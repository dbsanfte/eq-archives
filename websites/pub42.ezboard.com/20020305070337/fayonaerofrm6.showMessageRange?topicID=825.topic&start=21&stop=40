However, I thought I should point out that it is probable the warriors in the group may not have even been carrying shields. Warriors use them so seldom, I could easily see them having been left in the bank. Given the high strength of most warriors, they should always have a shield on them just in case. Human nature being what it is, I fear many blow off carrying a shield around as a waste of space/weight. <br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
you mean i should have a shield other than the one some guy gave me at lvl 4 because he was killing gnome guards and it was heavy? wow...<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
Try training Bash past lvl 13 as a non-fatty race.<br>
<br>
How many warriors out there carry shields to train/use?<br>
<br>
A warrior's job is quite simple. GET AGGRO AND KEEP IT. Now, does that mean aggro is a warrior's responsibility? Nope. Warriors get two weapons and a few buttons to keep aggro with. Aggro management is on a group's shoulders, not the warrior's. But, I digress.<br>
<br>
Expecting a warrior to bash when he can't without using a shield is unfair. <br>

How many warriors carry around shields? In my opinion not enough.<br>

Pain in the ass? Can't argue that. But casting mobs are hardly rare especially at higher levels. Neglecting a tool because everyone else does is not always wise.<br>

True, the skill may not see much action, but wouldn't you at least like to have it as an option, rather than have the need for it arise, and you be standing there twiddling your thumbs (or trying like mad to get back to the mob that just gfluxed you off of it/gated because it was *not* bashed and resume trying to damage it), while your party bites the dust?  It just makes sense to train up as many of your skills as you can, just in case...  I'd like to add that I witnessed the fight in question (they had one chanter, not me, with them, and he died too quickly from the AoEs to be of any help whatsoever re sieving), and they had *no* fatties with them, so it was definitely a pull your dusty shields out moment.<br>
<br>
As an enchanter, I may use evocation once in a blue moon, but spend a fair amount of my spare time nuking low greens so just in case I need it, it's there...<br>

But is it really that hard to create a hotkey bank with your secondary weapon, a shield in an inventory slot, and bash? Really, all it would take is a click on the shield, click it in the inventory slot, hit bash with your keyboard, then click again, and repeat. Is that so hard?<br>

I would tell you the same thing. I am not a fatty, I do not bash. What I have practiced up is kick, and it interrupts as well.<br>

You should have gone into the fight realizing it was a casting mob. If you went into a fight against a large enough target that this was a problem and didn't think to have chanters suckin its blue junk from it, your own fault. If you had to and spells don't work, Push It.<br>

Quit blaming the tanks for something your raidleader should have addressed before you got to the mob.<br>

Reread. What were you doing wasting mana nuking an ae mob(one that you knew was resistant) as a cleric? You're questioning the tanks in the matter when you're doing this?<br>

Warrior skills train VERY rarely and slowly, in case you don't know.<br>
<br>
As an example, my skill in 2hb is crappy. It's around 12? right now. If I want to train 2hb, that means I need to use a 2hb. And when I use a 2hb, I don't get aggro. When I don't get aggro, I'm not a good tank. When I'm not a good tank, I don't get groups.<br>

You'll be hardpressed to find a non-slamming warrior with bash past 100, simply because it's almost impossible to get up.<br>

I think you're all missing the point of my strategy. Basically you have 3 things hotkeyed in a hotbank. Your offhand weapon, a general inventory slot where you keep your shield, and the bash skill itself.<br>
<br>
Now, every time you see that bash button pop up, you quickly switch the shield into your offhand, hit bash, then put your weapon back into the offhand and repeat. Put the offhand/shield hotkeys next to eachother for maximum efficiency. Is that so hard? Sure, it might be a moot point after 55, but what about those other 54 levels?<br>
<br>
As for the raid aspect, if I'm not mistaken, you need exactly ONE warrior to gain and hold aggro. The rest of the warriors could be off doing whatever they want to, including training their other weapons skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nydia>Nydia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/18/02 3:56:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;it's not my job to bash&quot;</span><hr size=1> Just to clear some things up re the original example, at Faervas' (who is a notoriously bad typist) request: <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The bank of melees Faervas was in charge of healing were not the MT, or even his backup; therefore it was not their responsibility to hold agro.<br>
<br>
Second, the melees in the raid consisted of rangers (can't bash), no paladins or SKs (who could have) and warriors, and a monk.<br>
<br>
Third, no 'racial bash' warriors were present. <br>
<br>
Fourth, only ONE 55+ warrior was present (it was an old world mob - more specifically Phinny - we are referring to here), so stunning using kick was not an option.<br>
<br>
Fifth, the call to bash was given after the party had already TPWed once, so they knew what was coming, and had already been back to their POB once.<br>
<br>
Sixth, the pull on Phinny occurred after the party had already pulled multiple high MR mobs, which the spellcasters in the party had already reported as being unstunnable using spells.  <br>
<br>
Granted, this is a fairly unusual set of circumstances, but it underscores the point that it behooves one to at least consider the possibility that one might need to use unusual tactics from time to time, and at least keep a shield in the bank, and the skill at a reasonable level AND that sometimes one might be called on to change strategies on the fly (spellcasters switch out spells if the situation calls for it during fights all the time, guys).<br>
The success (or failure) of your raid might depend on it one day.<br>

It sounds to me like, you guys didnt have enough of the right classes there to kill the mob you where trying to kill. I could go on and on about how stupid the argument is that a non phatty warrior should have the presence of mind to actually go through the hassle to a) train bash up high enough, and b) keep a shield on them incase that 1 in a zillion chance that everyone become adgitated at them because the group cant kill the mob its trying to kill. I have leveled a wizard to 51 a paladin to 55 and a warrior to 56 and this is the first time I have ever seen warrior &quot;Bashing&quot; be an issue. If the warrior didnt make a phatty he probably isnt that concerned about bash in the first place.<br>
<br>
Next time you take on a mob that is clearly getting the best of you guys you should do the following things in order. <br>
a) Blame the rangers because thier helmets look funny<br>
b) Blame the paladins because they are paladins<br>
c) Blame the shadow nights because, they is just evil I tell ya<br>
d) Blame the warriors because they are just not smart enough <br>
<br>
OR E) Look at your situation from a more productive standpoint, and make sure you have the fire power to complete your task right in the first place.<br>

<br>
1. Shields as resist gear. Warriors forced to ghetto bash do not keep a shield equipped all the time. We swap the shield out with our offhand weapon when the Bash button recycles. The length of time the shield is actually equipped is negligible and so any resists on the shield do me no good. I'll stick with my Iksar targ shield thanks and find an offhand weapon with resists if thats what I need.<br>
<br>
2. It took me two levels of experience grinding (lvls 49 - 51) to get my bash skill from 98 to 184. But I have the advantage of a shaman partner to keep my agility and dexterity buffed constantly while grinding exp. Bash is not an easy skill to raise above 150 and any warrior who's ghetto bashed their skill that high knows it.<br>
<br>
3. Bashing doesn't move a mob around any more or less than melee attacks, so saying that the &quot;push&quot; a mob gets from a bash may interrupt a spell is irrelevant. The 5-7 attacks with my offhand weapon have just as much chance of interrupting a caster as the one bash will. Is the additional chance of a stun worth it?<br>
<br>
4. I developed my bash skill because it is a skill to be developed. I've found its more useful to try for a stun when a mob is running away than as a means of interrupting spellcasting. I'm also developing my beg skill as a means of taunting, despite the fact that I deplore it as a &quot;gimmick&quot;, because, like bash, other people I group with feel more comfortable when I do these things even though the impact of these skills on my overall effectiveness is minor. <p>Mukaz Razorscales<BR>

I played a half-elf warrior to 57...not the top, but high enough to say ghetto bashing is not difficult or an unreasonable request.  You are expected to keep a couple sets of gear to handle different situations.  Some of those sets of gear will do less damage or have less AC but they will be needed in some situations.  Not doing this because you consider it too much of an effort means you suck at your job.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it, you aren't a good warrior and you aren't a good player.<br>
<br>
Someone said great players take advantage of all thier skills &amp; that's it in a nutshell.  IMHO good warriors have all 4 melee skills, taunt, disarm, kick, beg, and bash as high as possible.  Neglecting any of those skills can reduce your effectiveness in some situations.<br>
<br>
EQ CAN be reduced to very simple button-mashing and zerg rushes but it isn't much fun that way...if you excel at playing your class and group with similar people you can do some cool stuff with one or two groups that takes the zergs 4 or more.<br>

The difference is less noticeable on larger mobs, but it is blatantly apparent on man-sized mobs.<br>
<br>
I don't think it necessary to get the skill &gt;150...in fact 100 is often sufficient. That level of skill is hardly a burden to reach.<br>
<br>
 If a lot of warriors are reading this thread and laughing, well it is their right to do so. They can play their characters however they wish ....but I hope they at least think about the discussion rather than dismiss the use of bash out of hand. If you know you are facing a ch-ing or gating mob and you are not the MT...consider bringing along a shield just in case. Interrupting casters is best done by other classes, but if they aren't around the job defaults to you whether you like it or not. <p>Gulor Gularin

I think that the odds of giving the mob that critical nudge are more likely to happen if you move him a bunch of times as opposed to waiting for him to begin casting. When its just me and my shaman partner (and the wonder mutt) I have plenty of opportunity to notice if its a bash or a kick or a regular attack that interrupts the caster. But its all just observational. No logs, no parser.<br>
<br>
As far as my play style goes its all moot anyway. I use all my skills. Until I hit 51 all my melee and weapon skills were maxxed. Disarm, kick, bandage everything but bash and beg. I'm working hard to max bash, and after many levels of complaining about using the beg &quot;gimmick&quot; i'm training that quickly too. (side note: my beef is that i shouldn't have to beg to stay at the top of the hate list, not that begging doesn't have a noticeable taunt effect). This means I carry a shield all the time and have hotkeys set up to bash. And all the other things I have to do to keep my skills maxxed out at each level. <br>

<br>
Regarding your comment about a warrior's job is to get aggro and keep it.... From my experience, bashing helps me keep aggro, much in the same way a pally uses stuns to get the mob's attention.  If I'm having trouble keeping aggro, I'll bash immediately before a taunt, which seems to increase the mob's hatred towards me.<br>
<br>
Ghetto bashing is NOT a pain in the ass, however it does require a minimal amount of skill and patience.  I've done it so much, even on non-casters, that it's become second nature, even after level 55.  And training up your bash skill isn't too difficult either.  Just like anything else, it takes time and practice, but the payoff is well worth it.  Mine is maxed and stays that way for one simple reason.  I'm going to do whatever I can in my power to be the best warrior I can be in whatever situation arises.<br>
<br>
Whoever says bash is worthless has never duo'ed exp with a shammy.  Shammy casts haste on the warrior, slow on the mob, and the warrior times his bashes to land just before the mob is about to attack.  The warrior will hardly get hit, and the exp will flow in nicely.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Ever fight in Seb and have a frog run on you because either someone didn't snare in time or root broke?  Bash holds it long enough for a snare/root to be cast so the froggie doesn't get to bring back 10 of his friends for a nice group wipeout.<br>
<br>
Bash is also great for momentarily stopping a mob from beating on your cleric when they've drawn aggro.  Gives a warrior more time to regain aggro.<br>
<br>
Ever pull indoors without SOW?  Especially in places like Velks, bash is an invaluable skill to have.  Aggro a mob with an arrow, then, when it eventually catches up to you, turn around and bash it, giving you some time to get a little ahead of it.  Repeat as necessary.  Works especially well on those backstabbing little buggers.  Oh, and while you're bashing, turn on auto-attack so you hold aggro better once the mob gets into camp.<br>
<br>
Ever had to run for your life to a zone line?  Again, turn around and bash if the mob is right on your heels.  This improves your chances of survival dramatically.<br>
<br>
As for relying on kick to interrupt spells.....I seem to remember reading that kick has only a &quot;chance&quot; to stun after level 55.  I have noticed it interrupting spells, but I swear it's not all the time.  However, I believe a landed bash will always interrupt a spell on a mob for which it is possible to do so, provided that mob doesn't make a successful roll for regaining concentration.  Also, the kick skill cap is lower than bash, meaning bash will have a greater chance to land than kick.  Other warriors should correct me if I misunderstand how kick works.<br>
<br>
This is only an issue because Verant created differences within the warrior class based on race.  We don't have to like it, but playing a small race warrior means we have to live with it.  Oh, and don't forget about the advantage that ogres get about being unstunnable from a frontal attack.  Even with these 2 limitations, I enjoy playing my assling warrior and wouldn't start over as a large race if I had to.<br>
<br>
Several people summed this up perfectly.  You do what you have to do under the circumstances to get the job done regardless of who you are or what class you play.  If you consistently neglect doing something to help the group because it's a pain in the ass and you cause a TPWO or unnecessary downtime, don't expect to ever group or raid with me again.<br>
<br>
It's not my job to bash?  Phhbbbtttt....now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time. <p><P><img src=http://zencore.home.mindspring.com/kleg.gif><P><BR>

(bash or no bash) If the leader says bash do you say &quot;its not my job&quot;?  These things are better found out now than when an action is needed by the warrior and you find out to late that he doesn't want to do it.  I would think that succeeding in the task is more important then the ego of the warrior.  Oh! NM. What WAS I thinking?<br>
<br>
Also I have a question:<br>
<br>
   Don't you get aggro more easily when the beg skill is lower or am I thinking to much like its pick-pocket?<br>
