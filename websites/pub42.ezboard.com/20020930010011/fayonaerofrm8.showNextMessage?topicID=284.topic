Since he did such a fine job, I will take a page from Kelraz and use some of the same rules as he has in the past.<br>
<br>
*Must be in Permafrost by 9:00 PM EST (6:00 PM PST). I am going to make the groups at that point exactly, not even arrivals at 8:01 will be taken. We will have the firepower in zone I am sure so no need to screw around waiting for people.<br>
*Melee must have a shield with them. The key to killing Vox is keeping her manaless and bashed up against the corner.<br>
*Resist GEAR! This can't be stressed enough and a lot of people overlook this. I am going to ask that everyone have at least 100 points of cold and magic resists UNBUFFED. This is especially critical for bards, enchanters, and clerics as these classes getting feared can screw their whole group or the raid. Bark Potions are not required but can be helpful turning a fear into a stun (they cast root on you, get some in case). Easy resist gear is Cloak of the Ice Bear (20 CR back), Crown of the Froglok Kings (20 CR head), White Gold Necklace (7 MR and CR neck), Runed Bone Fork (10 to all resists, range, melee), Drolvarg Mantle (10 MR shoulder) and there are plenty more. <br>
*Listen to the raid leader (Korike and someone else probably), listen to your group leader. And in all seriousness...we may all die but all of us dying following directions is better than all of us dying running around with chickens with our heads cut off.<br>
*Loot: NBG, there is at least one item every class can roll on I am sure...if nothing else the gems she drops (sometimes a blue diamond, etc.) Only raid participants are free to loot (44 - 52) with exceptions dealt with on a case by case basis. Mark of Honor, however, is going to claim the first epic piece for ourselves...if you were hoping for a scale and a book you can hope 2 drop and we open the 2nd to lotto, or simply come along for the experience and plan your own Vox raid for the following week. <br>
<br>
That should be the rules, so here is the breakdown of what is gonna happen :<br>
8:00 - Last call for new arrivals<br>
8:30 - Giants cleared (mostly), groups formed, move to buff room<br>
8:35 - Begin buffing<br>
9:00 - Buffing finished, assault on Vox<br>
9:30 - Final Verdict (Did we get her?!?! Clerics move in to rez, rogues to drag if Vox lived)<br>
9:45 - Fully Rezzed, loot distribution or 2nd attempt<br>
<br>
I don't plan on needing a 2nd attempt, but it may happen and we are going to allow time for it. I hope to have clerics there with their epics to make rezzing extremely fast, so we will have a swift turn around. The one thing that kills these types of raids is most people go into the first battle without experience and then die, have a 2 hour CR and don't want to try again. .<br>
<br>
Here is the buffing:<br>
When buffing is called each group leader will decide how the first 3 junk buffs will be laid down. Many people suggest bard songs go as the first 2 buffs (I suggest all bards twist 2) or any instant proc items (Jboots, etc.) because they can be refreshed. I know bards need to sing mana during buffing so you can lay down disease resist and then have the whole group click it off just before the assault to let a bard song sit there. That way when the song is dispelled it will start up in a second later anyway. After all groups report 3 junk buffs laid down we will then rotate in clerics, druids, enchanters, shamans, etc. into all the groups to see that everyone has a max of 14 buffs including: HP and AC buffs, Strength, Haste, Clarity, and lastly Magic and Cold Resists. Cold being the most important as Vox uses an AoE Cold DD and then Magic secondly because of her AoE Fear. <br>
<br>
The Fight:<br>
Going to have the groups broken into 2 - 3 waves, the first waves primarily melee. The Melee will charge into the fight and all focus on one of Vox's sides...beating the snot out of her. At 60% we will call in the final wave(s), heavy casters to nuke her. Melee will continue to bash keeping her stunned so she can't complete heal while enchanters will be tapping and draining her mana. Hopefully we will have 5 enchanters to drain her before she gets a single complete heal off...though 1 CH we can deal with, 3 is a bit tough. After 3 rumor has it she can't get another off but I doubt many have lived that long. Hopefully she will die fast...she is weaker than Naggy just has the heal which makes her very tough. Also keep note that after the buff room there are pits with KOS bears at the bottom so when you get feared be very careful walking back or you may fall into the pit. Check a map before you come to see where those pits are.<br>
<br>
When she dies I will be rezzed fast and no one is allowed to loot unless given permission by me or the other raid leader(s). Loot to be up for lottery and the classes that can lotto on them. Mark of Honor reserves the right to take 1 White Scale and 1 Pally Book, but everything else (and maybe those items depending on bard / pally turnout and need) will be lottoed.<br>
<br>
Crystalline Spear, Piercing 13/30 - RNG/BAR/ROU/WAR<br>
<br>
Dragon Bone Bracelet, AC4 +7 STR/AGI – ALL MELEE’S<br>
<br>
McVaxiu’s Horn of War, Bard only<br>
<br>
Runed Bolster Belt, AC5 +10 STR/STA/DEX, Perm haste – ALL MELEE’S<br>
<br>
Staff of Forbidden Rites, 2hb 25/50, +9WIS, +50MANA/HP, Effect Res, 10 charges – ALL SHA/DRU/CLE/PAL<br>
<br>
Torbin’s Mystical Eye Patch, +15WIS/INT, Effect See Invisible Permanent, - ALL INT/WIS Casters <br>
<br>
Warhammer of Divine Grace, Clerics only<br>
<br>
Kayruul’s Mystic Pouch, 10 slot 100% wt. Reduction – ALL THAT HAVE NOT WON A DRAGON DROP.<br>
<br>
And of course Prickley Pears will drop for Shadowknights who can roll on them if they need em.<br>
<br>
I invite everyone to come to this event, and would like to get an idea of who is coming first if you could post below names, classes, levels, etc. Level Limit is 45 to 52 for Melee, 44 for pure casters. If a cleric is 39 to 44, we can consider that, providing you meet the MR and CR requirements. We will not take more than 60 people into battle due to lag reasons, a mass LD would suck. Additionally we will not attempt without at least 4 clerics and 3 enchanters though hopefully we will have more of them! So post below, and can't wait to see you there.<br>
<br>
Ok there ya go and Sorry for stealing your post Kelraz, but you explain it SOOOOoo well! <br>
<br>
Also, the lotto of a scale or book is negotiable, if an Epified cleric wishes to negotiate their presence for a shot at a scale/book for a guildmate of theirs.<br>

They are +25 to the resists and stack with all items and spells.<br>
<br>
As well, beg, sleep with, or bribe high level casters and buffers to help out.  Get everyone to bring 20 or so pp to give to each buffer.  The difference from being buffed by lvl 60's and being buffed by lvl 52's for me is about 1000hps.<br>
<br>
Should definately try to have a shissar caster, high level shaman, high level druid, and high level cleric.  By high level cleric i mean able to cast group symbol.  Not only will this make for more efficient buffing, it will probably increase your chance of success by about 20%.<br>
<br>
Oh yah, i prob can drag my bro and his epic cleric to this one, he is not high enough to cast group symbol so you should try to get another.<br>
<br>
And the problem with bashing vox against the wall is her corpse could potentially get stuck, I recommend that we keep her in the middle and then as she gets too half, have all melee get beside me and bash for all they are worth.  If we have enough melee to interrupt or enough chanters to mana drain.  Then we win, if we dont, then we cr. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ueqnabal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EqNabal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/23/01 10:37:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Notice - Lady Vox - 9 PM PST 10/24 - Open Invite</span><hr size=1> And 1 more thing, if you're level 51 or 52, you can essentially forget about MR.

First off, let me thank those who showed. <br>
<br>
We waited for some extra peeps to show, some of whom did. <br>
<br>
We went and died. And the nukers kept dying, some of them up to seven times.<br>
<br>
I had a pretty good plan written down. Last night's failure was mine, in that I failed to communicate the plan well enough so that everyone understood it and knew thier part and knew where to go, and how to get there. <br>
<br>
I'll work thru this and do a better communcation's job next time.<br>

It's the chanters and wizzies I have trouble acquiring! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/26/01 6:17:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Notice - Lady Vox - 9 PM PST 10/24 - Open Invite</span><hr size=1> Always tends to be the little things that make a vox raid turn in to a mass CR.<br>
So little things to note:<br>
-Remember, you have to be in melee range to cast (amazing how many ppl completely forget this when the order is given to charge. Getting under her belly is best).<br>
-Illusions are a great way to get CR up easily and freely. Get all enchanters to be in wolf illusion, and get druids to do group wolf illusion.<br>
-Always always put up those bunch of crappy buffs and spells that nobody will need, so that the essential buffs will hang around after Vox casts dispell.<br>
-Melee.. Pet.. Casters. That's the order of waves.<br>
-Get as many wizzies as you can. doing 1k per spell really friggin helps. And also remember, melee range!<br>
-Like someone mentioned in a post above, the difference between a level 60 buff and a level 50 buff is the world. Get ya high level friends to buff ppl, all camp out, go to chat, then log back in when the word is given so that buffs dont waste away while raid leaders are trying to think tactics through or make decisions.<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of right now. But if you guys have no shamans, few enchanters, and few wizzies.. don't try it.<br>
