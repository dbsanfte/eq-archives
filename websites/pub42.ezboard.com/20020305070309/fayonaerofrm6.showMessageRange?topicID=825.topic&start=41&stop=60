<br>
Back to the topic, I think your main problem with this mob is lack of resistances.<br>
<br>
As far as pushing Gulor, of course you push more with a shield equipped instead of your 2h, you are hitting it more. Pushing isn't how hard you hit, its how much.<br>
<br>
Kleg, that's cool. It is a skill, and I'm impressed you keep it up(this isn't sarcasm), however I have to disagree that everyone should keep it up to be a good warrior. A successful shield bash does not always interrupt a spell, just like it doesn't always stun. It's just like kick, it doesn't always get the job done. Faced with 2 ways where both might not get the job done, I will take the one that allows me to do more damage.<br>
<br>
An average equipped and decently (60%) hasted level 50 warrior will do 40dps or so. Switching out gear to ghetto bash, no matter how fast you can do it, eats into your damage output. Enough people switching out gear to ghetto bash, and you are taking a decent chunk out of your damage potential. Dead fast is less damage dealt to you too.<br>
<br>
Azn, I have my hotkey bank pretty full. 5 pages full. flipping through several pages to find the hotkey while the mob is pushed so you see &quot;you can not hit them from here&quot; filling your chat box isn't too good. It slows you down. The less there is to go wrong, the better. The simplest thing is to push, and kick, instead of ghetto bashing.<br>
<br>
Edit: Sandin,  i don't think it is stupid to not understand why we think its a little..off...to ask warriors to bash if we aren't fatties. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrist0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crist0</A> at: 1/18/02 11:07:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugulorgularin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gulor Gularin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/18/02 11:07:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;it's not my job to bash&quot;</span><hr size=1> Using a shield definitely drops your damage output....thats why it is only really usefull on complete healing mobs or gaters.. the extra damage you do with 2 weapons is rendered useless if the critter rips off a heal on itself or gates out of your reach. I would never advocate warriors using shields in cases where speed of damage output is critical. <br>
<br>
As far as pushback goes...it happens when I bash..not when I smack it with my 1-HS. Although its true the 2-H weapons are slower and exert less pressure over time..there is an immediate pushback effect from a bash that I have only seen duplicated by a few of my stun type spells. I have noticed this with my warrior toon as well..not just my pally.<br>
<br>
I have to admit I was unfamiliar with the begging technique of increasing agro...I guess I need to put some work into that skill now as well. You learn something new here every day. <p>Gulor Gularin

<br>
I don't completely agree with this statement.  I can switch in a shield and back to a sword in less than 1/2 second.  The chances that the offhand weapon is between attacks is high, so I wouldn't expect the damage output to decrease noticeably.  If I'm using 2 different weapon types or weapons with the exact same delay, it's even easier to tell when the right time to bash is by watching the messages.  Of course, if it takes you a while to swap in a shield, then yes, you'll see your dps drop.<br>
<br>
I do agree however, that it is most useful on the healing and gating mobs.  I was hoping to point out some of the other lesser known uses of this skill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucsdmmnt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CSDMMNT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/18/02 11:47:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;it's not my job to bash&quot;</span><hr size=1> Not all bards swap instruments.<br>

Yes, Bash is a nice skill for stunning an opponent if you are not the MT, but if you are, your best means of holding aggro is doing maximum damage. Also as MT, its your job to &quot;Lead&quot; a gating or casting mob around while every other melee stands opposite you, kicking, bashing and slamming. The main bash class still is the Knight classes, as the shield is part of their standard armament (they can't duel wield, so the shield is the logical choice) where as a shield for a warrior is not. Warriors still need to produce maximum damage at all times. Difference in being the MT and not, is the selection of weapon speed, proc and the use of taunt. If the MT falls, than the next warrior has to be able to grab aggro fast. Fumbling with a shield may not be practical then.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you have to rely strictly on having warriors bash to prevent gaters...it might be best to revise your playbook as there are more effect practices. There is nothing wrong with being adaptable to situations of course, but its best to assume that most warriors will not bash.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukleg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kleg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/23/02 4:54:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=825.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/Kleg.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;it's not my job to bash&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There is nothing wrong with being adaptable to situations of course, but its best to assume that most warriors will not bash.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Faervas and I returned to Kedge last night, with a single party of levels 51-54, 5 casters and a monk (read: no bashers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  When it came time to start pulling the swirlspines (very MR cleric seahorses that guard Phinney), none of the casters, save the 53 druid, was able to get *anything* to hit them, and cleric and chanter stuns were 100% ineffective, even with the mob tashed.  The first one CHed, and was still casting.  I loaded Mana Sieve, as ToT wouldn't stick either, nor would any of my debuffs (I was able to get one Strip Enchantment to successfully remove a damage shield, however).  I found that, over the course of the night, if I got seven or more sieves off on the mob, it would be unable to CH.  Any less (in other words, if the mob was beat down too *fast* for sufficient mana to have been drained from it! or I tried doing other things while the fight was going on) and it would invariably get off a CH.  So, in the absence of a dedicated siever (which is a tremendous drain of mana on a chanter, I might add), bashing is crucial to preventing these creatures from healing themselves or others, and they will CH multiple times if given the chance...<br>
<br>
As Faervas indicated in the original post, it would have been *nice* if some paladins would have been present to do this job (yay the oft-snubbed paladins!), but in their absense, some shield action from the warriors, especially since this was a planned raid, should have been planned for.<br>

One camp thinks it hardly ever works and is a waste of time, and others such as myself who disagree. Its a matter of degree I think...Crist0 compared the situation to a ranger dropping from melee to assist heal the MT..I think it is more like a pally doing the same. Something I have had to do (successfully) many times. Since I use bash on a daily basis, I think I trust my vision a bit more.<br>

I think it is apparent from this thread that it is pointless to count on non-fatty warriors to bash casters if you run into trouble. Too many are of the opinion they can't bash worth a damn and can help more by continuing to smack the mob with their weapons. The majority will not be convinced otherwise no matter how hard an opposing viewpoint is argued. My advice is to make sure you have a chanter and a pally/sk in your group if you know you are facing casting mobs. <p>Gulor Gularin

Bards and necros are able to interrupt using mez; since it has a longer cast time, it's not terribly reliable on gating mobs, but it does the trick wonderfully for CH'ers. Wizards can stun as well. Druids get a nuke at lower levels that has a 0 second stun component. Unless your group has no paladins, shadowknights, enchanters, bards, druids, warriors, wizards, or necros, there's a way to deal with casting mobs. God forbid anyone tries to use their resources. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>
