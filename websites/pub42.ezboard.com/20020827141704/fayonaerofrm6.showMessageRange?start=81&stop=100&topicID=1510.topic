I just don't get it.  I honestly don't.<br>
<br>
An interesting topic came up in a public forum.  Yuegou posted to it.  I posted to it.  Yuegou devotes an entire paragraph to bashing me, and then, no less than an hour later explains to us all that despite calling me by name that he wasn't talking to me, THEN, devotes two more posts to the sole purpose of bashing me.<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, you go out of your way to cross the line between heated debate and just trying to piss me off.  If ezboard had an /ignore feature I'd take advantage of it like I do for you in-game.<br>

I hate it when pricks like you tell other people what thier posts mean and what was directed at whom. Like you have some better fucking insight into what goes on in other peoples heads than they do themselves.

<i>"My "strange agro" story or whatever the hell you want to call it was in referance to someone saying the Idol warped into thier camp. So lets quit pointing out that the vindi and his 2 temple guardians dont warp into camps. Thanks for pointing that out Palimax, but I dont give a shit about every raid you have EVER been to in Kael, the Statue and Idol warping out onto groups does happen, there was a nice thread about it a while back on the monkly business website. But that must be bullshit, because it never EVER happened to Palimax."<br>
<br>
"You sure think alot of yourself, I wasnt referring to you. Quit thinking that everything revolves around you. Your name wasnt even mentioned in the thread, yet every single thing posted here surely must be about Palimax, because EQ is Palimax. My statement was for the people that say, this is guild business, no one else has an opinion on it. Im sorry your gigantic ego might suffer a little at the startling news that there was something in this thread that isnt about almighty Palimax. Dont you have some real life shit to be posting somewhere in hopes of a little pity?"<br>
<br>
"Please show where Arbok says there was some strange agro due to some monk being in thier camp. Are you trying to say that even tho you werent there, you know there was a monk in the camp that caused the idol to warp there? Or are you just talking out your ass as usual, trying to implicate IvM monks that CB members have said didnt do it, and after Darus has already said it was his guilds doing?"<br>

Don't bitch when you die, over and over. Don't wait for the &quot;warning&quot;, put 2 and 2 together when you see two high end guilds forming up at the common aow/idol kill spots and get the fuck out of the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Put 2 and 2 together?  Look, two high end guilds coming into the hunting spot that &quot;we had first&quot; and have been killing mobs at &quot;long before they got there&quot; are coming to &quot;push us out of the way&quot; and &quot;stop our hunt completely&quot;.  Why?  Because your guild has more members you have the 'right' to do this?<br>
<br>
You have exactly the same rights as they do. They have exactly the same rights as you do.  Just &quot;taking&quot; their rights away won't settle well with &quot;anyone&quot; that is victumized this way.<br>
<br>
One of three things should have happened.<br>
<br>
1.  You ask nicely if they'd mind moving so you could kill the mob you're after.<br>
2.  You figure out a different place to hunt said mob that does not interfere with the people that were already there &quot;before you&quot; were.<br>
3.  You LEAVE and come for the mob later when the area has freed up.<br>
<br>
You expect everyone to treat you this way I listed above, but don't feel that you have to extend that same courtesy to everyone else.<br>
<br>
Courtesy.  Something none of the high end guilds seem to possess once they get that high.  That also tells me that you were &quot;never&quot; honorable to begin with.  Only hiding out and &quot;pretending&quot; to be honorable, until such a point is reached that doing whatever the hell you please won't get you into trouble anymore.<br>
<br>
Power corrupts.  Absolute power corrupsts absolutely.  I have not seen one single high end guild that has NOT been corrupted in this way, where they feel they can do what ever they want... everyone has to bow down to &quot;their&quot; wishes, but they reserve the supposed right to never bow down to anyone elses wishes.<br>
<br>
Get over yourselves.  You don't deserve what you have been recieving. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uatholbraes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Athol Braes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/02 3:07:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1510.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> &quot;By anonymous, I think Sulas meant someone who didn't post their in-game name along with their flame(s), so as not to tarnish their in-game reputation.

No, not fair at all, since calling me an idiot would be an outright lie.  Simpley using common sense and simple logic seem to be skills everyone here lack.  Not to mention not a one of you can actually handle it when someone proves them wrong or disagrees with them in some way... hence the need to call someone a completely outlandishly untrue name such as &quot;idiot&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usulaspsychoblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulas Psychoblades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/02 3:08:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1510.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Athol in sole response to your post!<br>

4. I wasn't even referring to your dumbass but I guess that you felt you didn't have nuts so felt the need to reply. <p><HTML><BODY>

Sulas, you're a fucking dumb ass.<br>
<br>
Wow, I almost feel more like one of you already.  Nothing like a good old &quot;I can't believe he proved me wrong so I better just call him an idiot.  Maybe someone will actually THINK that he's an idiot if I say this, and they'll ignore the fact that he had a good point.  After all, idiots can't possibly make good points.&quot;<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, a mile stone.  A mile stone I say.  I think I've actually seen the light.  If someone ever comes up with a valid point that's against my side of an argument, all I have to do is say &quot;You're a fucking moron&quot; and I've WON!!  YAY!  Thank you for showing me this Sulas.  I don't know what I would have ever done without this information.  I'll lead by your example from now on.<br>
<br>
You're a fucking moron.  Wow, I just can't get enough of it.  That line just debunked your WHOLE argument, just as you thought &quot;You're a fucking moron&quot; would debunk mine.  It's amazing what you can do with a simple, single sentence now adays.  I feel almost refreshed.  Wait... one more time...<br>
<br>
You're a fucking moron. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usulaspsychoblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulas Psychoblades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/20/02 3:25:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1510.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> You have been enlightened and thanks for showing your intellegence!
