The source of the accusation, a fat, balding man yelled out again for the gaurds, trying in vain to elbow his way through the mob of shoppers in Freeport's dusty Trader's Quarter.  The thief in question, a young, dark haired half elf, glanced over his shoulder before dodging around a trundling cart, disappearing into the crowd.<br><br>The half elf, barely out of boyhood, sighed as he slumped down in the cool shadows of an alleyway.  His dark, tattered cloak parted to reveal a rusted and scarred scale mail tunic, and his prize, a crusty, day old loaf of bread.  At that moment another appeared from the deeper shadows.  Her likeness to him was so close they couldnt be anything but related.  In fact, they were twins, with matching brown eyes and hair, and fine, handsome features that belayed their low stature.  The boy ripped the bread loaf in half, tossing one half to the girl, &quot;Next time, you get food, Kimyla.&quot;<br><br>The girl grunted as she bit into the stale bread, mumbling around it as she chewed, &quot;I got us enough coin last week to go for 3 days, remember?&quot;  The boy, Kennis, replied with only a mutter around his meager meal.  She continued on, anyway, &quot;But I have an idea, a plan that will feed us for weeks, maybe years.&quot;<br><br>Kennis sniffed the air dramatically, &quot;I smell...something.&quot;  She tilted her head questioningly before he went on, &quot;It smells like....trouble!  Beatings and jail time for sure.&quot;<br><br>Kimyla scowled and kicked at his boot before going on, &quot;I was at the Militia Headquarters today, and saw this..&quot;  From her cloak she pulled a tattered and yellowed piece of parchment.  <br><br>Kennis took it warily, squinting as he examined its contents closely, &quot;A wanted poster...but this is old..at least 70 years, surely this man..this...Ullric the Corsair..must be dead by now?&quot;<br><br>She nodded, chewing thoughtfully on the last bit of her meal, &quot;You'd think so, but this caught my eye, because I recognized the picture!  I have seen this man, living in this very city!  He has a small cottage in the north end, near the Knight's hall..I think they protect him or something.&quot;<br><br>Kennis grunted, looking up, &quot;You're sure it was him?&quot;<br><br>She nodded again, &quot;Aye, his hair is white now, not red, and he is old and stooped...I think he stoops on purpose, to hide who he really is.  If we could turn him in, we'd finally have a chance to get ahead!&quot;<br><br>The boy sighed, examining the poster again, &quot;I dont know, this says he is dangerous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hah!  Maybe he was 70 years ago, but he is a decrepit old man now?  What danger is he?&quot;  Kennis hesitated, and she pushed on, &quot;Think about it brother, finally a chance to get ahead of the game, to have some money to spare.  We can finally choose where we go, instead of relying on fate for survival!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is the bounty still available?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I talked to a guard, he said it was, and there is interest on it!&quot;<br><br>Kennis sighed, resigning himself to be doomed to his sister's demented vision, &quot;Okay, lets do it, what's the plan?&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> * * *</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><br>The old man tottered slowly out of the shade, stooped and leaning heavily on an ebony cane which glinted in the morning sunlight.  Dispite his withered tan face and cautious movements, his size was still apparent to anyone that looked closely.  His left hand, clad in a black leather glove, nearly encased the entire silver head of the cane.  His right, ungloved, swinging listlessly at his side, was still thick with meat.  In the bright day, his snow white hair gleamed brilliantly, matching the white robes he was clothed in.<br><br>Kimyla took a deep, steadying breath then darted out across the road, moving quickly over to him.  Her small hands closed over his thick, robed bicep, feigning to catch him in case he stumbled.  He looked over at her, his cloudy grey eyes barely focusing, &quot;Eh?  Who are you to grab at me?&quot;<br><br>Kimyla offered her best smile, her big brown eyes dancing with false merriment, &quot;I am Errin a serving girl, hired for the day to help you about on your errands.&quot;<br><br>The man stopped for a moment, staring off into space, seeming to contemplate the answer before bobbing his head in response, &quot;Very well, we had better get to it then!&quot;<br><br>So they went about the city, Kimyla clinging to the old man, laughing and telling stories, while the old man grumped and stared, coming in and out of a semi coherent daze.  Kennis followed them the entire time at a discreet distance, watching carefully for signs of danger or a trap.  They stopped at several shops, but the old man, referred to everywhere as Johan, talked and haggled with owners, but never made a purchase.  Finally, by mid afternoon, they stopped at a shaded cafe, taking a small round table under the building's canopy with a nice view of the street and passersby.<br><br>Kennis circled the block, coming up on the cafe from a crossing street, keeping to the darker shadows and gloom.  Finally he settled himself in a nice between the cafe wall and a barrel, a mere four steps from the table the two sat at.  He listened quietly as their conversation continued, they ordered tea, and Kimyla continued her never ending, innescent chatter.  Kennis would be glad to have this over just to have her shut up.<br><br>Suddenly he perked up, catching a flash of silver as the old man brought out a small flask, pouring a bit of brown liquid into his tea before the vessel disappeared back into the folds of his robe.  Kimyla watched his silently before licking her lips nervously, finally speaking up, &quot;So..Mister Johan...What is wrong with your hand that causes you to wear a glove?&quot;<br><br>The old man sipped at his tea, muttering grumpily, &quot;Old stories, not worth telling of past wounds!&quot;<br><br>She blinked, sensing she was treading on dangrous ground, but pressed on, &quot;An old battle scar?  Please, can I see it?&quot;<br><br>His eyes cleared for a moment, and he seemed to see her for the first time, &quot;What?  Why would you want that, girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh..Uhm, no reason.  I was just curious.&quot;<br><br>His eyes clouded over again, &quot;Well, no need for that.  Perhaps its time we be getting home.&quot;<br><br>Kennis pressed the tip of his dirk into the mans back, digging into the robe and pinning it against his flesh.  HE spoke quietly as the man straightened suddenly, eyes widening under bushy white brows, &quot;Or maybe, old man, its time we visit some friends.  Or should I call you Ullric?&quot;<br><br>Kimyla stood quickly, flashing a small hand crossbow from under her cloak, so only the two men could see it, &quot;You heard him, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'Johan'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, time to get down to business.  Get up and moving before we have to break your hip.&quot;<br><br>The old man's jaw worked silently as Kennis pulled him roughly to his feet, Kimyla dropping a few coppers on the table to pay for their tea.  Johan stumbled as he was wrenched up, nearly falling as his cane clattered noisily on the stones.  Kimyla snatched it up, giving her brother a cross look before turning on her heal and leading them away from the cafe.<br><br>The moved south through Freeport quickly, the old man struggling to keep up with the younger two.  Every few steps, Kennis would give him a rough shove and he wound nearly fall before the half elf would catch him again, digging the tip of his weapon into the old man's back.  Finally it was too much, and with a small cry, the feeble old man crumpled into the dirt.  With a dramatic sigh, Kimyla turned, planting a booted toe into his ribs.  &quot;Up, we've no time for this.&quot;<br><br>Johan wept quietly, his hands clawing at her boots and ankles, &quot;My cane please, Miss Errin..I need it to walk.  Take whatever you want, but I need my cane.  Please!&quot;  He began to sob, and suddenly the siblings became aware of other citizens on the street, giving the scene sidelong glances as they went on their way.  Kimyla gave Kennis a distressed look, and the young man quicky grabbed the older by his arm, wrneching him back to his feet.<br><br>Kennis grunted with the effort, his words harsh with his frustration, &quot;Get moving, you bastard, I've better things to do than waste my time on you.&quot;  The three moved out, slower this time.  But it appeared as though the fall had hurt the old man, for he was stumbling without Kennis' help now.  Both began to look around warily, worried of another scene.<br><br>Finally, relief flooded through Kimyla as they came into sight of the Freeport Milita Headquarters, and she instinctively quickened her pace.  Just ahead she could see the captain of the guard, in animated conversation with the Head Tax Collecter, a vile, fat man known to the city as Whorris.  So intent was Kimyla that she barely registered the old man behind her stumble again.  Only as he fell to his knees did she begin to turn, but by then it was too late.<br><br>Kennis had already stepped forward to help him up, the dirk in his left hand hanging limply at his side.  The old man's hand shot forward, as quick as a striking snake, and certainly faster than anything the two amatuer thieves had ever come across.  Before Kimyla realized what was happening, he had snatched his cane from her hand.  It spun in a black blur, and pain lanced through her leg as the heavy silver handle struck the side of her knee.  She yelped in suprise, tumbling onto the dusty street.<br><br>Kennis had a bit more time to react, and he stepped in closer, using his body to shield his strike from the onlookers.  No one saw the dirk in his hand drive into the old man's back, between his shoulderblades.  But they did see Kennis' brown eyes widen in suprise, as instead of meeting soft flesh, the blade simply struck resistance until it bent, then snapped under the pressure of the blow, the cheap metal shattering into a dozen glittering shards.  He stood there dumbstruck as the old man rose, calling out in his frail, old man's voice for help.  The Captain of the Guard was already running to them, followed closely by Whorris.  Any thoughts of flight were quickly banished from Kennis' mind as the silver handle of the cane swung back, striking him in the groin as the old man rose, seemingly oblivious to his attack.<br><br>The siblings stared on dumbfounded as the old man began babbling to the Guardsman about kidnappers and taxpaying citizens.  Their stupidity was quickly replaced by fear as more of the militia arrived, and the Captain ordered the two of them arristed!  Kimyla's amazement at what just happened was quickly replaced by rage and, deeper down, a heavy ball of terror, slowly growing as a guardsman pulled her to her feet and began cuffing her wrists.<br><br>Her dark eyes turned to the old man, who grinned.  Her eyes widened in suprise and awe.  His gaze was no longer clouded, but sharp as a predators, and he did not appear confused anymore, but very much aware of the situation, and he seemed to find great humor in it.  She blinked as he opened his mouth, whispering words only she could hear, &quot;You will never get ahead of the game, unless you already are.&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> * * *</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><br>Ullric smirked to himself as he walked briskly away from the chaos of the rapidly expanding situation.  The cane spun absently in his left hand, his right rested inside the breast of his robes, holding a bulging sack of platnium.  Behind him, the realization of what it meant to be beaten was hitting the young girl, and the realization that he was missing his collections for the day was hitting Whorris. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69845">Ullric Littleblade</A><BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/9.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
