I too, was of the right age to see Star Wars.  I also had a little brother in the same age bracket.  Growing up on Star Wars was amazing and I am glad that our generations children now have their own &quot;Star Wars&quot; aka Phantom Menace.  <br>
<br>
However, I would point out being a GIRL and being into Star Wars was a little different hehe.  You loved it for the romance.  The love triangle between Luke, Han, and Leia.  Yes, I'd run around in flowing white sheets with yarn buns tied to my head thank you very much ~!!!~.  It wasn't about the amazing technology or wonderful effects...that was why my brother liked it. It was about a woman empowered to run a resistance.  She was who I wanted to be.  Along with Wonderwoman, Isis and of course the Bionic Woman.<br>
<br>
As for comparing the two...there is no comparison for me.  One is future one is past.  One is science, one is fanatasy. Both genre's have played a HUGE part in who I have become. One is just as wonderful as the other.<br>
<br>
I sat mesmorized in the theatre in Star Wars and I sat equally mesmorized in Lord of the Rings.  LotR brought me back to being that little girl, waiting for what would happen next.  I was actually holding my breath, squeezing my husband's hand and actually cheering and clapping in some scenes. (I wasn't the only one thank goodness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  I have never read the books and will actually read the first one now &lt;not wanting to spoil the rest until I've seen the movies&gt;. But it showed me exactly what I had imagined Elves, dwarfs, goblins, trolls, hobbits, etc to be.  It took me places that before I had only imagined.  It was wonderful seeing it on a huge screen for once.  I think they did a wonderful job.<br>
<br>
I went in a 30-something woman with bills and tons of christmas shopping still weighing on her mind and came out a bright eye'd little girl, swooning over Legolas and Aragorn wanting to be Arwen.  I want the bed sheets, I want the posters, I want it all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Too bad I don't have kids yet to spoil them rotten with all the &quot;stuff&quot; from this movie.  <br>

But, I read the Hobbit, then the lord of the rings books when I was 15. When I read those books they quickly became the best books I have ever read, and I have read them on average of once every 5 years since then. I remember wishing they would make this epic movie many years ago, and now Im very glad they didnt make it till now. There just wouldnt have been any way for them to do it as well a few years ago. When I read it I was able to imagine the scenery in great detail, but WOW, seeing it on the big screen was just Amazing. IMHO this will remain the best movie ever made for years and years to come. I cant remember a movie that I have had chills run up and down my back just from watching it before.<br>

/em looks forward to having all three movies on DVD someday so he can sit back at the house having drinks and stuff and watch all three movies back to back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uakomofcazicthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akom of Cazic Thule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/23/01 10:58:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1447.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://sanguinecrusaders.homestead.com/files/Akom_Jump.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Star Wars Universe > LotR Universe.<br>
<br>
But can you really compare the two?  They are what you compare other movies / books to to see how good they are.  Star Wars was an awesome movie.  Do I think LotR was better  visually?  Yes.  After all... compare the budgets of the first star wars movies and LotR.  They can afford to go all out.  Also the technology that is availiable now is FAR better than what was around at the makeing of Star Wars.  Yet, star wars is an AWESOME trilogy.  It didn't have any books that it had to stick to, or any fans to worry about upsetting.<br>
<br>
They had to cut a LOT of things from LotR in order to make it under 3 hrs (we see VERY few movies over 3 hours now days).  This, unfortunatly, made the first half of the movie seem too fast (didn't go by too fast... things happened too fast), I.e.: Almost ALL of the traveling was instantaineous.  It didn't give the feel that they were on a long epic journey.  The cheery times that Tolkien put in in between the dark parts of the journey were almost compleatly cut from the movie.  No singing, no light spirits...  the movie centered on the darker side of the book.  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I loved LotR, however there are some major flaws in it.  Yes, the movie was awesome for someone who has read the books, but not everyone has.  Now you may be thinking, "pfft, how many people havn't read Lord of the Rings?"... I was suprised to find out that a good number of my friends hadn't.  A major flaw in the movie is the failure to explain some things.  Like that the Ring Wraiths were afraid of water and fire (and why they were). <br>
<br>
If you look at Lord of the Rings as a new idea and a new movie by itself, it is awesome.  However, since it was based on (in my opinion) the best fantasy book of all time, it could very well have been the best movie of all time, however with the small noticable flaws and the small plot changes, it loses some of it's glory.<br>
<br>
Taken Movie for movie... LotR is better than A New Hope.  But if you look at the background, the history, the universe that has grown from star wars, and compare it to that of LotR, star wars is the superior.  They say LotR is the forfather of fantasy.  Maybe it is, but thats the book.  We're discussing movies.  If Star Wars was spawned from a book, then maybe we'd have a comparison.<br>
<br>
If any of this dosn't make sense, check back later.  Its 2 am now and I'm tired (just got back from a long drive).  Gonna come back tomorrow and read this post to make sure it is conveying my thoughts correctly.<br>
<br>
Night.    <br>
