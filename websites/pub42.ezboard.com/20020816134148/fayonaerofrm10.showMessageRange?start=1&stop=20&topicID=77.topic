Well, it appears that our sister city to the west has pointed an official finger. Qeynos has declared war on the Bloodsabers for their suspected involvement in the plague, but they need help. Well isn't it about time?<br><br>The Bloodsabers have long been a scourge upon the land and the powers that be in Qeynos have been taken to task more than once for letting them run rampant in the west. Finally we learn the truth behind the inaction - they simply could not handle the problem. Now that their ineffectual policing has resulted in the start of famine-like conditions affecting all of Norrath, they seem at last spurred into action. With the help of hired &quot;investigators&quot;, they are finally beginning to make their way slowly up the ladder of that secret society.<br><br>It is this kind of thing that truly makes one appreciate living in Freeport under the watchful eye of the militia.

The question is, what is the fallout going to be this time? As always with the surly spellcaster, the problem is his unwillingness to share information about what he is doing. Last seen chipping away at a Wizard spire in the Dreadlands, we can only assume. Does he intend to destroy the spires and use their remains so that only he can teleport around Norrath? Is he setting a trap for one of his many unsuspecting enemies? Your guess is as good as mine, but rumors say that a former gnomish apprentice of his has acquired some of his work.

Strange enough that it is sold in North Freeport and having SUCH words in it. &quot;<br>The Militia, Lucan D'Lere obvfiously is amused about the recent happenings in Qeynos. And now that Qeynos finally starts fighting against the plague, he tries to again use this against them and convince the Freeport Citizens to believe in the Milita.<br>- &quot;Your guess is as good as mine, but rumors say that a former gnomish apprentice of his has acquired some of his work. Keep your eyes here for more details as they surface. &quot;<br>As he states, find the Gnome.<br><br><br>-= The Royal Herald =-<br>- They surprisingly do not mention Qeynos at all.

THis is very strange to me. They just talk about Lanys...<br>- The information about the Malevolence's Staff's location is in no way as detailed as in the Neriaks News.
