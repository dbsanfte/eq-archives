Something, or some one was missing. Damn these &quot;soft skins&quot;, they all looked alike to his eyes. The only way he could really tell them appart was their smell and right now the room was so filled with their scent and the scent of the local spirits that that it almost made him dizzy when he tried to separate them out. Then he realized what it was that was missing. He turned to his companion at the table and spoke. &quot;Sssir, Vanlaan, your traveling companion appearsss to have traveled on without you, usss.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Vanlaan looked around again, expecting to see Aedare come sauntering in, her usual belligerant self.  About that time, all hell broke lose, as one of the patrons was shoved through the Inn's door by several of the corrupt Freeport Militia.  Looked like things might get ugly.  Vanlaan considered summoning up a pet, but then decided to wait a moment and see how things turned out.  He wasn't worried about the Militia bothering him or Aedare.  As Innoruuk's Children, they had nothing to fear from the Militia, since they were corrupt at the hands of the Dark Elves.<br>
<br>
When the commotion didn't produce Aedare, Vanlaan really began to worry.  It was one thing for her to wander outside for a moment, but somehthing else entirely for her to leave him unprotected.  He thought back over the course of the evening, trying to remember if she had said or done anything out of the ordinary.  That was a hard one to pin down... Aedare was anything but ordinary.<br>
<br>
He sighed and turned back to his companion.  The fray seemed to be calming down.  Another patron had interceded on behalf of the beleagured paladin and the milita-men had been routed.  &quot;I'm not going to assume anything concerning Aedare at this point.  We've already paid for rooms for the night and I'm exhausted.  I suggest we stay the night and see if the dawn brings our lost companion back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan did one more quick check of the common room and then stood.  &quot;I'm going to bed.  This has been a hectic day and I need to spend some time meditating before I can call it a night.  We'll meet here first thing in the morning.  I look forward to traveling with you, my friend.&quot;  And with that, he turned and made his way to his room. <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#800000"><b>Vanlaan</b></font>

Do not look for me, I will find you.&quot;  And with that Vanlaan headed off to his bunk for the evening.  Drakhnar then sat 2 platinum pieces on the table, enough to pay for the drinks and the service, and begun to weave a spell.  Though the paladins were gone he still could not afford to draw much attention to himself.  Slowly the corner of the room he sat in seemed to grow darker, as if the shadows in the room were all going to that corner.  And if anyone had been watching, which they weren't because they were too busy cleaning up the mess, it would have looked like either Drakhnar was slowly being enveloped by the shadows.   And then, he was gone.  Causiously Drakhnar stood from the table and made his way to the now missing door.  Once outside he stopped and thought for a minute.  Being a cold blooded creature, he couldn't just wrap himself in warm clothes and sleep wherever he wanted like the soft-skins could.  It occured to him that the inn's fireplace was built into an outside wall.  This to him was ideal.  He slowly made his way around the outside of the in and found the bricks that gave away the position of the fireplace.  There he leaned up against the wall and fell asleep, knowing that the fire would die down and the cold would wake him long before any of the soft-skins were out of bed to notice him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udominicnelson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dominic nelson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/17/01 6:08:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Qwik held no ill feelings towards anyone in general but if there was one thing he couldn't stand it would be stupidity and the milita is the apidimy of it.  Tensing up every last honed muscle in his well trained body Qwik sent a stone cold look to each of the militia men as the made for Freeport.  Qwik was at somewhat of a loss for the boldness of the Militia men in the tavern considering the very dangerious dark ones who seemed to be culminating in the inn of late .. along with several seasoned warriors. Qwik was a man who was not as eloquent with words as he would like but his emotions and actions spoke louder then even Casidy's most prized poem could just the look in his eyes coudl be enough to melt a heart or freeze one in terror.<br>
<br>
taking a breif moment to walk back inside to survey the damage he walked over to the wounded silently and took out a few bandages and bound up what he could . With a consentual nod Qwik stood up and and quietly said "i will return try to stay alive till my return so that we may be properly introduced" with a sly smile he strode out the door just glancing towards Casidy who seemed to be trying to bring the tensions down somewhat and restore order to the inn.<br>
<br>
The night time was always Qwiks favorite time of the day.. there is just something about the unknown .. not knowing whats ahead of you in the path. Such is Qwiks life, no plans no responsibilities other then his own personal agenda but he knew deep down there was something missing .. but he felt so alive just reacting to his emotions, moving on a whim. "One can not live off of wit alone, with out a heart you will cease to exist," and Qwik lived by that thought constantly in his mind... just following his heart and emotions from one moment, to the next.<br>

<br>
As the dark elf made his weary way to his room, the door to the inn flew open, letting the rain that commonly assaulted the Commonlands blow in.  In the doorway stood the squat form of a bronze-armored dwarf, his eyes filled with rage beneath the green scarab helm.  The axe clutched tightly in his hands was almost twice as large as he was.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  DARK ELF!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; he bellowed.  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I've finally tracked you down!

I don't think I've ever heard a name similar to that in all my travels through the lands of the Elves.  I am called Jzonn and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wish a tale, do you?  Let me think about this.  I don't relay tales in the way of the Bards, but I know a story or two.  Perhaps I should tell you of a friend of old...a Bard himself who seemed to find trouble in most interesting ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jzonn smiles in a way to indicate he is recalling a memory.  &quot;I know just the tale.  Druevan, the Bard in question, and I were sitting in a place named The Storm's Retreat.  He was absently playing his lute to pass the time and both of us were drinking some Surefall Rum.  All of a sudden, Drue's eyes light up.  He stands up and exclaims, 'I've got it!'  As I turn to look at him...&quot;<br>
<br>
The make-shift door used to replace the recently shattered one is loudly opened, nearly knocking it off the frame.  A Dwarf is standing in the doorway, the water dripping off his stout frame.  Behind him, the rains are coming down and apparantly started unbeknownst to the patrons in the inn.<br>
<br>
&quot;DARK ELF!&quot; the Dwarf bellowed.  &quot;I've finally tracked you down!  Now, give me my ring or ye'll have yer head shoved up yer privates!&quot;  The Dwarf is clearly talking to the Dark Elf sitting on the side of the room, though the Dark Elf shows some signs of confusion about him.<br>
<br>
Jzonn sighs.  &quot;It appears to be a night for interruptions, Casidy.  I guess I should have known better than to expect some quiet time, but I'm not really in the mood to stop another brawl.  You may as well take this time to retire for the evening.  Perhaps I can finish the tale over coffee and breakfast tomorrow.&quot;  Jzonn raises his eyebrow inquiringly. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

Knowing that there was only one dark elf in there, he instantly sprung to his feet and in a flash was watching from the shadows just outside the door to the inn, waiting for the dwarf to make a move.  Drakhnar had given Vanlaan his word that he would defend him and help him....and he was nothing if he did not keep his word.   As he waited, he slowly reached into his belt pack with his left hand and removed a hand full of bone chips.  Calmly he waited, hand poised to cast the spell which would summon his pet.  And with his right hand he drew his dagger and with serpentine grace he cast a spell causing his hand to glow with violent energy, ready to drain the life from his enemy with the first strike.  This dwarf, should he choose battle, would know the true meanings of Fear and Hate.  And Father Thule would be proud. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uliandriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liandriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/3/01 12:13:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/yezud/spada.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Liandriana briskly walked down the narrow path on her way to freeport, keeping a look out for the militia.  Even though it was pitch black she could still see as it was day.  A nifty trick she was taught to summon a stone that gave her eyesight ultravision.<br>
<br>
She caught sight of three lurking bodies hurridly moving along the road.  She paused and squinted to see them better, just her luck militia men.  Rage built up inside her as she channeled the elements of earth into her focus.  She still had much contempt and hate, even as great of Innoruuk towards these militia men.  They would all pay for the night they stole her innocence.<br>
<br>
Infront of her the dirt on the ground rose to form a globular mass of earth and grass.  It had taken shape to above her height, this element would do her bidding in dispaching the milita men.  Yes, they would suffer.<br>
<br>
Channeling more power into the elemental it's body pulsed with a greenish glow as it almost seemed to go insane from it's beserken state.  She then conjured the elements of fire to surround the earthen mass with a blazing lava shield.  Her 'pet' was now ready to unleash her hate to the milita men.<br>
<br>
Again she channeled the elements of fire into the form of lava, slowly building it's power as she narrowed her eyes onto one of the militia men.  The heat from the fire she conjured burned intense until it was finally a molten ball of lava which she aimed at the man she stared at.  She pushed air into the lava and sent the bolt away.  The lava melted one of the pathetic souls into nothingness as the other two men stood there in confusion.<br>
<br>
The glob of earth suddenly jerked towards the two men standing in stupidity, they raised there swords to fend it off.  Only to be surprised as lava spewwed towards them as they slashed violentally towards the elemental.  One of the lesser men died quickly by his futile attempts at shashing only brought more lava gushing onto him.<br>
<br>
Liandriana grinned with a maddness as the second one fell, only one remaining and it would feel her full wrath.  She channeled fire into the man over and over, igniting his skin only leaving a charred remain of him.  She walked up to the... globs and spat at them.<br>
<br>
She felt slightly relieved, yet still obsessed. There was more to pay... yes, she had to see to that... the militia men would not have fun as long as she was around. <p><i><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17311">Liandriana Sedai</a> -55Conjurer <br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=24077">Syui Chan</a> -52Disciple</i><br>Officer of Destiny - Ayonae Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udominicnelson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dominic nelson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/6/01 9:06:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Finally ... stomach settled from visiting his mentor .. relief flashed across his face as he headed out of Freeport.<br>

"what is this" he thought to him self as he used his stealth abilities to sneak closer a woman ... and she seemed to be possessed by the spirit of innoruuk him self ... just stairing over the mounds of ... he didnt even know what . such a frightning look in her face.<br>

She knew that someday this hate for the freeport would consume her. She knew that whenever she saw someone of the militia she was violent and rash, she had to control herself. <br>
<br>
She let out a deep breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail M'lady...&quot; she jumped, &quot;Is all well?&quot;<br>
<br>
She almost yaulped to her surprise and quickly turned expecting more militia men, but to her surprise she saw a monk looking at her curiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I am fine Brother of the Ashen House,&quot; bowing before him.  &quot;I...I... had a run in with the local guard.  I am aware of the Ashen's Order on how they view the Paladin's and Militia strife.  They choose to look the other way, perhaps you will sire?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the monk had a chance to respond Liandriana heard a familiar call of her name.  Febreeza the cheerful gnome came up to give her a hug.  Febreeza always seemed to be in a good mood, she always enjoyed her company even though she rarely saw her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Febreeza, I would like you to meet...&quot; She looked at the monk.<br>
