Perhaps my time in Nektulos made me forget how weather can change, or perhaps it was simply the proximity to Lavastorm that led me to forget.  But as the night fell, I found myself seeking shelter for myself and my companion.<br><br>The inkeep at the tavern I chose glared at me with evident hostility.  I couldn't help but notice the holy symbols around the necks of the other patrons; worshippers of the Marrs, almost without an exception.  Feeling brave, the Innkeep chose to be clever; &quot;I have something you Dark Elves can use, let me see... it's the DOOR!  Now, GET OUT!&quot;<br><br>Eying my companion, the Necromancer Vanlaan, I walked slowly to the Innkeep.  I had once been a worshipper of the Whore, Erollisi, goddess of Love, in what was, quite literally, another life.  I had been trained to make men fall in love with me; or, to put it another way, I was trained in bringing out the beast within a man.  I slunk sensously towards him, and raised my violet eyes to him.  Using my most wanton sounding voice, I whispered, &quot;Are you aware of the gifts that my god gives me?  Even with the protection of those little paladins, your soul would be tormented in the Plane of Hate before your god even knew you were dead.&quot;<br><br>As the color bleached from his skin, I pulled a purse from my belt.  &quot;But that's not necessary, is it?  I believe that I have enough here to make us all forget our differences for the night.  My companion is cold, and I will not allow anything to happen to him.&quot;  A few platinum coins was all we needed to buy a spot by the fire to warm ourselves outside, and a few tankards of the house slop to forget the chill inside.<br> <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,Aedare - "The Blade of L'vanon"Spurned Shadow Knight of Innoruuk(Ayonae Ro Server)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uaedare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aedare</A> at: 1/5/01 6:51:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucasidy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casidy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/1/01 6:06:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Casidy had been sitting in the corner of the room, playing.

This young fool was determined to take my challenge, and expected me to falter.  I took a deep swig of the offered ale, wincing at its bitterness (the taverns in Neriak would never serve such swill), and began.<br><br>&quot;I was not always as I appear now.  Once, hard as it may be to believe, I was a mere human, one of the stinking rabble that infest Freeport.  Among them, I could have been royalty, had I chosen; instead, I learned where my place truly was, in Innoruuk's service.&quot;<br><br>I am always amused by the various hand gestures used when I mention the Father's name.<br><br>&quot;But I see no need to bore you with tales of my childhood.  Most prefer tales of wars, of fierce battles between good and evil.  I, however, know nothing about good and evil, only the Truth, and the Lies.  But again, I digress.<br><br>It was early in my career as a Champion of the Father when I decided that it was time to gaze upon His Holy City.  I therefore met with the elders of the Dismal Rage, our Church, and pleaded with them to allow me to make myself useful.  Within weeks, I received the response; I was to report to the Bridge in Nektulos (easily reached by simply following the road) to meet with a fellow Champion in His Service.<br><br>&quot;This was when I met Val'khan, assistant to the great L'vanon, both of the Church of the Firstborn.  It seems that Val'khan was in need of armor and, as I had been trained as a seamstress in my youth, I was quite adept at putting together ruined pelts to make a kind of tattered armor.  Through Val'khan, I would go on to meet my current Master.<br><br>&quot;With them as my guides, I was led through the Foreign Quarter, where the slaves - mostly humans, such as I once was - and the visitors from Grobb and Oggok - spent their time.  The horrific scent...<br><br>&quot;From there, we visited the Commons, where the bank could be found.  Although I was eyed with disdain by the guards due to the lightness of my skin, they made no motion against me.  We therefore continued on to the Lodge of the Dead, where the Shadowknights and Necromancers trained.  At the gates were a trio of ghouls, blessed creatures of Innoruuk raised to do His service.  It was the first time I had ever seen ghouls, and I stood in amazement and awe as they began racing from their post, no doubt to protect the Lodge from some unwanted visitor.<br><br>&quot;Although most of my memories of the seconds that followed are mercifully brief, when I regained conciousness, Val'khan did look quite embarrassed.&quot;<br><br>I looked around with a smile and drained the last of my drink.  &quot;Keep that in mind, should you visit the beautiful city of Neriak - no matter which god you worship, those not of Teir'dal descent are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> welcome beyond Neriak's Third Gate.&quot; <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,Aedare - "The Blade of L'vanon"Spurned Shadow Knight of Innoruuk(Ayonae Ro Server)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uaedare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aedare</A> at: 1/4/01 4:17:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vanlaan>Vanlaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/4/01 4:34:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: story continued</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In one of the darker corners of the inn, a robed figure sat watching the display.

Quietly scoping the tavern, Vanlaan noticed the robed figure in the corner almost immediately.  It wasn't hard to notice the fact that no one sat at any of the surrounding tables.  Vanlaan looked over at Aedare.  Although Aedare was quite capable of taking care of herself, Vanlaan was responsible for her actions and didn't want her causing trouble.  Not here.  Not now.  They needed to keep a low profile for the time being.  Aedare was occupied with teasing the bard.  Well, that was fine.  There shouldn't be too much harm in competition tale-telling.  He had to feel sorry for the bard though; she really had no idea what she was getting herself into.<br><br>Deciding that Aedare was occupied in a non-violent way, Vanlaan got up and made his way towards the back of the tavern.  He tried to act casual, but a Dark Elf Necromancer is anything but inconspicuous.  He mentally shrugged.  'Oh well,' he thought, 'I certainly won't draw anymore attention then our entrance already drew.'  As he approached the table, he noticed the lone figure was watching him.  If he wasn't mistaken, there was a lizard snout poking out from underneath the cowl of the stranger's hood.

A warmth of contentment fell over the crowd, and they began to sway to the rhythm and lyric of her voice, the lute, and the theme of the tale.<br><br><i><b> Ace in the Spit</b><br><br>In a city not far from here there lived a lad named Ace<br>The name he got, at birth, for being so fair in the face<br>He grew up wild, and on the land, as many of these parts do<br>In stature and status he grew as many the town folk knew<br><br>A vile evil came to town, and challenged the local men<br>Striking them like weeds to a scythe, baking them like hen<br>No one had the brains it seemed to banish this evil foe<br>But Ace its told, was not afraid for a plan his mind did sow<br><br>He challenged the fiend to a bake off, for the entire town.<br>If the villain failed to take the test, gods would frown.<br>As plans were laid, for the event, Ace grew sore afraid<br>His girl knew Ace couldn't bake, so a book to him she gave<br><br>She worked, teaching Ace to bake, to ready him for the event<br>A cake he would bake, like none ever seen, his hope to win<br>The day approached, the villain schemed against the cake<br>With his baking prowess, he had plans to up the stakes<br><br>The villain destroyed all ovens in town, seeking Ace's demise<br>Finding no oven to bake his cake, Ace had to improvise<br>The town folk cringed and fearing tried to stall<br>But Ace it seemed would show them all<br><br>Ace thought super fast, and altered the cake <br>And when it was done it came out great<br>And the town was saved, due to the Ace's fast wit<br>And to bake his cake he had used a spit</i><br><br>The tavern had kept the pace to her quick witted tale, one she had shared before, a trifle tale really. <br><br>Casidy set her lute down and picked up the fresh glass off mead the barkeep had brought her, and smiled.<br><br>The coins as always were brought or tossed her way near her stool, where her hat was laid.<br><br>She rose to take a sip from the cup and too address the lady at her table. "Well, theres one, and Casidy is my name, should you care for another. I have to make a round with the drinks, it is a deal I have worked out with the barkeep. He lets me play, and serve as I tend to get better tips that way." Smiling slightly as Casidy bounced behind the bar, and picked up a tray of frosty Ale, and headed towards the table with the band of paladins first. <br><br>The paladins where always ready to buy another mug, and tipped well, for the chance to have Casidy serve it to them.<br><br><br> <p><br><b><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#6699cc">---------------------------<br> Silent, Deadly         <br> Yeah, Right                  <br>---------------------------<br><br>~ Casidy Noteworthy</font></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uscaly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scaly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/4/01 9:54:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/kingscaly?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Watching.....waiting.....it was bad enough Valeron sent him here of all places....<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the Dismal Rage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->....ever since acquiring Lucan's testimony the Militia had no love for Scaly.

So, she headed to Freeport.<br><br>&quot;In Freeport, as everyone knows, is the Brownloe Bakery, where the best pastries and muffins in Norrath are available.

So, she boarded the boat to Butcherblock.<br><br>&quot;In the great underground city of the dwarves, she sought a magnificent feast, but all the dwarves cared about was ale and iron.  In Felwithe, the High Elves sipped on the nectar of the gods - not exactly a trollish delicacy.  In Kelethin, they made soups and stews from foraged vegetables and meats, but it was too watery for her tastes.  And in Ak'Anon, she tried to find a feast, but the ticking made her stomach hurt too much.<br><br>&quot;Sad and despondent, she travelled back across the Ocean of Tears, and made her way to Rivervale.

The pack he carries appears worn and weighted.<br><br>As he makes his way in, he carefully closes the door.

After filling a few other drink orders, he decants some brandy into a metal container of unknown composition.  He moves back over to the fire and takes the poker out of the coals, taps it against the inside of the fireplace to remove as much of the soot as possible, and sticks it inside the cup.  The sound of bubbling liquid can be heard and a steam rises from the cup, wafting about the room.  After the brandy is heated, the barkeep returns to the bar and pours it into a glass straining it through a cloth to remove any remaining debris.

"Here you are dear, sorry for the delay, I seemed to have needed a bit of brandy to warm myself as well."<br> <p><br><b><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#6699cc">---------------------------<br> Silent, Deadly         <br> Yeah, Right                  <br>---------------------------<br><br>~ Casidy Noteworthy</font></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujzonn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jzonn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/9/01 6:37:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/r/p/rpo2/Jzonn_Icon.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> As the young lady approaches, a Bard by appearances to the man in green, she places the glass on the table.  The glass has a cloth wrapped around it to help in the handling of the hot contents.  The man smells the brandy fumes coming from the glass.  He looks up and gives a slight smile as he reaches into a side pouch.  He places several gold coins on the table.  &quot;Thank you, lass.  This will do quite nicely.  Hot brandy has such a calming effect.&quot;<br><br>The Bard scoops up the coins in a fluid motion with her left hand to indicate that, while her feet may appear clumsy at the moment, her fingers are nimble.  As she turns to walk back to the bar, the man quickly, but gently, catches her right hand.  &quot;Don't worry about the incident with the other glass.  'Tis good to see yer not injured.&quot;  While speaking, he carefully palms a few more brighter coins into her right hand and winks.<br><br>As she walks off with a puzzled look, the man turns to his glass and cups it with both hands.  Bringing it to his face, resting on his lower lip, but not turned up for drinking.  He breaths in deeply and savors the aroma for a moment.  The glass is tilted to allow a small amount to pour out.  The man grimaces for a second, but relaxes as the amber liquid flows over his tongue and finally down his throat.  The glass is returned to the table as he leans back in his chair, noticably relaxing while his eyes begin to stare at the flames in the fireplace across the room. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR><I><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#cfcfcf">Ranger of Karana</I></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=6.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=6.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=6.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
