<br>
Personally, I'm still having a blast with EQ. If they keep expanding and refining it's content, I will continue to do so.<br>
<br>
I believe the best thing that Verant can do to ensure the success of Everquest is to implement encounters where the users have more control over what's going on. Look at some encounters like the Ring of Fire, the Fungus Grove Caller Quest, the Plate House spawn force in Kael, etc. The first time I did the 10th Ring War (special thanks to Ibiza for telling me to get my ass over there and kill some giants <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), I was having an absolute blast. I thought the fact that the person initiating the quest had as much control as they did over what was going on was cool. Seeing 15 giants march in perfect formation and attack your party was cool. The whole encounter was just... cool. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That's the kind of stuff that keeps this game fun for me. I haven't tried the Fungus Grove Caller quest or Ring of Fire yet, but I would love to. I'm sick of pulling mobs, I'd rather they charged me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There's a ton of room for content, and that's the reason I think the game will continue in it's success.<br>
<br>
What will the next expansion be? Will we find a passage to the underworld in the mines of Ak'anon? Will an alternate plane of existence be found, accessible through the Combine Ruins in DL? Who knows - it's impossible to say what Verant will do with EQ. If they keep the creative people that have made this game as fun as it is on their staff, the game will continue to attract new users and retain old ones.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't think that other games will really replace EQ. In my humble opinion, AO and DAoC helped this game more than they did hurt it. Verant was able to look at some of the things they were doing, copy it, and reproduce it in EQ. Since EQ already had two years of content in it, they were obviously more successful than the newer RPG's.<br>
<br>
I feel that if Verant continues to add game content, EQ will be around for a very, very long time. Who knows, we might even see an EQ2. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

Second there is still no contender. Other games that the whiners coming here to bitch about EQ and sing the praises of another have all been just whiny little teens that would bitch about the taxes winning the lottery. Not to mention they get new players still every day.<br>
<br>
This thing has a lot of leg left in it. But .... For this to fade something will have to takes its place. So far there is no game out there that even competes. DOAC was the closest and about 80% that ran to that thinkin it was the EQ killa are back in EQ. So talk about how the content is lame or unfinished or bugged or the expansion suck BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. But know they are still getting your 8.95 to 10 dollars a month.<br>
<br>
I am not an EQ defender although I like the game and If something replaces it tomorrow so be it. But the posters that use the same arguements of EQ sucks while they still spend their money is annoying. Gotta love the idiot hypocrite. <br>

<br>
Oh, not for a long time!  But coming nonetheless.<br>
<br>
The cultural and social aspect of this game is enormous.  How many kids have stayed away from drugs because there was this 'game' to eat up their spare time?  How many marriages have been broken, all because of a 'game'?  How many friendships have made the transition from this 'game' to the real world?  How many RL friendships have ended because of ingame disputes?<br>
<br>
The impact of EQ to me, is mindboggling.  I look for it to continue for several years -- I am going to agree with the three year suggestion for the game to thrive, and then a total of five years before it begins to decline.  However, I think the game will be around indefinitely as people will be willing to pay forever, to maintain their characters.<br>
<br>
For me personally, I have a lot to see yet.  Cara has 4 levels to go (well, 3 1/2) till she reaches the level end of the game, and I have a lot of good friends to interact with.  As long as my friends are here, I shall be too.<br>
<br>
I give myself at least another year.<br>
<br>
Legends, to me, has marked the beginning of the end.  We shall see.<br>

<br>
- I have to totally disagree. I think Legends has marked the height of EQ. You just know a company is doing well when they release specialized service for their more wealthy customers. The amount of uproar they got because of this, yet still went ahead with it, suggests to me that they really aren't worried. A game with 400,000 subscribers, and growing weekly. Why the hell should they be worried?<br>
In a way, however, I do think one aspect of the quote was right. It has marked the beginning of EQ... back then. With the major creators of EverQuest moving on and a new influx of players, I think it's marked a change in EverQuest - from what it once was, to what it will be now. Yes, I do think it is more of a cash cow now (hence Legends), I think it's becomming more commercial (what product doesn't when it succeeds?), and I do think there's room for improvement. However, this is the human race. We thrive from stuff like this.<br>
I'd like to give two thumbs up for Verant for creating such a great comodoty fetish product. And I'd also like to give them  two middle fingers for eating my social life. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>
