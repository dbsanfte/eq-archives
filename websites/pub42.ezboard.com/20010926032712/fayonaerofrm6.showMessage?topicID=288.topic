That do suck.<br>
But there is one thing I wonder.<br>
Why is it that way every facking time???<br>
<br>
I can't remember ONE time when a sebilis group got wiped or evaced with at lest one body behind, and actually got back and resumed the camping as a intact group. EVERY time I've been in that situation, the group broke up.<br>
<br>
Like yesterday. I had a great group in Disco. Really competent and nice people, something that supprised me a bit since it was a pure pickupgroup, and such groups tend to suck in the higher levels IMBE (In My Biased Experience).<br>
<br>
However, after hours of good camping and a few people leaving and getting replaced in good order, we get one misspull. The cleric died and the rest of us evac. And, of course, with gruesome predictability, it happens: the warrior realize he have to go and help a friend, the shadowknight realize he have a RL to attend to, and the chanter fail to return from LD. Nothing bad about these three people, each one probably had a good reason to not wait for replacement, but it's just so typical! <br>
<br>
Anyhow, the cleric had to get a summon corpse, but the three of us remaining actually managed to get a new warrior and necro, and moved back to our camp. Picked up a enchanter along the way too, CoH is a good thing to have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
Group i was in was....shall we say less than desirable?<br>
<br>
1.we got a druid that humm...was tanking ...yes folks a mid 50's druid that tanks.<br>
<br>
2. we got a ranger that claimed that she is as good as  any tank and that she can hold her own, blah blah blah,all of this cause i dared suggest we get a tank in group.Sorry rangers no offense inteded (in fact i like rangers) but you do not qualify as tanks. <br>
<br>
3.We got an sk that told us to &quot;MOVE&quot; ,i was surprised and asked &quot;humm...is the way cleared? &quot; answer the way is clear!&quot; only to find that it was not the case at all .we got wiped cause nothing was cleared.<br>
<br>
4.We got people that decided to pull even though we had puller.<br>
<br>
5.We had a mage that camped while we where wiped and then summon me so we can gather bodies and res (we are just mage,myself and druid ,2 of us nacked)and then amazingly and for no reasons went on his own and pulled a bunch of mobs that got us wiped yet again.<br>
<br>
6. we had a specific puller that was pulling single pulls for us during cr and all was going very well till  some sk guy decided he was the puller and got us yet another train, the druid of course was too busy to evac.<br>
<br>
And i can go on and on and on, you know this is possibly the worse night i have had in a long time, as  i havent seen a that amount incompetence for a while. A couple or more of these are matahari(sp) members  i suspect this is how you got you &quot;facts&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have done CR there with one person only, 2people doing cr, this very same cr and yet with this night i have more than dozen  people get wooped.How can this happen is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Yes i informed my group that i basically needed to cool off a while and camped for a few minutes(probably 3 min or less,time to grab a drink). There was no point in hanging out anyways, my group was incapable of doing a CR .I  still came back and resed a lot of people including another group that was in another wipe out. <br>
<br>
Now this was about my group,if you are talking about some other people that werent in my original group you need to say what names and who/what you are talking about. <br>
<br>
I didnt leave any group or person that was helping me.If you gonna make that sort of accusation then it would be nice to back up that claim with specifics.<br>
<br>
I appreciate people asking if they can help when they freaking mean it. Some of these guys are just waisting my time.Ask to help then &quot;what camp are we doing?&quot; or so what raid is this, can i join you raid? &quot; or &quot;i can only help but only if it takes 5 minutes&quot; <br>
<br>
I have gotten a ton of tells asking me if i needed help and after that experience i basically declined,the 1st body was done by ladariel alt and the last body i basically stuck to 2 (as in two)other people i knew were capable, 1 was daddio the warior and another was a mage from vision, these 2 guys and me did this simple CR that 15 + people couldnt do before.<br>

<br>
For all I care you are a godly cleric and the group were all noobs not knowing how to play their char.<br>
Sure druids can't tank, rangers are no tanks, mages should not pull, sk's should listen and IMO the only one who did his job well was you (from your story)<br>
Yes 1 was a Matahari so that's how I know.<br>
The other 4 were other Guilds so who knows its not a Guilds issue ts a player issue ..<br>
<br>
Anyway .. I just hate to see a Cleric camp out on his group for being pissed he died for no reason<br>
We all at times die for no reason but the fact is you take it as it comes and help your group and when you are done you can be pissed and camp out.<br>
<br>
You say you left 3 minutes but what you don't realize is that there are 5 people there and all they see is their cleric camping out.<br>
They do not know you will return, they do not know how long it will take, they do however know they just got left behind.<br>
<br>
Take care ..<br>

Indeed I would..<br>
But when a cleric leaves dead people behind I must admit it hurts a hell of a lot more being dead and being left behind by a cleric since he is supposed to rez ya.<br>
<br>
So yes it would matter but not as much as when the cleric does it since the other players can not restore your exp where the cleric can .. sorta logic.<br>

All you have casted on me is maybe a buff or two. <br>
<br>
Everything went well till we got to the point of going back to the zone..Yes a little mishap..<br>
<br>
But as soon as the mage coth us back and we failed going back to corpses due to major aggro and then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camped. And leave US with finishing up the CR.<br>
Yes I might have been busy organizing a rez for all since <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> left US. It is not as if you ever tried to communicate with us after you returned.<br>
<br>
I had a necro <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Thanks Zolten </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->much appreciated to summon us since YOU were too lame to even stick around.<br>
The Rogue in our group logged on his cleric to rez us..<br>
Yes we managed to get all our corpses..<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  And no No help for you! Nor help from you!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I even invited the chanter that was there *might have just been you* but the invite got rejected eventho I wanted to have the chanter summoned aswell.<br>
<br>
Lol you must be from another planet cuz the mage sticked around till I had the necro to summon us..But hey how can you tell when you are not online! And the sk even pulled some of the corpses while he was the one that really needed to leave.<br>
<br>
And please don't play god now..you haven't rezzed anyone from the group you dumped during the CR. Yes I saw you rez others, but non of us. /Cheer you you must be a proud being.<br>

Oh well I am glad we actually managed finish the CR!<br>

The points raised arent there to justify any of my actions.They are there to put things in perspective, these things tend to be annoying.We simply couldnt do anything right for some reasons.I happened to have liked the group for what it's worth,but wasn't pleased with the way things went.<br>
<br>
In any case you are making it sound a lot bigger than it is,they were plenty of clerics right there,even our group had an alt cleric parked there. Myself,I resed everyone that i could see needed it.None were gonna loose exp.This is not like the old days where there is an actual danger of loosing gear either, new and improved VI baby-sitting made sure nothing of this sort happens with the introduction of corpse summoning.<br>
<br>
PS1:It would be nice if players get the info that their name gonna get be brough up in this board so they can put their side of the story too imo,as oppose to me hearing it from a friend that my name was mentioned here.<br>
<br>
PS2: Dont guild leaders have less boring things to do than take care of little membership neighborhood squables?<br>

Everyone get a minimum of 2 buffs in my group,that is hero and symbole.If  i get loads of mana i will AC you (the druid) too.Tanks get more buffs.But evidently since you were tanking i should have given you ac also,oopsy ..so sorry<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was offline for a very short period of time,if you didnt see me that's because i was on the way to retrieve and res our bodies,including yours.I did not communicate this to the group because frankly i did not want you to tag along.When i got there i seen the a couple corpses were gone as they were evidently summoned.<br>

Since you camped out not knowing when or if you would return.<br>

<br>
seriously  to the cleric that camped.... WHY DID YOU WAIT THAT LONG  i would have told em to sit on it and rotate and logged at the same time as someone other then the puller got something... <br>
i group with rangers alot and damn they are good but a 60ranger cant tank a green mob so why claim to be a tank?<br>
druids that tank? sure sounds like a plan, just remember not to heal them so we get rid of the rude fucks early on in the group...<br>
a good group does not have casters that can whimp out and gate, a good group is all melee and cleric.... druid can go solo in Cs .<br>
if the group sucks... LEAVE IT<br>
dont wait, dont let it come to CR just leave it..<br>
and Ytrok.. dont take sides, guildleaders that take sides for the members without knowing jack shit about what really happend just loose all if they had any of the credibility.<br>

AC-buff isnt for you, dear druid..you dont have to tank normally..i only cast one ac-buff on casters (plus shammy and druid), cuz i have aof on my donal gauntles. the higher ac is only for the tanks and when you got aego you dont care anyway...<br>
<br>
About CR..I guess it has more to do with personal opinion. i always stay till CR is done and then i go (if the group sucks). But anyway..even if camping out at CR isnt nice..posting this shit officially on the board to show all others how much this cleric sucks isnt nice either..<br>

Just saying with me tanking the two or more frogs didn't effect his mana status whatsoever.<br>

Maybe some of us arent reading the entire message before posting...<br>
<br>
I got a cr group (2 other players) and went retrieved/res the bodies, i just didnt do it with my original group.By the time we got there though most bodies were summoned.<br>
<br>
Basically i got a different crew to get it done within a reasonable amount of time. <br>
<br>
Was it a cool thing to do? nope it wasnt ,but it got the job done like i knew it would.<br>
