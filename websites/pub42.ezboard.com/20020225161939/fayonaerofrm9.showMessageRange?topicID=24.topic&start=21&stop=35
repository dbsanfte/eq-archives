Like Kivorn said, the raid I was reffering to was the one with Midnight. However, the one you talked about, I think I was on that raid too. Ah, fond memories. Mystical Legacy was in Fear, and then Vision showed up. After some initial problems the guilds shared the plane. Then when the zone was half cleared a third guild (Paradigm, mightiest guild on teh server) showed up and declared that they would take CT. And suddenly Vision and Mystical Legacy wasn't merely tolerating each other, but was allies who taked out the god together. <br>
<br>
This was a very long time ago, like you say quite shortly after Vision was founded (as a merger of four smaller guilds, if I remember correctly), and my memory might be glamourizing things in retrospect. But the way I remember it there was very little ill will. True enough, some people in the two smaller guilds was angry at the larger guild for starting the same raid that we was allready doing and trying to push themselves past us, and some people in the bigger guild felt that CT was theirs and that it was rude of the little ones to not know their place. But on the whole there was very little ill will. Whoever got the god got the god, and I don't think anyone ever considered calling in a GM. <br>

Sol Ro lives on!</span><hr size=1> Yup.  The event is as you describe it.  I didn't want to make a &quot;Paradigm KS'd mah dragon&quot; post, because although I didn't necessarily agree with the way Paradigm did things from a neighborly standpoint; I certainly did (and do) respect the organization and planning they put into sucessful raids.<br>
<br>
Carefully kissing Paradigm's ass aside, yes, it was an interesting evening; and yes, Vision formed when four smaller guilds merged.<br>
<br>
It all boiled down to this.  Cazic Thule wasn't yours, ours, or Paradigm's.  It was whomever put up the best effort and got to him first.  That night, it was the unlikely alliance of our guilds, who (although admittedly rushed with Dread/Fright/Terror still up) pulled together and fought the good fight.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
In a similar story, we just spent about three nights in Fear - mostly cleaning up repop from the day guilds who went before us.  Sometimes we had other people in the zone who wanted to coordinate with us and do our best to share the zone; sometimes we had people in the zone who insisted on &quot;/shout Respect our raid and get our of our zone!&quot; as their means of diplomacy.  All in all we did our own thing, and it all went well.  Oddly enough, in all the times we shared the zone, we ended up giving away EVER drop that fell.  (We were often working with only 6 people.)<br>
<br>
However, as it always seems, Fear was a shoe-store.  Guess we're going back someday.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383836><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usanterre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santerre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/24/01 8:33:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ROFLMAO! Sol Ro lives on!</span><hr size=1> Indeed, Vallis Scortor was the other guild involved.  I am an officer of that guild.  Nitrain, our leader, had originally made an agreement with Midnight's leader/raid leader that we would work with them, get any drops we needed, and they would have CT within an hour or two.  Then we would take the Shissar (which was all we really wanted).<br>
<br>
By the time we reached the SE corner, the entire deal had changed, and Midnight (having more levels and numbers) had basically told us to go screw off. We were even told to &quot;pull clockwise&quot;, LOL.  Well long story short is we pull the GY and basically we both got to the gorgons at the same time, and they pulled them all.  At once.  Plane was basically cleared at that point, and then the petitions started.  My understanding is that the official word was we got to make our attempt first because we cleared the temple.  The reality of the situation was more likely the GM reacting to the horrendous reputation of Midnight, and the shouts they heard in the zone.  I can't claim to know exactly who it was shouting things over all, but I do remember Cinnamoon shouting that we didn't deserve CT because we could never complete any epic quests.  It was generally just rude, arrogant stuff like that.  Contrarily, Kivorn was more intrested in pulling than shouting, and Galuda, a good friend of mine, was uninterested in being with a guild that acted like that and left it.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is we probably couldn't have taken down CT alone.  But damned if we were gonna let a bunch of what we viewed as arrogant jerks have him.  So we called on some friends (who, ironically, also didn't like Midnight) and got the job done. <p><BR><br><B><I>-Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukivornteleri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kivorn Teleri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gimpy Ranger Admin</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/24/01 9:17:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/alex_enstrom/kiv60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ROFLMAO!

A dr00d said something like "GORGONS ON TRACK!" and all of a sudden we had a dozen pullers instead of just me and my helper :p<br>
They almost got me killed when all of a sudden four gorgons swooped down on me.<br>
Your puller, can't remember his name exactly, was a ranger though, was very friendly and had no problem with steering clear of us like I did with you.<br>
And no, I don't shout or harass people. I shut up and do my job until the raidleader tells me to stop.<br>
As a matter of fact, he told me "pull EVERYTHING, leave them NOTHING" so that's why the competition. <br>
No ill feelings I hope :)<br>

Your version is compatible with my own experience of the events, no need to argue about what happened. <br>
While you don't know the whole story about how Midnight managed to fack up the diplomacy so badly, be assured that you was not the only ones to be displeased with it. While it never was a major part in my decission to leave and I even missed Midnight a bit after the serversplit, that night sure did generate some dissatisfaction with the guild from my side.<br>
<br>
I hope that you as well can understand if people get angry when petitions are used in the way you describe. <br>
<br>
<i>"Fact of the matter is we probably couldn't have taken down CT alone. But damned if we were gonna let a bunch of what we viewed as arrogant jerks have him. "</i><br>
<br>
And you succeded with that. Prevented us from killing CT, prevented Cinna from getting her epic. Not by being faster or more powerful, but by politicing. I don't think you would have appreciated the feeling if the shoe was on the other foot.<br>
<br>
As for Midnights reputation, the guild was new. During the few weeks I was a member I never saw the guild behave badly, the CT incident is the only time that at all came close. The guild did have a bit of bad rep, yes. Partly because a lot of people automatically hated it because it was big, and partly because a lot of it's ranks consisted of former members of a guild that disbanded itself in a heated argument about honor after a really shitty incident. <br>

Moving deeper into the realm of memories from our old server, I see. Nice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
However, the subject of bad rep gets tedious in the long run. The only reason I mentioned Midnight's bad rep at all was because it was brought up, and I wanted to show that it was not relevant. If I had thought that the bad rep was well-deserved then I would never have joined. I was among the people who defended Midnight from the start. <br>
<br>
I'm sure that many of those who hated Midnight had different reasons to do so, and yes I know that ML had it's share of haters and at times more then it's share of goof-ups to laugh about.<br>
<br>
VVV was one of the first great guilds on SolRo, and I remember them from my midlevel days when they and HOSS were the big ones who did all the cool stuff. What went wrong from there I do not know and do not care. What I do know, however, is that when it fell there was many who loved the guild, but also many who hated it. When Midnight was formed those who had loved VVV seemed to think &quot;ah, nice, new guild, let them prove themselves&quot;. At the same time, many or at least several of those who hated VVV seemed to feel &quot;ah, VVV is back, let's flame them&quot;. This was before the ML people had migrated to Midnight, before Midnight had done any big raids at all. <br>
<br>
Many contributed to Midnights rep: the people who hated VVV, the people who hated ML, the people who hated Scorpio, and the people who hated big guilds in general. Which of these group was biggest is hardly interesting. What I however find very interesting is that a guild got horrible reputation as Evil Uberguild without doing anything at all. Nothing good, nothing bad, nothing at all. The guild simply got flamed all the way to hell for merely existing. <br>
<br>
Yet, I think both you and I had quite fun in that guild. Are you still wearing that Bloodember BP we got you ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You are right that the thread don't really belong on the raid forum. <br>
This is not a discussion about upcoming or past raids on Ayonae Ro, neither generally speaking nor any particular ones. I should have put the thread in this forum (or in NAG or general) from the start. <p>Love, Edeina<br>
