<br>
If I get home from work at 6pm PST on patch day, and everything in Kunark is dead, and people are polishing off the last of the Velious spawns, SOMEONE has a timezone advantage.<br>
<br>
If they didn't patch so often, eventually every spawn in the game would slowly start spawning at all sorts of different times, and nobody would have any advantage over anyone else (altough I suspect EST guilds would have a numbers advantage in having more people on at the same time).<br>

<br>
We talk about two different reasons why they want to kill the 4th warder here. First one, they don't want Darkwind to get any more Primal weapons. 2nd, Eternal Wrath wants to be the 2nd guild to wake the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
About the first one, well, it's their *guildwar* and I don't want to intrude but I won't sit here and say that they are doing the right thing, it's wrong to exlucde other guilds. Even if it is a quest to get warders back, I think it's quite wrong.<br>
<br>
2nd. Eternal Wrath is looking for prestige. Yay! We will be 2nd guild serverwide!! wow! They posted on many guildboards that this will happen, not only Ayonae, but on other servers such as Paradigm on Solusek Ro. I laughed when I read some of the those posts, it feels like they are advertising about how good they are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The post which Edeina wrote on this board was very nice but I think it goes a bit too far when they start to write about it on other boards. Honestly, I don't think that this prestige of killing the 4th warder as 2nd guild serverwide will be so big. I really think that quite many other servers ARE able to kill the 4th warder, but they don't want to, they still want the warders to be there.<br>
<br>
That's why I see this more as destroying for another guild than getting the server *stronger* against the other servers.<br>
<br>
PS. I am not against Eternal Wrath in any kind, I am neutral in this question, just stating out that this is going a bit too far for my taste. <p>- Fandariella, High Elf Beguiler<br>

you miss two reasons that are very motivating for us.<br>
<br>
First, the fourth warder is a very interesting fight in itself, a challenge to look forward to. Those are rare these days. Than only one other guild have killed this dragon is not because anyone have bothered. All ST capable guilds have tried, but so far only BotS have suceeded. It might be that FoH, AL, PD and the others have not tried since BotS - but I doubt it, and it was quite recently anyway.<br>
<br>
Second, the release of the sleeper is not the end of the story. This game is running out of content, and wakening the sleeper seem to be THE way to make new things happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
About Darkwind.<br>
Us wakening sleeper is not about them. The two motivations I mentioned and the second motivation you mentioned is more then enough reason. However, If DarkWind as a guild was nice and honorable, didn't monopolize spawns, didn't bully themselves into camped spawns, didn't snatch secondary ubermobs from broken spawns, and so on, if we considered them good friends and honorable companions, then we would stand down from our goal, in spite of the mentioned three compelling reasons. Then it would have been about them. <br>
<br>
You have to understand that to stand down from killing a uncontested ubermob who would be a great kill in many ways, just because it would be convinient for someone else, that's doing that party a favor. Not standing down is not a attack against them - of course it would be more convinient for them if we left it up for them to kill, but that's their problem qnd not ours.<br>
<br>
We are not at war with DarkWind, but quite frankly they as a guild have not earned any special considerations. So far they have taken every chance they ever had to roll over people, always doing what's most profitable for them. Surely it's enough that DarkWind goes out of it's way to always do what is most profitable for DarkWind, other guilds don't have to repay their attitude with also making sure to always do what's most profitable for DarkWind. This game is not all about them, after all. <br>
<br>
If one guild is preparing for a ubermob and DW isn't even there, then they can still barge in if they believe they can get ready quicker. Ragefire and Zlandicar comes to mind.<br>
<br>
If they can hold a monopoly on a spawn, they do. Noone but them could kill CT for months, because they was always hogging fear at Server Up. I don't know of any other guild that have ever hogged a spawn like that.<br>
<br>
And yes, yesterdays little snatchaway was kinda cute. There are several dragons in North ToV that can only be killed when Aa, a really nasty dragon, is killed. We killed the nasty one and most of the little ones, but too many people in our guild have RL:s and had to sleep, so two of these lesser dragons was spared for next day. Of course, DarkWind rushed in and took them. We broke the spawn, they took easily killed  ultrarare-spawn uberloot-dropping dragons that they wouldn't have had a chance to approach without us breaking the spawn.<br>
<br>
There is a consensus among basically all guilds that hunt in NToV that this is one of the lamest things that can be done in the game. Personally I think that this kind of behaviour is extremely lame regardless of what spawn it's about, and I do agree that the lameness increase with the scale. The newbies that snatched dervs from the camp my group had died many times to break, yes they was asshole bottomfeeders, but at least they had the excuse that they was ignorant newbies. DarkWind ought to have develop more dignity over time.<br>
<br>
This being said, I don't hate DarkWind in any way. I simply don't think that they have earned any special considerations beyond basic civilized behaviour. I wouldn't KS from them, but I can't see why I should leave mobs up when I want to kill them and the only reason to leave them up is because it would give DarkWind more to kill. This goes only for the guild as a whole. Many individual DW members are great people who deserve a lot of respect and who I would gladly go out of my way to help.<br>
<br>
Finally, if we manage to awaken the sleeper, it will not disable the Warders forever. They will most likely be up before VV or CB or any other guild have enough people with keys to do MOTG, Progenitor and FA (those will still be up and drop primals in any case), and definitly before they have enough to do the actual warders. Several guilds will be full of primal eventually, and over 99% of the server will never see ST in any case, regardless of what happens to the Warders. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
We are in 2 time zones, euro and us mainly.<br>
When u kill these dragons and leave 1 or 2 up because you need sleep, does this mean the euro people should not kill these, just let them stay alive untill you can kill em?<br>
<br>
That IMO is a bit strange because itwould ask us Euro's to step back from these mobs because USA is asleep.<br>
<br>
Not flaming but I would like to know how you can say that it is DW who is "stealing" your mobs when u are asleep.<br>
If DW would be asleep would you not attack mobs that are up because they are comfty in bed.<br>
<br>
Once again not a flame just a question...<br>

Then you would both be on the same time zones as each other and no-one could take over a camp while the other was sleeping. <br>
<br>
No, no, don't thank me now, Edeina. Just make sure I get into EW with no trial whatsoever when I am high enough in level.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/26/01 4:48:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=114>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a question about ST....</span><hr size=1> /smile ViBeSJoKeR<br>
Point is, those mobs would not be possible to kill without first killing the bossmob we killed. It's on a larger scale and thus in a bigger timeframe, but it is still basically she same thing as rushing in and snatch mobs from a big but nicely broken dervcamp while the ones who broke it are medding.<br>
<br>
She spawnbreakers shouldn't go and throw too mig temper tantrums about it. It's justa  game, and if people want to be assholes in a game, well, fun for them. But if the offenders come and ask the spawnbreakers to not kill stuff because that wouldn't leave enough for the leeches, why would the spawnbreakers comply? Answer: no reason whatsoever!<br>
<br>

We have been through this many times in this thread, I have nothing new to add. All point to that it's extremely likely that the warders will return.<br>

Good idea! <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
It was of some concern to me. Is this is reference to a few individuals, a particular guild, or the rest of the server?<br>
<br>
If its to a few individuals or a certain guild, its not really my business. Flame on for all I care.<br>
<br>
But, if you chose to place the whole Non-Eternal Wrath population of a server, some 5,000 + individuals as opposed to your membership base,under this &quot;Bottomfeeder&quot; label, you are doing a grave injustice to the rest of your guild and the server as a whole.<br>
<br>
Hey, I know you guys feel the can do whatever you want based upon the fact that you can, which is fine. Is a FAA server. Where it becomes a problem is when you belittle others because they don't hold your monopoly. If anyone tries to advance a little, they are called &quot;Bottomfeeders&quot; and you expect them to pay you some kind of &quot;Tribute&quot;. Your &quot;Bottomfeeders&quot; are really nothing more than people trying to play the game as they wish, just as you do. <br>
<br>
Eternal Wrath,I will give credit where credit is due and say that you have done some cool things and had some nice victories and have helped others even if you wished not to as a whole. <br>
<br>
Gladstone, I don't think you speak for your whole guild when you make those comments. If indeed you are, than how can anyone really appreciate what it is that your guild does? You look for respect, but we can't respect you if you don't show a little in return and wish to continue to bash the rest of the server community just for...existing.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your hunt.  <br>

<br>
Gladstone does not speak for the guild, and he was reffering only to the few individuals who take advantage of others efforts on these peoples expense.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, while only a few are asshole bottomfeeders like that, everyone are bottomfeaders at times. Including us in Eternal Wrath. I have farmed green mobs for faction and helpless blue mobs for xp, and I have tagged along to benefit from others work. This is nothing I feel ashamed of, because I have never done it as anyones expense. I would never snatch mobs from the ones who cleared the way for me. <br>
<br>
Like that time in Plane of Sky I talked about in the &quot;bottomfeeders anonymous&quot; thread. I was on the 7:th island and had a necro with me so I could get a raidforce up there. Imperial Order and Mithril Tower was the ones who had done all the work, I had only asked them for a summon corpse and ress to the island.<br>
<br>
They was to stay there a few more days to farm the place. Some other guest I chatted with actually suggested I would bring a EW raidforce up there after tehy logged, basically snatching the camp from IO/MT before they was done with it. I was so angry with him. He quickly retreated to claiming that he had been joking, lol. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

So dont talk shit pls we was there with 30 ppl all very tired (well it was really late in europe) we fighted these mobs the FRIST time we had absolutly no clue about them (well we dont have/had members with good foh contacts like you ... ). well for me it was a blast. <br>
for the aa think well n tov wasnt our main priority at this time  our main goal was  ST because we still need more keys/primals so we went to CT (oh yes u know the one we claimed) and warders (maybe for the last time for a long time for us if u win tonight). next day we went to the 3 west wing dragons. <br>
Now n tov will be our main goal i think because if u win tonigth there is nothing really left to kill, and it was just a blast and i think we are abel to kill aa too with some more ppl than 30 for sure.<br>
i would love to see ew and dw on a n tov rotation but well i am no officer i cant decide it.<br>
<br>
to ed: oh yes dw is badbadbad and ew is sooooniceto everyone blabla<br>
