Ok folks...here's the big gore secret....<br>
initial aggro from a da paladin..<br>
so that everyone isn't slowed in the initial ae slow....then 12 seconds of unslowed disciplines....then nukes to finish her off after the remaining slows.  If the fight isn't over in 30 seconds, you lose.  Just like trak and VS.  Also, people under 55 don't help much, as they can't resist the fear.  Perhaps with the new warrior fearless warcry this will change.<br>

<br>
Bust your ass and get to 54 or 55 and then we bust our ass to get your epic to you.  Its a give and take thing.<br>
<br>
In your case the white scale is still attainable it just takes for ever<br>
<br>
From the start of my epic quest, hmm I started around Oct of 00' it took me until March of 01' to get it.  Keep in mind that for a Ranger, at this time, You needed 2 items that came from once a week spawns, Inny and VS.  In your case at least there is more than one source for each item.  If not for the generosity of Eternal Wrath I would never have wielded Earth Caller.<br>

What you do is get yourself known and get on the raids, like Blearchie Pooh said, you will eventually get it.  It takes patiance young Jedi :)) <p>Conaddor Trueheart<BR>

What if chat channels were allowed?  By that I mean what if anyone could create a channel on the fly with a password that didn't share exp and life information, but merely added a new default mass communication method to all who joined the channel?  Without this ability, raids that require more than 2 groups are destined to fail, as was shown so conclusively in the early days of the server, when there were no guilds.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you COULD organize a high level raid from members of any guild, and not have to temp guild each and every one, with the attendant bother of everyone reguilding themselves at the end, merely for communication purposes?<br>
<br>
How would the guild structure be changed?  Would guilds have the same membership?  Organizing a guild takes a MASSIVE amount of organizational effort:  The website, the loot structure, the charter, the admissions policy....  Things that seem a little too much effort to insist on as prerequisites to create a chat channel.  <br>
<br>
The chat channel part of guilding, in my opinion, should be opened up to all.  The lack of it is the single most annoying thing I can think of in everquest, more even than the bugs, as it relates directly to what is fun about mmorphs:  interaction and communication with other players.  Guilds would be able to invite guests to their raids without the guild tag.  Independents could actually stand a chance to organize a raid.<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Well, I do have this to say about all your guildmates who are asking you to hurry up and level up....<br>
<br>
They want to play with you, see, if you stay lower level than them, you can't effectively group with them.  If it's a concious choice to stay low level, then perhaps joining a guild of similarly minded people of similar level would be more of your style.<br>
<br>
The game completely changes at level 30, and then again at 46, and then again at 55.  I never believe it untill I level, but every level over 51 makes a huge difference.  In mob aggro radius, in resists, in damage output, in who you can effectively group with.<br>

<br>
If your guild is more important then your epic, then stay. If your epic is more important the the guild, leave. <br>
This is always assuming you will not get your epic with your guild.<br>
<br>
For example: for Jokers goes: If you join us and want your epic in a short while, then you better leave. Because we are not strong enough to finish an epic a week and we have 50 people that will get one before you do because they have done more for the guild then you did (assuming you would join today).<br>
If you join the Jokers because you like the guild and the people, but would like to get your epic one day and work for it hard, then stay and we will try to help you as good as we can.<br>
<br>
Maybe your guild was simply.. honest to you?<br>
If a guildmember would come to me, lets say, a Bard, and would say: I want my epic, asap. Then I would answer: Forget about your epic.<br>
<br>
Why? Simply because the chances for us, with our strength, power, with other people deserving the epic before you do, simply in the position the guild is at the moment, the chances for you to get your epic within the next few months are VERY slim. <br>
However, I would offer you help with specific mobs if you organise and prepare and lead the raid. This is how it works with us. ANd the only way it can work for 'normal guilds' without Uberpower. <p><center><A href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/taino.jpg" border=0 alt="Send me a Mail"></a><br><FONT color=#ffffff

<br>
I concur.<br>
<br>
There were times that I did not have faith in Kelraz that we could take things down with the small amount of force, such as the Scale Keeper in the Hole, but, we did.  I am much more likely to show up to help someone that KNOWS what the mob does, knows how to get there, knows every little detail about the target and can get the people there.  I am NOT very willing to help someone who hasn't taken the time to level to 54-55, hasn't done enough research on the target in question, has to have someone else round up people for them, can't lead the raid on their own.  I honestly should not be a mob 'beta tester' to see what spells land on it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, in a lot of guilds, some epics are just going to be low priority.  Rogue, Ranger and Monk epics are some of the easiest to get, and they help the guild on the whole by improving damage output.  Enchanter and Cleric epics are by far the most beneficial to raids.  Necro epic is going to be low priority, since even most Necros shun it.  However, who do you think is going to have first dibs on a Kael/Thurg/ToV Robe?  A Necro.  Why?  Because it's damned nice for CRs.  There are just going to be more important things that help the guild much more on the whole.  Decking out your tanks in Thurg/Kael/SS armor is going to be much more worth the effort than decking out every Paladin with an epic.<br>

Lastly, epics and other nice items are also treated in most guilds as a special reward for effort and loyalty.  The majority of my guild agreed that my guild leader, Dashmoo, should receive a chain BP that dropped, because of her hard efforts and long nights she put in.  Semidie, guild Necro officer, finally received her epic, and deservedly so, after her longtime loyalty to the guild.<br>

If the guild isn't worth being put ahead of you, then you aren't going to be worth being put ahead of the guild. <p><table>

If that's the problem, you can stay in that guild as they gradually acrue power, and become a respected member, so there's no question as to who deserves bard epic most. Or, you can find another guild which perhaps may be a vehicle to the epic. Given the fact you left over not getting an epic, I don't think you liked your old guild, or your old guild didn't mean as much to you as your epic. Honestly, I don't think you'll have much chance as a 52 bard, because 52 is a simply unacceptable level for most guilds who may be able to do said bard epic. <br>
<br>
There is also another reason they may have told you that. They may have felt you just didn't deserve your epic, which is also a legitimate reason, though probably not in your eyes. If that was the case, perhaps there are other things besides epic you need to work on. <br>

If you really want it then go for it, if you dont then dont worry about it.  But geez don't let someone tell you to just give up on it.  <br>

First off, who is anyone to determine if anyone deserves their epic.  Next, we come back full circle to, if I take the xp road to supply them with what they want, isn't that cheating myself.  I pass up on an important level because it reduces the mobs available for the White Scale to 1 instead of 2.  And again, I reiterate, I have been down this road before.  Sure level up, we'll help you later.  No, I say.  Not because I don't trust that they will honor their word so much as there may be different leaders later, or the guild falls to levels where I cannot ever attempt to own that which I want, even after doing what they wanted.  I say screw that!!!!  Just as I told them.<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;If you want to see what happens when you get self-motivated bard, talk to Kelraz. He organized numerous events, including Vox and Nortlav runs, to get what he needed -- and because he came out saying &quot;I'm doing this, here is who I've got willing to do it and it's going to go down on this day&quot; when he approached people, he got a lot more willing volunteers.&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
This is part of the reason I left.  High Council decides that people under a certain level cannot have guild assistance to perform raids.  So, being not in the guild is basically the same as being in the guild.  No support.  <br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;Now, I must look for a guild and build the support within it to be able to make the attempt. This I attempted to do with the said guild. Anytime someone asked for help, I freely gave it. Including 5 personal attempts, the cleric attempted 2 times outside the guild, on Chardok for the cleric epic. 3 attempts, 2 of which were successful on the Druid dragon in TD. One Pali attempt in the hole, bypassing Nortlav with only one comment, that he was up, to achieve the goal set. PoA for warriors. PoH for others. PoF again for others. &lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
I would say it's about time to return the support that people were given for their items wouldn't you.  Not for the entire epic.  I have stated before that this was not my goal.  I know before I finally obtain what is my goal I will be 55+, but right now there is opportunity, with support to achieve an important, and yes hard to get piece with options on who is killed to do it.  Later, 55+ these choices are not available.  However, High and might council has decreed therefore no one will assist for fear of being seen in a bad light or going against their wishes.  High council is there to guide the guild, not rule them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukarmonshadowstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karmon Shadowstalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/20/01 5:40:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=734.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic</span><hr size=1> Your guild determines if you deserve your epic, because they are the ones who are getting it (for the most part) for you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukarmonshadowstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karmon Shadowstalker</A> at: 12/20/01 5:49:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utildares.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TildareS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/20/01 5:49:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=734.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic</span><hr size=1> The way I look at my Epic is, will it help my guild?<br>
<br>
 Iam a Necro and you all know what Uberspell it got on it (Ur 49+ Snarespell) this spell will not help my guild out a bit.<br>
<br>
 Yes I would love to have my Epic (Its one of my goals in EQ) but my guild isn't doing Fear any more so I just sniff around after pickup raides in fear so I could get the one Item missing.<br>
 I hate nagging for epic parts, so I don't.<br>
<br>
 Its quite sad that VI didnt do all Epics &quot;Party/Raide&quot; friendly so a guild realy would like to have all classes epics.(IMO a lure snare/dot 2k damage over 70 sec)<br>
<br>
 Well Iam in now hurry, my time will come so np.<br>
<br>
PS.

Your guild determines if you deserve your epic, because they are the ones who are getting it (for the most part) for you. <br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry to say, my guild helped me with none of the steps I have already taken.  I killed quag with a shammie that happened to be there for xp.  I gathered the group for maligar.  I did all the running around necessary for the first two steps, rather than cheat and get a druid or wizzie to port me.  Boats suck btw.  True, I am at a stage where there is no more soloing.  Guild support would go a long way to fulfilling those goals but it does not require the whole guild, as Kelraz has done and someone pointed out earlier.  A group, 6 players, to be the leader of a raid would suffice.  Post in general server forums, as I did.  Lotto the gear NBG, withholding certain items, one scale one book, for a lucky pali.  I even argued the point that if we did it as a guild, look at the loot we would have, within the guild.  Not one but both bards in the guild would have their epic piece and no one would need ever do Vox or Gorenaire again unless another bard filed into the rolls.  Two pali's would be happy to have their book, for their own epic.  Rezo sticks and haste gear.  Still some of the best gear you can get in the game drops off a few mobs.  No, they said.  You are not level 55.  Let's not count all the raids you have gone on.  You got hate gear, which I can get on pretty much any raid there, cause there are few bards, and a lot of stuff rots.  You got a symphonic sabre, piece of crap sword that isn't worth the metal it's made of anymore due to farming and has a mez proc.  WTH good does that do.  My dual wield ability goes off almost 100% of the time.  Proc unmezz proc unmezz.  But I think this rant is about over.  I see people for and against.  I will leave it with saying this.  It is true there are people out there that would goad a raid or even the full epic out of a guild then leave once they had it.  I for one would have more respect and show gratitude by providing the skill that weapon provides both me and the group I am in, to the guild.  It's also true that in more than a few guilds, server wide, there are a few in command who think it is the guild responsibility to equip their character(s) in the best gear while the rest suffer with mediocre stuff.  I found a guild that fits this profile and as the saying goes, if it smells like it, looks like it, tastes like it, it must be it.  I feel for the people that think they must follow leadership blindly in a game they paid for to have fun with, yet not be able to achieve any of their own goals. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=benielsongweaver>Beniel Songweaver</A> at: 12/20/01 7:42:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ublearchie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blearchie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Benefactor</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/20/01 8:06:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=734.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~jim_howard/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They said give up your Epic</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  First off, who is anyone to determine if anyone deserves their epic. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, the folks that show up and try to help on raids, other epics, and stuff like that are the ones I drop everything and run to go help. The ones that only show when there is something in it for them are the ones I am &quot;busy&quot; for.<br>

This includes guildmates and non-guildies.<br>
