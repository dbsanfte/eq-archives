I'm not often one to join the vogue clique, but this runaway train is difficult to jump off. <br> <br>What can you say about soccer other than it is boring, tedious, confusing, mystifying, bewildering and virtually impossible to watch. But, of course, those are the sport's good points. <br><br>Several times Friday morning during the USA's 1-0 loss to Germany (the Americans played extraordinarily well in defeat), I nearly slipped into a coma. I would rather have my wisdom teeth pulled (sans Novocain) than watch another soccer game. <br><br>Honestly, the only thing I have found more excruciating to watch on television in recent weeks have been political ads. But some of those pathetic people don't know any better. <br><br>Still, soccer is force fed every couple of years like Similac down a baby's throat and we are told if we don't enjoy the sport, it somehow makes us stupid or ignorant. <br><br>I don't care that the World Cup final will be watched in every home, hut and haunt in the world. Nobody on my street will turn it on. I dare say the same will be true in your neighborhood. You could add up the sum total of people who watched the USA's five matches in Alabama and not be able to fill up half the end zone at Jordan-Hare Stadium. <br><br>I suffered through the Women's World Cup three years ago and the only thing I remember was Brandi Chastain ripping off her shirt. No, it wasn't that exciting, but it beat the two hours of actual competition. <br><br>We were told the U.S. women's win was supposed to change how we view soccer. But it didn't change a thing, that is, other than the retail sales of sports bras at Wal-Mart. <br><br>Remember Bill Clinton afterward saying the game was &quot;the biggest sports event of the last decade.&quot; <br><br>Please. Of course, how would he know what was going on during the '90s since most his time was spent staring at the ceiling of the Oval Office while sitting behind his desk? <br><br>Friday morning, I flipped on the game between Germany and America at 6:25 a.m. Hey, I was curious. Mostly, I yawned between bites of raisin bran and swigs of juice. Eventually, I had to pop some Dramamine for dizziness. <br><br>Don't misunderstand me. I'm as patriotic as the next guy. I care when we're battling scum like Osama bin Laden or fighting refuse like Iraq. Though I was rooting for the USA, I'm beyond getting too worked up whether we beat the Germans in soccer. Not going to change my life any -- or yours. <br><br>Now, before some stuck-up, snooty, elitist soccer fan (are there really other kinds?) writes or calls in and says: &quot;Hey, idiot, you don't know what you're talking about. You've probably never been to a soccer game.&quot; <br><br>I have been to plenty of soccer games. For what it's worth, I spent five years one week covering soccer in Birmingham. In 1996, some pinhead thought it would be a good idea to bid for the Olym pic soccer venue at Legion Field. I covered something like 28 games in seven days, and the only time in my life I've ever felt sicker was right after surgery for an appendectomy. <br><br>I found soccer players as a general rule -- and they came all over the world since this was the Olympics -- to be revolting, rowdy and not on particularly good terms with the words bath or shower. <br><br>I say this not because of anything I saw on the field or afterward. This was a result of being around them for the weeks leading up to the event at the Olympic Village, having eaten several meals at the same table or close by. <br><br>So enjoy the sport if you want. Make whatever out of it you choose. But I'm going to rely on America's most famous athlete to sum up my feelings for this game. Last week, Tiger Woods was asked by a European reporter if he had been following the action and had any favorite players in the World Cup. <br><br>Woods had a blank stare. Finally, the great golfer said: &quot;You've got the wrong country.&quot; <br><br>Soccer is a great sport for little kids to play and their doting parents to watch. But it's like everything else. Most of us eventually grow up. We put the little ball down and get on with our lives, leaving the silliness of soccer behind. <br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uanterakayonaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnterakAyonaeRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/25/02 2:41:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1541.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://membres.lycos.fr/selmagor/hpbimg/banana1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Change the game name to zzzoccer </span><hr size=1> First this guy is using "soccer" instead of "football", and second if you don't like the game, you can find plenty of arguments to say "boo it's boring" and whatever bad things about it.<br>Will I look smarter if I say "american football" is boring ?

And more importantly, what sports are promoted by our media.  It also had to do with the number of sports availible to us to watch and/or participate in.  If you haven't grown up watching a sport, especially on TV, you won't probably watch it when you are an adult.<br><br>Soccer (American Football :') will never make it internationally because it can't be played by EVERY country.  You don't need any special equipment, or have to be a freaking giant to play it. The Japanese go to the Tokyo Bowl (the pre-sean American football game played in Japan) because of the spectacle, not out of ANY love for the game.  NFL Europe is just plain funny...<br><br><br>My 2 cents..ok maybe 10 cents,<br><br>Ail <p>"For he who shall, so shall he who"<BR> - Puke&Snot</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uailwon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ailwon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/25/02 5:00:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1541.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Change the game name to zzzoccer </span><hr size=1> Umm..<br><br>Hello Kahla...wake up..<br><br>Soccer is getting more popular in America!!!<br><br>The Women's wolrd cup match was tremendously popular and watched, more people watched this world cup than the one that was here!!!, more colleges have teams than ever before, the MLS is stronger than any previous US Pro Soccer league (and outdraws the NBA in my city...by a comfortable margin... but thaen some local High School Football games outdraw the Nugglets), moer kids play soccer than any other sport (and way, way, way, more than when I was playin'.<br><br>Is it going to move Football, Basketball, Hockey, or Baseball out of the lime light...ummm no!!

Soccer isn't the greatest sport out there, but it sure as hell beats baseball, golf, auto-racing, and basketball for my own enjoyment.  Though, as in auto-racing, it's most exciting when something goes horribly wrong (car wreck or fan-atics' riots).  Since hockey is over and football has yet to begin, soccer is a decent alternative.  <br><br>But dammit, 2-7am is NOT prime time viewing hours for me.<br><br>Is soccer getting bigger in the US?  A bit.  But soccer players don't make a million dollars a year, so it will lag out of the media spotlight unlike the established sports.  But with luck, baseball will completely collapse upon its own steroid boosted greed and soccer will come to the fore.
