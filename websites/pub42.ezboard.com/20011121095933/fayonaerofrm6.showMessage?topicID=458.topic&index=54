I guess maybe Gimp was the wrong phrase. Because you are right, it is fast respawn. although the did lower the level of many mobs there. The sad part is that it drew the huddled masses and yes they train like hell fight over mobs at the zone in etc. Also drew in the loot whores that will gank a mob cause it has phat l33wtz or what have you. People pulling through other camps, the list goes on. The kind of crap I would expect from so newby lvl 30 group in Runneye due to lack of experience and understanding of agro.<br>
Yet lo and behold... Idiots ganking mezzed mobs in hopes of ganking a kill. Hmm did not stop to think it would attack our enchanter. <br>
<br>
Also to whomever thought I meant outdoor zones create bad players. Here is the clue gun &lt;to quote blearchie&gt; That is not what I meant so I will spell it out. The people that always fight in this career path never get a clue. They fight where it is safe and will afford their bad play. They dont have to learn dungeon basics and can lvl through sheer time put in. <br>
<br>
To whomever thought it was boring before... ROFL... The zone was flat awesome before. Just no phat l33wtz for ya. I guess if a real dungeon crawl is boring, just stay with the rest of the huddled masses to ensure you can get a drag and a rez.<br>
<br>
Oh well have fun. <br>

I asked if it was ok if we killed some bigbirds to make our walk a bit easier and that it would take about 5 min tops to do this. He replied sure sure take ur time.<br>
We did what we came for while they stopped pulling for a minute to have us do our job.<br>
We moved on..<br>

Lots of churn and little progress.  I'll state things simply:<br>
<br>
1.  I really like new Chardok.  It not only gives me a third option on those nights when I only have 3 hours to play (what other game can you think of when 3 hours is a SHORT playing stint) I might be able to grab a pickup group and head in short or deep depending on the guestimated skill level of those present, but its also a fabulous raid type zone where a small guild like mine can take 2-3 groups, trash it from front to near the back if not all the way, and maybe get some nice gear upgrades along the way.<br>
<br>
2.  There still remains a lot of raid/crawl zones out there, they've been listed before.   I'm sure if HS gets a comparable upgrade we'll hear howls about how its ruined because folks actually want to go there, too.  =(  On the other hand, I KINDA sypathize about this, because my guild/friends are also the kind of people who go where the crowds arent....  <br>
<br>
3.  I'll agree with you that there are a LOT of players 50+ who dont play their class very well, understand game mechanics, or listen to instructions that will save their group or an entire raid.  Thats a fact that we live with.  <br>
<br>
However, I think the REAL argument here comes down to a confusion between SKILL, and PREPARATION.  I think a lot of it has to do with guild size too.   <br>
<br>
Many players simply dont have the time to prepare adequately in advance so that a well rounded group will be preassembled in place in order to enjoy a zone for as long as possble while they are on line.  You cant really cry about it, its simply a matter of fact, that is one of the disadvantages to being in a smaller guild, you have to look for opportunities to prepare ahead of time to organize as many people as you can, you have to look for areas that arent heavily populated, or you join in with the lowest common denominator and deal with the skillset you get in the pickup group.<br>
<br>
Thing is, those players who do (and I'd characterize them as typically those in larger guilds who pretty much have 30 or so, or many more, players on a night) have that LUXURY of a guaranteed well formed group tend to espouse themselves as more skilled players.  <br>
<br>
The problem is that many people assume that just because you arent prepared to fight every night that you somehow lack skill or arent willing to go adventure in dangerous places.  The converse is true as well of course.  Those who have the backup of larger guilds arent necessarily any good at single group tactics, and the fact that they can go deeper in dungeons because of larger expeditionary forces hardly makes them any more skilled.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm willing to roll with the punches and take improvements as they come.  Even if the improvements dont affect me personally (like say, the Runny eye upgrades), I can still be pleased that they will make things more fun for those that follow on in this game behind me.  As I said in my above post, cursing the changes that make things more rewarding to those that get to the zone after you do really seems like sour grapes to me.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  New Chardok gooooood!<br>

I think the title of this should have read Welcome to Sebilis 3, err, I mean Chardok...<br>
<br>
Yep I read all your first post, and agree with everything you wrote there.  Read as many of the other posts as I could fight my way through to get here.<br>
<br>
To a certain degree you are all right, and your all arguing semantics.  The idiots training in Chardok are the same ones who have spent their game careers training Crushbone, Blackburrow, Paw, KC and every other place they &quot;thought&quot; they should be high enough to go (which is usually 10 levels below where they should be).  Thankfully these people usually either get tired of constantly dying, or find somewhere else to level and level out of range.<br>
<br>
Chardok deeper in is very nice for both drops and experience.  If you can get past the trains.  Camping the exit is really no longer an option because everyone trains everything to the exit ramp now.  And as most, who honestly do know what they are doing know, the mobs will be coming back.<br>
<br>
Blearchie you are right and give it enough time for the idiots to get tired of it and go off to their other games (DAoC comes to mind) and those of us who honestly like the game will be able to play again.  Think if you give it some time to settle down hon, and get a decent group to head deeper in, you might actually like the zone.  It really does test you more than most I have seen.  It reminds me more of Sebilis now that Velks and Chardok have taken more people away from it.  *shrug* but then again what do I know.  I didnt go to KC, Sebilis, or Velks before I was 50+.<br>
<br>
To be honest with the mixture of Live and Undead this dungeon has actually become more one that you HAVE to crawl.  You can no longer just invis to get to the area you want and then start fighting.  As Final Destiny found out when they went to get the Queen.  You have to kill everything in your path and just keep killing.  You also cannot pause long because they have lowered the respawn rate dramatically.  There are also now traps that werent there before.<br>
<br>
Seems to me, to be more of a challenge then ever before if you can get past the idiots who havent a clue how to fight in a dungeon that actually requires people to know what they are doing, and thus constantly train the exit.  I just thank god most of those idiots havent enough talent to get very far in. <p><b><i><h9>Febreeza Tinytank - Level  56  Myrmidon<BR>
