Uhm, that's the core of the problem, isn't it. You like the country you live in, huh?<br>
<br>
Well, other people tend to like their countries too. Is is so strange they get a bit hostile when a few americans give them the &quot;I'm the biggest &amp; the best&quot; crap?<br>
<br>
This little flamewar started with some american moron saying that europeans have nothing to be thankful for, in response to a post that wasn't flaming Thanksgiving or America at all, but simply stating that european countries doesn't have this particular holiday.<br>
<br>
I prefer Sweden over USA. I assume that most swedes do, and that most USA citizens prefer USA. Nothing strange about that. I think you summed it up quite nicely, and showed why it's just selfimportant assholishness to demand that people who don't share your nationality should take a submissive attitude to you.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I think our two countries are among the WORST in that regard. Both USA and Sweden as countries have strong tendencies to regard themselves as manifestations of goodness that everyone should bow to. And it sucks. I am tired of hearing politicians and overeager patriots pat themselves on the backs.<br>
<br>
Also, L2 is right that USA is the hub of western culture. That does however NOT mean that the rest of the western world imitate USA. Hub and source is not the same thing.<br>
<br>
Finally, what country you live in is NOT the biggest factor in if you live a good life or not. Your chances are best if you grow up in a resonably wealthy and nice family in the free world. Sweden, England, USA, Australia or Japan are minor differences in that regard. In all these countries you are reasonably free from oppression, and there is always some social security net if you fall upon hard times. Just be happy you didn't grow up on the streets of Kabul or Calcutta. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

And american football?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?<br>
You strap on a tonn of pads and helments JUST TO PLAY RUGBY!!! Yes, rugby. The sport that was born a long time before 'american football', that requires no external protection, and no blonde bimbo's (tm) with Pom Pom's who cheer at the sideline while everyone else in the audience gets high and eats mcdonalds.<br>
EVERY other sane and civil western civilization abolished death pentalties, but you guys ENCOURAGE THEM. Kill people, who kill people = justice.<br>
Am I missing something here???? You punish someone, for doing the exact thing you do to them? And don't even talk justice to me, your great president Bush has put more ppl on death row than anyone, and wait for it, it gets funnier, 94% of which were of the black community.<br>
Oh, racism. Don't even start me. And pollution/crime/drug rates?!?! You guys sure are the capital of the world, in disgust. Your presidents decieve you, your economy rapes you, your neighbours rob and stab you. You guys INVENTED gangs. There are neighbour hoods you can't even DRIVE THROUGH.<br>
Don't give me the 'we're the best crap', because you can shuve it up your ass. I'm sick of this American mentality that you guys keep spewing on this board lately. You are brainwashed from birth, what with your stupid swearing of allegience and your bullshit freedome speaches.<br>

Britain has one<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  One hundred fifty years ago in the late summer of 1845 one of the greatest human ecological disasters in the history of the world began in Ireland. A fungus from North America established itself in Ireland and commenced to destroy the potato crop. When the fungus had run its course at least 1 1/1 million, possibly as many as 2 million, Irish had died and another 1 1/2 million had emigrated. No one can fully capture in words the magnitude or the intensity of the suffering and hardship endured by the Irish people from 1845-1850. <br>
<br>
The potato failure of the mid to late 1840's has been variably referred to as &quot;The Great Hunger&quot;,&quot;The Great Famine&quot; and &quot;The Great Starvation.&quot; One's choice of words to describe this colossal human tragedy is often determined by political ideology or personal agenda. Irish landowners referred to the time period as that of &quot;The Great Hunger.&quot; Most of these landowners were absentee and did not experience first hand the ravages of the potato blight. They, unlike their tenants, were not dependent on the potato for their survival. While potatoes rotted in the fields, landowners continued to eat a varied diet. <br>
<br>
The British call it &quot;The Great Famine.&quot; The scarcity of food was blamed on the weather, the potato fungus and, perhaps, most of all on the Malthusian notion of overpopulation. The Irish had overbred and there wasn't enough food to feed them all given the crop failure. However, as Frank O'Connor once observed, &quot;Famine is a useful word when you do not wish to use words like 'genocide' and 'extermination.'&quot; <br>
<br>
These latter terms are philosophically embodied in &quot;The Great Starvation,&quot; which is a more realistic way to refer to the time period when Irish peasants starved in the midst of plenty, Wheat, oats, barley, butter, eggs, beef and pork were exported from Ireland in large quantities during the so-called &quot;famine.&quot; In fact, eight ships left Ireland daily carrying these many foodstuffs. Starvation among the peasants is blamed on a colonial system that made them dependent on the potato in the first place. Racist insensitivity toward the plight of the starving masses also played a major role in the death and large-scale emigration which marked this time. The British failed to take swift and comprehensive action in the force of Ireland's disaster. <br>
<br>
In 1861 in The Last Conquest of Ireland, John Mitchel wrote: &quot;The Almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the English created the famine,&quot; Mitchell further observed that &quot;a million and half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English government. The died of hunger in the midst of abundance which their own hands created.&quot; <br>
<br>
Such sentiment expressed by an Irishman who witnessed the horrors inflicted upon his countrymen will always linger, refuting revisionist attempts to obscure reality. <br>
<br>
In recent years there has been an effort among Tory revisionists to soften the trauma of the period and downplay the role of the British. This is especially evident in the tendency to reduce the estimates of the number of deaths related to the starvation. Most of these apologists have suggested there were much less than a million deaths, while some estimates go as low as 250,000. Even these incorrect estimates are appalling given that they occurred only a short distance from the heart of the most powerful and wealthy empire the world has ever known. We suppose that such an approach is an attempt to lessen the blame that should be placed upon the British or insome sense to veil the magnitude of the tragedy. <br>
<br>
These same apologist feel that there was nothing that any government could have done to ameliorate the situation. The poor British tried, but were simply overwhelmed by the logistics of the operation. In their view the starvation was the inevitable outcome of demography and the prevalent economic theory of the day. <br>
<br>
It would appear that one of the major purposes of Irish revisionism is to undermine the basis of Irish nationalism and leave Ireland without heroes or historical memory. It also plays down the British responsibility for the catastrophic aspects of the Irish experience. Though they alternately whimper or crow about their quest for detached truth, Anglo-Irish revisionists attempt to present sociopolitical propaganda under the guise of scholarly writing. They choose to forget that British rule in Ireland was guided by the rope and the bayonet. <br>
<br>
British apologists would do well to ponder the words of the great British writer William Makepiece Thackeray who characterized British colonialism in Ireland as follows: &quot;...It is a frigthful document against ourselves...one of the most melancholy stories in the whole world of insolence, rapine, brutal, endless slaughter and persecution on the part of the English master,...There is no crime ever invented by eastern or western barbarians, no torture or Roman persecution or Spanish Inquisition, no tyranny of Nero or Alva but can be matched in the history of England in Ireland.&quot; <br>
<br>
It is time for us to stop using the euphemism &quot;Irish potato famine&quot; for two reasons. First, it is wrong because there was no shortage of food in Ireland. Secondly, it was not simply an &quot;Irish famine&quot; but a starvation based on systematic British exploitation of the Irish people, inaction in the face of the potato crop failure, and a vindictive, racist attitude toward the Irish. <br>
<br>
The events of 1845-1850 were truly a holocaust. Indeed in 1904 Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish Land League called it a holocaust. It is not something for the Irish and Irish Americans to forget. Why is it that we are told to stop living in the past or that we have too long a memory? Would anyone ask Jews to forget the Nazi atrocities against their people? Should Native Americans forget the massacres at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee? Would we suggest that African Americans forget the horrors of the middle passage? How can we learn from the past if we are ignorant of its successes, failures, an abominations? <br>
<br>
In the words of the Irish patriot labor leader James Connolly, &quot;The English administration of Ireland during the famine was a colossal crime against the human race.&quot; We should not forget our holocaust orchestrated by English imperialists and we should not let the world forget. In August 1989, during an address on Grosse Ile, Canada, Dr. Edward J. Brennan, Ireland's ambassador to Canada, noted: &quot;The Great Famine was Ireland's holocaust (which) condemned the Irish to be the first boat people of modern Europe.&quot; <br>
<br>
None of us can truly understand the nature of their privations, but we all can take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of those who died and the courage of those who survived. May their ghosts know that we still care. Let us not dare to forget the terrible death and suffering that occurred between 1845 and 1850. In fact we should indelibly fix it in our personal and collective memory for we are our ancestors. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A Brief History of the Mafia <br>
The Mafia is a secret criminal organization that wields great economic and political control over large segments of Sicilian society and operates both criminal and legitimate enterprises in the United States. It is believed to have originated during Sicily's late Middle Ages, beginning as separate bands of strong-arm enforcers hired by local landowners. It eventually evolved into a network of autonomous groups governing in rural areas, ruling a peasantry that received little effective government from a succession of distant, often foreign, royal rulers. <br>
In its present form, the Mafia is a loose alliance of many small local groups, each bound by kinship (or a kinship relationship that is assumed when a man becomes a member) and by the Mafia code of omerta, which requires absolute silence about Mafia activities and absolute obedience to the hierarchical Mafia authority. Until recent years--and despite the efforts of the Italian Fascists to destroy the organization in the 1920s and '30s--the Mafia flourished in the Sicilian countryside. When the Fascists fled Sicily during the Allied invasion of World War II, the Mafia--the only remaining governing structure--worked closely with U.S. forces. Today it dominates much of the business and industry in Sicily's cities. <br>
<br>
With the Sicilian immigrations of the late 19th century, the Mafia began to operate in several large U.S. cities. Two of the strongest mafia gangs in New York where controlled by Joe &quot;The Boss&quot; Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. They were known as the &quot;Mustache Petes&quot;. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> According to her murderer's confession, Cary Ann Medlin's last words to him were: &quot;JESUS LOVES YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cary Ann was an average 8 year old little girl.  Brown hair framed her sweet face, and big brown eyes enhanced her constant, glowing smile.  This darling won the hearts of any who crossed her path with her soft-spoken ways and zest for life.  Cary attended Sunday School at the First Baptist Church in Greenfield, Tennessee.  She learned at an early age about the love of her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  <br>
Her favorite color was pink.  She loved country music, and often pranced around the house singing, &quot;Turn Your Radio On&quot;.  She loved to swim and ride her bike.  She took ballet and wore her pink tutu in her first recital.  Her favorite cartoon was &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; and she had a huge stuffed Pink Panther on her bed.  She loved being barefooted and hated shoes!  She sucked her thumb until she was almost 2 years old.  She was a carefree little girl that loved life, and lived it with passion.  She couldn't understand why people sometimes lied.  Cary loved everyone she ever met and lent a hand anywhere she could...even to a total stranger....<br>
<br>
On September 1, 1979, Cary and her step-brother were riding bikes in the neighborhood.  A friendly man in an old car pulled up beside her.  He seemed to know her father and he persuaded Cary to show him where she lived. <br>
She parked her bike in front of a nearby church and climbed into the car.  That was the last time Cary was seen alive.  <br>
As soon as Cary was reported missing, the entire community went into action.  Scores of volunteers combed the nearby areas searching for her and the suspect vehicle. The next day, the family's worst fears were confirmed when Cary's body was found at the end of a field road on the outskirts of town.  Soon after, a family member of Robert Glen Coe reported suspicions of him to the police.  He was consequently arrested and charged with the kidnapping, rape and murder of Cary Ann.  <br>
Most of the confession was a nightmare for the family.  There was, however, one part of the Coe's testimony that stood out.  It was that something that told Cary's loved ones that the Lord had taken care of her, even to the end.  Just prior to ending the misery of this poor defenseless angel, Coe said she looked up at him with trusting eyes and said, &quot;Jesus loves you.&quot;  Even Coe choked back tears telling this part of his confession.  <br>
<br>
Coe was brought to trial and found guilty in 1981. He was sentenced to two life sentences for the kidnapping and rape.  He was given the death penalty for murder.  <br>
For 21 years this case languished through the judicial system.  To the family's horror it landed on the desk of Judge John Nixon in the Middle District of the Federal Courts in Tennessee.  Judge Nixon had a reputation of overturning death sentences.  He did not disappoint.  Cary's mom, Charlotte Stout, went to Washington, D.C. and testified about Judge Nixon's actions to the Subcommittee for Courts and Intellectual Properties (a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee) in 1997.  (see link)<br>
Judge Nixon was not impeached, however he semi-retired in 1997.   He still receives his full salary and still hears a 60% case load.  To our knowledge, he has not received another capital punishment case.  <br>
After 21 years of trial and appeals, Robert Glen Coe was executed on April 19, 2000.  It was the first execution in the State of Tennessee in 40 years and the first lethal injection, ever.  Cary's family watched the execution from an adjoining room.  Much to their sadness, Coe did not apologize before his death.  <br>
Finally, 6 months before what would have been her 30th birthday, Cary rested in peace. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Soccer, as you call football, is by far the most popular sport in the world. Baseball is an american thing.<br>
A majority of the population on this planet would consider Mecca or Jerusalem to be the center of the world. New York is an amercian thing.<br>
<br>
Your viewpoint Lleauaric, is very american. So of course you are a patriot. One has to look outside the borders to see the world.<br>

While other nations or regions may be more populated, they have no influence.  This is mainly because they have no contact with the rest of world, they live in poverty, or in Cultural Isolation from leaders who are afraid of any words besides thier own.<br>

There can be no argument that the center of the Western World is NYC, and therefore the central location of this age.<br>

being a apologist makes you popular I guess.<br>
<br>
I have no hatred for anyone..  but Ill be damned if Im gonna let anyone take potshots at America<br>
<br>
Why does Vietnam have &quot;Influence&quot;, it doesnt, its a backwater asian country struggling to pull it self out of the mess of Socialism/Communism<br>
<br>
Iraq isnt Influential..  Its a nation of people ruled by a despot, thats ostrasized from the world community<br>
<br>
Israel.  Hmm..  an interesting place and people, and yes inflential, to a certain extent..yet More like a Western Nation displaced in the Middle-East<br>
<br>
Pre-Prestroika Soviet Union.  An Illusion.  The Soviet Union lasted 80 years.  It Crumbled in trying to keep pace with the Western World.  America in Particular.  Was it influential?  Sure.  But it was a hoax, communism was a scam, a failed dream and a excuse for dictators<br>
