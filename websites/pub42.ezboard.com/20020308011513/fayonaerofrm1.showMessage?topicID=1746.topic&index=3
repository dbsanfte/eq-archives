Nope. Monks. Warriors gets the highest AC on items tho'.<br>

That would be... holyforge? Crits against undeads? Warriors gets crits against everything you know... so do most classes nowadays anyways.<br>

Well. If you count bards and rangers amongst those hybrids I would call you daft. Paladin buffs are quite nice (especially when you lack a cleric) but so are bard songs and the ranger spells Call of the Predator, Call of Earth and Strength of Nature (not to mention the rest). Divine Strength being a great buff however really helps the paladin class.<br>
SKs also have quite a nice buff now, but I seem to be the only one really digging it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lastly lay of hands is an instant complete heal<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well. I'll reply to this one in this fashion... if LoH is a complete heal, how come they have an AA skill that makes it one? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you want a lot of defense with some offence, a paladin is a good class to pick. For the other way around, maybe try a shadowknight or ranger.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Shadowknights share the offensive and defensive caps Paladins do. That would in essence make them just as defensive or offensive as paladins. However the Shadowknight spells being more offensive would place them on the offensive part of the defensive scales. You know... the whole thing with defensive knights(PAL SHD) and offensive hybrids (RNG BST). Let me tell you one thing... if you pick a Shadowknight with the hopes of doing damage, you're way out on the left field. Rangers, Beatlords, Monks and Rogues deal the damage in this game.<br>
In fact, I'd not be afraid to claim tha the ranger is the most offensive class in this game. Sure, we tank stuff occasionally. But that part is so grossly diminished when looking at our offensive skills.<br>
Whereas rogues and monks deal more damage than rangers, they also have more AC and defensive skills as well. Thus not tipping the &quot;scales&quot; of defense and offense as much as a ranger does. Which of course as we all know makes rangers fragile little packages of utility damage.<br>
<br>
All in all... I'd say you went off the deep end with that reply. If such a novice on paladins as I can take a quick look at the post and realize you're wrong in pretty much every word...<br>
Well.<br>
<br>
As for what I think of Paladins... A well played paladin is welcome in most groups. They can offer buffs when no cleric is around as well as quite decent tankage. In fact with the current AA system, a paladin who picks and chooses his skills wisely can rival warriors as tanks  in the regular group. Raids are another matter tho'.<br>
The combination of stuns (call it the paladin trademark just as the ranger's snare/roots and the shadowknights lifetaps) make them ideal to lock down gaters in most dungeons. Their LoH is a lifesaver in many situations, altho' many crappy paladins prefer to keep it to save themselves. Which in the end only hurts the group.<br>
<br>
If a warrior is medium offense and medium defense (the norm) you would find a paladin to be low offense and medium defense. With a buttload of mana to throw on heals (very good heals at that), stuns, root, buffs and much more. A defensive utility class in short. Brings to the group for defense what a ranger brings in offense.<br>
<br>
In the end however no paladin (or SK or ranger for that matter) can escape the 'optimized idiot equation'. Where people say Warrior for tankage, cleric for heals, enchanter for mez, rogue for damage and shaman for slow. Then again, those people rarely know how to play the game anyway.<br>
Best exp I've seen in this game still revolves around my old 4 ranger 1 bard 1 paladin team <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
till then our healing is never enough or it just takes too damn long to cast<br>
<br>
our buffs are ok, but most are quite useless....yaulp series while a nice concept has too short of a lasting time and just isnt worth the effort to keep it up imo....some will disagree<br>
<br>
as far as 'fun' goes, i think you've be better off with a convenience class before 60....once you hit 60 though paladins are extremely fun and cool to play, something with sow, or gate pre-50 would be good....makes it easy to enjoy the game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45274 " target="_blank">

IMO the &quot;key&quot; level for a Paladin is 59 because that's the level they get Celestial Cleansing, and Ressurection. At 60, we become buff whores due to Divine Strength.<br>
<br>
As for Paladins as a class, it really depends on how you want to play one. If you bring a Paladin to a raid, you have to have a certain mentality, or else you'll just be unhappy. Tanking is usually left to Warriors, damage output isn't that great, and most spells are useless. That being said, you won't be the &quot;star player&quot; of the raid, so to speak, but you do contribute to the &quot;little&quot; things - like topping off your group's HP for example. Then again, at 58/59, a Paladin does become an effective backup healer for the group.<br>
<br>
Paladins really shine in groups though. They're tied with SKs as second best tanking class in the game, and very versatile as well. Stuns, heals, some limited crowd control, etc.<br>
<br>
On top of that, there are certain roleplay elements that may make the class fun for you. Personally, I think it's great being able to fight your way down somewhere to help CR someone - the whole &quot;macho dude&quot; saving the day is amusing to say the least.<br>
<br>
To sum it up, I guess if you're a powergamer, you would probably be better off as a full blown cleric or warrior. If you want to play for fun, try it out and see for yourself how you like it. Recommendations won't do you as much good as first hand experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1746.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1746.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1746.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1746.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.threadControl?topicID=1746.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1746.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1746.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1>General Forum</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
