Lierre hit upon the one thing I was going to mention.  Caps Lock doesn't work in EQ (or at least not on the EQ I run).  How someone could type with a finger always on a Shift key is boggling, though I have no doubt it's possibe to train yourself to always type that way.<br>
<br>
One small correction, Livtinth.  The boats from FP from/to BB run in 20 min (or so) cycles.  If you just miss the boat, you could wait nearly 40 min just to get to FP/BB.  Having said that, I don't have a problem taking the boats at all.  I've run around Norrath for a long time and will continue to do so.  It may be a pain, but it's something I can control.<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad for encouraging/forcing the person to have patience.  It teaches lessons very useful throughout ones EQ career. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

But this may basically be because I was just playing for around 1 month yet before the split. So I spent most of my time on that server. <br>
<br>
The beggars are one bad bunch of lamers, sorry for my language but really...<br>
I have seen a guy that was in West Freeport a whole evening, just begging. I was there with my Guild outside at Ping Fizzlecutter. He came to use and begged EVERYONE. Once he got told to leave he just sent tells to all of us. <br>
One day later he was still at gate begging...<br>
And now listen good, 1 week later he was still there, begging of course, JUST begging. And yesterday, 3 weeks after that, I passed the gate and got a message *Loeb tells you: Hey can you give me money?*.<br>
He is there since a month or so, still lvl3 (!!) and of course wearing banded and stuff. I do not thin begging brings you anything since you lose time doing so instead of lvling (besides the fact that I disguise beggars and greedy ppl!).<br>
<br>
If you EVER meet Loeb. Please do whatever you can, charm him or bind him in Sebilis and kill him or whatever but make him stop (or at least make him female ;)). I offer 10pp (I am no beggar, so I don't have much money) for the one that bans him at least outta FP and EC.<br>
<br>
Now that we just talk about our Server, do you also have huge connection problems recently?<br>
I have a STANDARD of 20-30% loss and a ping of 0 with my CABLE connection recently, normally I go LD around 8-10 times a day. At the tunnel i do never get under 90% loss. Same goes for my girl, same goes for my Guildies and I also have seen full groups instantly going LD. SO its not my ISP.<br>
I was wondering whether it is just me (and my friends) or whether you have that too (it really really makes me sick to keep going LD in fight, let people die because of this and also the fact I pay 200$ for my cable per month for nothing). Or just whether you know anything about this and maybe whether Verant will do something against this...<br>

<br>
taino, it´s not you, it´s not your isp, only god (and i´m not even religious ... hehe) knows what it is...<br>
<br>
i had these problems for over a week, but it kinda stopped last weekend or a bit earlier...i had nearly no LD´s the whole week, one or two occasionally, ok. i definately HAD huge packet loss on one evening, but after getting disconnected three times in a row all of the sudden all PL was gone...it might have been my isp too because i had had problems surfing sites the whole afternoon but some friends went LD too and had PL problems and they have quite different provider.<br>
<br>
so i´m ok at the moment, but i know many people still have these problems...on about all eq server, people from everywhere in the world...no it´s most certainly NOT your isp, but a router somewhere near verant. some people think it might be verants &quot;provider&quot; cerfnet (sp?) too, some think it´s a worldwide router problem, the reaons may be different but the resultat is the same: massive LD and PL problems.<br>
<br>
not everyone is experiencing this, but many people i know...and verant is saying NOTHING about this all. not on the chat server when just 500 people got dropped from the server, not on the official boards, nothing. no statement at all, as far as i know. you can just hope.<br>
<br>

<br>
Just one more addition to this.<br>
I used to Petition this problem (as I and my girl and a friend went LD 27 times in one hour, yeah I don't lie).<br>
I sent tells to Guides and even GMs. They all said its NOT a Verant problem. After ahving told em I know like a bit about internet and they should stop fooling me now (hehe.. I was very polite thou) they said its a Router, just what you said.<br>
<br>
But what I do not get is that if this is Verants Provider and Verant REALLY DOES know about those huge problems since I am not the only one petitioning and mouthing, why do they not do EVERYTHING to solve this?<br>
<br>
mAny evenings have been completely wasted by PL and LDs... and I am one out of many. I don't get that.<br>
<br>
But as we all know, shared pain is half the pain =)<br>

please don´t ask me. i´m as upset about that as you are. and many others.<br>
<br>
even the GMs (and OPS) on the chatserver (where everyone seems to go first when he just got dropped LD the same time as numerous times on the evenings before) won´t say ANYTHING except an occasional &quot;we are looking into it&quot; or even &quot;it must be on your end&quot; (yeah sure, players all over the world and from all servers...yeah...). no official statement at all, and i know that the problems are still there for some people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383836><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/16/01 8:59:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do we feel at home at this new server?</span><hr size=1> > If you EVER meet Loeb.

But I must say I hate beggars. It just gets on my nerves because I'm out there fighting and trying desperately to earn a living. Two of your comments really struck a nerve with me...<br>
<br>
<br>
"Informed him that when people have really nice armor like this it usually means they are broke cause they spent all their money on their really nice armor."<br>
<br>
<br>
I just finished my ivy etched leggings quest last night (after almost 35 hours of camping Wiltin in OOT) and so there goes 200pp worth of bribes to get the NPC to accept the Quiver of Kithicor. I am now almost in full ivy (minus gloves) - I earned all my gear the hard way (with help from others, of course) and would not deny that feeling of pride to anyone else. <br>
<br>
<br>
"If I find someone getting ragged because they are actually trying to play the way the game was intended--from scratch, no twinking."<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm usually the one getting ragged on. Every time I start a newbie, I get the character *at least* to level 6 before I even consider passing any upgraded gear down. I've been picked on for having a level 5 wizard who couldn't even afford buying the rest of the level 1 spells. I've been picked on for being a level 9 warrior *still* wearing a full suit of tattered / patchwork armor (and that character had to make all the armor - tried for 3 real life days to get someone to make the armor for me, then gave up and started to train tailoring). And I was once a level 4 shadowknight wearing half a suit of tattered armor, getting KSed in Freeport by a level 2 dwarf with full crafted and a blade of xalgoz. Ugh, and it gets real annoying to have someone in their 50s walk up to me (the level 9 warrior in tattered, for example), inspect, and then start yelling at me because I'm not wearing bronze / crafted / cobalt / etc. Sorry beggars and twinkers, but I don't have 200k pp in the bank like everyone else. I'm just another poor ranger trying to enjoy the game...<br>
<br>
As for the beggars, I don't even bother responding to them anymore. I give buffs and money only to those people who I feel deserve them. I once tried to give a tailored large bag (6 slots, .8 weight) to a level 2 wizard and he started getting mad at me because he wanted plat. Gee, I was just trying to be nice. I eventually found someone who was shocked and excited to get such a gift; and face it, a free 6 slot bag is awesome when you are level 2. A few weeks ago I heard a level 5 bard in Freeport trying to sell some bog juice she had just made. Everyone was laughing at her - probably for doing trade skills, for "wasting her money", who knows... She was actually and untwinked newbie trying to earn a living with some snake scales she earned on the battlefield. I paid her 10pp for that stack of bog juice just because I was soooo happy to see a newbie trying to earn a living. <br>
<br>
Another thing that annoys me is the attitude that I get when I need a teleport or a res.  When I was level 26, I was fighting things in Lake of Ill Omen and monsters just started to *warp* on top of me from out of nowhere.  I died quick.  Then I appear in Firiona Vie and there are lots of people standing around.  I try for ten minutes to get a sow for corpse retrieval.  Nobody wants to help.  I give up and run to Ill Omen.  I shout what happened and ask for a res.  A cleric shouts back "oh that sucks".  I gave up, looted my corpse, and retired my ranger for two solid weeks.  When I came out of retirement, I headed for Kelethin, where I saw a ranger shouting for help - he got killed by the dragoon in WC and needed a port and some help to get his corpse back.  30 minutes later (with 9 non-anon people who could port in the zone), I offered to pay 15pp to tag along on the port and offered to help him get his corpse back - so now all that was required was a little mana to port us over there.  No response.  I saw a 51 wizard sitting near us, so I politely asked him if he had the time to port us.  No response.  I can take "sorry, too busy right now" - but he gave NO response.  I will laugh if he ever asks me for anything.  We eventually got a port - from a friend's druid who was 3 zones away - but it took almost two hours.  The problem is that I get this attitude from lots of people - I ask very politely if they can spare the time and/or mana to help me and I get NO response in return.  Please people, learn to recognize the difference between people like me and dewd beggars.<br>
<br>
Albarath says, "Excuse me sir, I was wondering if you could spare some mana to sow me for a corpse retrieval??"<br>
Kewldewd_00 says, "sowplzkkthx"<br>
<br>
Um, if you can't tell which person deserves at least a response, then I guess I'm just alone in my thoughts again...<br>

<br>
This always puzzle me. People always talk about newbies being rude to highlevel'ers, it's very rare that someone talks about the other side.<br>
<br>
Yet, none of my highlevel/midlevel chars have ever encountered rude newbies. I have encountered a inpolite one once, he just walked up to me and said &quot;you give me money, ok&quot;. I simply responded with a &quot;/ponder&quot; emote, and he didn't argue. On the other hand, my newbie chars have many times been verbally assaulted by highlevel people. <br>
<br>
When Edeina need to get somewhere far I politely ask nearby druids and wizards for a port, and almost always get a polite yes or a polite no in return. I can't remember anyone who have been outright rude. When one of my newbies ask for the same ride in the same way I am often met with a big friendly &quot;Fack j00 n00b!&quot;<br>
<br>
Most interestingly, this ride is usually from a newbiezone (freeport) to another newbiezone in the other end of the world (paineel, great place to level even non-erudites) - a travel that Edeina could have survived on foot and boat althought it would have been somewhat dangerous and most importantly uncomfortable, but would have meant certain corpseloss for the newbie.<br>

It may help to aid the server, in the long run.....in a small way of course. When character enhancement is earned...that player appreciates what he has much more. <br>
<br>
Charity , however...is a great thing. A reward should not be asked for, but rather bestowed on one who deserves it. Those of us who beggars come to,who &quot;newbies&quot; come to.. are in a position to give to Norrath and help make this server more of a home for us. 10 pp given to the wrong person...<br>
<br>
It is too early yet to know if this server is like home. It's much like moving to a new city...going to a new school.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufebreeza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Febreeza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/18/01 9:43:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/febreeza?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do we feel at home at this new server?</span><hr size=1> Oh geez...

Said while standing in the midst of several obvious druids and or shamans:<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon me, could anyone perchance spare a SoW for a Corpse Retrieval please?&quot;<br>
<br>
Funny thing is I can usually get one, but then could be cause I am a obviously nekked female, and usually cute.  Ah well.  I'm guilty.<br>

Heh, glad you enjoyed my post...<br>
<br>
I just got SoW last night <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was hanging out near the bank in Firiona Vie for almost an hour giving SoWs to everyone who stood there and asked/yelled/shouted/begged for one. Everyone was very happy and thanked me, except for one who just ran around a little and left. Oh well, at least now when people ask me for a sow I can actually cast it on them. After 25 levels of &quot;sorry, I don't get that spell until level 39&quot;, it's nice to finally be able to stop trying to explain that druids don't get dual wield. /happy<br>
<br>
So anyway, just wanted to say that asking for SoWs and binds is not begging, so ask away. Unfortunately, I still have to explain that rangers don't get bind, but at least I can SoW now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
