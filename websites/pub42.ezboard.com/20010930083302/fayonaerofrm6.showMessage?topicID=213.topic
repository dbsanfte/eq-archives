When role playing goes bad...*shiver* <br>
<br>
Treasure, and Everquest players who need it. How do you get treasure? Do your eyes widen, as a warrior, when the Enchanter robe drops? Do you, the enchanter see the warrior sword as a means to obtian your robe? Should the Tranquil Staff go to your twink? Or the monk in your group? Why should you support need before greed, when you know Gonzar the member of Hogan's Heroes guild has twice had groups give him a fungus tunic and sell it to get more again and again? I mean, after all. How will your level 30 monk ever get a fungus tunic if you keep letting Gonzars loot? It's not like you can tell a Gonzar from your average Everquest player. <br>
<br>
The most popular excuse I see as to why need before greed wouldn't work is the &quot;Player lottos on item, merely because it has value, he informs the group that he needs the item, but he only has dollar signs in his eyes for how much he can get in trade for it&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, again and again....Need before Greed, gifting those who deserve the item or can equip as an enhancement does not work........<br>
<br>
If you group with scum. (scum being the type of person you wouldn't take home to meet mom) If you group with anyone because you just want exp and you are an easy going person..you will probably be lied too, or cheated. Their are hints, during the group, and during raids (when you're among strangers) that tell you &quot;I need to get the hell out of here&quot;. Go with your intuition, if you do believe in rewarding the deserving and needy....go with your intution, disband and leave. If you do get screwed over in this way, remember that name, let everyone know the name as well. Make it harder for that character to get groups, to gain exp and follow you in levels. We all want to know who's hoarding loot on alts and saying &quot;hey...that's better than mine&quot;. We love to learn who sells their item, then makes it their goal to get into a need before greed group and re-obtain it. <br>
<br>
<br>
If you tolerate shady individuals, if you play under the assumption that &quot;well, he/she won't kill me, so I'll stick around&quot;. Expect to get screwed. If I didn't trust my group enough so that I was doing an all/all lotto on each item in group,( meaning I make this choice due to my mistrust of my group mates believability when they say &quot;i can use!&quot;).....what kind of group atmosphere is going on? Who are you playing Everquest with?<br>
<br>
I've practiced Need before Greed for as long as I can remember, and I don't recall being cheated once. The closest thing to that would be if say a player rolled on a phases spider carapace as an improvement and the next weekend obtained a plane of Growth breastplate. That player doesn't send the group that won his Phase Spider Carapace tells asking them each to re-lotto the item. This is a flaw that I escept, but that's because the only things in this game I value are things my character would use. I can't push morals onto that everquest player with the carapace, just as I can't make you see what I'm saying. Yeah you ! You still have your dice rattling in your cup, don't you? The only way you can get your level 35 monk a phase spider carapace is by random lotto! By all means keep that monk in your group down. You've got sellin' to do!!!!! Price check on..... <br>
<br>
I'm no merchant, however, I don't crave that item to be returned to me for a chance to roll dice just so I can twink or sell for platinum. <br>
<br>
I don't want your spells, I don't want your tolan's bracer. I didn't buy this game to sell pixels. I hunt for what I need....like...a cave man...does.. <br>
<br>
The statement about rogue courage was not meant to offend I am certain, we all know who drags the bodies when the Necromancer's asleep or solo'ing in skyfire. Shrug it off Ulric! <br>
<br>
I am all for being a harsher judge on your group, on who you spend your company with. You may get less exp if you choose not to group with that player you know has a happy loot trigger, but you also don't end up coming to the NAG board with a story to tell. <br>
<br>
(There are occasions when a group member has been invited and seeks an item that would go to another by need before greed type distribution. While this makes me ashamed and stamps the player as not to be invited again. That player is allowed to roll on that item and it becomes all/all lotto. Meanwhile, tells are shared between group mates that when we all roll the dice, those of us with honor who win hand the item to the one who needs. This often must be used for items that bare the label &quot;all/all&quot; but have stats that would influence individuals among the party more than others. I am not fooled by the all/all label,(many willingly fool themselves) the benefits of the stats offered are measured to fit the ones who can use the item best.)<br>
<br>
If there's one thing I hate, it's &quot;my twink would love that, what r numbers plz&quot;. I hope to see your name on the lfg list, with that attitude. Along with the players who cheat their groups out of items they really can't use with lies. You're both just as bad as the other, to me. <br>
<br>
Need before Greed works, and if you stick to it, you will surround yourself with players who trust and respect one another. If you arn't careful, you'll let the wrong person benefit. (we know this happens, because their are too many goons out there playing everquest who found people to help them get exp and they're looting, begging to loot, and making people upset)<br>
<br>
By the way, Once I joined a random between an entire group on an SMR long ago when I was a &quot;younger&quot; player. A wizard in the group had a much worse robe, but I randomed. Reason was, I thought it would get me a Ykesha.......<br>
<br>
I've since fixed what was wrong with me back then. I wish I could apologize to that wizard. I may have been able to change his perspective on loot as he advanced in the game with an act of generosity. I was wrong to lotto on that robe, I had no place doing so. <br>

<br>
First off, up till I was close to 60 I thought the same way.  It was great getting a pickup group and feeling like a &quot;guild&quot; type thing when something only 1 person could use, and it would go to them.  <br>
<br>
The fact is, everyone HATES to see something they can use go to someone that cant use it.  Especially an RBG or fungi Tunic.  <br>
<br>
Well, to burst your bubble Efal, everyone in everquest are equels unless they prove themselves otherwise, the class they chose has nothing to do with their allignment of what loot they may or may not lotto on.  <br>
<br>
On guild raids, YES give to those that will use, but in complete strangers, the enchanter helped every bit as much as the monk did, in getting the Fungi tunic to drop.  Same goes for a RBG.  <br>
<br>
Together they made it possible, together they spent their time, and Together they should have equal chance at the item they made available.  <br>
<br>
I cringed when you said that you saw how wrong you were when you tried to lotto on the SMR in hopes to trade for a Ykesha.  You did nothing wrong, trust me.  The caster gets what he wants if he wins, and you(who helped just as much) will get what you wants if you win(in a round about way).<br>
<br>
God made everyone equal, If I invest my time as a caster, in a tank populated area then i'll get equal exp, do my equal share, and get my equal chance at loot. <br>
<br>
If it was true that every class at the equal ammounts of drops at every camp, then yes i'd agree, nbf is good because in the end everyone will be equal.  But, as history shows, This isn't true at all.  Tanks like yourself and actually clerics like me in a lot of cases, make out with the most loot.  This is true, and I used to think it was right, but no longer.  Just because you Want it more doesn't give you anymore right to getting it first.  <br>
<br>
its late, bye.<br>

Very well said, I think the ideals you put down here speak of the depth of your honor.  <br>
<br>
I read posts like this and it really gives me reason to think about why I do what I do.  I admit I regret making some decisions when I'm counting my pp to buy something in ec and realize I'm woefully underfunded.  It's too bad those that do not share your viewpoint will likely not be swayed by your prose.  Human nature allows justification to rule, so no matter how much they want to believe they have honor, there will always be a reason why they'll gravitate toward the loot &quot;this time&quot; for &quot;this reason&quot;.  <br>

There is something you don't do in this game Efalin that a LOT of other people do and that is trade and barter.  I love to go to the auction and try to get better items with the spoils I've gotten during pickup groups.  I probably like doing this as much as you like joining a pickup group and adventuring with them.  If I was never to step foot into EC and trade items I might agree with your point of view, it would be the only way to gain items.  Instead I work for my items another way and I find it perfectly right as a caster to make a warrior roll on a cobalt bracer or a fungi tunic or a RBG. There is nothing to gain loot wise in these camps as a caster and like Dalten said an enchanter or cleric or whatever took part in the killing of the MOB just as much as a person that could use the item did.  <br>
<br>
It's not a crime to sell items, in fact, selling items in an intregal part of the game for a lot of people and accusing them of being greedy for wanting to gain better items is wrong.   <p>Zotreth Beion'Dhevel<br>

If they cannot answer these simple questions you should move on. If you dont like the loot system that is devised then move on. Groups I run are generally need before greed, but I dont turn down lotto groups either. What I do care about is that loot system is set prior to something dropping. I dont like people who try and change the loot rules when something drops they want a crack at. <br>
<br>
Are there greedy people that are not grouping with? Yes. So dont group with them. You do reserve the right to refuse the group. It has been my experience if the loot system is set from the beginning and followed that no matter how it ends up, you gain xp and have a good time. <br>

<br>
For one thing, I like to roleplay - even if in a pickup groups.<br>
<br>
My hobbies include wandering though zones, tracking people, giving them sow when I find them, then going invis or running off before they have a chance to even thank me; solo raiding deserted zones just to give the phat lewt away to non-begging low levels; and killing quest mobs just because.<br>
<br>
I see no point of depriving a warrior of a much needed sword or a caster of a great robe. It isn't going to make me a better ranger in either case, and I really don't want to sit around EC selling junk.<br>
