<br>
(my apologies to any Euros and others who don't get the above joke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I think the real problem is the use of the word 'good' as a catch-all, when what some of the posters are obviously talking about is status, stature, competence, reputation, etc.  I'd submit that what is a 'good' guild on the server depends on where one is standing, and what one values in the game.<br>
<br>
In my (very humble) opinion, Vision is a 'good' guild.  They have a tight guild structure, genuine respect for each other, and while they're not hitting the biggest targets in the game yet, they are tactically very sound and do a lot of impressive things.  Eternal Wrath is a 'good' guild, in that they pull off amazing feats, and since the departure of darkwind probably qualify for the 'uber' guild title (and have some nice people in guild too).  Mark of Honor is a 'good' guild, in that they have a wonderful family atmosphere, work very well together (and have a blast doing it), and get a lot of 'bang for the buck' out of their membership...<br>
<br>
And as for our little collection of flotsam... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What most of us value most is *learning and experiencing* the dynamics of the game (granted, average time playing EQ in our group is 10 months, so we are 'wet behind the ears' by most standards).  The way I look at it, if we powerlevelled up so that we could shop around for a hundred plus member guild so we could be a number in a raid on NToV (and thus qualify for membership in a 'good' guild by some of the standards set here), we'd only be cheating ourselves.  Sure, there are greater and more glorious ways to die than to get splatted in two rounds by a horde of frogs, but I'll be damned if I and my fellow-travellers are going to miss out on the thrill of learning how *not* to get splatted in two rounds by said frogs (almost anything can be solved with enough brute force, but how 'good' did you have to be to do it?  We hope and intend to push the 1-3 group format to its limits...)  If we get to the point where we can establish a toehold in Kael in the next month or so, I'll be *thrilled*, and meanwhile our shovels roxxor, thank you very much... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I would submit that our little operation is a 'good' guild, in that it serves the values and needs of its members, we are a mature and kind group of people who treat others on the server with respect, and we have a bangup time for our 9.95/month.  <br>
<br>
When I first rolled up a character on the server, and some well-meaning 'experienced' character came by and saw that I was a level 1 enchanter (who had already drowned twice in the past hour <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), he actively tried to convince me to reroll, that I would be happier as a mage or wizard.  'Enchanters are really weak', he said.  As he went on about how the other casting classes were better because (yada yada yada...), I was thinking, sign me up for the wimpage!  How much *can* you do with how little...<br>
and that is kind of the attitude I've taken regarding groups/guilds in the game in general.  Almost a year later I don't regret my choices for a moment. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  I greatly respect groups that have the combination of tactical skill and sufficient numbers to execute the high end raids in this game.  Do I want to see a part of that action?  Of course - but I wouldn't want to do the large group thing as a steady diet as it is too impersonal and chaotic for my tastes.  Dessert, maybe; but one man's meat is another man's indigestion...  And judging from the number of abysmally executed, zergling rush-and-wipe brute force raids I've already been privy to, there's a lot of indigestion out there along with the meat... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ugh, I can't believe I've 'contributed' (perhaps 'deposited' might be a better word) something to this thread.  Back to the salt mines, its time to do some field testing with my newest Jobaber...   <br>

I wanted to step away from hijacking the other thread, but I felt the conversation needed to be continued.<br>
<br>
I find it very interesting how some people look at the game.<br>
<br>
&quot;IMHO if you're hunting in Kael to get Thurgashit, you honestly cant be that good of a guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm.. great observation Kiradure.<br>
<br>
&quot;In my opinion, it's the people in the guild that make it good -- not the the numbers, levels, or time of existance&quot;<br>
<br>
Quite right, I agree %100 with this Furtivus.<br>
<br>
Palimax disagrees:<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh... It is my opinion that your opinion is wrong&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
My final observation on the vision tangent is this:<br>
<br>
You put up an incident for the population of the server to see your guild's laudable actions. Your post was worded poorly enough that even one your own officers agrees it could be seen as arrogant.<br>
<br>
I pointed out the fact that it looked arrogant, effectively raising a question about your guilds apparent lack of class.<br>
<br>
To argue my questioning of your guilds class in handling affairs several officers of vision, including you, their guildleader(For instance the first sentence of your first reply to me), and several of your friends come forth and toss around insults and flames like they were rice at a wedding. With the exception of Allamar, and at times, Membrayne.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell the above behavior validated my earlier opinions about your lack of class, for the most part.<br>
<br>
It wasn't ever about loot, so you can stop bringing that up.<br>
<br>
It was about *class*. Little word, lotta meaning.<br>
<br>
The end. <br>
<br>
Moving on.<br>
<br>
We have Arista saying:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry but everyone on this board needs to LEAVE LOGIX ALONE.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why? I'm not making crude comments about her gender or posting drivel about how hot she is. I am disagreeing with statements she makes. In those statements she directly attacts my guild and my intelligence, along with making some interesting broad generalities. <br>
<br>
Logix does not deserve special treatment because &quot;she is a girl&quot;.<br>
<br>
What I take away from reading her post is:<br>
<br>
a) I am inferior. If you could give an example of condescending tones in written(typed) form, that post would be a ringer for it.<br>
<br>
b) My guild is a midlevel guild without a clue, as all midlevel guilds are. We will never make it to HoT or even ever see a thurgadin BP. We haven't even been around very long.<br>
<br>
c) The value of a guild from her perspective lies in two things. What are they wearing and what level are they. If you  are not up to her standards of loot/level you are not a &quot;good&quot; guild.<br>
<br>
d) Anyone who doesn't have a roleplaying name in everquest is someone you can't expect &quot;high levels of thinking&quot; from.<br>
<br>
<br>
My responses:<br>
<br>
a) You can look down your nose at me if you wish. I am not impressed.<br>
<br>
b) My guild is not midlevel, as the vast majority of our players have one or more characters over 50. We are also far from clueless, and I seriously doubt the average level of your guildmembers also dictates their intelligence and ability to understand simple concepts, which is definately implied in her post:<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't impress myself. I believe that outfitting your main tank is extremely essential to guild raids. I guarantee every high-level guild capable of taking somewhat large targets will agree with this statement. The sole reason that you do not understand this is why you are in a smaller guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is also a good time to point out DoM is a carryover guild from karana, albeit with a changed name. We have been &quot;around awhile&quot;.<br>
<br>
c) What makes a guild good is its players, and that is all. Loot does not make a guild good. A guild can be composed completely of level 60 players, and be a bad guild. A guild can be 50 level 20's and be exceptional if they are good people. Materialism in a computer game is ludicrous.<br>
<br>
d) Lack of a roleplaying name does not make a person &quot;dumb&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Next.<br>
<br>
Logix, I am absolutely %100 positive my name will not be changed or taken away, you are correct. <br>
<br>
I am right in believing this, mostly because my name was already changed to what it currently is, by the server's lead gm. <br>
<br>
If you want to nitpick over things that are entirely irrelevant to the conversation, as well as things that you are very ignorant about- You picked the right one.<br>
<br>
And if you hadn't cared you wouldn't have thought to bring it up. <br>
<br>
I must have missed your PC Police uniform somewhere in there.<br>
<br>
You are not in any position to tell myself or anyone else how appropriate something is. If you had read my own posts you would have gotten an explanation of the name in any case, as you are mistaken about its meaning.<br>
<br>
Look at my response to Connador, after he nitpicked the same thing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of your post logix, is how completely unimportant my own guild was to the situation being discussed in that thread.<br>
<br>
So, in closing, Shanno your statement about<br>
<br>
&quot;some of you make it a personal issue and actually dig up stuff &quot;<br>
<br>
Might be better directed closer to home.<br>

I don't hate your guild.  I couldn't care less about your guild.  If one of your guild members asked me for C2, I'd probably give it to them.  If one of your guild members asked us to help them with a CR in Kael or something, we'd probably help them.<br>
<br>
However, the point I was making, is that the reason you believe in that poor loot system is because your guild isn't large enough to need a better one.  Additionally, guilds have to be established for quite a long time to build that sort of trust and loyalty.<br>
<br>

<br>
ONCE AGAIN!  I'm not a member of Vision, I don't give a damn who they let roll on their scales, the only thing was that you started advocating one of the worst loot systems, and harassing Vision's system, one of the better systems.  So, I pointed out to you WHY that system sucks and why your guild runs on it.  As for the Sev thing, you are so extremely far out of having any sort of argument against Vision's actions, it seems like you are just nitpicking with them because you have absolutely nothing better to do with your time.  They gave some Warrior a shot at it who didn't need one.  I've given a newbie 100pp before that didn't need it, are you going to argue about how I'm such a bad, bad person for it?  Maybe they did it for good publicity.  Maybe they did it for karma.  Maybe they did it in fear that the guy would scream and cuss them out if they didn't.  Maybe they just felt like it!  So what!<br>

Once again, arrogance is conditional on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> misunderstanding.<br>

You can't find a single person who thinks we were somehow anything more than fair to Warfrost -- including Warfrost himself, yet you KEEP MAKING NEW THREADS AND BRINGING THE TOPIC UP, and best of all, misquoting people.<br>
<br>
You misquoted and misunderstood me.  You misquoted and misunderstood Allamar.  I treat you the way I do because you demonstrate your TOTAL lack of understanding at every opportunity and raise my name of Vision's name every time you do it.<br>

Every time you try to demonstrate how right you are, you only PROVE, time and time again that you're wrong.<br>
<br>
You knew the timeline.  You wanted to see something that wasn't there.  Get a new tin-foil hat because the orbital mind lasers are getting to you.<br>
<br>
...and while I'm at it, I didn't post that example to demonstrate our generousity to anyone.  I put that up as an example of a situation where you don't give someone to the person who rolls the highest.  Dice don't decide Green Dragon Scales; and in the example I helped to clarify, dice don't decide Tolan's Darkwood Legs.  You see, before you came in and started insulting us for doing a nice thing for a nice guy, we were talking about the overall stupdity of handling guild loot with /random.  If you had understood that was what we were talking about, I might not have had to explain myself.<br>

For my obligitory on-topic portion of the post, it's impossible to judge a &quot;good&quot; guild by universally agreed upon terms.  I think this server has a lot of guild guilds, and I strongly suspect that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> nearly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> everyone in a guild thinks that theirs is good.  After all, why be in it if it's not.<br>
<br>
We covered that back in the infamous &quot;Best Guild Ranking&quot; post.  Go read it if you wanna find out what most of us think about ranking guilds and the subject part of what makes guilds good.<br>
<br>
The best guild on the server should be the one you're in right now.  I know I feel that way. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

It'd be entirely possible for a guild to let someone help them out, then decide they don't get to roll on the item when it actually dropped. Some guilds would do it. Some guilds have done it in the past, we see the person's post here when it is done to them.<br>

It had zilch to do with the rest of that conversation and was pretty early on, but I did bring it up, somewhere back there as most others were discussing their looting system.<br>
<br>
You gave the example that someone having 1% less haste on the item being rolled. He would not have been elligible for a chance at the item as the other melees at the raid would be. If you will use and don't have as good or better. 1% is not so great of a difference that it would stop being considered as good. <br>
<br>
Someone has 40% haste item and wants to roll for a 40% haste item that has better stats? Not gonna happen. That isn't the way the loot system works, just as clerics wouldn't roll on the highest ac item and warriors wouldn't be rolling on wis items.<br>
<br>
Your unfamiliarity with the system itself leads to some...strange...questions logix.<br>
<br>
IF you can use it and IF you don't have as good or better you get to roll.While loot still goes to the appropriate classes, it doesn't fall into 1 or 2 people's laps(unless they don't need it) every time. I don't know why you'd consider this especially greedy. Especially not any more than giving the same 2 people shots at the new stuff every time while the rest get tablescraps. What happens to the award system when your top 5 tanks all go to raids and all are good tanks? Who gets first call on a drop?<br>
<br>
Random loot policy doesn't always give everything to the main tanks, but it does give your bench more depth. <br>
<br>
And again, this loot policy would hurt my own chances for loot compared to the other. Of course, I don't need new toys all the time to be happy in eq either, and i like to see guildies get things just as much as myself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubradiouscalahan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bradious Calahan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/16/02 10:08:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Menn..er Logix</span><hr size=1> Like, qoute on<br>

None of these are &quot;trick&quot; questions.  Every guildleader who gets to look at these should recognize they are as true as things come...<br>
<br>
If I go to PoG and spend hours of my own time, without the guild, perhaps when the guild is sleeping, to get a Robe of the Bonecaster - or if I hoard platinimum for a year and buy a Mana Robe, at what point would I be eligible for a Thurgadin, Skyshrine, Kael, or god-dropped robe?<br>
<br>
If I have a 40% haste item, I'm ineligable for a 41% haste item.  At what percentage do I become eligible?  What if I recently traded my 40% haste item away to buy a luclin horse?  Am I eligible now?<br>
<br>
You've reached the 8th (7th, count how you will) island in the Plane of Sky.  Only one magician in your guild is still on the raid (all of the necromancers having accidentally fallen off of Bzzazzt isle).  What do you do when the second magician epic crown drops?  The going rate for this item is roughly 50k.  This item is worth 50kpp to any member of your guild, not just magicians.<br>
<br>
If I have three characters in your guild, a 60 Necromancer, a 54 Shadowknight, and a 54 Cleric, is it ok if I bring my Cleric to Hate and my Necromancer to Fear?  If it is, what penalty is there to bringing my characters to events that benefit them?<br>
<br>
You have raided Fear 100 times.  You have killed Dread, Fright, and Terror (together) (and previously Dracoliche) 300 times.  As a necro, you have always dreamed of a Staff of Undead Legions (look, just pretend, ok?  I have one, it's fun.).  On the 101st killing, a Staff of Undead Legions drops and you, a level 60 Necro who has raided Fear 100 times, and a fresh-off-probation level 46 Necro on his first trip to fear ever are there.  Who gets to random for this item, as the level 46 Necro clearly has worse equipment?<br>
<br>
You've reached Overking Bathsoap in Chardok, and killed him.  He has the cleric epic piece.  You have 4 clerics there, and two of them have started their epic; but in doing so, they've missed guild-raids.  Who do you let /random for the epic piece?<br>

Allamar does.  The simplicity of our system...   :)<br>
<br>
It doesn't bother Taygon, Menendi, Calas, Blloodsport, Rakazuma, Smal, Khondor, Azeroth, or Creeklass one bit.<br>
<br>
As I recall, either Smal or Azeroth won the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> roll</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for the Green Scale.  They didn't hesitate to cheer for Taygon when they did.<br>
<br>
Nobody in Vision is interested in what you did for us lately.  Within a week we got 7 assorted priest breastplates (Wuoshi, Trakanon).  One went to a shaman who wasn't online and hadn't played for a month because he's in Canada on business.  Similarly when a Kunark dragon coughed up an item later that week that was good for both INT and WIS casters (Torbin's Eyepatch), we made sure to take care of an INT caster.  [Good lord knows a Kunark dragon ain't gonna give up another INT caster item ever again -- and if someone says Orb of Tishan, I'm gonna kill 'em.]<br>
<br>
I'll tell you a story.  A long time ago in Vision there was a feeling that there would be classism.  That there would be haves and have-nots.  There was the feeling we'd NEVER get something so contested as a Wizard Epic (Venril Sathir was killed by euroguilds every time while I was asleep or at work, and the used their timing of the spawns to keep a monopoly for some time*, and the Wizard epic still involved a more difficult missletoe powder).  It was hard for our Wizards to see the &quot;big picture,&quot; to turn the clock ahead a year and see that every one of them who (a) put in the time, and (b) waited patiently would get their epic.  We have 8 Sorcerors in our Wizard class and 6 of them have epic weapons now.  It's not boast or brovado that we've equipped our Wizards; other guilds have done better.  It's a testament to the patience they've had.  It was hard for them, before we had a single epic, to see that someday they'd all have one, and it was hard to be on the bottom of a list that seemed endless.<br>
<br>
The moral of the story is good things come to those who wait.<br>
<br>
I eagerly await the answers to my loot scenerios from you, or anyone else, for that matter.  I hope that those of you on list based systems take heart in the story of our Wizards. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

'NBG Open Roll' is just that.  Anyone present at the raid who WOULD use the item gets to roll.  In most cases, it would be considered bad manners for the Warrior with a pretty good haste belt only slightly less as good as the one dropping.  There is no guidelines or rules on Open Roll as to whose haste belt is already good enough so they aren't eligible.  However, your guild apparently has certain guidelines they've added to open roll.  The basic points from the example I gave you were:<br>
<br>
a.)  Warrior who won the item puts little use to it as he rarely shows up to guild raids, whereas the other Warrior would have.<br>
<br>
b.)  The other Warrior has shown longtime loyalty to the guild, and is likely not to take an RBG, deguild and run to EC if he won.<br>
<br>
Even if the new Warrior had no haste, these points still serve huge reasoning as to not use this system.  However, you completely failed to see those points, and instead drill on what you think makes a person eligible or not eligible to roll on something.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't know why you'd consider this especially greedy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because, whereas 'every person there put in their effort', there is 'many people of the guild have put in their effort time and time again and have seen no reward'.<br>

We don't have just 'five good tanks'.  We have our MT, Lummus, and our ST, Reorx.  Outfitting these two are a large priority, as they are the people who are holding aggro.  The guild understands this, and some have willingly passed up armor pieces to these two.  If they have crap gear, they're not going to be able to hold aggro, they're not going to be able to tank that aggro.  This is why I must stress that you will not understand this due to the guild you are in.  Your guild isn't doing any large targets, you're not going to realize the importance of having your guild MT and having them equipped well.  In order to receive long-term benefits and move up onto bigger and better things, you have to support your tanks.  From there, what Warrior would receive a plate BP or something from HoT, starts from most active/highest level. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=818.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=818.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=818.topic&start=61&stop=77>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=818.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=818.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=818.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=818.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=818.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=818.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
