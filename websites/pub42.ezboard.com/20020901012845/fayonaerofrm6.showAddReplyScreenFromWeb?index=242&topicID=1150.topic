<br>
Wrong.  Go back and read the definitions (I think at least 2 have been posted) of a &quot;lie.&quot;  Then, think about what those definitions mean.  If English is not your first language then perhaps the subtle difference between a lie and a false statement is too difficult for you to grasp.  <br>
<br>
Probably the best definition I have seen is &quot;intentional misstatement.&quot;  You've got the false statement requirement correct (i.e. the misstatement).  But, what do you think the intentional requirement is?  Think on it.<br>
<br>
As for Faust, read the last few pages before posting more gibberish.  Then maybe you can understand why it's irrelevant for Blearchie to argue a fact (the objective falsity of the statement &quot;the sky is pink&quot;) that no one is disputing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulogixspybreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logix Spybreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AyRo IRC OP</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/4/02 6:26:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1150.topic&index=244>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zommy Zilor</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The way you are lining it out, no one has ever told a lie.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
By your logic, every Christian (if you are atheist) is a liar for believing in and advocating Christ.  By your logic, right now, I am lying to you, because you believe the opposite side of the argument.  By your logic, anyone who disagrees with what you think is 'right' is lying.<br>
<br>
By my logic, anyone can lie.  If my best friend gets a new haircut, it looks horrendous and we both know it, but I still tell him it looks great so he'll feel better, I'm lying.  If I actually believe it looks really good and tell him so, I'm not lying.<br>

<br>
Before I post more jibberish?  You wade into a situation where you do not know the background, then say that something someone said is not a lie.  <br>
<br>
Well, here's the scoop jackoff...it is well known (for those in the know...which you are not) that Zilor was VERY aware that he was removed from CoFE in a "we're on our way to remove you, or you can be a dear and do it yourself" manner.  How would one know this?  By being involved in the situation for the last fucking year or two perhaps?  I don't recall you being involved before now.  Were you posting as someone else on our other boards?  Is that how you gained all this worldly knowledge of if he is telling a lie or not?  I'm curious how you know that.  Plain fact of the matter is that you don't know, so kindly GFYM.  OK?  Thanks.<br>
<br>
You want to debate if someone being retarded (sample your family for best results) states something that isn't true makes it "truth" or not, depending on the phase of the moon, age, mental condition and if the subject is currently menstruating, that's fine.  If you want to say that someone is wrong by saying Zilor is full of shit*, that's where I'll have to bring up the point that you don't know the situation, so you don't know shit.  (Like it took a slide-rule to figure that out...)<br>
<br>
<br>
*-<font size = -3> When saying "Full of Shit", it is assumed that readers will know that it does not mean 100% filled with fecal matter, but actually used in a figurative sense meaning "incorrect, quite possibly by design"</font><br>
<br>
There, just so you don't start a whole big debate about "He cannot actually be full of shit, because he has organs that are required to keep him alive and wouldn't have space to be 'full of shit'..." blah, blah, blah.  At this point, I'm beginning to think that you are that dumb. <p>Faust<BR>

Stop me where I'm missing something.  Kaerila said that something Zilor said was BS.  You, stated that it wasn't a "lie" in a technical sense.  (Yes, and getting blown by your mother wasn't "sex", so you aren't guilty of incest.)  You wouldn't be able to say that, knowing the whole situation.  You begin to try and split hairs and twist it into a whole, "If you believe it, it's not a lie" debate.  Zilor was full of shit.  You continue to say how the whole thing is irrelevant", but keep posting to it, as if you are defending your doctoral thesis.  I poke at you because I think you are a moron.<br>

It just so happens that the above statement about what happened in Fear is correct,  as I recall we entered into Fear to find most all of COFE dead including Blearchie, Zilor called out to have no fear because Tides was here to save them. The remaining cofe that were still alive told the others in the guild that tides was here to help, but the leaders must have told them to refuse any rezes from Zommy or any other cleric in Tides.  It just goes to show you that cofe is well I wont say it.<br>

<br>
Crouwn, who are you? Someone who's an admin, could you please check the ISP addresses for this person and compare them to Zilor/grymy?<br>
<br>
I was there that night of this Fear wipe-out that's being discussed. Here's what I saw and know, and what I don't:<br>
<br>
The Champions of the Firebeetle Eyes (CoFE) entered into Fear with intention of doing the golems. As we were grouping up at the zone entrance, we actually let a Tides of Valor Iksar Monk (who's name I cannot recall now, please forgive me) accompany us on this raid. He grouped with us. Keep in mind, that this was after the KillSteal attempt by the leadership of ToV in Fear for Blearchie's epic. CoFE allowed someone from a guild that had the worst behavior (at that time) and had shown hostility towards CoFE come with them. There were no shortage of tanks or melee's there, so it wasn't a desperation move on CoFE's part. What it was, was a &quot;Forgive and Forget, Don't Judge The Actions OF A Guild By One Member&quot; kind of thing.<br>
<br>
CoFE moved into Fear, and cleared. They set up for the first Golem, hit a couple snags, and had a minor wipe-out. One of those snags: the ToV monk wouldn't fight. He just stood there, watching the fight, until it was time for him to Feign Death. This wasn't the cause of the wipe-out by any means, but it was noted because even though CoFE was practicing being forgiving, they weren't stupid: someone was watching said ToV monk constantly for bad behavior (training, ninja-looting, whatnot).<br>
<br>
So, CoFE wipes out. No clerics survive. One or two members did survive the fight however, and the reports coming back (this is where it becomes second-hand for me, please note) is that now ToV was moving in and setting up for the Golems.and that they'd been waiting just outside of Fear &quot;In case CoFE failed&quot;. As soon as ToV appeared, the ToV Iksar Monk disbanded, and went with ToV. He survived,<br>
<br>
As it seems to me, this ToV monk was a spy. He didn't help or hinder, he just fed information. CoFE, realizing that they had lost their attempt at the golems, quietly stepped aside and let ToV have their shot. CoFE play's nice you see.<br>
<br>
Now yes, Zilor came zoning in with ToV, shouting about how everyone was saved. Kind of easy to do honestly, he didn't have to do a thing, and he's very attention hungry. And yes, some cleric from ToV used their Epic ress-stick on some CoFE people. But CoFE, declined all those free resurrections to a person (as far as I know), because of the apparent duplicity involved. CoFE CR'ed itself in 30 minutes, and left. The people of CoFE are good people, and have their pride. CoFE learders Feuerfaust and Stauquin never told anyone to not accept a ress, it was a &quot;Everyone just kind of did it&quot; thing.  It also meant that nobody from CoFE who'd been there that night would ever trust another ToV person.<br>
<br>
How much of this apparent little plot was Zilor involved in? Personally, I don't think any of it: he hasn't got the brains. Hells, I think he wears a Walkman that plays a constant tape of &quot;Inhaleexhaleinhaleexhale&quot; so he doesn't forget to breathe. But it was planned, some ToV people had to shoot their mouths off about it later.<br>
<br>
So, if you want to talk about this, set out the facts as best you know them.<br>
<br>
And as far as the &quot;Truth/Lie/Perception&quot; hijack is concerned, it's an interesting thing, but futile in this case.  Can it be moved to another thread though? I'd get involved if it was, but this thread is about Zilor being a pimple on the butt of the Universe.<br>
<br>
Zilor is a liar. There is proof on these very boards (however it may be buried so far back it's irretrievable) that he practices deceit and deception. His banishment from these boards was no mistake, and I wish it would happen again.<br>
<br>
Hey Zilor, address my question a few pages back, like you said you wouldor did you lie about that too? You did say you would.<br>
<br>
<br>
With Tolerance For You<br>

<br>
Val pretty much summed up the situation in his post above.  We let the ToV monk tag along with us as he seemed like a nice enough guy.  When we were setting up for Fright, there weren't too many of us left, it was getting late and I think there were only about two groups of CoFE.   Matron ate the death touch (which made the entire trip worthwhile, in my opinion), and we all proceeded to do our thing - except for the lizard who mysteriously skulked about the rocks for the duration of the fight.  /shrug.  Maybe he felt we didn't have much of a chance?  Admitedly, we were a bit short handed I suppose.  I was the only nuker there, and being level 48 at the time I know how much I can bring to the table in a fight like that.  (Go go Enticement of Flame!!  Booyaka!)  Perhaps he was just saving himself from ending up as an addition to our pile of corpses in what was to be certain failure.  Either way, I thought it was a hell of a fun fight - spectator monks notwithstanding.  <br>
<br>
But yeah, ToV comes streaming in immediately afterwards with Zilor spouting off about how is was going to save us.  One of their clerics whipped out his rez stick and started to go to work, but we declined the offer for one reason, and one reason only:  We didn't want to hear Norrath's Finest Enchanter going on and on about how he singlehandedly saved the Champions of the Firebeetle Eye <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> from a situation we didn't need saving from</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the first place.  There were no ultimatums issued, no threats of &quot;DON'T CLICK YES, ASSHOLES!!&quot;, nothing of the sort.  It was a mutual, practically unspoken, decision on the part of the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Disclaimer:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I know that it may come as a shock to you, our gentle readers, that Zilor might be capable of starting message board threads for the sole purpose of stirring up trouble.  CoFE felt it was a possibility, and this dictated all of the &quot;no&quot; clicks the ToV cleric got that evening.  I will leave it as an exercise to the reader to detirmine if we were incorrect in our actions that night.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
