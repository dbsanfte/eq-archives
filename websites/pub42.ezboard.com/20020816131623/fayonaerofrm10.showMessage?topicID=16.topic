The moon consumed the sky behind him, his silhouette covering most of it. He was unmoving, but his cloak billowed in the chilling wind. Motionless. His face, concealed by the shadows stared straight ahead. If it weren't for the brief shudder that ran over him, you could swear he was a statue. <br>
<br>
The wind, the biting wind, it permeated even the toughest of hide. The moon welled up behind him, while he seemed to grow in stature with it. That indescribable gaze, though you could not see his eyes, they burned coldly. A mind-numbing feel of dread crept through the air. It was deafening, a silent roar. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a blink. One onethousand... and the image flashed back to life, but he now appeared through a window frame. The dark figure then crept forward towards the window. His steps made no sounds; his gate was incredibly fluid for his apparent size. He intently peered inside. The space inside appeared void, only the intensely cold moonlight shone in, and he blocked most of it. He stared inside for a long while, not as if in awe, or in a stupor, but an intentful, piercing gaze. He was sizing up. He kneeled down a grabbed a broken board leaning up against the ramshackle wall. He methodically slid the window open. Once again so fluidly, and so slowly that the window did not make one audible creak. He propped it open, and began to climb in. Slowly he crept in, slowly; it seemed to take years to climb in. Sweat built on his brow, and bead by bead gathered, edged slowly past his temple, followed his rigid cheekbone, and flowed into a large scar running from his cheekbone to his jaw. From there it hit his jawbone, paused, and slid off his face. His ears were so attentive that when it crashed to the floor it startled him, but he did not flinch like any fool. He finally lowered himself, both feet onto the floor. His breathing was heavy, but steady. He turned to his right, and faced a cot. A figure lay huddled in the blankets, oblivious to the uninvited stranger. <br>
<br>
The figure took a step forward into the room, and looked around intently. Satisfied he was alone, he turned to the bed and drew closer. He watched over the helpless being in the bed. The tenseness in the air was almost tangible. Suddenly there was a glint of steel; the figure raised his right hand high, angling for the most deadly blow. Fury filled his eyes, and his dagger in fist began the downward arc. The blade neared the bed when he let out a gasp. A cold feeling pierced sinew and spine, his spine. He went numb, and turned to see his assailant. A face in the moonlight looked grimly upon him. His own face turned to a look of horror. He tried to speak, but only his lips moved. He then let out a large sigh, and collapsed. He fell limply to the floor, a dull thud as his head crashed into the wooden floor.<br>
<br>
The assailant crouched over him, and looked into his eyes, &quot;Sorry friend I'm not ready just yet.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
“What a pity, good muscle gone to waste.” He rested his back on the splintery wall, and glanced around the room. A dark, drafty, ramshackle of a thing, but it had kept him safe for the last few months. Now it was time to leave. One of many enemies, maybe one he had not even met face to face, knew where he was and wanted him dead. <br>
<br>
There was no time to waste, and not any reason to. He had no acquaintances here, no friends. The only thing he really found to like here was a tavern he was growing fond of. A warm place, a back wall with a few tables where he often sat by himself and ran over his thoughts, or just watched for a drunk with a carelessly revealed pouch of gold coin. He never made himself known to any of the patrons, many wouldn’t recognize him if they ever saw him again, it was easier to stay alive when you don’t have many friends.<br>
<br>
He pulled out a thin dagger, and cut some shotty stitching around the edge of his mattress. He pulled out a small leather bag, and a small neatly carved wooden case. The bag was full of gold coins, but had been packed with cotton to keep from unnecessary rustling of them. He turned and withdrew the dagger from the man’s back. He grabbed a cloth, and pinched his fingers around the blade. He ran it through the cloth to remove any blood on the blade, the kind of thing that draws animals near when you must live on the run. He sheathed his dagger into a small unadorned sheath on his ankle, then put the bloody cloth in the man’s pocket.<br>
<br>
He rose and walked over to his closet. He pulled out a black leather cloak, with some very small, silver runed insignia on the inside of the hood next to his ear, and a dark metal clasp with the same insignia. He then pulled out a belt, with two sheathed daggers; ornately crafted handles, but the blades couldn’t be seen. He tied the small pouch and wooden case to his belt, drew his cloak tight and walked out of the house. <br>
<br>
He stayed in the lesser known allies, or sometimes crossing roof to roof, to avoid any more stalkers. One might be dead, but who knows how many others might have been employed, bounty hunters weren’t an uncommon occurrence these days. He came to the end of a long roofline and lowered himself to the shadows. <br>
<br>
“Like a vampire, I must avoid the light, to save my life.” A biting wind shot through the streets and allies. <br>
<br>
He didn’t trust the men guarding the gates, most guards worked on their own accord, and it was a good job for a bounty hunter to take up for a short while. <br>
<br>
Seetek heard something, and instantly slipped into a narrow alley to his right. He slid back towards the street, along the wall to listen what was around the corner. A woman was talking to a guard; it took Seetek a moment to focus his ears.<br>
<br>
“Yes a prowler, I don’t even know why we have guards, all the penny-weighters and smugglers. Hell, I even see guards rough up the occasional passerby for their silvers.”<br>
<br>
“Ma’am I’m sure none of the other men do such a thing, this is one of the safest cities there is. Why do you think we keep watch from dusk ‘till dawn, and from dawn ‘till dusk?”<br>
<br>
“Why do we have two incredibly large grave yards?”<br>
<br>
The guard sighed, “We’ll look into this prowler situation, go back to bed.” The guard turned and headed towards the gates. “Damn.”<br>
<br>
Seetek was no fool; he knew who the prowler was, and that the city guard may be corrupt, but they still work for their rations. He looked around, jumped and grabbed the overhang of a house. He swung himself up onto the roof, and walked towards the town wall that it rested next to. He did not see himself jumping up the ledge of the wall, so, with incredible skill, he started to scale it. Finding almost invisible crevices he pulled himself up to the top, and rolled up onto the ledge. A guard patrolling the wall spotted him. <br>
<br>
“You, who goes there?”<br>
<br>
Seetek bowed. He judged the man about 30 feet away, unless this man was a phenomenal athlete, Seetek could bolt and get away safely. He said back to the guard, “I’m up here for the view.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sure you have heard of the prowler around here tonight no doubt?”<br>
<br>
“Nope, not heard a word, having trouble with the townsfolk my good man?”<br>
<br>
“Well, Since most of the towns folk don’t climb the city walls to have a look at the view at such late hours, I must assume you are up to some sort of antic,” he then reached behind him and quickly fitted an arrow into a long sturdy bow, “and I’m afraid I can’t let you leave until you have been questioned, friend.”<br>
<br>
Seetek glanced around. There was no way but down, with blinding speed he dove headlong off of the wall and out of the city. The arrow went zinging by, now many feet behind him. He swiveled in mid air, glanced and the ground, and landed running. His cloak made him virtually invisible past the town light, and into the countryside he ran.<br>
<br>
“Alive for another hour, now where to go?”<br>
<br>

He was in a thickly wooded area. Occasionally, a long thorn would manage to pierce his cloak and stick him in the arm. He wouldn't nervously jump, but rather, in an incredibly quick fluid motion swivel away and break the branch off, like an assailant's arm. <br>
<br>
He walked very silently through the woods. Mindful of even small twigs. He was not akin to the woods, but he had been on the run before, and knew how to survive. He crept quietly onward through the timber. The pine shrubs, and willow trees made eerie haunting figures in the little moonlight that managed to creep through the dense leaves. Occasionally, a small figure would rustle around in the distance, and disappear into the trees.<br>
<br>
He crept on and on, all the while contemplating his next move. <br>
<br>
He glanced around and muttered to himself, &quot;This must be, hmm, Jaggedpine forest, yes. That means probably headed north? Yes nor-&quot;, a twig snapped subtly behind him. He froze. He could not move, perhaps whoever or whatever was behind him had not spotted him. All of his will was put into his listening. The forest was silent. There was no dull sound of animals scurrying, or an occasional owl hooting. Dead silence.<br>
<br>
He jumped to hide behind a nearby tree, but as he jumped an arrow caught him dead center in the calf. It drove through his leather leggings and momentarily crippled his right leg.<br>
<br>
He did not yelp, he did not scream. He merely grit his teeth, and tumbled behind the tree. He leaned against the tree and grabbed the arrow shaft. He prodded with his thumb into the wound, feeling the back edge of the arrowhead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not barbed.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grasped the arrow shaft as close to his leg as he could. Blood ran onto his hand and trickled down his arm. He quickly yanked it out of his leg. <br>
<br>
He glanced around the tree to see if he could see his assailant. No trace. He turned back and there in front of him was a wiry rugged man holding a bow. Arrow fitted, drawn back ready to fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you, what do you disturb the wood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a traveler, and that's what I do, I travel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not tolerate insolence, tell me who you are and why you have disgraced the wood with your presence.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Zan, I was once an adventurer of sorts, but have since retired. I know spend my time traveling Norrath, taking in the sights that I so thoughtlessly passed over. Who, may I ask, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Fenn Greenwind, I am ranger and guardian of the wood. I am sorry I shot you so hastily Zan, I have seen a good lot of dishonorable people try to seek refuge in Jaggedpine. I feel it is my duty to keep such evil out of the wood. Come with me, we can heal that leg of yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek tried to stand. He pushed himself up with his left leg bracing himself against the tree, but when he set his right leg down he toppled. He knew that he could walk if he must, but he did not want to be taken to Surefall, almost for sure where the ranger intended to go.<br>
<br>
Fenn looked down at him. &quot;Well perhaps I can do something for you.&quot; <br>
<br>
An aura of blue light began to envelop him. He turned his gaze to the stars, and his hands pulsed with soft blue light. The light then began to envelop Seetek. It made him uncomfortable at first, but his wound began to heal, the bleeding stopped, and it partially closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazing friend, thank you.&quot; Seetek reached into a belt pouch and pulled out a strip of cloth. He wound it tightly around the wound.<br>
<br>
Fenn looked at him wearily, &quot;Come with me, we can seek shelter here tonight, then tomorrow we can go on to Surefall Glade, my beautiful home.&quot;<br>
<br>
They walked miles through the wood. Seetek noted how Fenn seemed to feel so at home in the forest. He was not anxious, he was confident. <br>
<br>
They came to a patch of dense underbrush. Fenn looked back at Seetek; &quot;This is it.&quot; Fenn crouched and climbed through the underbrush. Seetek followed. <br>
<br>
A few logs were stacked for a fire and some whittling tools and bow cams were strewn about. A small leaf bed lay a few feet from the fire.<br>
<br>
Fenn walked over to a rack, holding a few skinned rodents. He took one down and put it into a nearby pot. He prodded the fire a bit, and threw on some kindling. &quot;Could you tend to the fire for a minute?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek nodded.<br>
<br>
Fenn disappeared out of the underbrush. Minutes later he returned with a shotty wooden bucket full of water. He poured some into the pot, then set the pot over the fire. <br>
<br>
Both sat in deep thought staring at the fire. Seetek never took his eyes off the fire, but he was taking very careful notice of his surroundings. Time crept by slowly. The sound of the boiling water consumed the night, and the heat from the fire made his skin feel as if it were shrinking.<br>
<br>
Finally Fenn stood, &quot;Yes, it should be done now.&quot; He turned to Seetek, &quot;Care for any?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek nodded.<br>
<br>
Fenn dipped a bowl in and handed it to Seetek. &quot;No elegant silverware here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek and Fenn sat sipping the broth.<br>
<br>
Fenn turned to Seetek, &quot;Well, I believe I need rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I haven't slept in a while either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek lay down on his bed of leaves, &quot;At least they’re softer than dirt,&quot; he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
He rolled onto his back and closed his eyes. A few minutes later he sat up. He glanced over at Fenn, who was lying on his back, eyes closed. Seetek rose slowly and quietly.<br>
<br>
He glanced back, and was startled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Fenn's eyes were now open looking at Seetek inquiringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nature's business.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fenn nodded and closed his eyes, drawing his cap down over his eyes. Seetek crept out of the underbrush.<br>
<br>
Fenn lay quietly next to the fire. He was drifting in and out of consciousness. Suddenly a sharp pain pierced his throat. His eyes opened wide, and he was face to face with Seetek, his hand on a dagger hilt, which lead straight into Fenn's throat. He tried to shout for a split second, but the dagger prevented air from escaping his lungs.<br>
<br>
Seetek hovered over him for a second, and when Fenn tried to struggle, he ran his dagger thoroughly through Fenn's neck, and into his spine. Fenn's eye's bulged, and body tensed, then went limp. Seetek withdrew his knife, and wiped it clean on Fenn's sleeve.<br>
<br>
He picked up Fenn's corpse and carried it out of the camp and down a small path to a stream and dumped it in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think I want to go to Surefall friend, but thanks for the camp.&quot;<br>
