Listen carefully now.<br>

Starting a thread or a few flaming someone like you have done to some people and some people have done to you is one thing.<br>

Maybe had she posted something along the lines of &quot;The rumors of Palimax retiring&quot; etc... but she did not she posted that he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> retiring.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the argument.  Momento had seemed to clean up her act just a bit lately.  Too bad she made a bad judgement call on this one.<br>
<br>
I do find it interesting that the person who started the above quoted thread was none other then Siaam himself.  Poetic justice maybe that he also has taken to doing the same things Momento does. <p><HTML><BODY>

I too was a little surprised at Edeina's decision - yet I was also a little surprised at Momento starting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> yet</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> another post to take a jibe at Palimax for no apparent reason. Hey, it fits in with her modus operandi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Harassment (note the singular 'r' in 'harassment') is a very strong term and I doubt if Palimax did complain as I don't think this thread even registered on his radar of things that bothered him - that is not the issue. There have been plenty of warnings given, and the dictionary definition &quot;vex by repeated attacks; trouble, worry&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> does</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fit Momento's pattern of attacking Palimax and Crydee for that matter.<br>
<br>
I guess Edeina felt that things were sliding just a little too far so she nipped it in the bud. It wasn't this one incident, but lately, almost every post made by certain posters received a caustic reply from Ms Malevolent. <br>
<br>
While I do share some of your concerns Yeugou, I also believe quite firmly that people have to take responsibility for the consequences for their own actions. Flame/troll away, most will just ignore. But with free speech come certain obligations - basically, if you cannot conduct yourself in an adult fashion and behave like mischevious children, don't whine when you are treated like a child.<br>
<br>
Yeah, personally I do think a week's banning was a little <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> harsh</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but Edeina is damned if she doesn't act and damned if she does. The most important thing is consistency.<br>

Well, as Palimax is fairly well-known, and a guildleader of a large high-level guild, I imagine he logged in today to be spammed with tells of 'You're quitting!?', and had to explain to his guild that this was a hoax.<br>

<br>
Let's grab some perspective. You're right. One thread by itself doesn't constitute harassment. However, for some time now there has been a number of derogatory remarks made about him and other posters irrespective of the nature of the thread. The fact that Palimax is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than capable of defending himself, and actually gives a shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   is moot. It is the principle here that counts.<br>
<br>
Yeah, sure. It's NAG. Let the poster beware. Whilst I have a soft spot for Ms Malevolent, she does irritate me from time to time by persistently waging her own personal vendetta which detracts from the quality of her posts. I would spank her, but living a couple of thousand miles away, renders that option unfeasible at best <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
There are people that post to this board who, if attacked in such a manner, may have taken the posts a lot more personally. Now since this is an EQ server community board which represents a wide range of perspectives, not everyone will &lt;BANG!&gt; get along. Some may argue, some may be jerks, and we may scream and shout like children.<br>
<br>
From my perspective, Edeina was merely nipping an issue in the bud before it became an issue. It is a rarity to have to witness Edeina enforce board behaviour, which is the best sign that the moderator is doing a good job (for those with a selective memory, there was a great deal of hubris about banning Momento previously).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  But is posting a lie worse than posting an ejaculating penis on a public messageboard?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This issue has been dealt with. Palimax clearly explained his position and accepted his wrap on the knuckles.<br>
<br>
Geez! I sound like the vice President of the Palimax fan club .. &lt;mutter&gt;<br>

This whole incident is unfortunate and a little unnecessary, but sadly, almost inenvitable.<br>

i said it once, i will say it again. &quot; YOU* read boards (in a break) at work and are afraid to &quot;get caught&quot; with such a pic that is so small that you can't even see what it is (unless you are getting close to it), it is YOUR problem if you &quot;get caught&quot; with that picture that isn't yours, on a public messageboard about everquest &quot;. sure there should be borders what is acceptable and what not. if there were pictures like palimax' one permanently, i would sure as hell kick him and say that it's not appropriate. but it isn't permanently, and he even warned you and said he will post something similiar in nature to kornutz' pic. did you say something about kornutz' personal pic with the hentai girl getting her breasts squeezed? which was the real reason for the debate? i don't remember it.<br>
<br>
if you are sooooo afraid, then don't look at this board at work. as simple as that. (although there is no reason to, since the pictures in question are removed and are not standard here). nothing is &quot;secure&quot; of *everything* that your boss could find offensive. or your company. the pictures were so small that i still doubt someone could identify them from far away. and if your company scans your pc or what websites you visit, and gets the picture or it's origin displayed, you're fucked anyway, even without someone actually seeing it on your screen. i know that it sucks possibly being screwed because of someone else's personal pic, but then again, if you surf at work, that's a risk you have to take. <p><center><font face=Verdana color=orange>"Old enough to know better, young enough not to care."</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usamuelledbetter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samuel Ledbetter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/24/01 9:26:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=620.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Farewell to Palimax</span><hr size=1> I see, so what &quot;you&quot; are saying is that I &quot;should&quot; stop looking at the Ayonae Ro messageboard &quot;at&quot; work to avoid accidently stumbling &quot;across&quot; some porn.

<br>
First, let me say that if EZBoard had an ignore function, while I'd consider using it for a few people, it simply wouldn't be practical.  Too often I'd be left wondering &quot;what in the world is he talking about,&quot; having missed some post from a troll.<br>
<br>
I wasn't met with a number of tells in-game asking if I was leaving.  Why?  Momento posting my retirement was hardly credible.  It was, as most people noticed before I stepped in and denied it, laughable.  On the day that I quit, I'll post a nice goodbye, tell a few people to go to hell, and tell a few others that I'll miss 'em and hand out a phone-number or two.<br>
<br>
The big question I guess is &quot;Was I harassed?&quot;  You can safely say that I'm not going to lose any sleep over the incident; but I'm still perplexed as to what facination Momento (and to a lesser extent Siaam) have over me.  If we're going to nit-pick on the word <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> harass (b) : to annoy persistently</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then yes, Momento is certainly going out of her way to annoy me at every opportunity.<br>
<br>
Ban them?  Heck, I dunno.  It's temporary and it's the logical progression from their warning(s)*  Compare to IRC.  They've been kicked before, and now they're getting a kick and a tempban.  The management didn't much like it last time I suggested how they should run things around here; I'm not going to interfere this time either.<br>
<br>
Oh, and please...  ...as much as you all like to talk about my penis (and who doesn't!), the more you jibber-jabber about it, the more I'm led to believe it was an effective -- albeit distasteful -- demonstration of the need for moderation of picture content.<br>

We know as a collective on this board not to take half of the crap trolls spew seriously, but when they continuously, reptitively, and annoyingly go out of their way to target a single person, for no aparant reason except for their odd fixation and perhaps stalking hobby, then it's time to go crazy with the ban stick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubelzebuth666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belzebuth666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/25/01 6:03:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=620.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ironworksforum.com/ubb/noncgi/smiles/double0smile.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> i`d have banned em a long time ago =p ì havent seen a constructive thread by momento or siam unless it was hijacked. <p>Belze L`Valeureux Crusader of the 6000th lfg <BR>_______________VISION_______________

However, I got a angry email from one person who believed she had been banned.<br>
I have contacted her by email and ICQ.<br>
I don't yet know what the problem is, but we will work it out. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Are we talking about the same person.<br>
The mail I recieved was a EZBoard private message that did not include any adress to reply to. <br>
I replied to the email adress and the ICQ adress presented in her signature.<br>
<br>
I don't know what have happened.<br>
The list of people banned is very short indeed, and she is definitly not on it.<br>
Also, there have been no IP bannings for a long time. Momento and Siaam was banned by username, so it can't be that she shared Internet Service Provider with one of them.<br>

<br>
now i can post again.. sorry if i sound angry in the message it wasnt my intention but i was a bit mad.<br>
<br>
when i tried to post it said<br>
<br>
you cannot post post a reply on this board, you have been banned.<br>
<br>
a few days ago i got a ICQ from some guy saying he didnt like my Sig and that he would have it removed.<br>
i thought this was the reason i got banned but it seems there was a misshap somewhere.<br>

I have not changed any settings whatsoever since I banned Momento.<br>

Good it have been resolved.<br>
<br>
I would propably have been a bit mad as well if I had been in your place.<br>
Btw, noone have contacted me about your signature. If someone had, I wouldn't have acted upon it.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>
