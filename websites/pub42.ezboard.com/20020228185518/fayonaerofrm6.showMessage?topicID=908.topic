I am doing this post to help explain to those that don't seem to understand why someone wouldnt want to help in anyway just because of thier Guildtag, and to help explain atleast my opinion of how guilds work.<br><br>1: Having a guild tag means that you belong to a certain group of players as an organazation. This entitles you to all that comes with it. Good and Bad.<br><br>2: As a member of a guild everything you do in your game play is not only a reflection of the type of character you want to be known as, but also a reflection on your guild. Joining a Guild means you take on the reputation of the guild, period. If the guild is not of the reputation, alignment, etc that you wish to known as then you should find another guild that is more inline with your outlook on the game.<br><br>3: Guild leadership is held directly responsible by other guilds and players for any action taken by you directly, or as a Guild. Guild leadership set the overall tone for the guild whether it is democratic voting system of all members, or a dictatorship does not matter. It is an organazation of players therefore leadership is where &quot;the buc stops&quot;.<br><br>IMHO these 3 things are the basics of how guilds affect/effect game play whether it is EQ or Quake3 no difference to me. I find the term guild hating to be one that lacks description. I do not hate a guild, I dont care for there style of play therefore will not involve myself with them in anyway. It is not out of spite but out of how I choose to play. If I do not like how a guild plays the game then I do not deal with them. In any game you can choose to play it however you want. If I don't like how you play don't expect me to help you. In EQ I have never faulted anyone for asking me for help that was tagged with aguild who's play style I did not like. I have however refused such help in the best and most inline with my play style, way I could think of. Generally I would say something along the lines of &quot; Sorry I do not get along with your guild or you have done nothing to me but be rude and your an a$$.&quot; Of course the chat generally goes down hill from there bc I am the only cleric within 5 zones that isnt anon. <br><br>now for the people that seem to be stuck on Stereotyping and Generalizing of people based on there guild tag<br><br>or·gan·i·za·tion   Pronunciation Key  (ôrg-n-zshn)<br>n. <br><br>2:Something that has been organized or made into an ordered whole. <br>3: Something made up of elements with varied functions that contribute to the whole and to collective functions; an organism. <br>4:A group of persons organized for a particular purpose; an association: a benevolent organization. <br><br>5:A structure through which individuals cooperate systematically to conduct business. <br><br>This is my main point: Something that has been organized or made into an ordered whole. <br>Notice it says &quot;in an ordered whole&quot; being part of a guild means you, hopefully, move as one and act as one towards any goals you have set as a Guild.<br><br>Just so there isnt any question of organization versus guild.<br><br>guild <br>Pronunciation Key  (gld)<br>n. <br><br>1: An association of persons of the same trade or pursuits, formed to protect mutual interests and maintain standards. <br>2: A similar association, as of merchants or artisans, in medieval times. <br><br>To this definition I have only one point. when you carry a tag it is wrong to accuse someone of &quot;guild hating&quot; or to fault them bc they dont want to deal with you in anyway bc of your guild tag. By wearing the tag you are saying that you agree with the conducts of the guild and its members. It is your responsibility to make sure that the guild follows what you believe is good game play or find a new guild.<br><br>On a personal note,when I hear of others in my guild doing something that I don't approve of you better believe that I talk with them and guild leadership. One of the strengths and weakness of any guild are the leaders. Now not everyone is perfect and will always make the right decision, but there are certain lines that I won't allow any organization that I belong to cross. Mistakes happen, correct them and move on. If a pattern evolves time for a change...<br><br>Just my 2cp, or 25cp as it would seem. I an interested in others outlooks on their perception of guilds in gaming.<br><br>If you took the time to read this mess, thanks!<br>Latah<br>Terhas Tomermentor 60 Cleric<br>Trackem Ankeelem 51 Ranger<br>Otherwise known as &quot;Tman&quot;<br><br>PS.

towards an organization. You don't choose to be born black, white, orange etc. You choose to wear a guild tag. I would never hold anything against anyone based on something they had no control over. You have control over your Guild tag. It is a conscious choice you make. Now as far as showing disfavor to a guild/ organization over one incident, haven't ever never would. Mistakes happen correct them and move on.<br><br>On another side note, I personally find the word Racism to be dated and ignorant. We are all human after all.

I think this is more directed to those who are on the other end of the stick.  A recent post from someone about their guild has brought this up.  They were wonding why there was much dislike for their guild, and many didn't agree with how ppl treated them because of their guildtag.  Basically they were whining about ppl not liking them because they were in such'n'such guild.<br><br>What Terhas said, is exactly how it is, when someone see's your guildtag, emotions and thoughts run through their brain, good or bad.  All he is diong, is explaining to the masses how it is:  If you have a guildtag above your head with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> name, expect reprocussions <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> good or bad</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>If you don't like what the guild does.  If you don't like how you are treated because you're in a certain guild.

The next day I logged on and was loading up a cleric on a second account (who was also logged in ssra).  I hadnt been online more than 3 minutes when a group of Defenders of Valor zoned in half beaten to death.  One of them says &quot;nice train&quot; and  another one says &quot;yeah we always have problems when they are around&quot;.  Was kinda funny since I hadnt even been online for a few mins and hadnt left the temple.  I must be a damn good trainer...better than sharn!<br><br>That is the second time that a member of Defenders of Valor has made rude comments towards me and I felt it was for no other reason than just because of the tag by my name.  I tried to explain to the guy that he must have me confused with someone else, and explained that I hadnt even left the zone yet.  He ofcourse called me a liar and said he saw me with his own eyes.  /shrug   guess some ppl are just really closed minded at times.  Anyone that knows me knows im a straight up guy and dont bs around.
