Only on the condition that the female takes responsiblity for a few more things, rather than blaming it all on men. <br>
<br>
Well, you somehow turned your incident into a &quot;it's not ok to rape people&quot; theme...which ...well, I don't see how anyone could argue that point or would for that matter. The world agrees with the premise that it's not ok to rape under any circumstances. <br>
<br>
On the complaint about men labeling women who present themselves in a sleezy manner being deserving of a sleezy title......<br>
If you behave like a slut. You're going to be found out, and your peers are going to label you a slut. A majority of girls I know have avoided that label, amazingly. So I am confident that it can be done.  If you are upset with your label, and you are a slut, odds are you know what you did wrong. <br>
<br>
<br>
If you dress like a slut, emphasizing your sexuality, you are &quot;modeling&quot; your body. &quot;Advertising&quot; what you have to offer. The history of the relationship between the two sexes will indeed warrant a reaction from the opposite sex. If a male sees a woman dressed in a provocative manner, it will indeed provoke a manner deserving the woman in the fashion in which she was aiming to please. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wliten's statement...is not bull shit. It's just not what you want to read. It's quite true. <br>
<br>
Now Edeina, (you don't mind me calling you Edeina, do you Alexander?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you fail to embrace the fact that one of the most important things that is going to determine a woman's reputation is how he/she carries herself. If I wore a dress and high heels to a sports bar, how monstrous would it be for them to label me and treat me badly? Or...would I be asking for it by the means in which I chose to represent myself? Now, here in the United States (your evil Western Culture monster of which so many negative elements elements of modern societies are to blame) women arn't yanked by the hair and dragged off into caves where they're lain on their backs, and &quot;had&quot; at will. Regardless of what Julia Roberts has led you to believe .<br>
<br>
Firstly, women know what reaction they have on men. Do all women hate how that works? No, because many....oh so many, aim to please. Those who succeed arn't posting on message boards of their distaste for Western Culture . <br>
<br>
Secondly, the fact that a man can sleep with four women in a week and not be labeled a slut (well, a skanky slut), while a woman doing the same can be considered a slut, goes back to the roots of the man's adoration and fondness for the woman. We want to nurture and protect our beautiful princess. It is emotionally unsettling to catch our daughters in bed with a boy, ect.  Now, we can drop that if the females of the world wish, but I'm pretty sure that my girlfriend appreciates me adoring her as my precious princess.  Sexually, we'll not be looked upon equally, because our roles are different, and that's unconciously how we want it. <br>
<br>
Yes, there are shovanists who abuse women in the world. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, a woman's labeling is not irrationally given. Labeling is a normal happenstance of everyday life. One easy method of labeling someone is by their physical appearance. How do you wish to present yourself? Line up eight women. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok ?!!!<br>
<br>
On the contrary, the entire deal with needing to go the extra mile to BE sexy is selling your sexuality. Advertising would be a better term. Marketing, even better.  It doesn't justify sexual harrassment, but it asks for it. If a woman wants to be respected in a manner excluding the attributes she bares physically...then she will go through the effort of not emphasizing those attributes. It's not a difficult task, I don't have a single female aquaintance who doesn't understand the fine line between &quot; sleezy sexually attractive&quot; and &quot;respectfully confident, and attractive&quot;. They never have had to deal with negative labeling. I suppose I'm lucky for having intelligent, responsible, confident friends who don't rely on their bodies to get them ahead in life.  Males do not emphasize their sexuality in the manner they dress, it's not part of our social code. Speedos often turn a woman off, regardless of the package within ! Spandex....*shudder*...no, they're not to be worn. They're just cheezy. A woman, however, exploits those curves, and her appearance is largely based on sexuality. <br>
<br>
Finally....So, when you walk down the street, and see a woman in fishnet stalkings, a short black leather miniskirt and a bekini top covered by a shiny red jacket at belly length. You can live on saying &quot;she's just doing it for herself&quot;. Truth is, she's advertising her character by exploiting crude elements her sexuality. She is cheapening herself, and any woman willing to defy western culture by doing so, is beginning the long walk down the path that leads to the label of being sleezy. It's not for sale, but she's crossed the line of respectful social presentation , and wandered into &quot;this is how I wish to be seen, this is what I have to offer&quot;. <br>
<br>
Never an excuse for walking up to a woman and calling her a whore. <br>
<br>
Never an excuse for being a sexual aggressor against the will of any member of either sex. <br>
<br>
But there is a line that a woman can cross where respect is thrown aside, and sleeziness is embraced. It's also easy to recognize, and comments will be made if it desgusts someone. <br>
<br>
Edeina, your high elf female cartoon does look like a dominatrix. Her sexuality is displayed in a manner that says &quot;look at what I have to offer&quot; and the means is not positive. As a feminist, which you must be from your complaint about the label your recieved (which led to a firm &quot;women stand with me on this !&quot; statement generalizing all sexual labeling) you should be offended that you're displayed in such a way. <br>
<br>
Your high elf female cartoon.....she looks nasty in leather, not like a proud woman at all. Verant wasn't thinking pride and respect when they thought of that cartoon. They were hoping for one thing. <br>
<br>
Arousal. <br>
<br>
Responsibility and prevention begins with the source of the label. I can't think a hog's a hog, until I see the hooves, the snout, and the tail. <br>
<br>
And for the record, I respect women. I respect women who want to be respected. If I see a woman flaunting her body, I make no crass comments, but I do think to myself &quot;so...that's what she wants to be seen as, hmm?&quot;<br>

I don't even know where to start with that one...<br>
<br>
With all due respect, I think that you are bringing some biases to the discussion that don't even need to be here.  Edeina's *behavior* played no role in the incident that she related in this forum; the person made a remark judged solely on her avatar's appearance.  Then, the individual justified the ugly remark by blaming Verant for making the model look the way it did, ...<br>
<br>
I personally *do* think that Verant made the female (and male) models look too blatantly sexual for my tastes, but this person, especially considering that they knew Edeina personally, should have had the courtesy and common sense not to make such a rude and cruel remark.  Now I know what irritated Edeina so much, and the crux of the argument you are currently having, has more to do with the *attitudes* behind the remark, but this is an argument that neither of you can win, because it is rooted in your personal beliefs.<br>
<br>
I personally believe that everyone, male female and other/two-spirited, has the right to 'own' their sexuality, with all that implies, and that what is too blatantly sexual in a negative way is highly subjective.  In reference to the 'bhurka' statement that was made elsewhere, remember that in some cultures, showing ones hair or ankles is too blatantly sexual for the 'norm' of that culture (whether we agree with it or not).  You may think the High Elves in leather look like dominatrixes, but some people really like it in a positive way.  You can think as much 'Lucy Lawless *is* the warrior princess!' as 'where's my whip I'm the bondage mistress!' when looking at that outfit, and if the persona of my character were different I might wear the look myself.  <br>
<br>
It's inevitable that people are going to judge and draw conclusions about other people based on their appearance.  But first off, lets remember that these are cartoons, and people have limited ability to customize how they look (pity the starting half-elf females - they are nearly naked!), and that second of all, when you *do* look, you are projecting your own biases onto the person you are observing... things that they might not have intended at all, due to cultural or perceptual differences.  (Or, they might be a child!  EQ is a 'family' game, and I have always felt a little sorry for the prepubescent children I have met while playing, stuck in adult avatars, and people holding them to that standard...).  So, *whatever* your personal biases might be, people would do well to remember that that person next to you whom you think is in hideously bad taste might really *like* the way he/she looks, and may see it completely differently...<br>
<br>
And if what that person likes is really trashy to you (and they know it and *like* looking trashy), so what.  Unless you know the person well enough to know that they won't be hurt by the remark, don't say it, even in a teasing way...<br>
<br>
For some people looking blatantly sexy is positive, and powerful, and makes them feel good.  For others, it is somewhat uncomfortable, and it makes them uneasy just looking at someone else who is dressed provocatively.  I've weighed in on both sides of the equation at different times.  For better or for worse, Verant gave us very provocative models, so we have to deal with this and remember that we are being manipulated by those images, and that what you see may not be what that person halfway around the world sees...<br>

I'm not a cop, I'm just dressed like one. &quot;<br>
<br>
I think palimax summed it up pretty nicely, wether you like it or not..most people may consider your attire..&quot;slutish&quot;(refering to ediena on the horse =))though who makes the &quot;slut&quot; standard is unknown...perhaps a new institution is in order...to assign all clothing a whoreness factor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ?...it could be a convient label on all clothing you buy!...<br>
<br>
But back to what palimax said..essentially if your gonna dress in a manner you know (or should know) is &quot;slutish&quot; in most people's mind, you really shouldn't be that surprised when you get treated like one.<br>
<br>
(small sarcasm to my post).<br>
<br>
The only thing at fault is the common mentality of what is &quot;slutish&quot;...but in the meantime if you know that, and still chose to dress that way, your partially to blame(not wholey obviously) for what you bring on yourself. <p><a href="http://www.darusgrey.com"><img border="0" src="http://www.darusgrey.com/darussig3.jpg" width="432" height="120"></a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufebreeza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Febreeza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/15/01 5:19:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/image/31/4764331.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR RUDE!<br>
