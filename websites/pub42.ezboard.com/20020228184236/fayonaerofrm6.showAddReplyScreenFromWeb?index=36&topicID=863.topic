We made a mistake in thinking you'd do the courtesty of bowing out once you saw our force present first, but didn't.  You didn't beat us to Klor in a race, because we weren't even running.  We didn't think we had to.  That was our mistake as I've said a few times now.  The part about who got Klor first over the other is meanless to what I've been trying to get across to you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Explain to me why we should have communicated with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Because your post made it sound like we were wrong for &quot;not&quot; communicating with you, when if any communication would have taken place it should have been &quot;started&quot; by you.  In every post in this thread between you and I now, you have repeated that if we're going to communicate while at a contested spawn that it has to be us that starts it and not you.  It's that superior than us attitude that has me posting... and you don't seem to be getting it, because you keep spewing it.<br>
<br>
This whole thing wouldn't have started had you not included that &quot;communication&quot; portion to your post.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to communicate and just rush to a spawn is one thing.  Saying that communication would have stopped the race, when you didn't &quot;want&quot; communication in the first place is very very misleading.  You made it sound as though we refused to communicate with you, so you took the spawn... which completely untrue and couldn't be allowed to stand as is unchallenged.  You make it sound like we're obligated to communicate with YOU, but you're not obligated to communicate with US.  That's degrading and disrespectful. <p>--Hagus Bruichladdich<BR>

<br>
I have never suggested that we &quot;wanted&quot; you to talk to us until you got upset  Prior to &quot;/ooc Who pulled Kalorek`Dar?&quot; we were happy with a foot-race and (now, mistakenly) assumed you were too.  <br>
<br>
I have never suggested that you &quot;refused to communicate&quot; with us, only that, had you have done so, or if you wanted to do so on future targets, we could avoid foot-races and work together to share when it made sense to do so.<br>
<br>
So, as usual, I'll be clearer.<br>
<br>
(a) If you want to get into foot-races for mobs, then, cool, that's ok with us, but neither you or me gets to be upset when the other one wins.<br>
<br>
(b) If you don't want to get in foot-races with us, then, that's cool too. Send us a tell next time you see one brewin' and we'll see if cooperation doesn't make more sense.  Similarly, if we see a situation where it makes more sense to us to work together, we'll send you a tell.<br>
<br>
Kalorek`Dar seemed much more like situation (a).<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we're cool with things being a foot-race.  I leave the matter in your hands.  As with my previous posts, I'll remind you that we're still open to option (b) when it makes sense to do so. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
There is no camping in everquest, to paraphrase the rule.  If our guild shows up with sufficient force, is prepared to make a pull and engagement happen before anyone else then we will do so.   If other guilds or conglomerates are present and we are STILL the first ones ready to pull and engage, we will go. <br>
<br>
Respecting another person/guilds camp.  We respect another guilds presence at a mob.  The way we respect that camp is to inform them of our intentions, ask them to go if they are ready to engage, and if not to step aside.  Often we offer a time frame in which we expect engagement on their part before we will go.  If the other guild chooses not to agree to that, or wishes to contest it they are free to do so.  Fair warning is given and time to engage or get out of the way.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
CB learns that Venril Sather is up in Karnors and mobilizes a force to take him out for one of our newest wizards to complete their epic.  CB arrives and SoT is in the &quot;pull spot&quot; preparing to go.  After brief communication with SoT personnel, we tell them we will be ready in X minutes to go.  SoT jumps the gun early due to our presence and makes some mistakes that cost them the fight.  Our personnel gain agro without being prepared and we lose a few folks as well.  We all rez the dead, rebuff and we inform SoT when we will be ready again.  SoT is given notice that we are prepared and will pull in about 5 minutes.  SoT pulls, engages and is victorious.<br>
<br>
<br>
CB shows up for Vindi/Statue attempt in KD and begins to set up.  CB is contacted by a leader from EW and is asked to delay the statue kill until they have sufficient force to attack the AoW.  Despite guild members complaints, CB delays the engagement 5 hours + so that EW may prepare.   This is an example of courtesy and respect as well as being able to agree.<br>
<br>
CB shows up for Vindi/Statue/AoW attempt and EW sits at the temple entrance blocking the pull path with approximately mid 30's in numbers.  EW engages Vindicator and wipes out.  CB is prepared to pull Vindi but EW is rezzing in the pull path.  CB informs EW of our intentions and get told to get lost.  CB consults Sony CS personnel to inquire as to the legality of our desires/intentions and what our recourse is.  CS staff informs us to Shout/OOC the pull and to get out of the way and if they do not heed they were warned.  CB complies with said instructions.  CB speaks to an EW leader who we inform of the guides instructions. Further said EW leader informs CB leader that they are still buffing “focus” and not ready.  EW then requests to know the name of the guide.  EW contacts CS personnel informing them that CB is &quot;threatening EW&quot; with said guides name.  CS personnel were brought in to mediate.  CB offered compromise to EW and EW refused every attempt at compromise save their original demands for more time in the amount they specified.  CS personnel force a resolution.  I think I know how I see this, but you be the judge of who forced PnP to be invoked and or further CS personnel interaction.<br>

Calling in customer service to back you up is pure bullshit. Of course they will back you up as long as you don't comit bannable offences, it is not their job to judge within the community. Since noone have claimed that you have comitted bannable offences, your defense is no defense at all, but simply admitting to be a total jerk.<br>
<br>
Many individuals and guilds, probably most, have unpleasent memories of having CS abused against them like that. Bragging that you managed to use CS to have your way and get away with it will not win you the respect of any of these people. <br>

<br>
We called in CS to clarify the rules.  We asked CS if we could or could not pull a mob while another guild stood in the pull path.  CS said that we could pull the mob.  CS was done.   It was not my guild that involved CS in any dispute over the mob.  <br>
<br>
However, this is all moot now as VV is sitting at Vulak forty strong with 3 or so of our members and EW just CoH'd on top of VV and then proceded to move up in to the pull path of Vulak.  Hypocracy at its finest.  I can't wait to hear EW's defense of this in light of the situation on Tuesday. <p><a href="http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=7518"><img src="http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/images/me.gif"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugandien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gandien</A> at: 1/31/02 10:21:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/31/02 10:20:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=863.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There are no KillSteal/RaidSteal/CampSteal servers</span><hr size=1> ok, let me sum it up:<br>

*CB petitions: is it bannable to pull through other raidforces?<br>
*Guide_01 tells CB: no<br>
*CB tells EW: Guide_01 tells you to get lost<br>
*EW petitions: wtf?<br>
*Both guilds refuse to leave the place, Guide force a roll, CB wins.<br>
<br>
If you tell me this is acceptable behaviour and I tell you that no, that's something that only a complete jerk would do, then it is NOT a language barrier. It's either you lying to defend your actions or you being a total sociopath who thinks that everything that isn't against the law is ok. Newsflash mister, this is a social game - and just like in RL you can be a totally disgusting asshole without breaking the law.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if you have been nice at other times and others have been unnice at other (unrelated) times, that is completely besides the point.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
CB did not call CS to their assistance. We needed to ASK them if it was ok to pull through EW since we were ready for AoW attempt and they were not. (Not to mention we need statue lewts) We woudlnt have even called CS if we had not known that EW would have surely petitioned about us  training them intentionally. <br>
<br>
After we did this EW called CS and said we threatened them? THEN CS really got involved, came to kael, evaluated the situation, etc.  Even after Aeno said 'kk we'll roll' (sounds like an agreement to me) he said that he wasn't satisfied and wanted a GM to enforce the desicion. Talk about manipulating CS to your advantage? <br>
<br>
TELL ME HOW DID WE ABUSE CUSTOMER SUPPORT EDEINA? all we did was ask if it was legal to pull through EW if they were an obstacle..you can thank EW for the roll..the roll woudlnt have happened without them!<br>

<br>
EW started CoHing to the Mir Lair when VV had like 15~ people, early in the afternoon and they camped there before anybody had a raid force.  And on top of that Vulak was not up, and still is not now.<br>
<br>
When our numbers became large we moved back to where Koi Doken spawns to put a bit of distance between VV and Ew so that we would not be directly on top of them.<br>
<br>
And we are now OTM to the elbow and will do our best to pull Vulak to there when he spawns.<br>
<br>
These are the facts, there is no hypocracy here.<br>

Of course I wasn't there, I quitted the game months ago. While I still care about many individuals in EW, the main background for my outrage is personal.<br>
<br>
Happened to me twice on Sol Ro that people walked up to me and demanded my camp, using CS for leverage. One attempt was unsucessful, but still annoyed the hell out of me. The other time almost made me quit the game in disgust. I had been camping the AC all day for a friend (Fandariella), and when it at last spawned the ring got ninjalooted before Fandariella could loot it. The Guide I called wouldn't help me, he claimed I had no right to decide who gets to loot the mobs I kill if I don't loot them myself. While we was at it, some other asshole whined that it would be unfair to let me have a second chance to get the ring. The Guide decided that it was that necro's turn to camp, so I was forced to leave empty handed after all those hours. The necro laughed in my face about it, he was so proud that he had gotten his way. And he had brought friends so they could take turns and hold the camp for the rest of the week so everyone in his guild could get JBoots. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
EW is in nobody's pull path, neither is VV<br>
basically its a hurry up and wait for Vulak to spawn night.<br>
<br>
Nobody is going to get trained, nobody needs to get PnPed.  May the best pullers win.<br>
<br>
Actually it might not even be that,  Wont be able to time respawn of the drakes / Defenders at the Mir lair or the wanderers at the Elbow.  Respawn adds + Vulak = bad<br>

<br>
CB consults Sony CS personnel to inquire as to the legality of our desires/intentions and what our recourse is. CS staff informs us to Shout/OOC the pull and to get out of the way and if they do not heed they were warned. CB complies with said instructions. CB speaks to an EW leader who we inform of the guides instructions<br>
<br>
You said this was the paragraph you took your information from...<br>
<br>
So this is the BIG guide abusement. Yeah we really took advantage of customer service here...<br>
<br>
All we did is ask it if was legal to pull through EW..I still would like an answer to why that is so ridiculously evil...<br>
<br>
EW made this a mess with Customer Service. Honostly, I believe they were actually trying to buy time by going from guide to GM (and because they lost the roll)..Oh thats not abusing CS compared to the god awful things CB did! asked what rules were regarding a guild blocking the way...good lord CB<br>
<br>
well theres your info.<br>
<br>
I'm finished here, Im not smert enough to compose something that you can't pick something out of and ridicule. I'm sure I screwed something up in what I've written so I'm expecting you to not focus on my main point, but disect my reply and turn it into something terribly wrong.. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubashur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bashur</A> at: 1/31/02 11:40:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ultrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LTrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/31/02 11:40:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=863.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Good luck to both of you then.
