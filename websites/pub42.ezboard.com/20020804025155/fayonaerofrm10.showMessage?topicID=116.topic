Their leader Warlord Drazor was recruiting a massive force of all lvls to help halt the attack of the evil forces on North Karana. I wished to join the evil side, so I found my way to North Karana and shouted that I wished to join The Evil Forces! After hearing this Disciple Xorn the leader of The Evil Forces summoned me to the wooden bridge and I was now under his flag. /role You had to disband from your guild to take place in the event BTW, so you could join the good guild or the bad one /role. As I was seeking a group to wage war with Disciple Xorn informed his army that the fighting will begin in 5 minutes! I managed to find a tremendous group It was I a 45 Barbarian Rogue(Caelus)a 49 Cleric(Tiradolin), a 50 Warrior(Vittaya), a 37 Monk(Deadlyclawz), a 48 Wizard(Sapper), and a 46 Bard i believe(Mukiu). After the groups were formed there were perhaps a total of well over 150 people ready to wage war in North Karana that day. The Brotherhood of light under Warlord Drazor(Human Warrior) were gathered on the stone bridge leading to east Karana and The Evil Forces led my Disciple Xorn(Iksar Warrior) were gathered on the wooden bridge leading towards West Karana. At last In what felt like ages The Disciple finally sounded the horn for battle. Our plan was to move up the road and bring the war to the Brotherhood, but our scouts informed us that they were trying to move their way up the shoreline and attack us right at our own base! A bold move yes, but was it foolish? <br><br>After word of The Brotherhood's plan it was decided that we should move back to our camp and meet them in battle. The Brotherhood seemed to look over a simple rule of combat and that was to stay together and be organized. The Brotherhood was attempting to attack us as if they were a mob from the local tavern! The first few groups that arrived managed to smooth the arrowhead they called their attack. My group and I arrived very quickly thanks to our bards song of selo's and entered the fray as The forces of The Brotherhood were being pushed to the middle. The group was quickly seperated and our entire army combined as if it were a group 100 strong! The fighting was vicious, but that did not stop me form losing focus on our goal. My first victim in battle was a Barbarian Warrior Named Wooden he was around his 53rd Lvl I believe, but what he had in experience I had in sneakyness. I persued him on the road leading to the camp of gypsy's, followed him back to bridge, and their I decided it was the perfect time to strike........Backstab for 220!! I continued to rain blows upon my fellow Barbarian until he turned around and began returning the favor. His mighty 2 handed sword did not discriminate between any race and I found myself with half of the power I came into the fight with. I reacted quickly though by strafing around him and then when he turned around I jumped over his head and.......Backstab for 230!! As I continued raining blows upon him once more he realized this was a losing battle he was fighting, so he fled (And they say Rogues are cowards). I could not catch him, but luckily my fellow group member Sapper put a spell upon him that made his blood boil! After this he toppled over and the victory belonged to me with of course the assist from The Sapper. Ironicly my 2nd victim was none other than.....Wooden again! After my victory i was still lurking near his corpse seeking prey and I noticed that The Warlord was resurrecting his fallen comrads! I watched as he resurrected Wooden and stood behind my foe as he was taking his arms off his corpse. I decided that he must not get a chance at vengence! All he managed to salvige was his helm, boots, and weapon before he could recover the rest in one sudden move I buried Rozzut's Whistler into his back for 215! He arose to his feet turning around to look at me and valiantly fought me, but without most of his armor he stood little chance. I decided not to evade him by strafing like the last fight, but to fight him face to face since he was at a disability.I realized the extra care I took when dealing with dexterity when I first adventured payed off because Wooden was fighting his second losing battle and fled once more, but this time other members of The Evil Forces noticed and began to slaughter him as I have never seen from any dwellers of Norrath. There was no ressurection for Wooden this time because The Brotherhood of Light were preoccupied with other matters. Those matters consisted of taking our bridge and holding it! Yes, The Warlord himself had taken control of our bridge with a massive force! He was aided surprisingly by a powerful Troll upon horseback named Orkhan if i recall correctly. Orkhan and The Warlord led the charge on the bridge and The others of The Brotherhood followed in their footsteps. What followed will go down in history...<br><br>The Brotherhood swarmed upon The Evil forces like locusts with one force antagonizing another, so we would not reclaim the bridge. Unfortuneately for them this was The Brotherhood's apex in this battle. Instead of attempting suicide missions to reclaim the bridge we now reorganized and attacked. Steel was clattering from every angle as we pushed ourselves on the bridge. While going forth I slayed a weak ranger who's feeble attempts to snare me failed may times and The Whistler claimed another victim as it burrowed into his chest. We furiously pushed towards the bridge and The Warlord realized that his hold of the bridge was short lived and he must act now or his entire army would be sacrificed! The Evil Forces continued the onslaught and many found themselves very close to The Warlord and soon he was the armies main target. I was standing right in front of Drazor, but before I could strike a spell was unleashed upon my already weakened frame I never found out who casted the spell all I knew was that as soon as it hit for 950 I hit the ground instantly dead. I was quickly resurrected by my leader Disciple Xorn and after thanking him I sprang back into battle this time not hesitating to attack The Warlord. I stabbed at him furiously, but he was guarded by a powerful magic shield that damaged those who attacked him. The magical shield and his massive blows were too much for any Rogue to handle and I fell once more. This time much like Wooden there was no resurrection, but unlike Wooden I was smart and before battle I had my soul bound at the gypsy camp by Sapper. I found my way back to my corpse and salviged my arms before the same was done to me as it was done to Wooden and returned to battle! I soon realized that I could better serve my army by destroying those who heal him instead of attacking The Warlord himself, so my 4th and final victim was a lowly Cleric. As he was watching over The Warlord I called upon The Whistler once more to slay him and before he knew it his lifeless corpse fell into the nearby river. At this time The Warlord was virtually alone except for a few onlookers from The Brotherhood who were afraid to interfere in fear of their own life. That shows the weakness of The Brotherhood and the strength of The Evil Forces. Warlord Drazor fought bravely swinging his stell in every direction killing a few, but he was outnumbered....and fell! Disciple Xorn saluted us on a job well done.<br><br>After their leader fell a Few members of The Brotherhood attempted to get their revenge, but were soundly beaten. Minor skirmishes took place on the following day, but we were too powerful for them to do any damage whatsoever. An exhausted Brotherhood not wishing for any more bloodshed sued for peace and Disciple Xorn in his infinite kindness made peace with The Brotherhood of Light! Our wise leader Xorn thanked us and said farewell to his troops and disbanded the army, but I for one will always serve Xorn's army and will be present at the next battle. Blood soaked The Plains of Karana yesterday and it will remain there for months to come as a reminder that The Evil forces had won The Battle of the Karanas!<br><br>Caelus Icefingers<br>Lvl 45 Barbarian Rogue<br>Disciples of Justice <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caelus>Caelus</A> at: 5/19/02 5:53:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukadathdreamfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kadath Dreamfire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/20/02 4:25:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hawkmail.monmouth.edu/~posten/minigang.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Brotherhood of Light vs. The Evil Forces!</span><hr size=1> Corpse camping = weak <br><br>Otherwise, cool recounting of the fight.<br><br>Kad <p><img src=http://hawkmail.monmouth.edu/~posten/new/kadath.gif><br><font color=red> Kadath of the Nexus, bearer of Al'Kabor's Propylon of the Nexus<br>57th level Wizard. serving the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro</font color=red><br><font color=gold><i>Ally to the Coldain & CoV, 166 Tailor, and proud craftsman of the 7th Shawl</i></font color=gold><BR><b> Lord of the Vision  -  <a href=http://eqcrusaders.tripod.com>Valiant Crusaders</a> - Ayonae Ro Server</b><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49724>Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caelus>Caelus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/20/02 8:39:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Brotherhood of Light vs. The Evil Forces!</span><hr size=1> Yeah I didn't like that part either, but he was right there and considering Ayonae is no pvp server I realized I wouldnt get many chances for backstabs like that. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caelus>Caelus</A> at: 5/22/02 9:04:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugiena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Giena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/20/02 8:55:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Brotherhood of Light vs. The Evil Forces!</span><hr size=1> <br>Nice job on the report Caelus!
