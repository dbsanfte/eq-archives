The group was very well balanced: cleric, warrior, rogue, ranger, shaman, and me. I join the group, and since I'm unbuffed, politely ask the cleric for a little lovin'. She says sure, as soon as she gets a little mana - quite understandable. Normally, I'm fine with waiting a little while for a cleric to buff me. Buffs are probably mana intensive, and I didn't get Hero at the same time everyone else did.<br><br>Normally, I'm patient. After about fifteen minutes of watching the cleric gain aggro from NUKING, I start to get a little peeved.<br><br>Once again, I politely ask for buffs. She gives me Hero a little while later. I also ask for a symbol when it's convenient. She says she doesn't want to waste a peridot on a bard, since we're not tanks.<br><br>Apparently, all the other bards she knows are immune to melee.<br><br>I'm a little XXXXed by that, but I don't say anything. Here's where the story gets bad.<br><br>Our puller manages to get three Xin Thall Centiens and one Ravenous Beast. Our warrior communicated with me very well as to which target he should get (as some of the centiens aren't mezzable... think it has to do with level), and we start swinging. <br><br>Of course, our wonderful and dependable cleric begins to nuke the mobs I'm trying to mez. I'm still not sure why, but the mobs found me to be more offensive than our cleric, and decided to play Pinball with the bard. I'm dead about ten seconds later.<br><br>I wake up in Shadowhaven. I tell the group, &quot;ready for rez when mana is available&quot;, and wait. And wait. And... wait. After ten minutes, I send a tell to the cleric. She says, &quot;oh yeah sorry forgot&quot;, and rezzes me.<br><br>I zone to ME, loot my corpse, and get back to grinding. After a few kills, the cleric sends the most offensive tell I have ever heard in EQ:<br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No donation???<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br><br>Okay, now I am XXXXED. I said something that probably went along these lines: &quot;Why in the @#%$ world would I pay a cleric in my GROUP for a rez???&quot;<br><br>She says, &quot;I need cash to pay for peridots.&quot;<br><br>I'm not sure, but I think my head exploded right about there.  I am now very, VERY angry. I left the group, kicked my dog in the ribs, beat up Othen, and broke some various household appliances.<br><br>This cleric's name was Caeliane, or something like that. She was anon, guildless (big surprise there), and either level 58 or 59.
