Not getting pregnant in the first place is the best route.  No woman (or man for that matter, he has a part in the decision) wants blood on their hands.<br>

America (and likely the rest of the world) has some pretty wierd taboos about sex.  It is no wonder that our young people screw like rabbits and go running to an abortion clinic to fix the problem.  Most of the kids out there never had their parents talk to them about sex in any setting besides the tongue tied "I'd like to talk to you about sex" schmuck lecture.<br>
<br>
Imagine if American parents pulled that size 12 stick out of their ass and talked about it over dinner?  Right now kids hit the teenage years and think it is some kind of secret ritual that endow's the participant with adult status. <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

I worked in a cytogenetic lab for a summer. I've helped autopsy aborted fetuses. Let me tell you that while you can make the argument that it is best to abort for the sanity of the mother and the wellbeing of the family etc, the fetuses being aborted in cases where genetic anomalies are the problem (e.g. fragile x, downs, etc) are not balls of anything but fully formed miniature human beings with 10 fingers and 10 toes, eyes, noses, arms, and legs. A normal pregnancy is 40 weeks. Tests are usually done (in my limited experience) from around week 8 up to around week 20. Most typical is probably around 10-12 from what I saw. These are first trimester fetuses and are not balls of anything.<br>
<br>
You are entirely entitled to your opinion, but I felt it should be based on fact rather than fiction.<br>

<br>
As for abortions, I'm not for it nor against it. I think that in some cases it's needed, but in most not. Since it really seems to be used as a easy way out these days, and abortion is not like a condom or taking the pill but it's treated about the same way now days.<br>
<br>
You know the first thing they ask you if you show up at the school nurse/hospital and you're under 20 and they realize you're pregnant is? "So, you're gonna have an abortion right?" if you answer no to that question you'll get the "You sure you don't wanna have an abortion, you really should think about it". With it being phrased that way, atleast in the lil' town where I live, I can't blame girls for getting abortions everyone will tell you it's the easy way out.<br>
<br>
Now back to the real topic, most of these people don't realize that there's something wrong with them (bare in mind that those I work with are from the age 30 - 65, they all have homes of their own and they all work, I talk about her as a girl since it's how I see her =/ ), or rather they don't quite understand what's wrong with them. None of them has been abandoned by their parents, their apartments and the care they get are payed by the state and the families. <br>
<br>
They live rather good lives from a "normal" standpoint, but it's that one girl that really twists my world.. she's so aware of the fact that she's not normal, she has the same education that most Swedes do she has a clear and bright mind, but she can't do jackshit with it since certain parts of her brain wont let her.<br>
<br>
Most of them get stuck mentally at the age of like.. 12-15 they talk about the same things that you talked about when you were that age, to see a 63 year old woman talk like a 12 year old hurts ME to see. Don't get me wrong, I'm giving them the absolute best care I can, but it's hurting me to do it.. it's like isn't there something that could be done for them.. well you get my point.<br>

Abortion is final. Whether you choose to acknowledge a fetus as a living person in development, or a ball of tissue that will after time become a living person, you can not deny the fact that things left to mother nature it will one day become a living breathing human being.<br>
<br>
Yes there are cases when women have abortions just because of the fact the baby will not fully gestate for various reasons but that doesnt seem to be the topic here.<br>
<br>
I am personally against abortion, just for the sake of birth adnormalities and just about any other reason except under extreme circumstances. For very simple reasons. One of them:<br>

I can list an endless supply of &quot;what if's&quot;, and can show several examples of disabled ( from birth defects) people thru out history who have literally changed the world. When you make such a final descission you have destroyed any possible future for the unborn child, yourself and the world around you both.<br>
<br>
How someone can completely shutout any possible positive future, just over fears of a negative one are beyond my comprehension. I will never understand that mode of thinking.

No wonder so many kids these days are so fucked up.<br>

Abortion is a way better option than an unloved child.  The quality of life is what is the most important - and a *normal child* isn't going to get that without knowing that he/she is loved.<br>

So, carry on yer pointless debate about killing and murdering.  An unwanted child is already emotionally dead.  Period.<br>

A couple knows by tests that their child will be born with major birth defects, and will have a very short time to live (2-5 years).  They, or adoptive parents should be subjected to the pain of losing that child?  As well, the child will be subjected to intensive hospital stays for his / her entire life.<br>

Nothing is black and white - the world must be seen as a zillion shades of grey.  <br>
<br>
As a firm believer in abortion being evil, picture yourself and your mate finding out you're about to have a child, yet, if the woman carries that child to term and gives birth her chances of surviving are about 10%.<br>
<br>
Why is her life worth less than the child?  Her life is equally precious, and her death as a person who has lived for a few decades will affect WAY more people in a negative way, than the death of an unborn, unknown child.  The pain cannot be compared.<br>

It was the doctor-killers I called rightwing extremists, not Bill O'Reilly. Surely we can all agree that a person who walk armed into hospitals, with the intention of murdering the first whitecoated person he see, is a extremist?<br>

Again, it's our minds that entitle us to human rights. NOT our number of toes. With lump of tissue I do not mean it have to be spherical or anything. Hey, it can look like a fully grown Pamela Andersson for all I care. If it doesn't have a mind and doesn't have a brain that could fit a mind, no way in hell I'm going to consider it a person and care about it.<br>
<br>
Lets say the real Pamela Andersson had a really bad accident. Lost both legs and arms (including that nice and even number of toes and fingers) and had the skin burned from her head and torso so the silicone fell out and she could no longer be physically recognizeable as human. But with medical help she would still be able to survive and communicate, her mind would still be intact.<br>
<br>
Then some doctor gets the idea to clone her organs (all except the brain) and assemble them to a new body that looks just like her old one. This new body would have human genes, looks that many consider beautiful, and it would have that precious number of toes. Which one of these Pamelas do you consider to be the one that should have the identity and the human rights? The person without the ten toes, or the mindless flesh-doll with the pretty smile and the right number of toes?<br>

&quot;What if's&quot; works both ways. I'm talking about odds and chances, if you allready know the future then you don't have to consider it. Just follow the one true map. Must feel comfortable. But not really useful, because you will always end up with those questionmarks no matter what you do. Which feels worse, btw? Having a abortion and knowing that things might have changed so it might have had a chance of leading a happy life, or not having a abortion and see a person as in Flexure's example suffer for almost the whole following century because of YOUR choise? Which do you think would have generated the largest numver of questionmarks?<br>

Yes, you can adopt away children you won't care for. Sadly enough, those who don't care for their children often don't care to adopt them away either. Far too many children grows up unloved. Anyhow, you can't adopt away the child from you, but you can't adopt away from the child the body you have once given it. Even you you don't have to live with your choises, your child do. <br>
<br>
Children deserve to be born without defects. If they come out crippled then it's not their fault. The blame belongs to the parents and doctors who wouldn't care enough to let the child have a healthy start in life. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I would like to add that the horrors you bring up are REAL.<br>
As opposed to the &quot;children&quot; the &quot;pro-live&quot; people claim to care about.<br>
<br>
If we are to label abortion as killing or murder, then it's only because someone have decided in a very abstract and theoretical sense that these limps of tissue should somehow be considered children. <br>
<br>
Sure enough, some anicent pope once decided that the Soul is inserted at conception, and every good scientologist &quot;know&quot; that the egg is flooded with milions of stray souls the first time it divides.<br>
<br>
But if you arn't a conservative chatolic or cult member or such, then you have no rational reason to believe in any of that stuff. And even if you are of the faith, it's your faith alone that give you your opinion. And faiths should not be pushed on other people. If I believe that trees have souls it doesn't give me a right to wreak vengance upon those who cut down trees, and so on.<br>
<br>
If you have to weigh obeviously real people against things that are only people in some theoretical abstract sense according to some or other esoteric faith or theory, reality must take priority. faiths may be true and they may not. They might all be wrong, they might most certainly not all be true. But the real people are undoubtely there.<br>

<br>
I agree either way you end up with question marks. My point is two fold. One, I personally given a chance even if it is 1 in a million would rather have the chance at a normal life. Which brings the second part. If you end the life before it even has a chance you elimate all of the posiblities good or bad.<br>
<br>
You, I or anyone can not tell the future. I certainly would never attempt to even guess at it when it involves the life or potential life of another human being, let alone my own child.<br>
<br>
There is always another option aside from termination. Abortion is the quick easy answer to a larger set of problems. From what I know of the women and men who have consented for their female partner to have an abortion, all of them have done it as a way out of the consquences of their actions. There are of course those that have had abortions for other reasons, I am speaking directly of the women and men I know.<br>

<br>
Watch an ultrasound of an abortion in progress sometime. You will see the Fetus even at 3 weeks so signs of self preservation. Is that not a sentient act?<br>
<br>
All of that aside, the fetus will grow into a sentient human being after a normal gestation period. Abortion stops the normal growth of the embryo into a fetus into a baby. So IF you destroy a fetus then you have destroyed a Baby?<br>
<br>
Not bad logic but slightly flawed. There is an assumption the gestation will go as normal and the baby could have been born. Which bring me back to my point. There is no logical reasoning that isnt flawed on abortion. You just do not know, because you can never know the future.<br>

I agree 100 percent that children should be able to be born without defects. The answer is not killing imperfect fetus's though.

Gettin awfully close when you talk about aborting just because of birth defects then tossing in blaming the parents. Unless the parents knowingly enage in sex to have a baby knowing 100 percent that the child would be born with defects, then how can you blame the parents?<br>
<br>
It is always sad, when a child is born and there is no one there to love them and raise them in a decent manor. Even in that realm there are still shining examples of people overcoming their inadequate birth rights, and literally changing the world.<br>
<br>
Under your point of view their lifes would have ended before they ever began and the world would be that much worse for it.<br>
<br>
I feel the best that any of us can hope to do, is to help whenever, however we can. So that the odds of someone with disabilities, birth defects, an unloving home enviroment, and any other diveristy that has lead them to an abnormal/negative upbringing can actually have a better chance at becoming something better than where they started.<br>
<br>
In Flexure's case, I do not see the problem 100 percent in their disability. I see the problem with the enviroment. People talking in the third person right in front of them. That is just rude and hurtful. It shouldn't happen. To leave someone to sit and rot away is wrong. The answer I see is not in aborting any and all possible birth defected fetus's. It is changing how we treat people with such problems. So that they can lead some form of productive life, and enjoy atleast a basic quality of life.<br>
<br>
Watch the Special Olympics&quot; tell me those disabled people have life so horrible. They don't because of the enviroment they are in.

Bad argumentation Cristo, "what if" can also be employed with "what if your child is the ante christ?' and so.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this thread has slipped from it first subject : Will you be able to keep a child that has physical or mental problems. But the abortion theme can bring some different colors : you know your child will have problems, will you keep it ? As I said, if you don't know anything before the birth, you will keep him/her and love him/her because (s)he's your child. But at the first ultrasound, the doctor tells you there are 95% chances of malformation. What are you gonna do ? And this I can't really answer. Especially as a man I think.<br>

Never EVER use the cheap &quot;that sounds like something Hitler could have said&quot; trick in a serious discussion. Plzkkthx.<br>

Hitler did a lot of things. Some good, some bad, and some horribly bad. He made sure good roads got built, and then he had 12 million individuals murdered in concentration camps. (The six millions who WASN'T jews are still forgotten by most people.) This doesn't mean that building roads is a bad thing, okey?<br>
<br>
As for the part you quoted, it's race mysticism and totally of topic. Either you don't understand what I'm talking about or you just try to smear me. I'll assume it's the former.<br>
<br>
I am not talking about building a master race or any such nonsense, and I find the question itself offensive. All I'm talking about is that if you are born without disabilities then you have better chances in life then if you are born with serious disabilities like the ones mentioned by Flexure. And you allready agreed on that part, so it's not even a issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you end the life before it even has a chance you elimate all of the posiblities good or bad.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If you never have a child, then you don't give your children any chance. True. This goes not only for abortion, but also for not getting pregnant in the first place. This is one of the prime reasons why the Chatolic Church think condoms are evil. Logically they should also consider celibacy to be evil then, but one can't expect too much logic of them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you have a certain number of children, they should have as good chances as possible. Lets say you will have one and only one child. Getting a damaged fetus and abort it and then get pregnant again and keep the undamaged fetus, that will give your one child a much better chance then if you have the damaged fetus evolve into a child and then use pills or condoms to not get pregnant the second time.<br>
<br>
Your point would thus be quite illogical if you didn't cinsider the fetus to actually be a child. That's the core difference, I think. I cosider them potential children, while you consider them to allready be the people they might one day become. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
I do not believe that we humans are merely products of our genes. We evolve by input from our surroundings and from the choises we make ourselves. A fetus have a genetical and biological structure, but the development of the real person have not yet started. If time was split in two worlds and the child was born in both, it would be likely to evolve into two very different persons, no more alike then two twins who havn't grown up together.<br>

If someone is crossing a street and is about to get run over by a truck, is the answer then to pull him in so he can cross again when it's safe, or to visit him in the hospital and try to make him feel good about never again being able to move his legs or be without a diaper?<br>

Well, of COURSE the first choise should be to pull him in. Failing that, done is done. Do what you can to cheer him up, but don't fool yourself that it's as good as it would have been to save him in the first place. <p>Love, Edeina<br>
