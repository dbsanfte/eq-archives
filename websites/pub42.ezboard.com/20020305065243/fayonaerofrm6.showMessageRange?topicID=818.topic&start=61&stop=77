I know you understand this. I also know that you realize there are times when a guild gets together and says &quot;Hey, let's get x person their epic piece in such n such zone&quot;. This is entirely different than say, kael arena or planes and class armors.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is random is there as the failsafe. It comes up if everyone is pretty evenly matched, or can't decide what goes to who. It removes the need for a loot officer of any kind, and as loot officers and the like generally get fouled up at some point, that's not a bad thing. It also means there isn't an officer getting headaches about keeping track of everyone's gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the robe, who do you think would deserve an item more, someone who already has something like it or someone who doesn't? We're assuming they both put forth the same efforts for the guild and are the same level, as well as both being in the guild for about the same time. Is there an incentive for you to get your gear over what the average is in the guild? I don't know, maybe you don't wanna get better gear. Maybe that other caster couldn't afford the robe you could? <br>
<br>
Also you'll take note in my post that i don't know about necro items and that I was assuming they were the same. I noted that you said thurg robes were about the same as ss robes or kael robes, and I know that pog items are just like thurg items, with the stat bonuses switched a bit(as melee gear goes).<br>
<br>
<br>
Diamonds are neither 50kpp nor hard to get. Lets assume a guild gets 2 green dragon scales up there. Warrior a is at the raid, and is the only warrior at the raid. The rest fell off, and bounced on the chain on the way down. He is near or at this step in his quest. There are several other warriors who are close to this step in guild who are not there. Would we sell this hard to get item, random it off to someone who could sell it, or would we hold it?<br>
<br>
As for your cleric example, again, if you are as active as you're saying this cleric is in your example, you will raid him often. He will get more gear than the other clerics who play less because he is there more to get it.<br>
<br>
I can easily explain the difference between 2 people agreeing on something and 100, saying &quot;Hey bud i don't need arms but i need gaunts, and you don't need gaunts but you need arms, if gaunts drop i get em and if arms drop their yours ok?&quot; Is incredibly different than saying &quot;You know we all raid the same amount(addressing his 4 warlord guildies), however I am more important. Because of this, since we both need every armor piece that drops up here, I will get everything I can wear, and you will receive something only if i already have it.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/17/02 3:22:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Menn..er Logix</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> epic quest items are not normal loot.

Great!  When are you going to?  'cause you didn't in your post.  Lets scale the example a bit.  If you have two necromancers in your guild, and they can agree with how to handle every drop (in advance) without randoming, is that ok?  And if so, is it ok for 3 to agree?<br>

Just because someone put the word &quot;epic&quot; in the questname, it isn't any different than any other item available in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think there is a vast difference in a dropped item that less than 1% of a class will ever have(from the stats I assume that came from ubermob_00whatever, but i don't look up loot tables from such mobs to drool over, so i am not familiar with who drops it) compared to a time consuming quest available to all members of a class after level 50. <br>
<br>
For example, when you put together a raid on a triggered spawn for guildmate x(and guildmate x has spent a good deal of time to get to the point they could trigger it), it's a little different that hitting a zone and having something drop for 2 people that have the same time in guild(blah blah blah, they're even).<br>
<br>
&quot;As for the new Ferrari. Who would deserve it more, the guy who already has a Jaguar who bought it with the money from his second job that he worked at nights for, or the guy who barely held down his day job and drives a Datsun &quot;Honey-Bee&quot; to guild raids once a month?&quot;<br>
<br>
What happens when two people put forth the same amount of work at job 1, but person A works a second job to get a ferrari? Does person A deserve to have 2 ferraris before person B has a single one? They both work just as hard for the company. Let's assume they race their cars for a living.<br>
<br>
Solution 1.<br>
person A says &quot;ya know this model is a year newer, I'll flip you for it, if i win you can have my older ferrari&quot;<br>
<br>
Solution 2.<br>
Employer says &quot;well, person A likes his car, and to be honest it seems a little strange to be giving someone who put forth no more effort for our company than B here a second good car before B gets an upgrade from his geo metro.&quot;<br>
<br>
Solution 3.<br>
Employer says &quot;Person A gets the ferrari, his second. This is because it is in our companies best interest to keep him in the latest model ferrari, even though he already has one and even though you don't own a competitive car at all yet Mr B&quot;<br>
<br>
Which solution seems to be the most fair and sensible?<br>
<br>
&quot;Similarly, you've made it clear that as an ALT, he'd never, ever, loot ahead of a main? What situation will he get more gear than the other clerics in?&quot;<br>
<br>
Lets say your guild raids hate 20 times in a 6 month period. Your alt is there for every raid, and so are 2 of your guildmate clerics(these people are raiding just as much as your secondary char, if not more). There are also 2 clerics who show up now and then, and have made 5 raids each. Your alt gets anything the main characters pass on. Is it really hard to believe that out of 20 raids you won't have more than the 2 who made it to 1 raid in 4?<br>
<br>
&quot;It's finally obvious to me what you don't understand. (Or what you pretend not to...) You know we all raid the same amount, but I will get the best equipment because the GUILD is more import &quot;<br>
<br>
Who decides how much either has put into the guild?  Who chooses which is more important? How do you do that if they both put the same time and effort into the guild? More importantly, how do you do so without spreading ill will around? Putting a lot of time into a guild(as much as anyone else of your class) and being told &quot;You get the leftovers&quot; could be seen as, pardon me for saying it, &quot;A slap in the face.&quot;.<br>
<br>

Regarding the Staff, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> uber</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->loot in general.  You see, there again, you help demonstrate MY case.  Loot distribution the high level isn't random because you're not getting items that eventually every person in the guild will have.  Most of the loot that we're talking about is stuff that less than 1% of a class will ever have.  I, for example, have a great belt dropped by Dracoliche -- a mob killable by most mid-power and higher guilds.  He's pretty much just a cross between a overgrown Ashenbone Drake from Hate and Venril Sathir.  A &quot;big Wuoshi with Lifetap instead of AE&quot; on his best day.  As much as I'd like to get that belt for every INT and WIS caster in the game, Dracoliche has a 13-item loot table and spawns once a week.  Even if we get a quarter of all of his spawns, and he drops the belt more than a quarter of the time, I can't get that good of a belt for all of my casters until sometime in 2005.<br>

<br>
You ask these questions like they're rhetorical and the answers are all obvious; that you do spread ill will around and make people into second-class citizens.<br>
<br>
So, I'll pretend you actually posed them as questions.  The guild as a whole, guided by the officers decides who deserves items.  In cases where all other things are equal, where no other determination exists, you try to let two (or more) people work it out themselves.  As a last resort, you flip a coin.  If for some reason Cantra and Vaxumgax are on a raid, both who have tirelessly given to the Shaman class and to Vision, and a great item dropped, I'd have absolute faith that first of all, they wouldn't need us to work it out.  Whatever Selan decided would sit well with either of them, and lacking his guiding hand, the two of them would be able to work it out.  In the rather unlikely event that I'm forced to work it out between the two of them, I'll simply make an arbitrary decision or flip a coin...  ...yes, you heard that right.  As a ~final~ solution and a last resort, I'd simply have one of 'em call it odd or even.<br>
<br>
Remember, none of our warrior are getting leftovers.  The gear that we've put on Allamar enables us to get better equipment than if we chose a pure /random strategy.  If the first 10 pieces of armor went to Allamar (which they didn't, but play along), then we're able to be more efficient in places like Temple of Veeshan.  Over the course of a few raids, we make up those 10 pieces and more for being a more efficient guild.  By giving up pieces in the short term to Allamar, all of our plate wearers benefit in the long term.<br>
<br>
A pure /random strategy doesn't enable a single tank to hold agro without becoming a liability.  With a BP on one tank, legs on another, arms on a third, and bracers on a 4th...  ....with no possibility for the warrior with a BP to get legs, since he has mediocre legs, and others in the guild have bad legs, no warrior ever stands out.  No warrior ever gets strong enough to make the raid efficient.<br>

Good god.  *tap tap*   Is this thing even on?<br>
<br>
Someone help me out here.<br>
<br>
For every guild the size of mine, the &quot;MA Tanking&quot; strategy is a necessity.  To not outfit a warrior (or a small group of warriors) ahead of the curve of equipment in your guild only decreases the overall ability of your guild to raise the average level of equipment in your guild.<br>
<br>
Every tank in Vision has better equipment because they sacrificed in this SHORT TERM for the LONG TERM benefit of equipping Allamar as best as possible.<br>
<br>
Having 20 mediocre dressed warriors is no substitute for 1 VERY WELL dressed warrior and 19 nearly-as-mediocre warriors.<br>
<br>
I do not care what strategy your guild, or any other guild on this server uses; but to stand up repeated and say that it doesn't make sense to equip Allamar first only shows that you don't understand how some encounters in the game MUST work. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
Is directed at me.<br>
<br>
What's interesting about this you say? <br>
<br>
Nowhere in this thread or the other longer faster stronger bionic thread did i say vision had a bad loot policy or that vision should change their loot policy. In fact, several times i said things to the effect of it works for you, good for you.<br>
<br>
The whole loot tangent in the conversation i was involved in was brought up by:<br>
<br>
&quot;What i've found to be the soundest policy for loot, especially on multiguild raids? If you help kill it and you will use it you deserve a shot at it like any other joe&quot;<br>
<br>
Which seems to me to be stating a personal opinion, not fact, not telling anyone they need to change their loot system to random roll.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, that one line catches responses like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Moral of the story: Open roll sucks. The only thing you are achieving by advocating this way of deciding loot is making yourself look like a loot whore.&quot;*<br>
<br>
Again Palimax, your system works for you, /cong. Your way is not the only way, and neither is mine.<br>
<br>

It only makes sense if you're aiming for a more time efficient method of improving the guild.  Crist0's attitude toward the game appears to be that everyone should have a chance at a reward if they put in work.  Sure it may take ten times as long but eventually your MT will be outfitted just as well as if you funnelled all loot to him in the first place -- it will simply take longer.  Remember, loot in this game doesn't rot from time or use! A different attitude toward playing the game doesn't make someone wrong.  They're willing to wait the extra 3 or 4 years it might take using /random before their MA is outfitted.  Why criticize someone for playing the game differently?<br>
<br>
As to your rhetorical question, guilds now at the top do MT loot first because it's the quickest way to the top.  Guilds that do totally random loot (or some other loot style) are likely still working their way up the chain.  Within 10 years or so though the landscape will be different and we can revisit your question at that time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uxeck.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xeck</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/18/02 7:35:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Your both right!</span><hr size=1> Your both right!  Here is why:<br>
<br>
Outfitting the MT is the best way to go IF that warrior is always there for the raids.<br>
If the MT is dealing with RL stuff, your raid is going to have to get along with a lesser equipped replacement than if you randomed.  <br>
<br>
So before a guild can go to the more efficient method of loot distribution, it must have a VERY reliable MT.<br>
<br>
If the MT isn't available, the raid is in deep trouble.<br>
