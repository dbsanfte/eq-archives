Sighing to herself why would anyone dare try and compete with a bard at tall tales, no matter, she could help this one.<br>
<br>
Moving quickly around the table of the young paladins, some more noble than others, she passed out drinks to those at the table, many slide a few coins to her. One overly zealous fellow, slapped her rear as she passed. "Wench, bring me another of the good mead." <br>
<br>
Rolling her eyes as she turned and headed back to the counter, she grabbed the glass the barkeep had prepared for this special fellow, and another full tray of Ale. The men seemed more thirsty than usual this evening, maybe that as a good sign, she thought. <br>
<br>
She returned to the table, and noticed the seasoned hero sitting off a bit from the others, his face the picture of calm. She thought she recognized this one, probably from some song or other she had learned, as he had the look of a hero about him.<br>
<br>
Pausing to set a fresh glass in front of him, she reached out and brushed his cheek as she removed the empty. It was a subtle movement, but obviously intentional, and solicited the desired result. He looked up and stared seemingly into her very soul. Casidy looked back at him and smiled, her eyes twinked as she spoke, "Come now, this is a time for making merry. I'll not allow melancoly here to abide." <br>
<br>
With that she returned to the bar, and filled up with a few more drinks for the remaining patrons. Stopping for a hug and pause at the table where Qwik, her favorite monk, happened to be proping his feet up on the table.<br>
<br>
"Hi there handsome," Casidy spoke as she slide a fresh glass to him.<br>

Perhaps it was simply the Father's Will.  But as the bard made her way through the room, beginning to pay more attention to the patrons than her, I reached for my blade, the room turning red in my rage.  &quot;TURN AND FACE ME!&quot; I would say.  &quot;NONE TURN FROM AEDARE AND LIVE!  IF YOU CANNOT FACE ME THROUGH WORDS, FACE ME THROUGH STEEL!&quot;<br>
<br>
But I didn't.<br>
<br>
Slowly, I pulled my hand away from the hilt of my claymore, and looked around, calming myself.  &quot;My hate is my shield,&quot; I whispered, and closed my eyes to calm myself.<br>
<br>
I saw Casidy, being watched by the patrons, being cheered on for her tale, simple though it was.  I saw the paladins sitting together, telling stories of their battles.  I even saw Vanlaan, in the companionship of one of his own - a fellow scholar, at least, if not a fellow dark elf.<br>
<br>
I was alone.<br>
<br>
I had no family, for I had turned from the Marrs to follow in the Father's path.  The Dismal Rage had never truly listened to me, no matter how I tried to heal the rift between them and Neriak, for I was a woman attempting to do a man's job.  I now wore the skin of a dark elf, which made all of Freeport my enemy, and yet the Spires saw that within my breast beat the heart of a human, and I was spurned.  Even Vanlaan saw me as a servant, not a companion.<br>
<br>
The hatred raged through my blood, but I kept it in check.  And in return, the Father showed me the truth.  I had not been following His path; I had been following the path that others had set for me.  L'vanon, greatest of the Dark Elves, had seen me as a way to build his armies, and then turned away when I failed.  Vanlaan saw me as a blade that he could use to regain... whatever he felt he had lost.  Once it was his sister.  Now it was his position.  He felt guilt for using me, and attempted to give me gifts, but he still needed me for his purposes.<br>
<br>
I was no longer a priestess.  I was a warrior for the Father.  Nothing else mattered, and it was time for me to accept that.<br>
<br>
Opening my eyes with a new clarity, I saw that all eyes were turned away from me, especially Vanlaan's.  Quietly, I gathered my supplies, and made my way from the inn. <p>Innoruuk Guides My Path,

It was good, that was just what Scaly needed to save him from his own thoughts.<br>
<br>
The 'dark one's' tale had a rythym to it, if a bit confusing, atleast to this paladin it was.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Watch and wait</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Valeron had said.  And so Scaly waited.  Waited and watched.  Shaking his head, and blinking hard he cleared what was before him and looked around.  <br>
<br>
All appeared normal, the tavern was full of life.  Everyone appeared to be engaged in some conversation or another..... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  except one</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  A lone 'dark one' was slowly rising and gathering their belongings as if to leave.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> interesting.....wasn't this one with another?  Two enter...one leaves....</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Amused, Scaly silently watches as Casidy's &quot;competition&quot; headed for the door. <p>Scaly<BR>

The slight whine from the hinges attest to the need for oil on them.  At first, the barest of outlines could be seen from the night sky.  Slowly, a figure emerges from the darkness.  His armor is of a green hue, but appears to be made of differing types.  At his right side is coiled a whip.  A set of fangs or perhaps talons hang from his left.  The pack he carries appears worn and weighted.<br>
<br>
As he makes his way in, he carefully closes the door.  Turning back around to move further into the room, he inadvertantly bumps into a Teir'dal who appears to be on her way out.  &quot;My apologies, lass.  I don't seem to have my normal legs right now&quot;, he offers with a tilt of his head.  She returns a scowl, but backs away a bit upon seeing the gaunt look in his eyes.  He hardly notices as he moves over to the bar.<br>
<br>
The barkeep casts a wary eye at the newcomer, but listens as he hears the request.  &quot;I'd like to get some hot brandy, please.  I'll be sitting over at that far table when it's ready.  I'll tip yer servant well if they'll bring it to me.&quot;  With that, he tosses a few coins on the counter and moves over to the empty table.  He takes his pack off and sets it next to a chair he eases into.<br>
<br>
The barkeep walks over to the fire and pulls a poker off the wall.  He sticks it in the coals and returns to his bar.  After filling a few other drink orders, he decants some brandy into a metal container of unknown composition.  He moves back over to the fire and takes the poker out of the coals, taps it against the inside of the fireplace to remove as much of the soot as possible, and sticks it inside the cup.  The sound of bubbling liquid can be heard and a steam rises from the cup, wafting about the room.  After the brandy is heated, the barkeep returns to the bar and pours it into a glass straining it through a cloth to remove any remaining debris.  The glass is placed on the counter while the barkeep motions for a pick up. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Final Destiny&gt;</B></FONT><BR>
