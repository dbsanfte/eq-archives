Its the best way for me to improve my skills.  I am REALLY bad at editing my own work, so tell me what is good, what is bad, what is ugly.  Let me know what could be taken out, and what should be expanded on.  Help me help you!<br><br>Anything I post here is a first draft...Like I said, I dont edit my own work much.  You see my writing in its most raw form.<br><br>Master of the Jade Hand is a part of the greater epic that I've come to think of as The Companions (something I previously tried to start, and failed).  The Companions is the history of the end of Norrath as we know it, brought about by a series of events that surround Ullric and his friends.  The Jade Hand is just part of what Ullric is.  Its definately not the first story in the Companions, and not the last...just somewhere in between.<br><br>Furthermore, I prefer a better fantasy than JUST EverQuest offers.  So some things will be much more realistic, just in the name of roleplaying.  NPCs are not always KoS, mobs that we normally use 12+ people to kill, a single man may fell in pairs or more.  Drakes from Temple of Veeshan are a good example.  A mob that takes a raid party to kill, a paladin may take two on at once, in the name of heroism.<br><br>Likewise, death is much more permanent, and instant.  Our heroes can be, at times, much more vulnerable than they are in game.  There is no zoning or camping out in reality.<br><br>All of that being said, I guess I'd better start?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/podside.jpg" ALIGN="left" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100><br><b>Ullric Littleblade</b><br>Assassin of Tides of Valor<br><A HREF="http://www.thesafehouse.org">Ayonae Ro Ring Warden</A><BR><i><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=83046">"Speed kills if y'know what I mean."</A></i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A> at: 11/30/01 6:49:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/30/01 7:58:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Capture.</span><hr size=1> The mountains near Kaladim had grown quiet as the afternoon wore on. Now that the sun was closing on the horizon, the silence was almost complete.  The only disturbance was a pair of travellers, moving at a languid pace among the gorges and valleys.  The two, both mounted, contrasted each other greatly, watched from a distance.<br><br>One moved slowly, almost carefully.  Little more than a vague manling shape under a long charcol cloak with a deep hood covering his bowed head.  He was larger though, than a normal man, and he nearly seemed asleep as he rocked with the motions of the magnificent beast beneath him, its coat nearly the same shade as its rider's cloak.<br><br>The other rider was much smaller, a dwarf in shining golden plate, he rode a white pony, scrambling over rocky slopes and moving in quick bursts, always scanning the area with wary green eyes.<br><br>Eventually, the cloaked man spoke, his voice a deep baritone, though he spoke softly, barely heard above the clatter of steel shod hooves on stone, &quot;Ever vigilant, Paladin.  Even so close to your own home?&quot;<br><br>The pony skidded down a slope as its short rider turned to face the larger, his auburn beard bristling, &quot;When in the company of thieves!&quot;<br><br>The larger man snorted, cutting him off.  He reigned his great mare in, looking up, revealing a handsome, if weary face, framed by brown hair and a beard, and highlighted by midnight blue facepaint in a swirling design skating across his left cheek.  &quot;We are going to have this conversation again?&quot;<br><br>The dwarf groaned, his steed also halting, &quot;Please Brell, no Ullric!  I'll not put up with another minute of your prattle of pillaging in the name of Gods!&quot;<br><br>Ullric smirked, &quot;You are lucky then, friend.  For this is where we part.&quot;<br><br>The dwarf looked around, recognition dawning on his ruddied face, &quot;So it is!  And time is late, so we must part quickly!&quot;<br><br>And they did, the dwarf moving north among the rocky lands, while Ullric headed east, under the eaves of the Faydark.  As they parted, the barbarian raised a hand to his companion, &quot;Fair well, Haak!  And remember, we meet here in two days time!&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> * * *</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><br>Under the eaves of the ancient forest, twilight came on rider and mount quickly.  The nearly black horse neighed restlessly, eyeing the darkness as it plodded along among the widely spaced trees.  Ullric patted her gracefully arched neck comfortingly, &quot;Be calm, my dear, and have Faith,&quot; He grinned at his own pun, and the horse snorted again, &quot;No harm will come to us in the Faydark.  We are guarded by the Protectors of the Glade.&quot;  The shadows seemed to shift at that moment, punctuating his comment.<br><br>Then the first arrow came.<br><br>Out of the darkness it whistled, its mark deadly.  Only the instincts of Ullric's steed, Faith, saved him, as she bucked suddenly, the arrow narrowly missing his head and striking the tree beyond him, sinking into the bark with a melodic thud.  Ullric shouted in alarm as Faith wheeled, both rider and mount searching for their assailant.  In Ullric's hands now were a shortbow, strung with an arrow nocked.  Faith's reigns lay slack around the horn of his saddle, and he guided her unconsciously with his knees.  Still no one, man or beast revealed themselves.<br><br>More arrows, barely heard as they cut through the air.  Faith sidled to the left, both of the new missles missing by narrow margins as Ullric returned fire into the darkness.  He nocked another arrow, realizing how desperite his fight was.<br><br>Another arrow, he was faster this time. Before this latest shot had even been sighted he loosed his own.  Ullric was rewarded with a thin cry of pain, followed by his own grunt.  Looking down, the barbarian blinked at the arrow shaft protruding from the left side of his ribs.<br><br>More arrows shot from the darkness.  The rogue swayed uneasily in his saddle, the bow clattering from his hands as he grabbed for the saddle horn, trying to keep his balance as Faith danced about.<br><br>Despite her deft maneuvering, two more arrows struck the warhorses' master.  She felt his weight slump against her neck, and she snorted in anger at the darkness, foam frothing from her muzzle as she challenged the unknown attackers.  They replied, lithe humanoid figures garbed in the shades of the forest.  She reared, lashing out with steel shod hooves, and one fell.<br><br>But to her alarm, the mare felt the comforting weight of her master and companion slide from her back.  She wheeled, but was too late, the figures already slipping into the darkness with him.<br><br>Faith stood in the darkness of the Faydark, legs stiff, breathing heavily, rage filling her breast.  Her master was taken, what was she to do? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A> at: 12/2/01 9:23:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uzeezromdraxon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeezrom Draxon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/30/01 2:39:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Capture.</span><hr size=1> Encore!   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~Zee!@#<br>Grand Master of the Sideways Run<br>Proud Elder of Legend of the Jokers<br><img src=http://members.home.net/crux/zeeplaysig.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/2/01 9:05:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Judgement.</span><hr size=1> Consciousness returned to Ullric slowly.  First a dull roar, like a distant ocean rumbling deep inside him.  It faded with the darkness, dulling to a light gray.  When he finally opened his eyes, the roar had receeded to a vague feeling; a light breeze filling the room.  He was on his back, looking up at wooden ceiling beams as sunlight slanted across his vision.<br><br>He sat up quickly, remembering what had happened, and instantly regretted it.  White hot bolts of pain raced through him, and his hands went to his stomach.  He looked down, his broad chest was wrapped in bandages, and soaked through in two spots with crimson.  More flashes of pain told him there was a similar spot on his lower back, and one near his right shoulderblade.<br><br>&quot;So you're awake.&quot;  Ullric looked up, body tensing and bringing forth more bolts of agony, causing him to groan and the world to swim before his eyes.  When his vision cleared, he recognized the man standing at the door to his room...and the bars that made up the door, or cell, rather.<br><br>He was human, garbed in shades of green, framed by a cloak of deeper green.  His blond hair was swept back from chisled features, and tied at the nape of his neck by a thin leather band.  He would have been handsome, if not for the eyepatch, covering his right eye.  Maybe he still was.  Finally, Ullric spoke, &quot;Aracelt...How long have I been asleep?  Where am I?&quot;<br><br>Aracelt winced slightly, &quot;Seven days you've been unconscious, my friend.  Haak sent word when you did not return to meet him, and I arrived 3 days ago.  You are being held in Kelethin, by the Protectors of the Glade.&quot;<br><br>Ullric blinked in suprise, &quot;Held?&quot;<br><br>Aracelt nodded, &quot;Until your execution, for crimes against Tunare.&quot;<br><br>&quot;For what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thats what the proclomation stated.  Crimes against Tunare.  The execution is scheduled to be the first midday after you awake.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What time is it?&quot;<br><br>Aracelts hands tightened around the bars, his knuckles growing white, another sign of his worry, &quot;About 9 in the morning.&quot;<br><br>Ullric hesitated, considering this, &quot;Has anyone else arrived?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Scarabae arrived under darkness, last night. She currently resides in the House of Gently.  She hasnt been out since she got here.&quot;<br><br>Ullric nodded, &quot;What do you make of all this?&quot;<br><br>Aracelt shrugged and opened his mouth to reply, but before he could, he was shoved aside, replaced by a wood elf guard, &quot;Stand and be prepared to meet the High Council of Kelethin, dog!&quot;<br><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> * * *</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><br>Ullric grunted, stifling his pain as he was shoved forward roughly again.  He was garbed in loose brown robes, his hands tied before him.  Every movement brought more pain to his wounds, and the handling the guards were given him wasnt helping.  Another shove brought him to his knees, his head bowed, a sheen of sweat covering his face.<br><br>&quot;The infamous Ullric Littleblade.&quot;  Ullric looked up towards the melodic tenor voice.  Before him was a wood elf lord, dressed in the finest cured leather the rogue had ever seen. His fine brown hair was combed back, with neat, tight braided strands framing his pointed ears.  His features could only be described as beautiful.  Around him, arrayed in a broad semi circle, were eight more finely dressed wood elfs, though none with the splendor of the man in the center.  They all stared at Ullric expentantly, though he refused to reply.<br><br>The guard behind Ullric planted a foot roughly on his shoulder, and he toppled forward, trying in vain to catch himself with bound hands.  He lay on the smooth wood of the hall, breathing heavily, attempting to control the pain.  He could hear them laughing lightly at his pain.  A female spoke up, the humor obvious in her tone, &quot;Infamous. He doesnt seem nearly as dangerous as he's been made out to be.&quot;  Her voice sounded familiar to the rogue, too familiar.  He could almost see her out of the corner of his eye...just a graceful form, and red hair, with a touch of gray.<br><br>The man in the center sighed, when he spoke up again, he almost sounded frustrated, &quot;Well lets get on with this.  Ullric Littleblade, you've been charged with crimes against Tunare and the Faydark, too countless to name.  Cheif among these is the willful poisoning of the land, and an attempted alliance with Berttoxxolus to aid in your efforts.  How do you plead to these charges?&quot;<br><br>Ullric did nothing, other than slowly rise back to his feet, keeping his eyes on the floor.  A long minute passed, Ullric remained tense, awaiting another blow from behind before the man at the head of this group spoke again, &quot;Your silence is taken as admittance of guilt.  You have been judged guilty of these crimes.  You are hereby sentenced to death, to be carried out at midday, today.  Take him away.&quot;<br><br>Ullric was wrenched to his feet and dragged from the room.  He remained silent, behind him, a quiet murmur arose as the counsil began their gossip. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uzeezromdraxon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeezrom Draxon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/3/01 12:52:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judgement.</span><hr size=1> lovin it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <p>~Zee!@#<br>Grand Master of the Sideways Run<br>Proud Elder of Legend of the Jokers<br><img src=http://members.home.net/crux/zeeplaysig.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucreeklass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>creeklass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/3/01 6:58:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judgement.</span><hr size=1> I agree.

From the shadows in front of the caged door of his room, Ullric judged he had an hour until midday. Maybe less.  A pair of travelworn leather boots crossed his field of vision, and the barbarian looked up from where he sat against the back wall of his cell.<br><br>Standing before him was another wood elf, his long blond hair tied back into a pony tail that fell to his waist. His skin was tanned as much as any other, but to the rogue, his skin tone was darker, almost sinister. He wore no cloak, but a breastplate of shining mithril over a long sleeved green tunic, and simple leather leggings.  Slung at his waist were a pair of wicked looking longswords, with ornate silver handguards wreathing the laquered black hilts.  Ullric recognized him on sight.  &quot;Guard Captain Elowyrn.&quot;<br><br>The man smirked, &quot;Ullric.  Long time no see.&quot;<br><br>Ullric grinned wryly, &quot;Not since you kicked me out of your city two years ago.&quot;<br><br>Elowyrn slowly wrapped his hands around the bars of the cell door, &quot;Yes, it seems longer.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Does it?  Seems like just yesterday to me.&quot;<br><br>The elf glared, &quot;I should have killed you when I had the chance.&quot;<br><br>Ullric chuckled, &quot;Looks like you do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed.&quot;  Elowyrn turned his head, &quot;Guards!  Prepare the prisoner.&quot;<br><br>Two guards entered the room, pulling Ullric to his feet by his arms.  They quickly made sure his bonds were secure before tying the loose brown robes to his limbs, so that no clothing swung freely from his body.  Once this was done, he was pushed into the dappled sunlight.<br><br>Up and down ramps, over crowded and empty plazas and platforms, he was lead, through the winding tree city of Kelethin.  Everywhere they went, people stared with subdued anger and fear.  Ullric kept his eyes on the back of the guard in front of him.  Occasionally curses were flung at him in elvish that he only half understood.  Presently they convoy reached its destination.<br><br>The large platform was teeming with wood elfs, all there to witness the event.  The crowds murmur rose to a fever pitch as Ullric was led through them to a cleared area, where he was roughly shoved up against the wide bole of the tree the platform was built around.  There he was held as four guards wound cord around the tree, binding him securly in place.  For the first time since leaving his cell, Ullric looked up, his pale blue eyes scanning the crowd.<br><br>Most of the onlookers shied away from his gaze, but he picked out a half dozen who didnt, all familiar faces.<br><br>Aracelt was there, his bow strung and propped over his shoulder non-chalantly.<br><br>A pair of half elfs, resplendant in blue armor, trying their best to look inconspicuous, but on the whole failing.  Faranor and Poldar.<br><br>Another half elf leaning against the wall of a building built at the edge of the platform.  His cloaked form was hidden mostly in shadow.  Skotti.<br><br>A human, standing by himself, a satisfied lear on his face.  Zommy.<br><br>And standing nearly in the front of the crowd, so he could view the event, was Haak.<br><br>At the end of the platform, across a lane cleared of crowd, Elorwyrn stood, holding a black laquered recurve bow, strung with an arrow nocked.  Even at thirty paces, Ullric noted the black fletching.  Across the crowd, he could hear someone shouting above the din.  He couldnt make out any words, but the rogue recognized the voice as that of the head of Kelethin's High Council.  The crowd roared, and Elowyrn raised his hand in recognition of their approval.  Eventually, they quieted, and after a long pause, the elf raised the bow, pulling back the string until the arrow fletching rested next to his cheek.<br><br>Ullric watched his doom patiently, prepared to accept the death he had so often cheated.  Time seemed to draw out, the murmur of the crowd silencing around him, the edges of his vision blurring as the Captain of the Guard came into crystal sharp focus.  Elowyrn blinked once, and took in a deep breath.  This was it.<br><br>Reality crashed back into him in one breathless jolt.  Seemingly from nowhere, a white fletched arrow struck the blackened bow just above where Elowyrn held it.  Elowyrn cried out in suprise, the force of the impact pushing the bow down and to the left as he released his own arrow, which struck the wooden floor of the platform with a quiet thud, drown out by the roar of the crowd.  Ullric looked around in suprise, but found Aracelt standing as stunned as him, bow still on his shoulder.<br><br>Haak was the first to spring into action, as chaos erupted around them. He lept forward, drawing a slim knife and slicing the cords binding Ullric in one uppercut sweep.  Ullric stumbled, but Haak was there to catch him, sliding the shiv into his palm as he did so.  Already Elowyrn was rushing forward, closing the distance between them.  He drew his wickedly keen longswords, aptly named Guard of the Fay.  Ullric knew he stood no chance against him with just the small dagger he wielded.<br><br>Yet before the captain could reach him, another stepped into his path.  Smaller than him, the female form wielded lightning and steel in her hands, bringing the flashign weapons to bear on the charging man.  Elowyrn only just saved himself from her initial assault, and recovered quickly.  Ullric knew at a glance that the woman, her face covered by a full helm carved in a grim, stoic visage, was the legendary Warderess, Scarabae, Lady Gently.<br><br>Haak shouted a warning, only just in time, Ullric found himself backpedalling from another assaulting guard, who swung a rapier in clumsy strokes at the skilled rogue.  Behind and to his right, the barbarian could hear friendly voices, calling for his aid.  One quick riposte and the guard fell, bleeding badly from the neck.  Ullric scooped up the fallen elfs rapier and looed around.<br><br>Chaos had ensued on the platform.  The crowds were panicked and rioting, amid them he saw three half elfs, a bastion among the angry swirl of the crowd.  The larger man began making his way towards them, shouldering his way easily through the crowd.  He had covered half the distance when he looked around again, catching his bearings.  A flash of light caught his eye, and he found Scarabae again, at odds with Elowyrn still, now dueling near the edge of the platform.  Her green scaled armor was scored and scratched in several places, and he was bleeding from a deep cut to the thigh, but neither was lagging in ferocity.  For a moment, Ullric was torn in his course of action.<br><br>Then she stumbled.  Elowyrn captiolized on her error, pressing forward as she tried in vain to fend off his blows.  Ullric surged through the crowd, heedless of his own danger.  He saw her stumble again, and Elowyrn pounced, bringing one of his blades down on the defenseless ranger.<br><br>Not fast enough, for at that moment, Ullric was upon him.  The shiv in his left hand stabbed into Elowyrn's attacking forearm, giving only when it struck bone.  The elf yelped in suprise, twisting his hand and pulling the dagger from Ullric's grip.  Ullric's momentum carried him forward, colliding with the smaller man.  In the close quarters, he could not defend himself from the guard captain, who brought up the other blade, half to strike, half to defend himself.
