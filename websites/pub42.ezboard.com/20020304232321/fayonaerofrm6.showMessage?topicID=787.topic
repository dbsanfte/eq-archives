Are we?<br>
There's no doubt in my mind that entertainment has always been consistent, only evolving in the forms it takes. Theatre, Sport, Radio, Television, Comuter games..<br>
As society changes, so does the face of entertainment. But the frequency and involvment of entertainment in everyday life never changes, it merely.. evolves.<br>
I hold an extreme opinion on this subject, as coming from a home, family, and prety much an area/society/town that doesn't see much of the online world, it makes it ever so hard for me to spend the time I wish playing EverQuest. And I feel as if I'm prety safe in suggesting that frequent players of EverQuest in our community also face the scrutiny of being told that we just play too much Computer Games.<br>
So let me lay my cards on the table.<br>
History: I've always been a social person, going out all through secondary school (highschool), college and university, involved in activities, belonging to healthy relationships and growing up in a strong family that appreciate the usual social aspects of life, such as interaction, community actitivies etc. <br>
And then one hot, summers day (sounds good, I don't actually have any evidence to suggest it was), I stumble upon EverQuest in my local Electronic Botique store. I've never been too fussed on the internet, although my family did have an internet able computer which I had ocassionaly used to go on chat rooms and to get the hang of word documents and such.<br>
So I load it up, and.. love it. Being, well younger than I am now and a bit more responsibility-free, my friends and family never took much notice when I'd start spending several evenings a week playing it, for long periods.<br>
It became something I really enjoyed, a form of entertainment, of relief from college work, a different form of interaction after an extremely nasty relationship, and just a basic chance to relax, kick back, and have a laugh.<br>
EverQuest has become something I do the most. It's become an activity I do practically every single day. I'm not a house wife, jumping on during the day, an unemployed bachelor, a happily married partner - playing extensively with my better half, I'm just your average, run of the mill, three nippled young citizen. I have no excuse to play the game from boredom or pressure, from disability or disfunction. I just like it.<br>
Now, let's take on an outsiders perspective. A perspective of those who do not play EverQuest, do not play online games. Are not concerned with the internet, even. <br>
They don't understand that it is a form of entertainment. They don't see it as we do, as a chance to meet new people, to have real fun, with other real people. They can't see how it can gain attention for hours a day, days a week, weeks a month.. years even. They cannot percieve why you would become irritable when asked to stop playing, to come offline, or when you would put off real life events for it.<br>
Dare we explain that eventually finding a group, only to loose it to the reality of life and responsibility is an annoying thing? That when you're the main crowd controller and the washing up has to wait? That real people depend on you? That it may be 'just' a game and not real life, but it is also a real consumer of real people's time and patience? Dare we, incase we face the ridicule of 'social life'?<br>
When being scrutinized by the outsider, you'll often hear such words as:<br>
Fresh air; day light; exercise; friends; life; wasting. These words will serve as a form of ideaology, as pressure to convince you that the air in the room performs its job worse than the air of the outside world, where it is fresh and somehow is better for you. <br>
Let me shed some light so you can understand my frustration with you, Outsider_01. <br>
You play golf. Let's say you play 18 holes one day, with some collegues or friends. You're hitting the 9th hole, got a few pars and possibly a birdie or two under your sleeve, but all of a sudden.. you have to stop and do something else. Annoyed? Tough shit.. you can't play golf for hours at a time! Get a grip! It's just a form of entertainment! And no, I don't give a flying fuck if it's out in the sun or not, where the air happens to be 'fresher'.<br>
Do people who watch Television for an equal amount of time you play EverQuest hold any substatial ground when grilling you on playing EverQuest for the entire evening?<br>
Perhaps the reason why some people percieve playing EverQuest for hours at a time as crazy, is because they do not realise that it is merely another form of Entertainment, something the world is not familiar enough with. <br>
I'm going to stop here, as my post is prety 'all over the place' and I don't have any actual sort of structured argument going on here. But please let me know what you think. Are the people that play EverQuest like a, god forbid, hobby.. addicted? Are they sad? Not normal? Are the EverQuest community rightfully open to scrutiny because it's not healthy, not the norm?<br>
Or am I right in suggesting that there is nothing wrong with playing something a lot, because you like it. That you can justifiably spend all evening on a computer game - not having to tell people that you do it because it's something you like to do, instead of sport or 'clubbing'.<br>

Not that thats a bad thing, but honestly, thats exactly what it is.<br>
<br>
Are we obsessed? Id say so, yes. Is it our fault? Well, not entirely.<br>
<br>
Think back to every game you've played.<br>
<br>
I'll start with one of the first I played (because I cant remember the names of some of the atari ones off my head)<br>
<br>
Lets take Super Mario Bro. for instance - Old school, Nintendo.<br>
<br>
You could sit down, play it, beat it, and go back to watching TV. well, if you were an uber gamer at the time.<br>
<br>
How have games as a whole evolved from that time? There are 2 major differences in Mario Bro. and EQ.<br>
<br>
1) Multiple Real Life players living in a semi-real world environment.<br>
   EQ is a world of people, with similar interests - there are many sub-traits to this, some being<br>
a) Most folks played D&amp;D at some point in there life and/or are interested in Fantasy-based storylines and the interaction with such themes.<br>
b)Guilds become families, friends become family. Some of the most intuitive and funny people ive ever known live in EQ. Sure, I can call them, or email them - or even visit them every once in awhile - but EQ provides a meeting place for your neo-family, giving a common ground for both entertainment and friendly chatting.<br>
<br>
Now - the other factor that seperates EQ from the majority of other games.<br>
2) Complication.<br>
In almost every game, there lies one target, one boss, one main plot with one main goal.  Lets apply this scenario to life. Imagine you wake up one day, and you have to go off to Bumblefuck, USA and kill Joe Shmoe and steal his left handed smoke shifter.<br>
<br>
So you start by killing some yard trash, you get enough lunch money from beating up little kids, you go buy a baseball bat, and you beat Joe Shmoe like a red-headed step child, retrieve the smoke shifter, and w00t! Its done. You're life's destiny accomplished.<br>
<br>
So what now? Well, Joe's dead, the world is safe. So what the hell do you do with your life? You live happily ever after - doing yard work while the Mrs's goes shopping.<br>
<br>
So how did EQ get away from that? They made it real life. You dont have one goal in EQ, you have a ton of goals. there will always be something you havent done - a road you will never travel. theres simply too many things to accomplish in one sitting. You die and lose exp...you scream - but what if you never lost exp? The first couple of times you died, you'd jump for joy. But eventually, all you would worry about is losing your corpse, and you'd go on suicide runs everywhere.<br>
<br>
Mario Bros wasnt complicated.  Waste king koopa, its time for a coke and a smile.<br>
<br>
EQ? There are no winners. And, despite uber gear, uber players, and uber everything else - Everyone has the freedom to customize their lives, and EVERYONE can achieve something better than the best Equipped, best played character in the game - whoever that may be.<br>
<br>
So are we addicted? Yes, and rightfully so. The next time Outsider_01 pisses you off, just say &quot;/rude %t&quot; and see what he says.<br>
<br>
Now, if you'll excuse me, Im going to go pop some valiums.<br>

I try to explain how 50 people have planned their day around ME and I can NOT just turn off the computer. <br>
<br>
Even my husband...who is a DIE HARD 1st person shooter gamer, sometimes gets upset that &quot;No I can't come upstairs at this very moment because we are just about to take on the King in chardok and I'm the main tank&quot; comes out of my mouth instead of &quot;Yes Dear&quot;.   I just want to scream sometimes....&quot;Your games have PAUSE ...Mine DON'T....GET OVER IT&quot;.<br>
<br>
I try to take the time to explain things...Really I do.  But damn it, some days people in my RL get me 2 inches from climbing a tower and takin' some people out.  <br>
<br>
Ok, maybe not 2 inches...but damn it...I could climb a tower...<br>
<br>
...mostly anyways, I mean, I hate heights.  But I could go off just the same.  I don't have a gun, well I have a nerf gun.  And believe me....those little styrofoam arrow-thingys can hurt.  I mean, if I actually got up on a tower and shot one at someone.  Wouldn't the gravity effect work?  I mean, maybe if I got like Empire State building high, and just dropped one of the little arrow-thingy's off the top...it could do some damage.  Of course I wouldn't be able to look off the edge, so I'd mostly be throwing it blindly off the roof but...it could possibly manage to hit someone.  Maybe.  So...DON'T SET ME OFF, I'm a ticking time bomb of fury...ya...that's it...THATS the TICKET.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><HTML><BODY>

The funny part is regular EQ players have a busier social life than &quot;normal&quot; people.  The average person doesn't have social engagements scheduled 5 days a week where dozens of people show up.  If EQ was something we had to leave the house to do, like going to a gym or a club, it probably wouldn't get nearly the raised eyebrows.  People just assume that since you can do something at home, it's not nearly as important as anything else you could possibly be doing.  I run into the same attitude when I'm attempting to work at home -  some people seem to think that if there is no boss standing over your desk you can do whatever you want with no repercussions.  The worst part is the attitude that since you're in your home and the other person has taken it upon themselves to leave their home and come to you, their wishes and time are somehow more important than your own. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

The upside to EQ is that you have interaction with the outside world.  I live in a small town and there isn't much to do.  I used to whine to my husband about playing a "game" too much and not spending enough time with me, so what does he do?  Buys me a computer and the game.  I have more fun playing this "game" than watching TV.  We have no children and work in a factory 3rd shift so our party life is slim anyway.  Most people who complain do not see the social part of the game.  They just hear the word "game" and block the rest out.  My friends have finally given up debating this point with me.  They think I am silly and that we have no life, but they just go home and watch the latest cool show on TV.  At least I have a conversation with people of all different cultures and see different aspects of people instead of just watching premade life situations.  I have delt with friends ingame who have rl health issues and different problems and no I can't fix them, but I have been an ear for them when they just have a lot on their chest and need to talk.  To me there is something to say about that.<br>

- That's a prime example. The outsider_01 doesn't seem to understand that EverQuest cannot be merely 'left' at any given moment. Sure, if my person was required elsewhere and I were playing on a playstation 2, for example, then I'd glady hit pause as NO real life people would be dependent on me on some other side of the world. <br>
Because my family and friends are extremely alien towards any type of online game, they are too ignorant to take notice that there are REAL PEOPLE in the game. I think if they were to only understand that the game rightfully competes as a substitute to real life activities and interactions, involving more people from more cultures than my immediate friends and family have ever met, if they could only grasp and understand this fact, than there would be no threat of argument or misunderstanding about the fascination or time consumation that EverQuest demands and ensnares. <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>

I have had the same problems.  "You don't have any friends"  I have like a 100 on here I talk to all the time.  "Just turn it off"  It doesn't work that way.  "Its only a game"  Well true, but the other people on this raid who will be sorely pissed off and inconvienced by me needing a gate out 5 mins after we got here are my friends.<br>

My parents constantly tell me im on to long or something around that but there sitting on there happy butts watching some stupid TV show all day and night they make the excuse that they dont want to waste money on entertainment but we know they just want to sit back and relax and watch the tube well thats exactly what im doing but in a more constructive form i get to interact with people and do things i cant do in RL.  <br>
They let me play of course but they limit my time to a REALLY annoying rate they think i can play EQ 1hour a day all week i mean GOD thats gay it takes 10mins to log in 10 to 20 mins to find out what you wanna do or whats going on and 10 to 15mins getting to the place you need to go thats not including the time you have to sit at zone sayin 60 gravelord LFG over and over for to much time so basically id be loggin in finding out whats going on then loggin off ;/ now thats what i call gay.<br>

For example, my wife thinks nothing of starting a conversation with me while I'm madly trying to respond to 13 tells right before a raid starts.<br>
<br>
Her perception is that since I'm not actually vocalizing what I'm typing, I must not really be communicating.  She's never interrupted one of my phone calls nor walked in on me and my friends and began her own conversation.  She just doesn't understand that what I'm doing is social in it's own way.<br>
<br>
The circle of friends you have in EQ is a difficult concept to grasp for those not immersed in online gaming.  My wife likes to hang out with her girlfriends and chat, eat, whatever.  I just happen to like hanging out in Sebilis with my friends while killing some nasties.  It's really no different in my mind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=riotgirl>riotgirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/8/02 11:43:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=787.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *yawns* I present the ever-repeated debate..[Long]</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They let me play of course but they limit my time to a REALLY annoying rate they think i can play EQ 1hour a day all week<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The reason as to why your parents set these seemingly arbitrary, fascist ground-rules is because they habour the long desired wish to see their son graduate one day, and find gainful employment other than uttering, &quot;Would you like fries with that?&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
There is a stigma attached to all forms of interaction based on the 'net, whether this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> interaction</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> expresses itself through online gaming or chat-rooms. Net based interactions are somehow less 'authentic' than those formed in the 'real world'. Likewise activities.<br>
<br>
-- ***** How rather peculiar. A strange sense of deja vu just washed other me as if I have typed this post before .. ***** --<br>
<br>
As touched upon in Sorcha's concise and perceptive post, EverQuest is a 'computer game'; as such, is automatically rendered trivial and lacks any validity compared to other forms of entertainment e.g. any physical game/activity, having cathode rays burn an image of Jerry Springer in one's retina, fooling around outside with the babysitter or even passing around the crack pipe. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Your games have PAUSE ...Mine DON'T....GET OVER IT&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Exactly. As others have already expressed, detractors are quick to miss out the incredibly high level of interaction with other players. Like Blearchie said, if all the players were NPCs controlled by a computer AI, I doubt if I would stick around for long.<br>
<br>
As for partners .. well, women are just alien-sex-fiends from Venus. Apparently <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The analogy works just as well if you substitute the sex and the planet. Probably better. I really do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> understand them. They demand that you make a gap in your schedule to spend time and devote attention to them and then works themselves up into a towering Jesus based frenzy when you grope them between medding, waiting for a rez, port or CR, and twiddling your thumbs whilst camping x mob for y item, which has 0.1223489% chance of loading per 14 hours and which will inevitably be KS'ed.<br>
<br>
Having your partner storm off in a huff to jam with Ani [DeFranco] is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> bad</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> idea. Needless to say that Riotgirl is currently single.<br>

- Ex-fucking-actly. And agreeing immensley with what Riotgirl posted, well.. not towards the end where you went slightly crazy about being single and obviously making some sort of reference to a bad break up, people who cannot relate, don't try.<br>
These are the people that have never picked up a joypad or typed on a keyboard before. Those that have no idea what E-mail is, or what 'lol' means. For them, sitting in one spot and playing EverQuest for hours seems like a mundane task for the boring. They see no appeal, so they don't TRY to understand it. The attitude is ignorant, it's annoying.<br>
It's fine to play sport all day long.. but not an online roleplaying game because you're sitting in one chair, inside, not interacting. <br>

<br>
It's no accident so many people play the game frantically for a year or a few, and then leave a hateful farewell-message stating that one have to be a total loser to play this worthless game. Of course those people are wrong, the statements are too silly to even consider since they have played so long themselves. Yet, those statements should not be disregarded. While they are not true, they are not lies either. They are outcries of emotional pain, not rational statements.<br>
<br>
I think the problem with MMORPG:s are twofold.<br>
The addictiveness and the alienation from the outside world.<br>
<br>
As have been mentioned, the game is kinda addictive in itself, and it gets much much worse by the facts that you can not pause and that you are letting down real people, real friends if you don't do your part. The game also offers a gig social enviorment in a world where people live stressful lives and RL friends often have higher priorities then you. Work, school, spouses, all that. All in all, the game make you dependent on it and make you lose some of your control of your own life. This lead to the same combination of love and hate that are often found in RL families.<br>
<br>
Secondly, once a huge time of your time is dedicated to the game and to your real friends in the game, it alienate you from your non-EQ friends and aquaintenses.<br>
<br>
First, it takes a lot of your time in ways that are partly out of your control, and thus your other friends find you unaviable in many ways. My friends really hated when they called and I was just mumbling to them while attending my group or raid, and I later got to feel the same kind of resentment myself. (Combined with the horrifying revelation &quot;oh no, I was like that&quot;.)<br>
<br>
Second, like Halo said, the sum of the entertainment is constant. Play 20 hours of EverQuest compared to 20 hours of giving 10 movies or single player games 2 hours each.<br>
<br>
Now first put this into the perspective of &quot;what does this, in itself, give me?&quot;. We will all respond that EverQuest gives more. It's interactive and it's social, while the alternatives are solitary and basically non-interactive. Single player games are interactive as opposed to movies, but the interaction is stale since you are interactive with solid predefined parameters, as oppsoed to the social dynamics of the EQ player base.<br>
<br>
But now lets put this into another perspective! What does the entertainment give you to talk about with your non-EQ friends? When we think about it we will find that EACH movie and single player game will give us more to mindlessly babble about then the entire 20h EverQuest episode, unless it's the first time you tell about the game as such. The surface of EQ is kinda bleak and people who have not played themselves cannot understand the subtilities or are at least not interested in them. Many will also be un-understanding on a deeper level, finding the whole thing to be creepy and act accordingly. <br>
<br>
Please note that I say non-EQ friends, not RL friends. I remember when Kivorn and I worked together. We had a lot of fun, talked about stats and levels and zones and guilds and tactics and all that all the time. But while we enjoyed it, we grove more and more isolated from the rest of the company, who probably considered us crazy or something. To a outsider, EQ-talk do sound like a very strange mix. Algebra crossed with something that sometimes sound like fantasy and sometimes like reality, and have some really creepy elements of death and dark ocultism.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I borrow the phone? I am a shadowknight in the service of the god of hate. Normally I can feign death, but this time I was not fast enough, so I died for real. I need to call a friend so he can come and ressurect me.&quot; <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I try, try my damndest to explain to him that I cant just leave the group with our monk LD, he'll get raped!  Not to mention the cleric with horrid packet loss!<br>
<br>
I happen to have a good, very close friend in game who has started to take the liberty to call me and my other friend over here in New york when she lives in California, and my parents toss me odd, sidelong glances of curiosity and puzzlement when I tell them that someone I met in EQ is on the phone with me.<br>
<br>
I equate EQ to life where you can do whatever you want.  I think that's what kind of captured me in it, the fact that I can fuck around on my bard, druid or paladin and either quest or get EXP.<br>
<br>
I know we're not insane, and as I sit here talking with someone I've known so long that people have actually mistaken us for IRL brother and sister, whom I just found out played EQ, I realize that EQ has provided me with more opportunities to meet and make friends than I would dare chance in my introverted real life.<br>
<br>
But have your internet stripped from you and you'll find that you're not really bent on playing the game, Kiradure has been at 53 for well over a month with no significant EXP advancement and I only play a few hours a week if at all, and only at a friend's house.  I think more about my ex girlie than EQ.
