<br>
   Sunlight poured through the Butcherblock Mountains.  Glimmering drops of dew fell from long strands of grass, and squirrels played in the nearby trees.  The sight was so beautiful it almost made Worin forget what was about to take place. Almost.  The dwarven army was preparing for battle just outside of Kaladim, their grand mountain city.  Outfitted in magical armor crafted by his grandfather years ago, and wielding his father’s powerful falchion, Worin felt unstoppable.  The line for the blessings of the clerics took nearly an hour for him to get through.  When it was his turn, he heard the priests chanting their magical words, and for a few seconds he was surrounded by a blue aura.  His troop consisted of 3 warriors, powerful dwarves wielding axes forged from velium ore, 2 battle clerics, to heal wounds if anyone was to get injured, and himself, a holy paladin.  Worin wasn’t extraordinarily tall, even for a dwarf.  He had shoulder length brown hair, and a long beard in customary dwarven style.  Him muscles bulged from the strength spells the priests had casted, though he now felt a little nervous about the upcoming battle.  It was rumored that there were a thousand ogres stationed outside the mountains in Dagnors Cauldron, and that they had support from the goblins.  Worin wasn’t so much worried by the goblins; he had been hunting them for all his life.  They infested the mountains, and despite how many they exterminated they still kept coming.  They were weak, but some of them had powerful spells that could incapacitate even the strongest of dwarves.  The call finally came to get into battle positions.  Hiding in a ditch dug into the side of a hill, they would ambush the ogres from all sides.  The ground started to shake slightly. Gradually it got louder and stronger until it felt like there was an earthquake tearing the city apart.  When it ceased, Worin could hear words being exchanged between the dwarven king, Kazon Frostreaver VIII, and an ogre general.  Suddenly, the ogre yelled and pointed a great spear at the 300 dwarves before him.  That was the signal for the hidden forces to attack.  When Worin jumped out, he got his first look at an ogre, 1000 of them in fact.  They were massive, pale green creatures, about 3 times the size of a dwarf. At least 300 of them were on horseback, and they all carried massive spears.  As the ogres on horses charged, huge wooden stakes were pulled out of the freshly planted earth and held steadily by the strongest dwarves.  Horses plowed into the sharp sticks and ogres were flung off and promptly killed by swarms of dwarves.  Worin’s troop sprinted at the ogre army along with the other 300 dwarves that had been hidden.  They reached the beasts and were greeted by spearheads plunging into their front lines.  Worin blinded 10 of the beasts with a spell that created a massive flash of light.  Chopping at their knees until they fell wasn’t proving extremely effective, but there was no other option.  Worin hacked and slashed at the mighty beasts until they fell.  The clerics spells had proven more effective than expected; all spears directed at him were deflected away without fail. The dwarves altogether weren’t fairing too well.  After an hour of combat, the ogres had lost 400, and the dwarves had lost 300.  Minutes later, the ogre general shouted to the ogres the order to retreat to camp.  The dwarves cheered as the ogres fled into the forest.  Looking around for the first time, Worin saw the horrible damage done.  Dwarves and ogres alike lay broken and bloody on the ground.  Dismembered limbs were scattered on the ground, resting in pools of blood.  Seeing the faces of his fellow dwarves, some friends, even the ones he didn’t care for was too much for him.  Darkness overcame him, and he fell in a heap on the ground.<br>
<br>
     Worin awoke lying on a table in the medical center of Kaladim.  He slowly sat up, feeling immense pain in his left arm and chest.  He looked down and saw red stained bandages wrapped around deep wounds.  Looking around him, he saw clerics rushing around, keeping extremely busy with patients.  “Ahh, your awake.”  Worin looked around and saw a gnome looking at him.  “Your not hurt too horribly.  A couple of days with the regeneration spell we cast and you’ll be running like a clock.  But only one a gnome made, the elvish clocks are much too unreliable, wouldn’t you say?”  Worin stared at him for a few seconds, and then said, “Sure, if you say so.  So I can get out of here now?”  The gnome nodded and replied, “Your armor is under the table, and there is a pile of weapons we found on a table just outside.  Yours might be there, if the goblin scavengers didn’t take it first.”  Worin nodded in thanks and pulled out the box of armor under his bed.  Pulling on the chestplate, he noticed 3 runes on the inside he had never noticed before.  Upon closer inspection, he saw they were glowing slightly.  Anxious to see if his father’s sword was there, he paid the runes no attention, and put the rest of the armor on.  As he approached the table, he instantly saw the weapon.  It seemed to stick out, almost as if it was drawing him to it.  It was a beautiful falchion, a mithril blade with runes carved down the middle.  On the hilt was a red pommel jewel, that gave him great fighting prowess.  He put the sword in his sheath and slung his shield over his back.  The medical center wasn’t far from his home, a 10-minute walk.  He started to go, but then thought to go see his friend Traelden first.  Traelden was a warrior and had been fighting in the war too.  He had to know if he was all right.  When he arrived, he knocked loudly on the front door.  The house was like most other dwarven homes, made of brick, had 5 rooms, and was built against a wall of the large cavern where the city was located.  In the center of the town was the Council hall, where the council of elders held meetings.  An entire wall of the city was made up of the Castle, where King Kazon himself lived.  It was a massive structure, built as a stronghold for the king and the council if the city fell to attack.  It could hold up to 400 people comfortably for 6 weeks, and the top was lined with slim windows for archers to hold back any attacks.  Staring at the castle, Worin had forgotten about banging on the door.  As he raised his fist to knock again, the door slowly swung open, and Traelden smiled.  “You’re alright! I was worried, you were in the infirmary for 2 days!”  Worin couldn’t speak.  Traelden had a huge scar along the side of his face, going through his eye and down below his ear.  “You’re face!” he said, cringing.  “Oh, real nice way to greet a friend” Traelden said, signaling for him to come in.  “Sorry.  An ogre do that to you?” he said, walking in and sitting down on a chair in the living room.  “The general did it.  Just before he ran off with Kazon.”  Worin jumped up and yelled, “Just before he did WHAT?!?!?!!!!?”  Traelden looked at him mourningly, “They haven’t told you yet? Ach, it’s terrible.  He grabbed him up in one hand, threw him over his back and called the retreat.  The council’s going insane trying to keep peace.  People are panicking, we’re nothing without a king.”  Worin sat down, a look of utter disbelief on his face.  He had known Kazon since he was 12 and Kazon was 20.  When the other dwarves had been picking on Worin, Kazon always showed up to help him.  Worin had looked up to him ever since, and Kazon had taken him in.  He was sympathetic for Worin; he knew what it was like to have your parents die at a young age also.  Worin’s parents had died in an ambush by goblins when he was 4.  Worin and Kazon had been close friends.  This was much worse than he had imagined.  “I have to go home.  I’m really sorry about your eye. See you later.” He said in a daze, rushing out the door.  Traelden nodded, and let him go without a word.  He knew they had been friends.<br>
<br>
  Worin walked home, thinking about what he would do.  What could he do?  March into a camp of 500 ogres and kill them all? As good as it sounded, he doubted he would get 1 killed before he got a spear through the heart.  He walked into his bathroom, staring into the mirror hanging on the wall.  Washing his face with cold water from the well, he noticed a scar on the left part of his forehead.  It was different though, not a straight scar, but it speared to almost have a form. He looked closer into the mirror, and saw it looked almost like a series of runes.  He wrote their forms on a piece of parchment, and grabbed his chestplate.  The markings were the same.  With a shiver, he decided to ignore it and put the chestplate away.  He swallowed a potion from the medical center, and went to sleep. <br>
<br>
   A loud banging on the door woke him up.  “Worin! Wake up, we have to go!”  He grumbled and got out of bed, walking over to open the door.  Traelden was there, fully equipped and ready to go.  “Let’s go, the council has called a town meeting, and they said to come equipped.”  Worin scrambled to pull on his greaves, chestplate, and boots, and grabbed his sword and shield.  Putting on the rest of the armor as they walked, he asked, “Do you know what this is all about?”  “Not a clue, but it’s very safe to say it has something to do with ogres.”  <br>
   <br>
   They reached the meeting hall just as the council began to speak.  An elderly dwarf stood up, and with a magically amplified voice said, “The Council has reached a decision.  The current situation is this:  The ogres are holding Kazon hostage.  They want us to give them Kaladim.  The options were this:  Pack up all our belongings, desert the homes and lives we’ve worked so hard to build, and let filthy ogres invade our homes” At this everyone booed.  The dwarf held his hand up for silence, “Or, we could fight.  But not a typical fight; to win against the ogres, we would have to use cunning.  Army versus army, they would crush us into oblivion.  But brains versus brains, they have no chance at all.  Long ago, when the mines were first erected, the king of the dwarves was a great oracle.  He foresaw a great war without a leader.  The prophecy read like this: <br>
        The ogres will strike, and steal a great possession.  Give not the prize, else the world fall to flame.  Fight not with hundreds, but with a mere 8, the runed one will lead us to victory.<br>
<br>
   This goes on a bit further, but that is the majority of it.  Very cryptic, but many things of that time were.  We have no leads thus far as to who the ‘Runed one’ is.  If any of you think you know, tell us immediately.  It is of utmost importance to the city, the dwarves, and apparently the world.  Additionally, we need dwarves willing to sacrifice themselves for the cause, to join the party of 8.  Come see us after the meeting as well. That is all.”<br>
<br>
   Worin felt cold as the prophecy of the First King was read.  He thought about the runed on his forehead, and if that could really be what they were talking about.  Worin was no leader, he had been picked on and pushed around his whole life.  What could it mean? Should he tell the council?  If it meant victory to the dwarves, then he had to.  He approached the stage where the Elders were seated. Kneeling, he said, “Council, I have information that might pertain to the Runed one.” They looked at each other doubtfully.<br>
“Young Worin, tell us what it is you know.” Worin pulled his hair away, uncovering the runes.  “I found these on my forehead last night, after I had woken up from the battle.  I found the same marking on my chestplate.”  The leader of the council walked over to him and held a very old piece of parchment to his head.  “They match.” He said.  The council stared at him, measuring him up.  “Not exactly what we expected, but if the prophecy says… we have to try it.  Worin, pack your belongings, and ask a very close friend whom you trust more than anyone in the world.  You will leave tonight.”  Worin looked confused.  “Leave, but where?”.  The eldest one said, “Go where your instinct leads you.  Your first initial thought will always be correct. Go forward, Worin, Hero of Kaladim.”<br>
<br>
   Traelden was waiting in the back of the meeting hall.  “What was that all about?” he asked.  “Listen to me Traelden, I’m going on the mission.  I need to pack up with a friend and leave tonight.  If you don’t want to come, I’ll understand completely and won’t hold it against you. Will you come?”.  Traelden looked amazed.  “Of course I’ll come with you, but why are we going? What about the Runed one?”.  “There’s no time to explain now.  Pack some provisions and we will leave as soon as we can.”<br>
<br>
   The Butcherblock Mountains were a very dangerous place to be at night, unless you knew their secrets.  Worin and Traelden crept silently along the mountain pass, making sure to avoid the camouflaged goblin camps marked on their maps.  If they were to awake even one of them, an alarm would be sounded and hundreds of the creatures would have been upon them by daybreak.  At the other side of the pass lied the Greater Faydark, home of the elves.  Worin wasn’t quite sure what they would do there, but he would find out when they arrived.  As they followed the path leading the way, the silence was interrupted by Traelden’s whisper; “Worin, wait. I heard something in the bushes to the right,”.  Worin nodded, and snuck up slowly behind the bush.  He had a natural advantage in the darkness of night; dwarves had night vision developed by many years of mining in dark places.  As he drew nearer, he could make out a humanoid form in the bushes, staring straight ahead at Traelden.  Worin approached, drawing his blade.  Taking swift action, Worin stepped up behind the figure and put his falchion to the man’s neck.  Gasping with fear, the man yelled, “DON’T KILL ME, PLEASE, I’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!!! I DIDN’T TAKE THE GOLD, I SWEAR!!”  Snarling, Worin said, “Quiet, fool, or you’ll get us all killed by goblins.  I’m not a man of the law, and have no intentions of killing you unless you intend to harm us.  Now, I think your foolery was enough to awaken the goblins. RUN”.  Worin and Traelden took off as fast as their legs could take them.  The man in the bushes, not knowing what else to do, took off after them.  After an hour of running, the 3 men halted.  A massive stone statue of a figure standing tall and proud stuud in front of them.  The figure marked the entrance to the Land of the Elves.<br>
<br>
   “This is where we’ll set up camp for the night. We’d ask ye to join us, but we’ve never seen ye before, your not of a race we recognize, and from the sounds of it yer a thief who would just as soon stab us in our backs as we sleep and take our money. Good bye.” Traelden said to the man.  Thinking about what the council of Elders said abou instinct, Worin said to the man as he turned to leave, “No, stay, you’ll just be killed as soon as you take 10 steps away from the fire.  Introduce yerself, take an ale and stay a while.”  Traelden looked disapproving, but said nothing.  “Oh, thank you! Your too kind to this halfling.”  “This what?” Traelden said without thinking.  “Halfling.  I come from Antonica, East of the Ocean of Tears.  I came looking for adventure, and to get away from the, umm, lawmakers of Rivervale. I didn’t really do anything, just a gold here and there, a couple knives, some ringmail.  Never knew that they would get that upset over a few hundred platinum, ya know what I mean?”.  “A rogue then? Good, we may have need of you.  We are going on a mission to rescue a man of high status to the dwarves from a couple thugs.  This man is very powerful, and very rich.  If you come with us, I can definitely see hundreds of thousands of platinum in your bank account.”<br>
The rogue’s eyes glazed over, and he started muttering words about money.  When he came back, he looked at them and said, “Nice to meet you two fine gentlemen.  Th’names Fordel.  When will we be leaving and when will I get my money?”.  Worin looked over at Traelden and smiled.  They discussed financial matters until sleep overcame them.<br>
<br>
   Worin awoke to a sword pointed at his neck.  A man dressed in chain mail stood over him.  The man was tall and muscular, had pale skin, and long, pointed ears.  “What are you doing on this part of the continent, dwarves?”.  Worin held out his hands to signal that he was unarmed, and the man let him stand up.  “I am Worin, and I have come to seek people to help me in my quest.  I am looking for a way into the elven city to find adventurers. Can you direct me?”.  The elf looked at Worin.  “You will be coming with me into the elven city, but not in the way you intend.  You three are not prisoners of our great King Thex. Follow me.  Worin looked around and saw 6 other elven men in a circle around them. Shrugging, he began to follow the elf.  Well, at least we’re getting into the city he thought.<br>
<br>
   After 2 hours of walking, they reached the elven city. The three travelers gasped.  Up in the trees the elves had built the most beautiful city any of them had ever seen.  Wonderful white buildings connected by bridges in the top of the trees.  The guard captain directed them onto a magical lift that took them into a huge building that appeared to be a castle.  Worin wondered how trees could support suge a huge building, and then remembered the rumors of elven wizards with power greater than even the Baalrocks of the deep mines.  The guards led them through a series of passageways leading to a jail like building, with glowing energy acting as bars.  Saying more words, the travelers were suddenly inside one of the cages.  “I will tell your story to the King.  If he takes interest, then you may be lucky.  If not, you will become test subjects for powerful spells being created by our wizards.  Good luck, dwarves.”<br>
 <br>
   After 20 minutes locked in the cage, Fordel had grown impatient.  “Why, the nerves of those elves!  Creeping up on us while we’re sleeping, taking us to this prison, and then calling me a dwarf! Twice!! Erm, no offense,”.  Traelden and Worin nodded forgiveness as they tried to make up for lost sleep.  Minutes later, 2 elves walked in and opened the cage.  “You, party leader.  Come with us.  You will have council with the King.”  Worin stood up and nodded goodbye to his companions.  He followed the elves back through the passages until they reached a huge chamber, lined with guards.  In the center, on a raised platform, sat an elf wearing golden armor and a gem encrusted crown.  “Come forward, dwarf, and tell me your story. I have received message from the dwarven council already, and will compare your stories.  Sit, and have a drink.”  Worin approached the throne and sat in a less reagal looking chair across from the king.  He ate sweetcakes and drank wine as he told the story of the abduction of the dwarven king by the ogres, and the group of 8 in the prophecy.  King Thex listened as he sipped his wine, and nodded in approval every once in a while.  When Worin was finished, the King gave his final approval.  “Your stories are exactly the same to the word.  I actually was in the process of sending for the elves most powerful wizard.  This student learned of their powers just a year ago, and they quickly advanced to extremely high level magic.  Ahh, here they are now.  Come in, Aelin.”<br>
 <br>
   Worin looked at the door to the entrance of the throne room.  Walking towards him was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  She had blonde hair, typical elven pointed ears, blue eyes, and beautifully shaped features that were not hidden by her tight red robe.<br>
“Hello.  I’m Aelin.  I believe we will be journeying together for a very long time.”  Worin just looked at her mouth wide open, and said eventually,  “Oh, um, Hi.  My names Worin.  My other companions are waiting in the jail.”  He turned towards the King.  “Thank you, your highness.  I think I represent all the dwarves when I say you have our eternal gratitude.  We will need to buy provisions for travel and possibly need to see a smith.  Can you have someone direct us?”.  The king smiled and told one of his assistants to release the others and guide them to the market.  After many more displays of gratitude and the purchase of food and drink, the party was once again outside the elven gates.<br>
