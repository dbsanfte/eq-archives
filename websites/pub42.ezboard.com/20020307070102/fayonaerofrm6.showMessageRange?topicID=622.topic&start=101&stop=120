<br>
So what is this a big contest on "who has the bigger stick?" F*** that... if you guys really wanna find out who goes where then friggin guild war each other.<br>
<br>
Don't wonder who's better than the other because at the end we're all just people who are playing some dumb ass game. To some people this game has become all about loot. Loot is their drug and they can't feel good unless they get it. To me thats pretty sad.<br>
<br>
I ask you all... WHATS YOUR DRIVE TO PLAY THE GAME? WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING? WHY ARE YOU STILL PLAYING EVERQUEST? IS EVERQUEST WORTH SPENDING YOUR TIME?<br>
<br>
Everquest has evolved throughout the years where it is no longer a fun game for alot of people and only play to satisfy their loot addiction.<br>
<br>
And if we are ranking guilds then none of the guilds such as EW CB or VV should be up on the top 7 at all because I bet that more than 70% of the people in those guilds don't play for fun, but because its a job.<br>
<br>
On my top guilds I would rank all the pure newbies who are just starting to play this game and starting to explore and discover everything for the first time. To wonder whats over the hill or to fear the thump of an SG foot step in Oasis. Those are the people who are trully "playing" the game.<br>

It is the part of the brain which controls our ability to know right from wrong, social graces, and common sense.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Frontal lobe damage seems to have an impact on divergent thinking, or flexibility and problem solving ability. There is also evidence showing lingering interference with attention and memory even after good recovery from a TBI (Stuss et al., 1985).<br>
<br>
One of the most common characteristics of frontal lobe damage is difficulty in interpreting feedback from the environment. Perseverating on a response (Milner, 1964), risk taking, and non-compliance with rules (Miller, 1985), and impaired associated learning (using external cues to help guide behavior) (Drewe, 1975) are a few examples of this type of deficit.<br>
<br>
(above blatantly ripped from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.neuroskills.com">www.neuroskills.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )<br>
<br>
In *general*, the frontal lobe is associated with reasoning, planning, parts of speech, movement, emotions, and problem solving. I'd imagine that since he said: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Of course you could always pull him WEST... Seriously though, it doesn't take a whole helluva lot of frontal lobe capacity to deduce the best location to &quot;relocate&quot; Lendi.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I'd have to think that the frontal lobe is at least partly responsible for thought processes involved with things like deductive reasoning as deduction is in some sense the direct application of knowledge in the production of new knowledge.<br>
<br>
Perhaps ironically, some findings from a Rotman Research Institute/University of Toronto study were published in the April 1999 issue of the international journal Brain. These findings revealed that:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ...people with right anterior frontal damage [to the frontal lobe] had the most disrupted ability to appreciate written and verbal jokes -- and funny cartoons -- compared to the normal control group and people with focal lesions elsewhere in the brain. Individuals with right frontal damage chose wrong punch lines to written jokes and did not smile or laugh as much at funny cartoons or verbal jokes. They showed a preference for silly slapstick humor -- surprising but illogical endings which are the hallmarks of such acts as The Three Stooges.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In addition, The Brain Explorer [ <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C0110299/brain/anatomy.php?page=anatomy2">library.thinkquest.org/C0...e=anatomy2</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ] notes that:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The frontal lobe controls a number of functions. It is in charge of voluntary motion, memory, intelligence, concentration, behaviour, personality, as well as conscious thought. The left lobe controls the motor movements involved in language such as speech and writing, while the right lobe is usually involved in non-verbal activities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So while your take on the function of the frontal lobe is not wrong per se, it doesn't preclude others as well; moreover, to single out the functions of the frontal lobe as being <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ...the part of the brain which controls our ability to know right from wrong, social graces, and common sense.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> is overly simplistic at best. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36323">Caean Sacroguerre, Knight of Tunare</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucaeanthepaladin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaeanthePaladin</A> at: 11/27/01 10:06:00 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shortyrezstarfury>ShortyrezStarfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/27/01 11:31:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 7 guilds on our server?</span><hr size=1> I think hearing the chatter back and forth for six pages has pretty much surmised a lot of this...talking sheer power ranking would go something like this:<br>
<br>
1. EW of course...if you think otherwise, well lemme see you guys kill Tunare, etc.<br>
2. VV gets my vote, but I don't think they are close to EW honestly<br>
3. CB and I think they are a lot closer in sheer power to VV than most people think.<br>
<br>
Beyond that I don't think anyone comes close to these three guilds in *sheer power*.  Some other stuff to think about...<br>
<br>
Rest in Peace sure is doing a hell of a lot with the small group they have left.  From what I have seen, they have suffered the most from DAoC and other crappy games, but still kept it together.  Personally I would rank them as one of the best guilds on the server because they can do a lot with what they have.<br>
<br>
Vision on the other hand seems to be the top guild for those that want a laid back, relaxed atmosphere.  No they aren't going to rival EW in power, but I don't think they really give a damn.  They care more about the friendship aspect, so kudos to them.<br>
<br>
And of course I think my guild is right for me, but I need not try to brainwash you into thinking that.  As others have mentioned, I need not wave my dick around.<br>
<br>
I think this thread is a prime example of EW being a very respectable guild on our server.  I don't see them coming in here saying &quot;we're uber, you're wrong, we beat your guild any day of the week&quot;.<br>

<br>
Professional Everquest players behave like this? Where do I sign up for the newbie area?<br>
<br>
Keep leveling, younglings. You too, can become one of these, spewing values and priorities as these ones do. Such is the way of the Everquest Player.<br>
<br>
These attitudes turn real people away from this game, it just makes your stomach turn when you realize who you're playing with. <br>
<br>
There are no &quot;top guilds&quot;. Only &quot;top players&quot; . These days, the worst players of my generation are scattered throughout your &quot;top guilds&quot;.  The great players, now play side by side with such bad players (emphasis on the quality of their character), and as days pass , time allows bad reputations to fade. Some of the worst players I ever crossed....now seem to carry loud voices in these guilds. Makes me vomit. <br>
<br>
Problem is....great people just arn't attracted to Everquest. If you respect guilds and players merely because of their ability to kill Verant's latest NPC and collect their newest items enhancing your stats, I feel deeply sorry for you. To think of NPC killing and item collection as a means of obtaining prestige...well....Everquest's reputation is well deserved, we'll say. <br>
<br>
My IQ went down from reading this....(always does when I come to this board to learn of the happenings and read the thoughts of the frequent posters) and I'm much stupider (grammar check, right wretch?) for posting...but any jack ass that views the game in this &quot;is my penis big? Please verify...&quot; perspective reminds me of how a high level guild can never be &quot;great&quot;.  Well done Verant. Well done indeed. <br>
<br>
I know who the great people are who play this game, and I'll give you a hint as to who they are so you can trace them when you log on. The hint is....they don't give a damn about what fool killed whatever npc, or who wears whatever armor. <br>
<br>
Top guilds..abilities to kill npc's....tacticians. Absurd. <br>

We are not a racing guild. It is very hard for us to break in Ntov most of the time. <br>
(i) VV/EW are racing against each other on mobs. <br>
(ii) We don't have enough on till late to compete<br>
<br>
As for the 425 dain, we havn't attemped him. Dain has never been a priority. With the new upgrade to him, he is more of a headache and frustration than anything. Only reason to kill him is for his Belt. <br>
<br>
Acually Tormax is doable for us I think, our 1st attempt at him. We pulled Tormax to zone solo (thanks Slight).... and acually got him to around 50%... this was without any Gb wizards and a lack of strong attendence that night... we just wanted to see how well we do... otherwise its hard to get a chance because on this server because VV or EW get to him first. <br>
<br>
We aren't going to try Yelintek till we break in Ntov and get all the ' practice ' that VV has been getting. CT solo is again, more frustrating and not worth it, but I think if a good number showed up its doable. There is much better loot to be had I think is the general consenous. We are not a loot guild, it is not our main drive. <br>
<br>
I bore of this tedious drival about... which guild is &gt; another... Which guild has phatter loot than the other. Which guild had fewer deaths than us on a mob than another. Flaunting is a form of insult in a way I think. Never once have I flaunted anything over anyone here, at least not that I remember. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uyasp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yasp</A> at: 11/27/01 3:01:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rainwolf>Rain Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/27/01 2:52:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Top 7 guilds on our server?</span><hr size=1> Most Powerful + Attitude in my eyes:<br>

Hey Nephlite, were you there when we failed to Klan and VV didn't even have the respect to let us res first. They fought over our bodies while we were rezzing. Thankfully we didn't do the same when you failed. Almost happened again, but someone convinced your great leader to spare us the time to rez in. Hows that for respect?<br>
<br>
Hey I've seen CB prepping for Sontalak after a wipeout, and a VV member pulled Sont away from us to DN for themselves. Is that respect? Please tell me what VV does that is so respectable other than waiting for another guild to fail on a mob they are learning.'<br>

Oh and by the way, hows the move from a guild like Undead Lords to Vea Victis feel? You think your a top dog now and can prance around like you are better than me? or anyone else not in VV?<br>

I mean anyone who likes their guild they're in will say their guild is the best. I know I feel that way. If you're truely happy where you are, your answer shouldn't be different.<br>
<br>
I am currently in Casus Belli, and I am more than happy where I am, I would not trade places with anyone for anything. If anyone feels differently than I do about their own guild, I think something is wrong. This is my opinion and I might be wrong.<br>
<br>
There are hidden &quot;advantages&quot; for being in a guild which is able to kill all mobs, such as EW. If you are a power gamer who only plays eq to be &quot;uber&quot;, a guild like EW is the way to go. If you don't really care about ethics and &quot;play nice rules&quot; (I'm not saying EW in particular) a guild ***LIKE*** EW is the guild to be in because of their ability to see everything and do everything the game has to offer. They consist of players which have similar goals like you do (the powergamer).<br>
<br>
If you are a part of a guild which is able to see and do everything the game has to offer, I can almost assure you, you will put up with alot more bull shit than if you were in a second or third ranking guild because of the cozy spot you're in. If you decide to leave CB or VV, you still have EW to fall back on, provided you get in. Now if you're currently in a guild like EW, chances are you won't want to leave no matter how bad things may get because you have the nicest spot on the server. Where would an EW member go if they leave? CB? VV? I can assure you, either of these guilds would be considered a step down in the eyes of a power gamer.<br>
<br>
Yes, we've had power gamers leave CB. We've had people say, &quot;you guys are not uber enough for me, I'm leaving.&quot; (Mind you, not in those exact words but that is what they meant) and 90% of the time, they go to EW and stay there. This whole process of deguilding because we're not good enough for you is perfectly fine by us, cause if you honestly think 40+ people are not as good as you are, we're happy to see you leave. Power gamers and casual players do not mix. Period. These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.<br>
<br>
As a closing note, I would MUCH rather see a guild rise to power rather than walk into an already made situation. I firmly believe getting to the top is better than being at the top. The thrill of the chase is what does it for me, not the prize.<br>
<br>

Ask me in tells if you want. I don't like to start flames in message boards, but IMO , yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Yasp made a statement about VV being on our heals when we TRIED Kland, then once we failed yall went in a killed him. Grats we dont need practice anymore for Kland we have him now. As for your next few statements it sure looks like you dont mind talking smack.<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot;First time we killed a golem in ST was with 9, when the warders still existed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
/Cheer VV does in fact have a much bigger Dick then us<br>
<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot;You did try at DN, didn't work out for you. BTW we are the only guild in all EQ that pulls Sontalak to DN, so i was wondering if you didnt mean to copy our tactic how did you come up with this (Which btw makes it harder than killing it at TOV entrance)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
OMFG we tired to kill Sonta in a different spot other then the norm. We failed and we now kill him at zone to TOV. I better not catch VV killing him at TOV zone or I am going to start saying how much you stole our tactics.  Also of coarse youhave to mention how much harder you try to make sonta just so you can give the poor little dragon a chance , give me a break.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot;I could say Yes on this one, since there is a little trick we use on how we attack that you seem to be using too , this is since you finally killed klandicar.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh no CB stole the trick to have all melees behind Kland , Is there no Justice in this world we live in? You ever think Maybe the 8 times we tried Klan and Failed that MAYBE we learned what we needed to do. This statement of yours really proves how full of yourself you are. You know I heard DW used that tactic also and while they were there was VV sitting there watching them...  See I made that last part up but it goes to show you anyone can make up Bullshit to make themselfs look better to the public. Really you know what finnaly killed Kland? It is called Priceless, Primal and tweaking the heal strat just a little bit. Deal with it<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot;Actually i could say Yes to this one too, see. In order to do Lendi, people 'move' lendi out of her spot to clear the 2 wurms, drakes.<br>
EW used to move Lendi South of her spot.<br>
DW used to kill Lendi somewhere else. not even at exit.<br>
VV moved her north.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hehe Good thing you have your own hall to pull to, and I guess since all of them are taken we just need to stop killing Lendi . HAHA think about it where are the static spawns at and where is the best place to pull her where there are none? You know since DW is gone and only EW and VV is left that ARE doing lendi. Then if we didnt Move Lendi north we would be stealing EWs tactic by your standard. For god sake just casue you did something before another guild doesnt mean that guild stole your tactics. Also Like I said before it takes us max 2 times for lendi due to bad luck sometimes where the last time you did her it took you 4-5 times. Why steal those tactics , and to top it off I heard you made some of your members camp casue you had to many there. It is bad when you have to camp MEMBERS to kill a mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot; Maybe cause you need to re-read how she ranked the guilds and (gasp) in her opinion, CB doesnt deserve one of the top 7 spots. IMO CB does. but she doesn't<br>
<br>
<br>
You are correct as I re-read it I saw it was based on &quot;GooD Peope&quot;. I also think in life opinions are like assholes everyone has one and most of the time they stink, But that is only becuase I love MY GUILD. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote Nibble &quot;Althought i don't agree with Ibyza by posting in a flame message board, i gotta see her point.<br>
What you see is the reaction of a guild member that worked hard and died/spent hours. Figuring out the way to kill a mob based on their guild resources.<br>
It is not cool after you achieve something , see how another guild's member sits almost every time we kill a mob NEXT to us to see how we do it. <br>
Does this person have the right to do it? yes.<br>
Do I think it's ok to watch other guild every time they kill a mob until i get all the info i need instead of trying to figure it out myself? No&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Also what you see is a guild who has worked its asses off to kill big targets called out for stealing tactics. I have sat next to DW while they exploit pulled tormax using the ledge , does that mean when we do tromax that is how we are going to do it? Durr no we pulled tormax straight to us no exploits, in fact I have heard that VV used to do this? is it true? if you YOU stole your tactics from DW . See how this works? Thing is you are trying to be little the fact that CB is catching up in power and has a Good rep to go with that. You might have power but from what I have heard from the Ay population you are not as liked as you think you are. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Quote Nibble &quot; These are my 2 cents on this on-going flame war in this thread. <br>
I would rather CB/VV people stop posting flames, since all it does is create a more hostile environment.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Tell ya what Nibble I will stop posting here and drive down to houston from collegestation and sit down with ya face to face and have a beer and talk about whos dick is bigger.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also the 2 VV that left for SOT becasue SOT is a EST guild hehe you are so very wrong SOT has always been mostly a PST guild . Dont worry though you dont need to make excuses becasue people left that werent happy, it happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
AS for the tool whos name I forget that said Nibble sat me down. Please grow up, anyone that has britney spears and bongs on his sig has to be either 12 years old or a 25 year old dope smoking pervert<br>

<br>
and just fyi before i go into it..we have had one shot at tormax with 40 players. Tormax was pulled with an add and the add kicked a lot of vital people (including our only shaman that night) ..So we had about 35 people ..missing 1 MT cleric and our shaman. We managed to get him to 50% and then we actually zoned out because the adds were screwing too many important people<br>
<br>
if we had all stayed in the zone , we would have got him to 35% with a half assed attempt and a low amount of players<br>
<br>
tormax is not that difficult. He is easily comparable with the new vindi ..but 150% of Vindi's HP<br>
<br>
Now on to the NToV..<br>
<br>
VV, since CB has no chance at ntov dragons, why dont you give us a shot at them? I gaurentee we can kill at least 2/3 of NToV given the chance..but since you consider it such an accomplishment, and so very difficult, you shouldnt have a problem letting us try since we would obviously just fail. and because you are so honorable what problem do you have with giving a hopeless guild a chance at something so uber..<br>
<br>
Oh and youve been there twice or three times? big fucking yay! <br>
<br>
this thread isnt really directed at vv, but whoever made such a big ass deal about ntov and tormax<br>
<br>
I do agree though that VV can surely take Yel much lower then we could hehe<br>
<br>
CB just really isnt a power gaming guild..we will move our way up, but slower because we probably have 1/2 the time to do things that vv and ew have 2 times the time to do <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubashur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bashur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/27/01 4:36:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bias</span><hr size=1> this thread is good entertainment down at the pharmacy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=622.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=622.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=622.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=622.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=622.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=622.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=622.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
