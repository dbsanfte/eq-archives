But really all this hair-splitting of &quot;Egoism&quot; vs. &quot;Egotism&quot; vs. &quot;Narcissism&quot; is meaningless. Whatever label you apply to it, Satanism is just evil, and those that practice it are potentially harmful to those around them.<br>
<br>
There are no boundaries to a Satanist, no limits to a Satanist. If a Satanist wants to enslave a population, or molest children, or poison the town's water supply, or anything at all he wants to do, no matter how outrageous or cruel, if he feels he can do it and get away with it, there is no reason for him not to. Other people, their rights, their happiness, indeed their very lives do not even enter into the equation for a Satanist. &quot;Self&quot; is the only consideration.<br>
<br>
I am not exaggerating this, or mischaracterizing Satanism. It is all spelled out clearly, in so many words, in the writings of Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowely that SELF is all that matters. Everyone and everything else are simply resources to be exploited and then discarded at the whim of Self, or obstacles to be circumvented or destroyed if Self perceives them to be in the way. Evil. <p>__________<br>

I dont think we're splitting hairs... I was trying to explain that there is a difference between Satanism and Egoism.  The two are far from the same.<br>
<br>
From what you say of Satanism, one might consider it to be the religion of narcissism.  If one were so bold as to make that statement (i wouldnt, i hold firmly to the belief that you cant be a Satanist if you dont worship SATAN... but thats something else to chat about) then one might also say that since Satanists practice narcissism and since narcissism is a personality disorder, Satanists must be suffering from a mental disorder.  <br>

<br>
To the defenders of satanism, could you say that there are aspects of satanism that are &quot;good&quot; beyond the boundaries of the self?  Is there anything about the religion that can be constructive to society?  If not, can satanism then be included in the philosophy &quot;there is good in all religions?&quot;<br>
<br>
Absence of a thing isn't necessarily evil while providing such a thing can be good.  Thus, good can exist in the absence of evil.<br>

<br>
doing random acts that are somewhat evil is in human nature.. why deny it? if someone hits you and you get angry you want to hurt them... aggression is human and very needed for our balance, and i think most people would call aggressive behaviour evil.<br>
<br>
but since that aggression/evil is good for us then i guess evil is good for us too.<br>

there is a very good song by Slayer thats called "god hates us all" i recommend everyone to read the lyrics of it.. and no they arent satanists, just a bit agressive and skeptic about some things..<br>

<br>
Are there aspects of satanic philosophy that are keyed toward benefitting society rather than the individual?<br>
<br>
For the sake of this question let's avoid the &quot;what do you mean by 'good'&quot; ambiguity.  Just use common social definitions of the term.  As an aside, I wouldn't consider aggressive behavior 'evil,' though it can lead to evil.  It's just sometimes -- as you say earlier in the paragraph -- &quot;needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm just interested in whether satanism can inherently produce behaviors which the average person could clearly construe as good toward society as a whole.  After that we can discuss whether acts that are good solely for an individual warrant being considered good acts in any way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Someone said "You must learn to love yourself before you can learn to love others". I think that's a pretty smart quote.<br>
<br>
Hrmm.. what does it contribute to society... (this is where my english starts lacking and I'm having troubles expressing what I mean.. but let's hope it gets through ) Well, a person who is confident in himself and know's what he can do and know's how to "use" others becomes a very good divider of work for example. Never hurts to have a boss that's sure of himself that easily finds out what YOU are good at and uses that part. Which also in the long run makes YOU feel good, because you notice that "damn I'm great at this", it boosts your selfconfidence and gets the more work done.<br>
<br>
This sounds wrong when I read it now but I can't think of a better way to express it in english, sorry... hopefully someone understands me atleast <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uflexuregraverobber.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flexure Graverobber</A> at: 12/9/01 1:12:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/9/01 12:57:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: since i know it will turn into a nag ill post it here.</span><hr size=1> satanism is very centered on the self, or ego as some want to call it.<br>
this is true and i say thats not a bad thing.. caring for yourself is NOT bad and how ever you twist and turn it the self is always the most important person in your life..<br>
<br>
explaining example:<br>
mr lets call him Bill loves his kids and treasure them over anything else.. his exact words are i could not live with myself if anything happened to them...<br>
or..<br>
Mrs Doe..  " i cant stand by and watch these things take place, i cant stand to see this man get beaten to death"<br>
<br>
driven to the extreme these are all acts you do for yourself, and they are perfect examples on how everything is really about ME MYSELF AND I.<br>
there is nothing wrong with this.. this is just logical facts, and i only put them here to show that everyone centers on the "self" but how much varies just like everything else.<br>
<br>
satanism therefore focus on our primal instincts and the most human aspects of our lifes.. and quite frankly i think that the society would gain on people caring more about themselfs.<br>
<br>
you are your best friend and worst enemy, no one can hurt you or care for you more then yourself.<br>
<br>
i help people alot, i do that knowing that i help myself by doing it since i become a better person for doing it and i feel better about myself when i do it. <-- MEGA EGOIST<br>
<br>
i am not a satanist and i never claimed to be one.. i dont know everything about them or their religion but i still find it just as valid as any other religion.<br>
(any claim done as sarcasm to dumb posts not counted)<br>

I think this question is kinda an un-question.<br>
You know, like, &quot;why is green?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Religions are not philosophies about what is good for society. No religion is. Religions have been USED by those in power as propaganda for what THEY believe is good for society. Thus all the blodshed in the name of Christ and the one known by names such as &quot;I AM&quot;, Jehova, God and Allah.<br>
<br>
If we want to discuss what's good for society, then lets start talking about Utilitarism, Libertarianism, Kant and Rawls Theory of Justice. Please leave religion out of that subject.<br>
<br>
Just IMHO. <p>Love, Edeina<br>
