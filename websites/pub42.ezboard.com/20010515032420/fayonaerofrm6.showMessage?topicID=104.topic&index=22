There's a new breed of lamers out there I refer to as the trolling drunkies.  They get wasted then go looking for provocative threads in which to insert their pearls of wisdom.  Somehow, somewhere, someone informed this troll his opinion mattered in the grand scheme of things.  Unfortunately, we'll never know who that fruit cake was so we could rightfully beat the hell out of him for convincing another piss-ant that he's somebody worth listening to.<br>

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Anyway, if you want to rape a guild's rep over one instance by a member before talking to the officers or the leader (myself) then I would recommend ya go fuck yourself and play Q3.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<br>
No.  No reson to judge a guild by the incident.  We could judge them based on their guildleader's attidude instead.  Maybe I'm just slightly less high-strung, but one of your members (purportedly) stole from someone, and then you told the person who got upset by the issue to go fuck themselves?  Let me see if that's clear.  To resolve an issue of an Undead Lord stealing from someone, the guildleader of Undead Lords tells the complaintant to go fuck themselves?  Seems reasonable.<br>
<br>
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Here's what I use to judge guilds and their members by, you should try it yourself...<br>
an action by 3+ people of the same guild is a guild action. Anything less is an individual(s) action. Try that next time in your sorting of guild or individual rep determination.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<br>
I'll try and remember that when someone in my guild does something that dishonors themselves ~and~ Vision as a whole.  If a single member of my guild steals something, bails on a CR, flys off the handle in /shout or /ooc, or any other &quot;less-than-honorable&quot; act, it paints a bad picture of the guild as a whole.  You must see that the actions of your members, no matter how isolated from the guild body, do reflect on you as a guild.  If for no other reason than someone had a run in with your members and then did exactly that - assumed that since it was the only event with one of your guildmembers that left an impressions, it was the way people in your guild behaved.<br>

UDL is not just any other guild nor do we allow outside pressures into making us act like any other guild.  We have our own checks and balances and it doesn't always involve &quot;booting&quot; or reprimanding.  Maybe teasing mercilessly for years on end.. but that's just how families are. *eg*<br>

lemme break that down for you a little more and show you the error of your argument.<br>
<br>
<br>

Maybe I'm just slightly less high-strung, but one of your members (purportedly) stole from someone, and then you told the person who got upset by the issue to go fuck themselves?

<br>
Reading comprehension wasn't your top category in school was it?  You can deal with me or my officers in game and we will correct the situation.  You can completely avoid dealing with me in game and carry your rap straight to the boards slandering all of my guild before myself or any of my officers have a chance to respond and resolve the situation and I will tell you to go fuck yourself...again...and again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll try and remember that when someone in my guild does something that dishonors themselves ~and~ Vision as a whole. If a single member of my guild steals something, bails on a CR, flys off the handle in /shout or /ooc, or any other &quot;less-than-honorable&quot; act, it paints a bad picture of the guild as a whole.

<br>
Incorrect, any person who takes the actions of one individual to be representative of the whole body is a close-minded moron.  Do I slam the offending guild member for the general stupidity of the average human being that infests EQ as well as slamming him for his actions?  No.  The stupidity of the average person is not the offending guildmate's fault.  He is responsible for his actions alone and not for what other misguided judgements the average EQ player is quick to jump to.  A French citizen might steal from you.  That does mean that all French citizens are thieves?  No, it does not, and you would be a total close-minded moron for jumping to that conclusion.<br>

<br>
I made it fairly clear that I had no particular beef with you, so I'm mildly curious why you make personal attacks at me.<br>
<br>
Once Iridiscent chose to bring up the matter here, you clearly CHOSE to continue to discuss this matter in the open.  Your eight posts on this thread demonstrate that.  Try not to get too upset if other people want to post their views on a topic ~YOU~ decided to keep public.<br>
<br>
Someone came to our community board to complain about an issue in ~OUR~ community and you told them to go fuck themselves.  Were I in Iridiscent's shoes, it's not how I would have handled the situation; but it is the forum that Irid chose -- and since we all probably didn't get the memo from Undead Lords headquarters telling us how you'd prefer us to handle complaints, you can't get too steamed because someone didn't do it the way you wanted them to.<br>
<br>
Although I could use a few less /tells in my average everquest session, I, like you, prefer that matters regarding my members be brought to my attention, or to the attention of one of the officers who help make my guild what it is.  I just can't expect that everyone will choose this method to address their complaints.  Especially people who are upset about a situation.  Not everyone is as level-headed as I'd like them to be, and I'm certain not every got a copy of the Vision Complaint Process Form.<br>
<br>
You said:<br>
  &quot;Incorrect, any person who takes the actions of one individual to be representative of the whole body is a close-minded moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
While we certainly disagree, I'll try and make my point clearer.  I've had dealings with exactly one person in your guild that left an impression on me.  Every other person in your guild other than this individual has, for one reason or another failed to leave a lasting impression.  Because that member of your guild acts in such a way, I (perhaps foolishly) assume that he is in the company of like-minded individuals.  Until such a time that I have further dealings with members of Undead Lords, the stigma of that individual's actions will taint my perception of that guild.<br>
<br>
The actions of individuals reflect on the body as a whole.  You all ~choose~ to fly a common banner.  &lt;Undead Lords&gt; waves above your heads.  Individuals who, while flying this flag, do good actions will favorably color the perception of that banner in the minds of people who observe them.  Individuals who do &quot;unsavory&quot; things while flying your banner will taint the perception of your guild in a negative way for the people who see those things.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe me, go re-read Iridiscent's original post.  Someone flying your banner did something &quot;not-so-good&quot; and to at least one observer of the situation (no matter how close minded you think that person is) the overall perception of your guild got worse.<br>
<br>
...and for what it's worth, it takes more than a few veiled insults and backhanded comments to get me upset.<br>
<br>
I stand behind my reputation and the reputation of my guild brothers and sisters.<br>

<br>
I am not a member of UDL.<br>
<br>
I have met Warpd... and well, I did think the name was appropriate.... I did not have a bad experience... but... Warpd seemed to suit the person... as I have found... most of the names of the UDL above all other people...seem to fit them... *shrugs* maybe it is just the fact that I have had NUMBEROUS interactions with UDL members.<br>
<br>
UDL is primarily, if not exclusively, a roleplaying guild.<br>
<br>
And a damn fine bunch of players, in my experiences.<br>
<br>
This is not meant to toot any horns (mine bard pun... sorry I can't resist these.... being a bard and all)... but it is meant to be an observation.<br>
<br>
I would like to point out several facts...<br>
<br>
1- within two hours of the initial post... The GUILD leader of the guild responsible replied.... not some minor guild peon... but the leader... replied.<br>
<br>
2- Strike's initial post was both civil and direct and to the point. He offered to personally look into the matter, and to offer restitution.<br>
<br>
3- The wizard in question posted, as did the initial poster of this thread, and they were contented to let it die.<br>
<br>
Regarding foul language and verbal backlashing... This is a NAG board... and when you goad someone like Strike... what the hell do you expect?... Look at the name? Strike Fear... does that sound like someone that will back down easily?... Also, the support of the various UDL members, and Lords on this thread is... quite frankly Fairly fucking impressive to me.<br>
<br>
Regarding judging a book by a page. Yes you can feel free to judge an entire organization by one persons singular actions... I can also feel free to decide that all individuals with a name that starts with a P will hence forth be called Blockheads to me... *shrugs*... free will is a double edged sword.<br>
<br>
I would caution anyone by forming an opinion over one incident. Opinions are like backsides... we all have them.... keep them intangible, and you will find yourself in much more intelligent company.<br>
<br>
I am tired of watching people pick at a guild that has more longevity and rich history than the game in which this incident happened.<br>
<br>
Oh, and please feel free to point out to me the individual that plays this game that has not had ONE bad night... the individual that has NEVER been an Asshole to anyone ever.... and I will point out to you the fact that it doesn't exist...<br>
<br>
So rant all you like... but please take it to a new thread... this one... is dead.<br>

Are you suggesting that the actions of a single person helped set your perception on something?<br>

<br>
Read the heading of this board.  Flames will fly.  You failed to read what I said thoroughly and closely then proceeded to make misguided assumptions.  Expect to be flamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once Iridiscent chose to bring up the matter here, you clearly CHOSE to continue to discuss this matter in the open. Your eight posts on this thread demonstrate that. Try not to get too upset if other people want to post their views on a topic ~YOU~ decided to keep public.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's already in the open.  Not by my choice.  It was made public so it will now be handled publicly.  I have no qualms with continuing this in public but make any comment or statement suggesting I have made an incorrect choice of action here and I will suggest you grab your fire gear and be ready to play.  Make any disparaging remarks concerning myself, my guild, or my guildmates and you had better be ready to be hit with a full salvo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone came to our community board to complain about an issue in ~OUR~ community and you told them to go fuck themselves. Were I in Iridiscent's shoes, it's not how I would have handled the situation; but it is the forum that Irid chose -- and since we all probably didn't get the memo from Undead Lords headquarters telling us how you'd prefer us to handle complaints, you can't get too steamed because someone didn't do it the way you wanted them to.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said this before and I will say it again.  Guilds have officers and a leader for a reason.  I have never in my entire gaming career seen anyone that did not know to contact the leader or the officers when there was a problem concerning one of my guildmates or my guild in general.  This is common sense by now for the average EQ player after two years.  If you don't know that by now then you are Newbie and you are going to get slammed no matter no what you do trying to learn the game and interact with it's people.  Accept it and move on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although I could use a few less /tells in my average everquest session, I, like you, prefer that matters regarding my members be brought to my attention, or to the attention of one of the officers who help make my guild what it is. I just can't expect that everyone will choose this method to address their complaints.<br>
Especially people who are upset about a situation. Not everyone is as level-headed as I'd like them to be, and I'm certain not every got a copy of the Vision Complaint Process Form.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, you can and should expect it.  As I said above, the average player after 2 years knows how to deal with guilds.  If they do not then they are a newbie. Guild structures are posted on the EQ web-site.  If these people can't take the time to read the structure and rules of a game before they step into play it then they better be prepared to take the heat when they make a mistep out of ignorance from not reading about the game.<br>
<br>
You said:<br>
&quot;Incorrect, any person who takes the actions of one individual to be representative of the whole body is a close-minded moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;While we certainly disagree, I'll try and make my point clearer. I've had dealings with exactly one person in your guild that left an impression on me. Every other person in your guild other than this individual has, for one reason or another failed to leave a lasting impression. Because that member of your guild acts in such a way, I (perhaps foolishly) assume that he is in the company of like-minded individuals. Until such a time that I have further dealings with members of Undead Lords, the stigma of that individual's actions will taint my perception of that guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's your loss and the thinking of a close-minded moron.<br>
<br>
&quot;The actions of individuals reflect on the body as a whole. You all ~choose~ to fly a common banner. &lt;Undead Lords&gt; waves above your heads. Individuals who, while flying this flag, do good actions will favorably color the perception of that banner in the minds of people who observe them. Individuals who do &quot;unsavory&quot; things while flying your banner will taint the perception of your guild in a negative way for the people who see those things.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe me, go re-read Iridiscent's original post. Someone flying your banner did something &quot;not-so-good&quot; and to at least one observer of the situation (no matter how close minded you think that person is) the overall perception of your guild got worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me make this abundantly clear because it doesn't appear to be soaking in and then I will redemonstrate the example I put forth above. I do not care for the average EQ player as they have shown time and time again their ignorance and general stupidity.  There are quite a few people on this server that I will deal with.  I have no use nor time to interact with 90% of the population of this server.  That 90% consists of adolescent kids, power-gamers, newbies, kewl-dudes, and general loot mongering idiots.  They generally have no qualities at all that would make me give a flying shit of what they think of myself, my guildmates, or my guild in general.  I think so lowly of them that it truly does not matter one way or the other what they think of me.  You will find this opinion pretty much runs throughout the whole of UDL.  The other 10% of this server I do interact with and they are generally good adult players with a shred of common sense that are capable of seeing this as a game and not the source of their life.  With that knowledge in hand do you really think I'm going to bend over backwards begging for mercy on these boards over the perceived actions of one member?  Far from it.<br>
<br>
Back to my original example of the French citizen... (apparently I'm going to have to spell this out ;x)<br>
<br>
A French citizen (Warpd) comes to the US (Ayonae Ro) and steals a piece of iron (Nasthar Sword.)  He is caught and put in jail (suspended.)  The owner of the piece of the iron (Nasthar Sword) runs off to the newspapers and the next day there is an article run nationwide implicating all French citizens (UDL) as thieves.  Soon the entire country (Ayonae Ro) is in an uproar and demanding that all French citizens (UDL) be ostracized and not allowed into the country.  All French citizens (UDL) do have the option with a little effort of moving to another country (guild here) and renouncing their citizenship (guild.) Now, in this example, was it fair to the rest of the French citizenry to cause a national uproar leading to the banning of all French citizens from coming to the country because the average American was too stupid to see the circumstances for what they are before jumping on the French band-wagon banning?  If you say yes, you are a close-minded moron and I'm wasting my time dealing with you as you're a dead end signifying what's wrong with a lot of this game and the people in it.  Nor would I even want to have anything to do with you.  If any of your guildmates are of the same vein then I can't really say I want anything to do with them either.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and for what it's worth, it takes more than a few veiled insults and backhanded comments to get me upset.&quot;<br>
<br>
My intent was not to upset you only get your attention.  If I wanted to piss you off I would have ventured down other areas such as viewpoints on your lineage, education, etc... By the way, if I made a veiled insult in any way I apologize because it was not intended.  I try to be direct with my insults.<br>
<br>
&quot;I stand behind my reputation and the reputation of my guild brothers and sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
As do I.  Take it, accept it, and move on.  You do not have the right nor qualifications to comment on how I run my guild.  Nor do I on yours.  You can assume all of UDL to be assholes or not.  I'm not going to bend over backwards nor jump through hoops trying to change someone's already contrived perceptions of myself or my guild.  I can shed some light on misperceptions and misreadings, however.  I have done that and now it makes no difference to me what you think of myself or my guild. You can deal with us or not it's your choice.  It doesn't matter to me one way or the other.<br>
<br>
For the record, Warpd looted the sword and had an emergency. He had to leave the keyboard for for a few minutes.  I suppose he could have slapped in a quick /afk but he did not. When he returned to the keyboard he says the group was pretty much in an uproar bitching pretty hard at him.  He didn't take kindly to that and just said fuck it... screw 'em and it spiraled from there.  I can understand his attitude in this but I do not accept it as an excuse.  Nor do I consider the actions of the group justifiable in raising hell after only a few minutes of no response.  I have to conclude he was grouped with a few of the members from that 90% of the server population I spoke of above.  <br>
<br>
To the wizard who won the roll and appears to be a mature adult in his postings here my sincere apologies once again.  I'm sorry this happened.  <br>
<br>
After hearing the full story this goes out to the rest of that group: Tough shit, you can whine me a lullaby when I get online.   <br>
<br>
I consider the matter closed now.  The thread goes wherever it will from here without me.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the nice words, Casidy, it means a lot to me coming from you ;&gt;<br>

<br>
"You failed to read what I said thoroughly and closely..."<br>
<br>
No.  Despite your suggestions to the contrary, my reading comprehension is just fine.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"That's your loss and the thinking of a close-minded moron."<br>
<br>
Perhaps.<br>
<br>
...but I stand by my ascertation that the actions of individuals affect the reputation of those which they ~choose~ to associate with.  Aparently something we disagree on.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"Back to my original example of the French citizen... (apparently I'm going to have to spell this out ;x)"<br>
<br>
Once again, you ~seem~ to be equating my disagreement with you to mean that I don't understand you.  I get your point.  I just disagree.<br>
<br>
I don't expect you, or anyone else for that matter, to be swayed by my argument, it's not my intent.  The difference between your anlogies and my statements is that I'm discussing people who CHOOSE their associations.<br>
<br>
...and for any sufficiently LARGE number of associated people the corelation between single member actions and group-body actions decreases as the population of the body rises.  One bad Frenchman in a country of millions.  Bad country?  Probably not.  One bad person on a 10,000 person server..  Bad server?  Unlikely.  One bad person in a 200 person guild..  Bad guild?  Doubtful.  But reduce the population of the group sufficiently, and raise the population of the "bad element" enough, and things can change.  You yourself suggested that three might be an appropriate number of people in a guild to consider something a "guild action."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"I'm not going to bend over backwards nor jump through hoops trying to change someone's already contrived perceptions of myself or my guild."<br>
<br>
Again, I don't think I've actually said that "I too now hate Undead Lords" or anything to that end.  I had a run-in with a few of your members tonight in-game and frankly, it was a positive experience.  ...but probably something I might not have taken note of were we not to be having this discussion.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
In short, I only thought your post was rude to Iridiscent, and being "a game acquaintence" of Iridiscent, I felt strongly enough about it to speak my mind.  Again, you disagree and seem to place more fault on Iridiscent.  C'est la vie.  We shall agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
I do think the guilt-by-association topic is worthy of discussion however.<br>
