<br>
I do know that I've heard and seen many good things from Vision people.<br>
<br>
When asked to help, they are there, helping and saving somebodies bacon, like yesterday in Kithikor, they came buy and rezzed a Rogue Epic wipeout, then stayed to help take down the General for one of the rogues who still had his item to turn in, and only gave up when enough of the original people had left.<br>
<br>
In Tenebrous, on a bad pull, my group was having trouble with 3 vampires. Palimax was nearby, came and dotted all three mobs and slowed them to the point that we could drop the mobs. <br>
<br>
Several other examples I could list that I have heard about from guildmates and friends are second-hand information, but from trusted sources. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, if you are going to bad-mouth a particular person or guild, have some logs to back up information that you are putting forth to back up your point. Until then, Palimax and Vision have my respect, and if they ask me for help ( unlikely in the extreme that is) , I'll be there to do what I can to help.<br>

<br>
I wouldnt have to be asked Karmon. I dont push my way into camps. No one on this server can say with honesty that I have pushed someone out of a camp before. I dont do it. If someone is there, I wait my turn or go elsewhere. You dont know me, I dont know you, so I have no idea where you think you know how I would act in the reversed situation.<br>
<br>
Kelraz: "Heh, if it was me I would have stayed killing."<br>
<br>
Good to know that Kelraz. Nice to see that the times I told you and your guild that Phini was up so you could get your backbone were appreciated. Btw if it was you, you would need to get realistic first. There is no way in hell you would be able to ks from me.<br>
<br>
Palimax: "Orontes killed unengaged mobs only. Ones standing at their spawn point, at full heath, already spawned, ones not being cleared (or at least not being clearly quickly) by the person who complained. When they asked him to leave, he did. When they called his guildleader, he came."<br>
<br>
Why are you using the plural word, They? Are you speaking of me or the other group of people that Orontes pissed off? The mobs he nuked WERE NOT unengaged, they were meleeing me. You tried to use verants rule of no one owns mobs to your own advantage, yet you convienantly overlook the other aspects that go along with that crappy rule. Those mobs were fighting me, not Orontes... the rule doesnt state that if he starts casting on it, that he has the right to kill it, it states that whoever the mob attacks is the one that has the right to kill it. You want to play by Verants rules, then accept them all and realize he was KSing according to their rules. And for the record Palimax, the spawns were standing no more than 30 seconds. I was sending a tell to the other mine asking how their drops had been. 30 seconds on the first two he tried to kill.. lets not make this sound like the mobs have been sitting there for 5, 10, 15+ minutes. Why dont you tell the server how much time we got to clear mobs before you decide its ok to gank them. "When they called his guildleader he came?" You made a statement to me that you watched him start ganking the mobs in both camps... now its changed to you came after the fact?<br>
<br>
"Yuegou does suggest, now, that Orontes tried to KS engaged mobs. In these situations, the only KS'ing going on was Yeugou attemting to engage mobs that Orontes had begun long casts on. Feel free to quibble over the definition of "engaged mob" without me."<br>
<br>
I see, its ok to use one of verants rules to justify him attacking mobs, but to hell with the other rules that say he shouldnt have been nuking them. Typical.<br>
<br>
"While it's my belief that Orontes was within his right to kill these mobs, it's also my belief that it's simply better in these situations to just leave and go somewhere else -- which Orontes did."<br>
<br>
Like I said in the initial post, it will be just fine when people move into your camps and start killing the mobs you are camping... will be the same situation. As for Orontes leaving... why did he do it a 2nd time? First he showed up in the 1st mine and started ganking mobs from their camp... when they complained, he moved over to the mine I was in and did it there. Thats leaving? Moving to another camp to gank mobs is leaving?<br>
<br>
"No precedent got set here. Vision has always had a policy of defending it's own opportunities to kill mobs, while also giving others their opportunities to do the same."<br>
<br>
Ah so it is a Vision policy now... not just a Palimax policy. Glad you cleared that up. Great to see that anyone can pull any mob they want from a Vision camp if its "standing up, unengaged, and full health". That sure opens alot of doors. "Hey look, Vision cleared to Trakanon, hes standing, unengaged, and full life... CHARGE!"<br>
<br>
"26 posts over a grimling??"<br>
<br>
Some people just dont know how to read so ill state it once again... its not over a grimling.. its over a simple thing called courtesy. How some people expect it, but dont give it in return.<br>
<br>
Yogurt, Yogurthead?... now now children, dont hurt my feelings, especially with those remarkably witty ones... damn did you spend days thinking them up? Ironically I use your correct names, yet I see people crying in this thread and other threads about "calling people names". What a bunch of hypocrites, you can jump up and down and flap your arms when someone calls you anything other than your name, but its ok for you to do it. More of the typical candy ass care bear crap that goes on on these boards. Why dont you all just gather up in a big circle and start tossing each other off... thats all you do on 90% of the posts around here. Nothing but a bunch of backpatters and yes-men. OMG he said something mean to Haloface, get him girls!!!<br>
<br>
One last comment, on a tangent. I read some of the "if this was pvp, who would you kill first" post. Thanks for the laugh, most of you dipshits couldnt fight your way out of a paper bag. All the little doggies barking from the safety of the porch, how cute.<br>

<br>
First of all, I am and forever will be greatful for you sending me a tell that Phinny is up and thus my guild went to kill him for my epic. However, I can't really let someone slander someone's name over a silly camp, one that he wasn't even a direct part of and I believe he may have encouraged his guildmember to leave while the guildmember really didn't have any reason to.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, I think there are 3 factors holding wether or not a spawn or set of spawns is &quot;camped&quot;<br>
<br>
If you are actively engaging a target, it is safe to assume the target is &quot;camped&quot;. Any attempts to steal the &quot;camp&quot; would directly violate the EULA by attacking an already engaged mob without consent.<br>
<br>
If you are currently the only group preparing to engage the target, it is safe to assume the target is &quot;camped&quot;. I.E. you are buffing up for Venril Sathir in the buff room with enough people to attempt the kill. Keep in mind if you completely wipe out the camp is lost, and only by common courtesy do you get the camp back. (always nice to thank group B for holding off one or two wipes to see if you can complete the task at hand)<br>
<br>
If you are actively engaging or preparing to engage in order to progress to a target (say you are killing the myconids on route to Trakanon) it is safe to assume the target is camped.<br>
<br>
As for the grimlings, or say the wyverns in Cobalt Scar, I don't think it is fair to say you can monopolize a zone or a section of a zone and all the pops in that section unless you are able to kill them as they spawn. It seems that the Vision member saw a few untouched, unengaged critters and attacked them. If that isn't allowed, well then next time I log on all of the wyverns on the east side of Cobalt Scar are camped -- sorry quad kiters. (don't I wish...heh)<br>
<br>
I would think you would be thanking Palimax and the guild member in question for leaving the zone to you and your guild. Maybe I misread it all, but in the end didn't you get the spawns to yourself anyway? <p><i>~Kelraz Bladesinger<br>

Most of the people camping there are motivated by either a tireless devotion to tradeskills, or pure greed.  I'm curious as to what tradeskill Yuegou is working on.<br>
<br>
Let me explain what happens when someone comes to the cave that I normally clear for small stackable acrylia [They're for several trade skills, I use them for tinkering]:<br>
<br>
They come to the cave that I'm in, they see NO mobs up, with me moving to spawn locations that I have already cleared BEFORE the mob repops.  They see no unengaged mobs, and they move on - often asking me if I'll send them a tell when I'm finished.<br>
<br>
If someone came to the entrace of the cave that I was in, and the outside mobs had already repopped before I could clear them, then as far as I'm concerned, they'd be perfectly within their rights to kill them before I could make it back out from inside the cave -- as I have no right to lay claim to more than I can handle in a reasonable period of time. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
youre right yugo, palimax is probably the rudest, uncaring, greed stricken , unethical guy ive ever heard of.  i hope i never run into the guy myself. his reputation sucks around here anyway! i pray that you never have to go through such a horrible experience again!  If you can even find the courage to play again after such a wrongdoing by orontes and palimax.<br>
 good luck to you,, i hope you will be able to continue your EQ experience with the same enjoyment as before.<br>

And yeah I think I'll call you Yogurthead if I like.  Obviously it upsets you, otherwise you wouldn't address the issue.  Plus it's a childish name that fits you well. <p><a target="Shortyrez Starfury" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45788">Shortyrez Starfury</a><BR>
