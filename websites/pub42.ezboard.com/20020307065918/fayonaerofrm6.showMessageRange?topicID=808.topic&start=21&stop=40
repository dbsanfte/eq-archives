<br>
IMHO terrorism is the act of pursuing a grievance with party A by killing/intimidating party B.  Consider the september 11th attacks: by my definition a hit on the trade center was a terrorist action but an attack on the pentagon might not be since the Pentagon is pretty clearly a military target.  Both attacks though used planes full of non-combatants so ultimately they were both terrorist attacks.<br>
<br>
Attacking the civilian population of a country to influence the government of those civilians is wrong IMHO.  There is no justification.<br>

You really think so?<br>
<br>
2 bombs... one on Nagasaki and one on Hiroshima. Two of the largest (note, not THE largest) wholesale slaughtering of civilian populations.  After the second bomb the government of Japan surrendered the next day not wishing to see more hundreds of thousands of civilians turned into a piles of ash and glass.  While both were terrifying and morally questionable.  Most every historian agrees that those bombs probably saved more lives in the long run than the invasion of Japan would have cost in either Japanese or American lives.  More than a few Japanese from that era agreed that it was probably the best decision for both sides.<br>

<br>
The original question of this thread, &quot;Are there any forms of Terrorism that are good?&quot; begs two different questions in response- what deos the word &quot;terrorism&quot; mean, and what does the word &quot;good&quot; mean.  <br>
Here is the only dictionary definition of terrorism yet seen on this thread:<br>
<br>
&quot;The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, since war has been &quot;unlawful&quot; since at the very latest, 1921 (Kellogg-Briand Pact), I think War fits rather nicely here, even though as a matter of both fact and law, every nation considers the right to make war a basic part of sovereignity.<br>
<br>
A final question, the American Civil War cost the lives of nearly 1,000,000 Americans to end slavery and put to rest the question of states Rights.  I fail to see how it would somehow have been worse to blow up some public building, kill a few thousand &quot;civilians&quot; and accomplish the same purpose.  I'm not saying it could have been done- see Northern Ireland for an example of Terrorism as an excercise in futility- but would that have been more atrocious than a million dead? I don't see it.<br>

<br>
french resistance movement during WW2 also used terrorism as tactics..<br>
<br>
infact all revolutions that have taken place in our history has had terrorsim to some extent..<br>
<br>
so does this mean that terrorism is OK if the cause is good? well its hard to answer that since the "good" part is highly relevant, what is good for A isnt always good for B.<br>
<br>
Mr Bush has declared his own Holy war (jihad) against all terrorists in the world, does this mean that america is now the world police that will send troops to put and end to any public protest? i mean during the recent top meatings in Gothenburg and in Italy there was a public outcry with huge riots by young people protesting against them.. using any means possible to fight their opressors aka the police.<br>
<br>
and can we expect american troops here in sweden hunting down our own worst form of terrorism namely the vegan's (undefinable but militant vegetarians that sabotage farms and burn down MC donalds buildings) i'd say the world will always have some forms of terrorism or it will stagnate..<br>
and btw hunting down suspected terrorists can also be called terrorism so i guess you have to start hunting yourselfs aswell.<br>

If you are attacking a supporter of an enemy regime or the regime itself then you may have legitimate targets.  Slamming a plane load of civilians into a civilian office building is not an act of war, it is an act designed to inspire terror in the population of a country.<br>
<br>
The bombing of Japan in WWII occurred under the assumption, probably correct based on our experience fighting the Japanese in the pacific, that the US was at war with the entire population of Japan and that the enemy would not surrender even if they were obviously beaten in normal combat.  To end that war it was decided that it would ultimately cost less lives to demonstrate total military supremacy to the enemy by destroying two cities.  I don't know if I would have made the same choice, but in retrospect is seems to be the correct one.<br>
<br>
Treistaania you are wrong, I think, about the French resistance.  They used guerrilla tactics not terrorist tactics.  They weren't planting bombs on the street to kill random folks walking around to protest the Nazi occupation.  They instead did everything they could to kill Nazis.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it makes more sense to say that war has achievable goals but terrorism does not.  In a revolution your goal is to replace your existing government with one more to your liking.  To achieve that you attack the structures and organizations that allow the current government to function.  A terrorist that has a problem with that same government ultimately seems to dislike an idea.  Since you can't fight an idea you lash out at the things that represent that idea to you.  If you hate western culture you might fixate on the US as the most successful western country and begin shooting at anything that symbolizes the US.  Ultimately you can't effect a change in your situation because your enemy isn't physical and can't be fought.<br>

<br>
Wearing a uniform makes you an acceptable victim of violence.  Its as simple as that.  When you join the military you take on all of your governments enemies and become a target for them.  You accept that at any given moment your life may be violently taken from you.  This is especially true for most modern militaries where all enlisted personnel have joined voluntarily.<br>
<br>
Since the Pact of Paris (the Kellogg-Briand Pact) wasnt signed until 1928 it has no bearing on the Civil War aspects of this conversation.  Truthfully, seeing as how worthless the Pact was (and is) I dont really see that it holds much bearing period except in the textbooks as a failed half-attempt at peace.<br>
<br>
&quot;A final question, the American Civil War cost the lives of nearly 1,000,000 Americans to end slavery and put to rest the question of states Rights.

I'm not saying it could have been done...but would that have been more atrocious than a million dead? I don't see it.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would have been worse because the targets would have been civilian populations.  A huge majority of the americans who died in the civil war were military personnel.  The armies of both the North and the South (with the exception of some black slaves who were pressed into fighting for the South) were completely voluntary.  By joining the armies of their respective sides, those who died in the civil war accepted the fact that their death was acceptable to gain the goals of their side.<br>

<br>
  I used the American Civil war as an example of a conflict that almost certainly couldn't have been more devastating to the parties involved, and more ideologically based.  It may help you to know that as far as &quot;Volunteer&quot;, virtually every male in the Southern States between the ages of 17 and 55 was eventually conscripted, as there were no exemptions other than for disability and vital war work.  Even in the northern armies, by 1864 an overwhelming number were either draftees, or paid substitutes mainly recruited from Europe.  Every American Army since the 1863 onward has been comprised of mainly draftees, until the Gulf War.  <br>
<br>
So seriously, what is so sacrosant about blowing people up with a plane, but not about dropping bombs out of the plane?  How about dropping bombs out of a plane unto &quot;civilians&quot; on their way to the tank factory? <br>
<br>
As an aside, I would personally prefer an argument more compelling than &quot;it just is&quot;- and I still want to see a useable definition of &quot;good&quot; and a better definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; in this context.<br>

If you don't see the difference between targeting people in a slushie-machine factory and people in a tank factory then I can only be thankful you aren't in charge of any military Orontes.<br>
<br>
Civilians involved in a war-effort are soldiers for all intents &amp; purposes since they contribute to the capacity of your enemy to continue aggression.  Civilians riding in a plane to see thier relatives are not involved in the war unless you believe that genocide is the easiest way to prevent future conflict.<br>

<br>
Virtually every civilian in a country contributes to the capacity of their country to continue aggression to one degree or another.  Unless... they have somehow managed to miraculousy find a way to extricate themselves from their nation's economy.  Countries can't go on the aggressive without an economy.  They can try but they won't last for long.  It's impossible to maintain production and effort when your cities are rioting.  Everytime they spend a dollar, a peso, or whatever they contribute to their nation's economy and ability to pay to financially maintain a war effort.  Even those people on the plane had jobs and were working and functioning members of the US economy.  War is not going to distinguish you as being a soldier by what time of day it is or wether you may be on vacation.  &quot;Whelp time to clock out now... phweew... I'm no longer a target until 8am tomorrow.&quot;  I wish it was that clear cut and nice but it's just not going to be.<br>
<br>
Wether they build slurpee machines or manufacture tank barrels they are still participating in the maintaining of our country's economy and it's ability to keep troops on foreign soils and at sea.  Why do you think Bin Laden was going after the world trade center and the stock market?  He was hoping to cripple our monetary ability to keep and maintain the troops in the middle east.  Fortunately, he didn't do his homework and had no clue that our economy wasn't as centralized as he hoped it would be.  He migh have succeeded back in the 1920's as the depression proved how centralized our economy had become around the stock market.  Thankfully, there's enough safe guards in place and alternative investments that we are no longer that centralized.  He made a dent though, I'll give him that much.<br>
<br>
To bring back another WW 2 example... something like 95% or more of the US civilian population at home was actively participating in the war effort.  From metal recycyling to tire scrounging to candy bar making... virtually the entire US work force was directed towards the war effort in both support and maintenance of our troops over seas.  By your definition practically every US civilian was a soldier and a legitimate target at that time.  Even if they had gotten on a plane to go see their mother or father, etc...<br>

The founders of the United States were probably very much terrorists.  Aside from the Boston Tea Party, the colonists in favor of revolution did what they could to rally people under their flag, and cause fear and terror in their enemy, through subterfuge and a lot of propaganda.<br>
<br>
As they say, history is written by those who win wars.  A lot of acts that the US considers horrendous, we've done ourselves at some time or another.  Pearl Harbor and the St. Valentines Massecre (in Vietnam)?  Same thing as George Washington crossing the Deleware.<br>
<br>
Suppose, for a moment, that the United States, through some great miracle, was overthrown by the forces of Osama Bin Laden in a series of bloody battles followed by an invasion.  The resulting future was to become an arabian empire led by him, that eventually prospers as much as the United States ever did.<br>
<br>
200 years from now, would the destruction of the World Trade Center be referred to as an act of terrorism, or an act of heroism that caused the eventual forming of a great and wonderful empire?<br>
<br>

No shit the US factories were targets in WWII.  The german factories were too, hence the mass-bombings of those targets.<br>
<br>
The factory is a target.  The neighborhood where the workers live is NOT.<br>
<br>
Ullric, there is a difference between revolutionaries and terrorists, as I mentioned in an earlier post.  The boston tea party was not an act of terrorism, it was an act of vandalism.  It's always struck me as unfortunate that high-school history teachers are stuck with books that claim this is a patriotic act:  a bunch of men, angry about taxes, looted and vandalised the business property of British merchants.  I'm not aware of any organized efforts by the american revolutionaries to shoot torries &amp; burndown their houses.  Tempers may have flaired &amp; someone may have taken advantage of local sentiment to get back at a neighbor, but for the most part the fight was constrained to battlefields.<br>
<br>
History, in the short term, is written by the victors but it's a bit ridiculous tho suggest that the actual attack on the world trade center could ever be considered a heroic act.  At best the facts would be rearranged to justify the action.<br>

Next time I'll be sure to piss on your corn flakes too.  No one dropped an airplane on anyone's house.  A military headquarters was hit (the pentagon) and a major economic financial institution was destroyed.  Please tell me who's house got a plane dropped through their living room?<br>
<br>
I don't recall anyone being allowed to live out of an operational flying airliner, nor the pentagon, nor even the WTC.  So... what's your point now or do you really have one beyond wanting to get pissy with me for no discernible reason?<br>
<br>
There's a few things you need to wake up to about warfare.  It's not pretty and it sure as hell isn't perfect.  Laser guided bombs, GPS guided cruise missiles and such are pretty new to the war arena.  The numbers are in on those laser guided bombs... only about 40% actually hit their intended targets.  Where do you think the rest go?  That's right... right into the neighboorhoods surrounding those factories where all the workers for that plant live.  Housing developers don't take military strikes into consideration when building those neighboorhoods.  They build them as close to the factories as they are allowed to as a matter of day to day convenience for those workers and those workers are going to flat out die when the shit starts hitting the fan.  It's a sad thing but it's a flat out fact of war and of life.  Yes, it would be nice if all factories were built 50 miles away from all housing.  Yes, it would be nice if the pilots had the luxury of cruising to ten feet off the ground so they could hit their targets more accurately... however, they are more concerened with getting home alive to their own families which means dropping those bombs from thousands of feet in the air.  They could really give a rat's ass about what you think of their targeting ability back in the confort of your own home while their ass is the one on the line dodging SAMs and trying to accomplish their mission.<br>
<br>
I know what you're saying about trying to target military first and such but when you're a religious zealot fighting what you perceive as the devil's kingdom on earth you're going to use whatever means at your disposal to strike at the heart of it.  I imagine UBL feels very justified in wasting the lives of the few innocents on those airplanes in order to bring about what he was sure would be a stake through the heart of the devil's empire.  All governemts at some time or another have considered it a fiar trade off of a few innocent lives to achieve what they believed to be the greater good.  UBL doesn't have an army.  No army on earth is foolish enough launch a frontal assault on the US.  They know they're going to lose.  So they have to try whatever other means are at their disposal.  And they too, are going to give a rat's ass about you think of their morality when they believe beyond any doubt that they are fighting by God's word.<br>
<br>
The response to that I'm afraid is going to be a lot more immoral acts in order to properly defend against those kinds of tactics for the greater good.<br>

<br>
Define short term.<br>
<br>
And why is it so rediculous.  Religious zealots of the Al-Qaida (sp?) already claim those who sacrificed themselves for their Jihad are heroes.  If they were to win everthing (as it were), why would it NOT be written so?<br>
<br>
Even if the Boston Tea Party was an act of vandalism, modern day textbooks (at least 1970ish modern, 200 years after the event) claim it to be at least somewhat heroic.  Historians know the actual facts for what they are, and tell it like it is maybe, but we still feed false information to our kids, many of whom never bother figuring out the truth.<br>
<br>
Destroying tea = revolutionary act of heroism after 200 years<br>
<br>
Sacrificing your own life to kill thousands of the enemy = Huge revolutionary catalyst resulting in a rhetorical empire.<br>
<br>
I think you are limiting your views in this case.  To YOU, what happened could never be called an act of heroism.  To someone else, it might be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/12/02 6:03:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=808.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: are there any forms of terrorism that are good?</span><hr size=1> how is 11sep bombings equal to the word terrorism? isnt this word as wide as any other to describe things?<br>
<br>
french resistance in ww2 used bombs to fight the germans and they held people as prisoners demanding something in return.. that is terrorism.. and i think that was good terrorism because i think its for a good cause..<br>
<br>
i dont like osama bin laden one little bit and i think that his actions are horrible there simply isnt an excuse but it was in no way any more horrible then how americans have done several times against other innocent people.. <br>
bombing 2 large cities to show off force in japan was in no way defendable and truthfully it was all about testing a new toy they had.. not only that , the 2 cities in question had nearly 100% civilian population who had nothing to do with the war.. america got theír butt kicked at pearl harbor and wanted to dish out some payback  thats it.<br>
<br>
but take a small population who gets overthrown by a much stronger force.. hmm tempted to use indians as example.. nah..<br>
ill use ireland instead..<br>
why should ireland take orders from great britan? they wanted their own country with their own culture and laws and they fought GB with any means possible.. and if you take 400 civilians against 50 000 soldiers you cant expect them to run screaming over a hill armed with slingshots.<br>
instead they used targeted terror bombings in the Uk.. that hurts alot more then those slingshots i promise..<br>
<br>
in sweden we have the right by law to demonstrate against things we think is wrong.. and more often then not those demonstrations end up in riots because the police starts harassing them.. its not very hard to agitate a mob of 18yearolds and when thats done you can always claim they started to vandalize and loot stores..<br>
if you have a planned protest march trough a large city as gothenburg and the police places themself in the way with riot shields and teargas grenades then dont expect anything less then a few rocks flying in the air.<br>
people got shot by the police that day.. i saw a private video take where a police officer takes a pregnant womand who has her hands in the air saying i give up by her hair pulling her to the ground and kicking her.. and yet the police are the heroes?<br>
<br>
fighting your opressors with any means will always include the use of terrorism no matter how many laws there are against it.<br>

- Infact, the IRA's prime target is Northern Ireland, that WANTS to stay under British rule, whereas Southern Ireland doesn't. Ireland is a trickier situation than any. I agree, as with Scotland and Wales, England needed to keep their hands to themselves, but that just goes for their whole entire empire, and every other empire in the past.
