We mobilized forces, and I was one of the first to show up in Karnors.  Unfortunately, I wasnt the only one.  At first show, Tides of Valor had 4 in the zone, Exiled Alliance had 14.<br><br>15 minutes later, Tides had 12 in the zone, Exiled had 16.<br><br>I attemtped to talk to XA's guildleader, offering him the option to back down as a favor to ToV (we saved a 16 man XA raid deep in chardok, a 6 man group stumbling across a large pile of corpses).  He informed me that Venril Sathir was a ffa mob, and they were there first anyway.  I conceeded, and the leaders of our raid agreed we'd have to wait for XA to try before we would get a shot.<br><br>XA had 22 people and were preparing, Tides had 14 in the back of the prep room, with 2 more in zone.  XA went in, we waited to see what would happen.<br><br>XA botched it, and were wiped out...their last remaining clerics were outside of VS's room, and he was running around killing them.  ToV crammed into the back of the prep room, for fear of being trained.  Sure enough, the last remaining member of XA's raid party, Skyjulin, with VS aggro on her, ran directly into our midst and died.  VS proceeded to wipe us out.<br><br>10 minutes later we were rezzed up, with another 10 people coming in, and we went in and took down VS on our own, while XA rezed their raid party.  XA claimed Skyjulin was trying to get out to camp.  The GMs could do nothing, since they werent there to witness it.<br><br>Friday, we heard that Trakanon had popped, but Vision was already going in after her, with XA's help, so we ignored it more or less.  Once we heard that Vision had failed though, we decided to go check things out.  We showed up (about 8 of us) at Sebilis, and an officer in Vision told us that we could have an uninturrupted attempt at Trak if we helped them with CR.  We agreed, grabbed a mage and headed in.  Along for the ride was an Exiled Alliance cleric (whose name escapes me atm).  We never questioned him, assuming he was there to rez people dead in the lair once we took down Trak.<br><br>A total of 40 of us were assembled at the final prep spot before Trak's lair, going over last minute tactics.  The XA cleric had set up camp across the river, within sight of Trak.  As we moved up to the last corner before the lair, Trak came charging around the corner at us.  Needless to say, we all died due to bad positioning (though we still got him to gate on us).<br><br>The only conclusion we could come to was that XA had yet again trained us, since we'd never had Trak aggro on us like that before, and had already set him up for the rush.  The cleric must have cast an aggresive spell on trak from where he sat, wiping us out.  Vision and XA then moved in and killed Trak, while we summoned corpses and rezzed before heading out.<br><br>Twice in 24 hours, what appears to be intentional training of raid parties to gain advantage by Exiled Alliance.  Take it for what you will. <p><HR WIDTH="50%" ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="http://outside.clanpages.com/podside.jpg" ALIGN="left" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=100><br><b>Ullric Littleblade</b><br>Assassin of Tides of Valor<br><A HREF="http://www.thesafehouse.org">Ayonae Ro Ring Warden</A><BR>Master of the Jade Hand<BR><i><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=83046">"Speed kills if y'know what I mean."</A></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usphirekblackstaff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sphirek Blackstaff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 7:23:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> You failed trak with 40 people?<br>wow <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uetirnaltwigz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Etirnal Twigz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 7:27:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Sphirek know how to read?? <p><center><img src="http://members.home.net/ggothlin/Base22.bmp"><center><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5241">Click Here To View My Equip</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 7:32:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> We've done trak with 24.

Perhaps my opinion on the matter may be a bit tainted, but I don't think Terhas (the cleric in question) trained anyone. There are too many logical explanations, both in motive and probability, to jump to the conclusion that Terhas trained you. First off... why would he?? If we agreed that you could have a shot at trak, why would we train you when you attempted him? We are perfectly capable of performing that corpse run ourselves, so it's not because we needed to &quot;sucker&quot; you into helping on the CR. It's also dumb to train him right before you were going to kill him. It would make more sense to train him on you when you were unbuffed and unorganized, to further ensure the failure of the raid. Second, just look at the facts. There are too many ways to aggro trak while pulling the mobs in his lair: bard songs, group buffing, shoddy pulling, etc. I myself have been on two different trak raids where he was aggro'd prematurely (but it was never my fault <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Finally, how was he the ONLY person to survive?? If he aggro'd trakanon first, I would assume he would be the first to die. If he used DA to train you, you would have seen him run through your camp - did you? Before you jump to a conclusion, objectively look at the facts... in this case, I think Terhas recieves the &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; seal of approval. <p><html><b><green>Roliel Glorysong</b></green><i>World's worst tank,and a terrible singer too</i></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 3:30:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trak thing</span><hr size=1> Whoops, accidentally posted twice. <p><html><b><green>Roliel Glorysong</b></green><i>World's worst tank,and a terrible singer too</i></html></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/urolielkotn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RolielKotN</A> at: 11/26/01 3:30:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/26/01 3:56:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trak thing</span><hr size=1> First off...Terhas would have died regardless, if Trak rushed us and he didnt camp out.

Some of the reason they may have failed could be from the fact taht another guild in force is set up just feet away from them like vultures. I know when you are making your preperations and people are not listening 100% that the odds on failure go up a ton, and with another guild sitting so close its very hard to concentrate 100% on what you should be paying attention to. I believe your guild should have waited at the zone area till they finished thier attempt at VS. To me it looks like you guys were sitting there with the hopes that they fail, and figure as soon as the last man dies rush VS and finish off kill. So in the end it all works out the wya you want anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=626.topic&start=21&stop=39>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=626.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=626.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=626.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=626.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=626.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=626.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
