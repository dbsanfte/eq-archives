Phaw I say !</span><hr size=1> Such does not exist.<br><br>The Player Base of Everquest in general is not what I would consider honorable and filled with integrity. <br><br>The goal in Everquest (to most) is not to become a better person, but to collect as many toys as you can until the game ends (preaching that you play for friendship all the while). <br><br>With the majority player base being as it is, and the goals being as they are, the amount of faith to place in a guild being able to filter out the &quot;goons&quot; can't be that large. No doubt, it's a goon responsible for goon filtering.  The guild is made up of a majority of goons. In most cases, integrity is overlooked for the need of a certain class. So if you're an enchanter or cleric, you can be quite the goon and still be tolerated. <br><br>All of the high level guilds on this server, no doubt carry enough low lives to wear the banner of &quot;dishonest guild of greedy lootwhores&quot;.  <br><br>The theme of Everquest is &quot;me&quot;.  The theme of the high level game is &quot;Us.....and if I provide for the Us, the Us will pay me back eventually....I hope...if not I will find another Us to provide me with the items I crave&quot;. <br><br>I've come across garbage players from each guild.  If you're a member of one of the 55 plus guilds you're really in no place to judge the integrity of another bunch of treasure hunters. Make sure your own yard is clean before you go harp on the neighbors. <br><br>Luckily, there's a substantial amount of players who judge by items gained and treasure obtained. So loot enough, and your integrity will be overlooked. People will inspect and kiss ass, hoping to eventually join your guild and get in on the goods. <br><br>If you can't beat 'em. Join 'em.  Stats on swrds , bro? Peeps wanna set seeds? kk, I have twink monk and twink war lol. LF fungi. <br><br>For the love of crap, you're not a good player because you have an epic weapon, or because you are in full Kael armor, or because you're a member of a 60 player strong level 60 guild. <br><br>You threw honor away the day you said &quot;we need clerics and enchanters and warriors....BAD, if we're going to get that loot&quot;. <br><br>Now, those of you who have honor, are babysitters. <br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umomentomalevolent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momento Malevolent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/10/01 10:39:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=575.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So, you're a member of an honorable EQ guild?

Could it be killing a mob with fewer peeps than another guild?<br><br>There are far more reasons why people play EQ. To generalize that folks in large guilds are there for items only is a fundamantal flaw to your argument.<br><br>I know guilds where the base requirement is a PC and a pulse. Others where no matter how bad a class is needed, the POTENTIAL problems that person brings will prevent membership far before they are made a member.<br><br>I have seen guilds discipline members, and boot members for the violation of guild rules on a regular basis. I have seen guilds pass on boss mobs to let another guild who had never attempted that mob have a try (and I'm talking when the first guild was at the stageing area ready to attack).<br><br>I will go back to the point that EQ is played be people who live in capatalist countries. There are few socialists or communists who play I would venture. Western society is also very &quot;me&quot; oriented. To expect a game to develop a socialist culture, when such cultures don't flourish anywhere, is unrealistic.<br><br>There are good, if not better guilds out there, I say the problem is with the people who don't take the time to let a good guild grow with them and jump to the biggest guild they can find with the quickest acceptance policy.<br><br>Remember, you are always free to start up your own guild.

I rolled up an enchanter and my friend a cleric.

I started tailoring instead of jewelrymaking because I thought that, as someone who could only wear cloth, I should learn to make it (and wore my raw silk robe until L 18, when we got a gossamer). We quested for the Screaming mace, and I used a fine steel dagger (that *was* a gift) until I gave up weapons at L 22 or so.  I did the Moggok at L 18 (took me that long to find my way across antonica <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and was immediately asked if I would sell it (laughs).  I still won't sell them, but gladly will make one for free for anyone who will spend the evening in conversation while we do the legwork together, don't get many takers though... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I sweated bullets illusioning up and going to Neriak to get the first two enchant metal spells (still don't know how I feel about them putting that line of spells in felwithe, learning to use your illusions is an essential part of any enchanters education).  When I could finally make enchanted silver jewelry (and afford to make a few pieces) we were so excited that everyone in our fledgling guild had +2 Int or Wis or Str rings <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   When one of my friends could finally make tailored belt pouches and backpacks, we were out in force killing bears in West Commons for the skins....

Many can vouch for this. I have been playing since day of release (ok so i have 189 days played till i actually reached level 60 ;p)<br><br>Recently I rolled up a little cleric so I could one day actually play in the Plane of Growth. I wanted her to earn her items. At level 22 she was in Blue Wicker Armor that I had looted off the kobolds in the Warrens. Other members in my group included a twinked up warrior (who knew me well) and another caster who didn't know me at all.<br><br>I experienced reverse snobbery. This caster would not talk to me, called out her heals, asked the twink warrior for advice, etc. So I asked him if it was because I looked like a newbie, to which he replied yes. It disturbed me enough to go pull out some gear out of the bank to make her look "acceptable". :rolleyes  Sigh, peer pressure ;p<br><br>hehe Trying to get to the point of this post...

We know what race/class combination best suits our personality.  We, for the most part, know the best weapons, armor, items to work at achieving.  But, if you make a new character on AR, many times you will fall into the pit of peer pressure that happened to Dashmoo <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Edit: I have fallen into this temptation a couple times as well.  It is very easy to do when your main has XXk plat in the bank and your newbie is starving)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  But, on a different server, there is no high level main to give you things, even money.<br><br>I have started 3 different characters on 3 different servers.  A Wood Elf Druid, a Erudite Necro, and an Ogre Warrioress.  I have played each of them to level 15 or so.  I dont play them alot anymore because I really miss my friends, and Thistle.  But Thistle and I have discussed doing this together, and I think we may be doing it soon.  It really does make the game all new again. <p><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/01/11/12/flamingtext_com.111722210.gif" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a><br>Image by <a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb2.html">FlamingText.com</a></BODY></HTML></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufebreeza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Febreeza</A> at: 11/12/01 10:19:51 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=575.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=575.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=575.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=575.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=575.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=575.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=575.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=575.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
