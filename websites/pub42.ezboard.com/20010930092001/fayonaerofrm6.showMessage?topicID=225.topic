However, usually we complain about these things because they adversely affect our own play time or that of our friends.  Tonight, unfortunately, the Cup of Incovenience ran over and, in addition to all the corpses and wasted time, an additional victim was found: the relationship between my guild and a handful of members from another.<br>
<br>
Red Branch is not a large or well-known guild.. and is certainly far from uber.  However, every so often we are able to get enough people on to do something kinda cool.  Tonight, we had a couple groups' worth of people on and decided to do some of the battles for the 9th Coldain Ring.  Specifically, we went after Doldugin and the triggered giant spawns deep in the Ice Chanter area of Kael Drakkel.<br>
<br>
Everyone was hyped up, as people usually are on guild raids, and we marched up the ramps of Kael flooring giants left and right making our way in to the trigger point.  When we got to the room, however, we were shocked to find 5 or 6 people from another guild sitting there camping the few room spawns.<br>
<br>
At this point, we should have just turned around and walked home.  But everyone was hyped up.. we were going to do this damn quest.  We were going to be nice about it, of course.. we'd stay as far away from them as possible, not kill any of their mobs, buff them, trigger our 2 rings' worth of spawns and leave.  It was shaping up to be just another &quot;too many people, not enough space&quot; situation where everyone grumbles about it for a while, but then it's over in 10 mins and life goes on.  OH HOW WRONG WE WERE!<br>
<br>
The first went fine.. giants spawned.. we killed them.  More giants got triggered.. we killed them.  Somehow during one of these fights, a giant broke off and attacked the other guild~  Why?  I wish we knew.  I can only think it's because the other guild was trying to be good citizens even though we were clearly in the wrong (having failed to just walk away as outlined above).  No death came of it, though, and we killed all the giants with no one dying and without even interrupting their XP spawns.  Great!  Things were going according to plan.<br>
<br>
Then we made our second mistake and tried to trigger the spawns again.  It started out the same: giants.. dead giants.. more giants.. dead giants.. final mob!  We kill the final mob and.. uh.. more giants.. more giants again.. more dead giants.. more giants.  The quest had locked into a spawn loop--spitting out giants as fast as we could kill them.  We killed the entire chain of giants fighting non-stop THREE times before we finally realized there was just no way out of this.<br>
<br>
With our numbers slowly dwindling as this cleric or that paladin ran out of mana, we sent people to ask the other guild to please camp or feign and that we were very very sorry, we'd try to get this all fixed.  Again, being wonderful citizens of this game, they did so--understanding that, while we were in the wrong at first, this was clearly out of the control of any mortal being.  The wheel of fate was being spun by crappy Verant scripting.  The arrow always lands on: SNAFU.<br>
<br>
The mess is still being cleaned up as I write this post.  Tempers are hot, people are logging in disgust (on both sides).  But the worst part is that the other guild, instead of being to write this whole thing off to &quot;too many people, not enough room&quot; now assigns the whole of the blame to Red Branch--and rightly so!<br>
<br>
Our intentions were: &quot;we will inconvenience 4 or 5 people from this guild for 10 minutes without interrupting their xp and we'll be on our way.&quot;<br>
<br>
After everything hit the fan, it's only logical to assume that our intentions were: &quot;we will inconvenience whomever we want, whenever we want, for however long we want while abusing their generosity and, ultimately, getting them killed as they tried to help us recover.&quot;<br>
<br>
So from Red Branch, a hearty apology to those in Final Destiny that were unlucky enough to be involved in this fiasco.  You put up with us when you shouldn't have had to, you helped us without us asking you, and you suffered loss at the hands of the fickle finger of Verant Coding.<br>
<br>
For all of the above, we are deeply, truly sorry.<br>
