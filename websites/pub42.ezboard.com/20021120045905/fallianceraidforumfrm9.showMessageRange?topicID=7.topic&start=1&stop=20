I hope we get lots of feedback on this and that we can all come up with a system that works.<br>
Rather than go into any reasons why this structure is necessary I will simply outline my proposed idea.<br>
-Alternate between random and the set structured loot rules.<br>
Example: currently their exists a rule that entitles only level 55+ characters the priviledge of rolling on Breast Plates. Alternating between raids that use this rule and a free raid where anyone involved in the raid can have a chance at rolling gives the characters lower than 55 something to &quot;shoot for&quot;.<br>
If an alternating system is going to be used it is important to not disclose whether the raid is Open or structured until it starts. This ensures that as many people as possible attend the raid...( otherwise those inelligible for item rolls will not come) <br>
-This idea can go even further and be done on individual item drops rather than the whole raid. Perhaps the next Breastplate that drops can be randomed to all involved in the raid...then the one after that follows the 55+ rule. This in itself could solve alot of problems and give everyone involved a fair chance. Those characters with a longer time put into the game still get their chances at loots, while younger characters have a chance at getting that really great piece of gear.<br>
-It is agreed that a loot list is too difficult to maintain..yet it is also agreed that some form of recording &quot;who has got what&quot; is necessary to prevent the same Luckier players from winning all the rolls. There are players who have attended all the raids and yet never won anything in a roll. I propose rather than maintain a list, people use goodwill and remember that they have won an item and let a fellow gamer who has not, roll in their place. Feedback on this point is very welcome..we must come up with something that works.<br>
-Point system. I have heard of some guilds that use a point system for determining who gets to roll on drops. A single point is awarded to the character for each raid they attend in the presence of guild officers. When a drop happns that several players want only those players that have &quot;#&quot; of points may roll. Once rolled there point total drops back to zero. This system is fair to all...as it rewards those who are involved in raids and lets the players rotate in and out of order.<br>
The negatives to this is who is to say How many points a certain player has...inflating of points will occur...and the casual player gets left in the dust in this system.<br>
In closing I invite all of you to add your input in an attempt to come up with a loot system that makes us all happier.<br>
What we need is constructive discussion and suggestions to loot arbitration. <br>

I dont quite get it.  I dont mean to the bringer of bad news, but.....<br>
<br>
These type of raids are ONLY POSSIBLE with a HIGH level tank crew, and usually a HIGH level monk puller.  The BP rule makes perfect sense to me..a 49-52 or so tank would last barely longer than i would against these uber mobs.  Paith, who is 55 plus, got his first piece of thurg armor ever the other day.  He dies about 10-15 times a raid, not counting wipeouts, to pull for us.(he makes it possible to do these raids)<br>
<br>
Dinekus just finally got the BP from thurg after many, many, many kael raids.  He also dies about 2-3 times more a raid than anyone.  Ramune also.( they make these raids possible)  without them, we wouldnt even have the chance to get this stuff.  Ummm, our highest melee in Order are all Rangers, and as bad as we like to think we are, (and we are pretty rockin) we dont make good tanks against level 56-60plus mobs.  <br>
<br>
A friend of mine is a 59 myrmidon, he has recently received a set of thurg armor.  WHY? well he single group pulls with a 60 monk, and gets the mobs that drop the armor components.  If you want this stuff, sorry to say, LEVEL! Or be patient, and it will come your way eventually, if you come to them often.<br>
<br>
I know this sounds unfair to the casual gamer, but there is plenty of  gear out there, in quests, or now with luclin many new drops.  My thurg quest arms were only a small upgrade to my Black ice sleeves, cost about 700-1k, My kromriff military leggings are comparable to thorny vine leggings(planear drop legs).  My quest helm of tracker that i will receive upon turning 55(quest all done) is comparable to any helm. My treeweave is comparable to my planear drop BP.<br>
<br>
I just feel for all the people who run these raids, die hundreds of times, and never get anything.  Then when they get a drop, theres all this dissention.  <br>
<br>
If you are a warrior, around 49-52 or so, and want the thurg armor pieces, then you can set up a kael raid.  it takes about 2-4 groups depending on average level to take these giants.  And you will still NEED a couple close to 60 tanks to take the hits, a close to 60 FD puller, and plenty of clerics to heal. (who may not be real happy about you getting the BP when others are actually tanking these mobs) <br>
<br>
And another thing, these loot policies we have been using are temporary, the raid organizers and loot coordinators are still trying to get a system that is satisfactory and maintainable.  So give it some time.  As far as people not wanting to come to raids because they cant get a BP, theres always a chance that the higher levels already have the piece, or are LD, and you may get lucky.  Luck plays an important role in these raids.  <br>
<br>
As far as the 55 rule also, maybe the alternating method may be nice...But YOU still need to have near 60 tanks getting HIT, is it fair for a tank that isnt even TANKING the mobs to have the BP over someone who is there getting the snot smacked out of em for the good of the raid?<br>
<br>
Just my opinion, and grats on all the drops guys and gals, i had fun.  I look forward to the next raid.  I personally enjoy them immensely, loot or no loot. If i get something. GREAT, if not i still had fun, and got to rumble with my buddies!<br>

<br>
Breastplates and greaves done in this manner would be great *if* they were something that generally dropped as often as everything else in every zone.  I understand the 55+ rule being that players that are the highest levels *should* be getting hit more often and need the higher ac/stats and for the most part, breastplates and greaves are the most rare drops.  However... seeing a bp or greaves go to a level 55+ that is rarely on raids but happens to show up to a raid once in awhile and gets the chance to roll on the best drops... I can see how that would bother people.  <br>
<br>
Keeping things as simple and as fair as possible is the best way in my opinion, while at the same time doing what is best for the guilds as a whole.  A breastplate or greaves on a level 50-54 tank isn't going to benefit the raid as much as a breastplate or greaves on a level 55+ tank.  We all want great gear... we all want better survivablity, but I would rather see a leather tunic drop in Kael (using that as an example since Kael was mentioned) go to a 55+ monk/druid/etc rather than me because it will benefit the guilds on a whole more to have those that gain more aggro more often than I do, do more damage, etc... to have better gear than I do.  I'll get my turn when I hit 55+ or when everyone there 55+ has a bp or greaves.<br>
<br>
I do agree that a point system is a good idea even though I'll never be that high on the list.  Raids usually start before my daughter goes to bed and are half over or almost over by the time I log on.  Kenzo cannot make very many raids do to his work schedule, so he will never be very high on the list either.  We'll miss out, but that's as it should be since we cannot be there as much as we would like to and when we aren't there... we are not participating... we're not helping DS and OOBS.<br>

Loot order or list will go down as probably the most difficult thing about EQ.. second only to a druid getting a group in seb!..<br>
We have had some success with loot order and points in the past and is our best hope.. <br>
But the thing I have noticed lately is the amount of drops we have been getting lately.. Lilas, My main, never got any fear armor or seen any drop after many trips there till he was lvl 55. But we have seen a number of drops in the last few raids. I think if we just had these raids little more often, we all would have something. Silk is dropping like theres no end.. <br>
<br>
The worse thing is,someone getting mad about not getting a drop and leaving just to have it drop again a few drops later. Seen this happen to a enchanter in hate.. but her leaving only showed her reason for coming to the raid. <br>
<br>
Again the loot list is written in pencil not stone.. adjustments need to be made, but while a drop rots on a mob isn't the time to do it.<br>

But the thing we need to keep track of is who got what on the pevious trip.*Studly#1 won roll on earring of Asswhoopedness* so Studly#1 is SOL on the next run if the mate for his earring drops untill all that need one have it.

          I still agree with a NBG basis for a loot table tho. If ya got better stuff on then tuffy beans.Don't matter if ya lvl 6 or 60. Let someone that can get some use out of it roll.

The bit about EC, if you are ever found selling an item you got on an alliance raid, you will NEVER get another piece of loot on a raid again.  We dont raid to get loot so you can pad your coffers, we raid for the betterment of the alliance.  As for the points, the purpose of it is to reward those who are most dedicated, not as a means for person x who has better gear than person y, to get even better gear.  Thats all for now.

    All these posts happened in no time.  But I'm glad that this issue came up, especially since we have both guilds filling input on it.  <br>
<br>
   Ok, until we get the point system hammered out, I believe that we should continue just the 55+ and highest in each class getting a chance on bp's/robes.  I'm not saying that lower levels shouldn't have a chance, and I totally agree where you are coming from.  The other week I won silk headband or something...which I will be giving to Eilen since I have better already.  This is what I believe should happen.  You win a roll and have better, pass down to others what you can.  Everyone's dream is to have better armor, I can tell you this from personal experience.  But listen to this, we seem to be raiding kael a lot.  How many raids do you think it will take until everyone already has certain pieces and they are being passed down to others.  Not many more, especially since we have been getting very lucky with drops.  I have been at a kael raid for 4 hours and seen one thing drop.  So it all depends.  Someone posted that Dine and Paith die alot.  I think Paith beats me at deaths, and I usually try hard to die =P.  The ac on a kael bp I believe offers more ac than the one Paith is currently wearing, which may just save his life one day.  Which would increase our pulling, which would increase our pulls, which would increase our kills and drops.  Well guys, I know there is something else I really want to say, but can't think of it atm. =P  So I'll post it later.<br>

Take for example we raid fear and a 55+ druid wins a vermi bp because they are the only 55+ present or just happen to win the roll, and then a week later we are raiding kael and the thurg druid bp drops, as the rules are stated now that same person would be eligible for that drop, now i'm not saying that you should never be able to upgrade your armor but to me it kinda seems like a waste of a bp because with both being no drop the vermi would become useless and it seems kinda pointless for someone to have a no drop bp for a week when someone else would be able to use it for a much longer time.

I have some idea about what this point system may consist of, so to earn points are we gonna rotate raid responsiblilities?  or are just 5 people or so gonna ever earn points?<br>
<br>
<br>
What about this?<br>
<br>
Rikko Pheelix-Ranger<br>
Loot: thurg quest arms=1 point<br>
I dont get squat til other rangers on the current raid have 1 point each.  Can even be more in depth..<br>
<br>
Rikko Pheelix-Ranger<br>
Loot: thurg quest arms CORRODED CHAIN= 1 point<br>
I dont get squat til all on the raid who use CHAIN drops have 1 point also.<br>
<br>
and can carry these points to next raid<br>
<br>
<br>
for roles of leadership, and responsibiliy, ya earn -1 point which helps get loot too. which would help people that are too lucky, or not lucky enough have even better chance at getting item.  <br>
<br>
<br>
maybe a system of some kinda hybrid of the two.  Im really not all that concerned with loot myself.  But like to see everyone happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am so badass now, with a full set of thurg armor, i would just be way too good, and id always let eevryone know about it too. lol j/k<br>

I think it would be great system if the small details can be hammered out.  It would also mean that to get loot, youd just have to be patient and NOT ONLY LUCKY.  Means your turn WILL come.<br>
<br>
Also the problem arises with say a new ranger, say everyone got 5 points, and then we recruit another CHAIN armor user.  In these instances maybe start the whole CHAIN class back to 0., i dunno how it would really work, but i think we should try to even out the drops as much as we can to keep everyone feeling involved. i do like the 55plus rule on BP though. <br>

You recieve points for being on a raid, not acting in a leadership role.  Therefore points cant be monoplized and everyone gets a fair shot who attends.  While it is nice to say people who have looted cant loot again till everyone else has, this will cause problems because the first person to get loot, will end up sitting on a ton of points if they cant spend it till everyone else aqquires points to spend and does so.  What I like about the point system is it will get those who are there the most often fully equiped first.  While this may seem unfair to some, its the same principal of waiting till everyone gets something, in time those who are there the most wont need a piece and it can be boughten by others.  I guess the moral of the story is time heals all, lol.  Ok enough outta me, I havent eaten all day and I'm starving, off to dinner.  Keep the input coming folks, this is good stuff.<br>

<br>
Point system: Well the problem with the point system is that many of our raids start rather late unless you live on the west coast, which makes it very hard for many people to get on for these events. the problem with this is that if i cant make many raids due to this fact but when i go to a raid i contribute 100%( i meaning our alliance members not me specifically) then it would be unfair to tell them that they cannot have a chance at uber gear because of these types of things. so the problem with the point system is that people have other things to do and EQ many times has to take a back seat. If your considering using the point system have people bank their points and make them able to add them to their rolls if they choose, example would be 3pts for planes raids 2 points for high lvl raids and one point for guild functions and other guild related events. so if someone had 20 pts saved they could add them on a roll but if ya dont win you lose your points.<br>
<br>
High LvL looting: The problem with the high lvl loot rule is that we dont really have enough 55+ guys to do that if you were to drop the lvl cap to anyone that is planeable then i think you will get more interest in raiding because it gives people the feeling that they have a better chance at the nice gear, but will also help to lvl our lower lvl classes and get them up into the 55+ range a little faster<br>
<br>
These are just my opinion, it is up to the guild leaders to decide but you should address the fact that we only have a handful of 55+ members and the nice gear could really benifit some of the lower lvl peeps just trying to catch up<br>
<br>
PS, i never win a roll so this isnt to increase my under 55 chances at all hehe<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
When it comes to raids, I don't feel people should be rolling for Items that drop. Because theres the chance of someone who doesn't show up on raids and completely does not deserve the item getting it, or a real late shower to the raid getting it.<br>
<br>
Items should be awarded by the leaders / officers of the alliance to who they feel is in the most need of the Item and participating the most in guild events. <br>
<br>
If people don't think this is fair, there is also the point system, much like what BoTS and AL have ( probobly many others ), where going on raids gets you points you can use to get an item.<br>
<br>
Well , i've run out of thought for the time being , yet I'm sure I'll think of something =)<br>

<br>
Its not fair for the people who have inserted on a raid and was the set class/race for the armor/item or gem.<br>
Basically a enchanter armor falls in hate and there was 2 enchanter to start out with. But now there is 4, adding 2 more later on the raid. The Guy who just ported in wins the roll(after the mob has died) won the planar armor!  I bet the other 2 chanters wont be too happy at that. Would be great if the first couple of enchanters would pass on looting it, leaving it for the other 2 enchanters to roll upon themselves.<br>
<br>
I would like to continue the loot list to avoid confusion and mess and if we were to continue to roll for armor/quest pieces, why not let non alliance roll for it?<br>

<br>
If I'm wrong in my thinking, please correct me, but couldn't other raids be held by/for the people that can't make the current raid times?  I don't know how many people there are that the current times do not work for, but if there are enough of us, maybe something else could be done.  There are still people this wouldn't help out though like Kenzo... he works second shift so, east or west coast doesn't matter... he can't make weekday night raids.  Last time he tried he got all the way there and the raid was over.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Dunno if there's anyone else out there on a weird schedule like his though.<br>

With a point sytem, there will be no rolls and you wont need to bank your points because once you get them for attending a raid, they will be yours until you spend them.  The only situation in which there will be a roll is if two people want to buy the same item, in which case the winner of the roll spends their points and the other person retains them.  The time zone issue can be resolved by setting a time one must be on a raid to receive full points, so those who come an hour or two late but stay 3 or 4 hours will still get full points, and those who can only stay 2 hours or so will recieve partial points.  I tried to push for the system that Talowen suggested but it was determined to be too biased so I started on the point system idea after some people suggested it.  Keep the input coming here, hopefully the system will be out soon.<br>

<br>
DISCLAIMER:  These are strictly examples, there are no implications towards anyone.<br>
<br>
It seems somewhat backwards for a just planable shaman (level 46) to recieve a chainmail tunic/leggings when we have 55+ rangers wearing treeweaves and ry'gorr.  That 46 shaman should attend the raid even though he/she might not get the tunic or leggings.  His/Her time will come around eventually.<br>
<br>
The same holds true for the plate classes.<br>
<br>
When it comes to passing on loot.  If you have the equilivant or better...DON'T ROLL.  If you're already wearing a kunark breastplate or greaves, DON'T ROLL.  If it's an item you're not going to use all the time, and someone else will, DON'T ROLL.  At our last Kael raid I saw several people pass on super nice loot...because they had better or because they thought someone else could better use it.  I commend these people.  They're looking at the big picture. <br>
<br>
The raid leaders, whomever they are at the time, have the authority to use discretion at any time regarding loot.  If/when this happens, the raid leaders will confer with each guilds leaders and officers in attendance.  That's how it's been in the past and that's probably how it will be in the future.<br>
<br>
We have another Kael raid on wednesday.  Let's not send our raid leaders, guild leaders, and guild officers tells unless they're happy tells.  Let's not bicker about loot, let's just go there and have a good time.   Despite the 289038403 tels from 390784986 people about 3459734965 things I had a pretty good time, let's do it again. <p>Neaadan<p>
