<br>
<br>
Everyone starts out with lets say 50 point &lt;example number for crunching purposes&gt;.  Then after that everyone gets say 1 point for every 10 minutes on a raid whch would be double for epic raids.  Then when a Item drops the loot cordinator says OOC/shout what the item is and for anyone that would like it to send them a /t with how many point you want to spend on it, you only get once chance to send the tell, and who ever sent a /t with the highest number &lt;of course you have to have the points&gt; gets the items and that persons points are deducted, there for Items have no set point value exept for what the person that wants it puts on it, making it easier to work with because all you have to do is have loot cordinaters keep track of peoples points &lt;like a list that can be done ingame through the /note command&gt; so here is how it would work<br>
<br>
Raid #1 Paith, Kallon, Influxx, Jilberta show up for raid, we each have 50 points, something monkey drops and Loot Cordinator says to send tell, well Me and influxx dont' want the item but jilberta and Kallon do, its not that important Item for Jilberta so she says she will only pay 10 points for it, but the item is a definate upgrade for Kallon so he sends tell that he wants to spend 25 for it, so he gets it and the loot cordinator makes note of how much points Kallon spent on it. Jilberta then has to leave early and nothing monkish drops, then the riad ends so points would look like this<br>
<br>
Paith:100<br>
Influxx:100<br>
Jilberta:70 &lt;less points because had to leave early&gt;<br>
Kallon:75 &lt;less points due to purchase of item&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid number #2 same people show up but influxx decides to play his dr00d.  nothing monk drops so no monks spend any points, but a dr00d item drops and Influxx gets it and spends 50 points on it, No one leaves early.<br>
<br>
<br>
Paith:150<br>
Influxx:100<br>
Jilterbta:120<br>
Kallon:125<br>
<br>
<br>
Raid #3, everyone shows up again, a ultra rare BP drops and everyone wants it, so everyoen sends loot person /t wiht max points and Paith wins it setting his points back to 0 &lt;no more items that raid for him&gt; and on and on and on, you get the picture now.<br>
<br>
<br>
and there is also the option to set up along with the Point system that if you are after a certain Item that everyone on the raid gets raid points with the exeption of the person after acertain item that set up the raid &lt;they are getting the item they are after&gt; they neither Gain nor loose points.<br>
<br>
and people can be nominated/awarded points for doing out of the way thing, IE: magas goes 2 hours out of his way to rez Kallon he get 50 points, as well as having guild events where hte winner gets so many points.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok I am done, Laterz &lt;runs screaming and jumps off a cliff&gt;<br>

When you’re having a bad day and it seems like people are trying to piss you off, remember, it takes 42 muscles to frown and only 4 to pull the trigger of a decent sniper rifle.

<br>
The only flaw with this is the book keeping.  That seems to be the problem with any loot system that attempts to make loot awards fair rather than just going to the person that is luckiest.<br>
<br>
The loot list solved all the major problems I could think of in terms of a loot system, but it was a pain to figure out who was there, who moves up, who moves down, who left early, etc etc.  It is a full time job just to keep track of it, and woe to the entire guild if the LC(s) can't attend the raid.<br>
<br>
The point system we have pending now makes keeping track of things simpler by not deducting points for not attending raids (no moving down the list if you miss a raid), but re-introduces the problem of having to /random in cases of a tie, and someone still needs to keep track of who was there and for how long.  Hoping to avoid the situation of the LC being MIA we are appointing multiple LC's.  <br>
<br>
The system Paith just proposed is intriguing in the sense that there are bits of loot that are more important to us all.  With this system we are able to express that importance in the size of our bid.  Example, Az wouldn't mind having a hate-plane bracer, but really wants the hat or bp, so I bid say 5 points on the bracer that drops just in case nobody else wants it, but I will put all my points into a bp drop and probably half of them into a hat.  The biggest flaw is the time unit of point award.  At every 10 minutes (or similar fairly short interval) it would be kinda tough for the LC(s) to keep track of who is where.  It also brings up the question of what happens when someone goes LD for a half hour with isp trouble, or has to go afk for dinner or something.  Do they keep getting points?  <br>
<br>
I am not arguing against this as a proposal.  But I like to try and think like anyone that might be attending our raids (hmm...need to make a provision for guests too) and come up with the questions that they might ask.  The harder we try to break a system before we implement it the more likely we will be to get a solid system in place by the time we go public with it.  No matter what we do there will always be some situation we didn't think of, but I would like to have as bullet-proof as possible a system put together before we go public with it.<br>
<br>
That said we need to do something.  We have run too many raids on a combo of &quot;divine award&quot; and &quot;random chance&quot; now.  I want to get something that people can see in place so they can track their own progress.  If we have to keep making things up as we go there will continue to be problems from people that weren't paying attention or just didn't understand the way the loot rules are explained at the beginning of raids.  I think we have all been doing a pretty good job of keeping actual loot awards very fair.  I think that we are getting the loot to the people that deserve and need it.  But we really need a system that people can look at and use to predict what will happen rather than keeping it semi-shrouded in mystery.  The more we operate by divine edict the more open we are to charges of favoritism and discrimination.<br>
<br>
Wow, that got a lot longer than I first intended.  Sorry about that.  Please take none of this as directed at you Paith, you just kinda tossed the match at me, I caught fire on my own, hehe.<br>
