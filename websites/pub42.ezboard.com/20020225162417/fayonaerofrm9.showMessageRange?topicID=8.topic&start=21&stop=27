This is how it actually got started.<br>
<br>
Members of Phoenix, RIP, that guild that Tallyn and Aanani were in plus a few other random people like me (Rupert) started hanging out together.  First it started out at the Ghoul Lord room when we worked together to feed out Yaks, next we did it in Sol B going after the Kobold King.  From here it escalated to Fire Giants, and even the Plane of Fear.  The next step of course was to take down Naggy, which the first 2 times we were unsuccessful, then we did it on the 3rd time...we were the first group on Sol Ro to take down a dragon.  Main reason we started grouping was so we could do the high end raids like HOSS was doing (because HOSS wouldnt allow non-guild people to join them).<br>
<br>
Hehe I remember the first time we all went into Fear.  We were led by Jmellow around to a house and started fighting the zombies...they saw the paladin armor drop and lust crept in.  Did that over and over again and got tons of class armor.<br>
<br>
Anyway (Nostalgia makes me ramble sometimes), we were in South Ro (Sorn, Jmellow, Talanon, Tannin, ugh some caster, Tallyn I think, and me Rupert currently playing Alora my mage) talking about how we should make a guild to be able to do guildchat instead of just shouting all the time...make it more orderly.  Well after days of them pondering this over, they decided to form Paradigm and only 45+ people were allowed to join.  <br>
<br>

Faerain, my first character, was guilded by Phoenix in late May 1999 at which point the main core of the guild had ALREADY passed me up. It was created by a group of RL friends at Wizards of the Coast and they just pushed right through all those levels and worked themselves up to 50 together, doing harder and harder stuff. Some of the first &quot;twinking&quot; of Faerain was the raw-hide stuff the older guildies were picking up in Mistmoore and didn't need -- they picked up more than they could use.<br>

That was also back when Phoenix had TONS of wizards and I was one of, like, 3 druids in the entire guild. That didn't last past that first summer though.<br>

Shit happens and times change, basically Balthek, Tannis, Sorn and a many others, all left RIP because of conflicts and PD was formed not long after.  RiP used to be a nice force of players even after the split, even had several european players(still does), but most joined Darkwind, and a few other players who were around in RiP went other paths, like Scorpio.  Scorpio formed Midnight on Solusek ro, around 2 weeks before the server split occurred.<br>
<br>
A lot of old school players are still in rip, for the most part, a lot of guilds started out with the end of &quot;uber&quot; RiP, at this point we still have a nice ammount of muscle but consist mostly of a tight knit group of players looking to have fun more then anything else, lots of old friends together.  <br>
<br>
But, other guilds, as more and more people hit 50's and 60, bigger, badder more uberish guilds formed and some fell(VVV).<br>
<br>
VVV used to be the driving force of Sol Ro, I dont know what happened when kunark came out to change that, but I read a post at solusekro.org by one of the leaders basically explaining why the leadership stopped and VVV fell apart.  VVV totally ceased when GM's broke them up because of stealing spawns(innoruuk i think).  Now VVV was the largest single guild on the server, and not everyone joined the same guild after the GM's broke them up, some went to PD, some to Pheonix, you name it...  After VVV broke up, basically PD and The Thirteen Moons were the top guilds, TTM actually had a pretty bad Reputation at the time of being devious and untrustworthy.  TTM turned into Darkwind(after their own problems with GM's) and the reputation went along with them, Thalanx of Darkwind and PD struck a deal with Trakanon and thus started mending of the bad reputation.  PD gave them a chance and DW held their word, and proved to be a great guild imo, lots of honorable and knowledgable players(european guild).<br>
<br>
 basically on Sol Ro there were 2 major guilds before the split, these could do anything their hearts desired.  <br>
<br>
Paradigm did things first, they killed Trakanon several times before Darkwind even tried, and got to VP peak first.  Darkwind wasn't far behind, but still haven't cleared VP I dont think.  For the most part, no other guilds had the muscle or organization to do what these guilds did, Thalanx of Darkwind is a great leader and Sssorn a great huntleader of PD as well, and people in the middle to get things going.  <br>
<br>
Smaller guilds such Pheonix, Bunnies of Chaos, Magna Charta(european), and Blood Tide were also thrown in the mix of guilds who could do Gods and planes.  Well, there were tons and tons of guilds who could do planes, thats why everything was always booked up.  <br>
<br>
The worst part is that a lot of &quot;uber&quot; guilds reside on Ayonae Ro, but surprisingly everyone is getting along just great.  There were 2 Trak able guilds on Solusek Ro(simply because these 2 dominated trak furiously), Darkwind and PD.  Midnight seems to form in the middle of the night(what a pun), and killed Trakanon surprising a few people, and pissing a few off as I recall.<br>
<br>
On Ayonae Ro its interesting to see DW, Pheonix, CN, EW, Nightmare Clan, and maybe more who can kill Trak easily, but it all seems to work out ok, Velious is huge and Plane of Phat Lewts, aka, PoG is much easier to get to on a regular basis. <br>
<br>
Thats my recollection of the main guild process on Solusek Ro.<br>
