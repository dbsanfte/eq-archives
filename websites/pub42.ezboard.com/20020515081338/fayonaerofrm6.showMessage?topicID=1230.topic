After camping Ragefire and getting Indra the cleric epic.  Indra makes some lame excuses about trading the character for a level 60 epic rogue.  Couple days later, Indra shows up tagged Immortal Mercy.    Below is the message the supposed owner of Indra posted on Lost Fires, I copied it here from the public forums.  <br>Make up you own mind about what really happened.<br><br>Eh, Terry Coffman  , you are a total piece of shit and I really hope I learn which character you are really playing now so I can go out of my way to fuck you over.  As for the Indra character, congrats to Immortal Mercy on a slightly used, Ebay cleric with a shinny new noodle.  Make sure you gear her/him/it up before he/she/it gets re-ebay'd.  <br><br>Anyone else out there selling accounts, maybe you should put a line in the auction letting all the potential buyers that IM takes all ebay characters into the guild without any hassle.<br><br>Lothorn Fatestealer<br><br><br><br><br>Subject:  Re: Indra <br>Posted By:  Terry Coffman Guest<br> <br>Posted At:  4/18/02 1:52:37 pm  <br>Reply  <br>Well here it is the truth you can take it for what it is i made a deal for Indra back not to long after we moved over here from Cazic thule server Vane draxon made me an offer after him and his wife divorced and he no longer could or wanted to play because of his Carpul tunnel in both wrists and then having surgery wasent going to play EQ anymore so i took him up on his offer and started playing indra and still P'lvling untill my wrists began bothering me as well and will be doing surgery this coming week my wife has been playing indra as far as typing and doing the buttons but i have been in the back watching and telling her what to do next thats why sometimes i wouldnt answer or i would have a time before i did things wasent Lag but me telling wife what to type and what to do next and i was hoping my wife would catch on and play indra but she didnt have a desire to do any computer stuff or gaming either.<br>Now as far as taking advantage of LF at the time it wasent intensional if i had known at the time that Vanes friend was gonna make me an offer i couldnt refuse then i wouldnt have wasted the guilds time and mine in taking her in the first place but when some one says ill trade you a Char that i had no use for or i can take her anyway then you do the trade because i dont have the CD keys for her account and anyone that has played eq long enough knows that is all you need and his personal info to get an account back and you cant do a thing about it.<br>The account that was given to me by no means a fair trade for a lvl60 epic cleric and if it had been my own account no i wouldnt have never of taken the trade.<br>But you ppl in the guild think that if it was still my cleric i would tag with Immortal Mercy after they tried to take it from me you are off your rocker there's no way in hell i would have tagged with them and will never tag any of my Char with that guild or RIP and sure its a slap in the face to all you guys that spent alot of time helping me do RF hell its a slap in my face as well when i logged on to see her with IM's tag last thing she told me was she was gonna stay with LF's for awhile and then tag with VV.<br>The last 2 of my Char's are gonna be gone by this week i cant get my wife to help with the keyboard and computer any longer so i have to give it up and all i can say is iam sorry that it happened in this way and if ya'll have a need to talk about me and call me what ever and it makes you feel better then so be it i do have it coming just dont blame anyone else for what i've done.<br>Lost Fires take care for this is my last and final post <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uanadari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anadari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/18/02 9:13:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ebay</span><hr size=1> Small Note : Most guilds have Ebayed chars in their guilds...<br>Obvisously Im not going to rattle off Names of the chars but I know that top 10 guild list on the other thread, 90% of them I can confirm have EBayed chars in em...<p>Sorry for the bad news...but Ebay Happens.

This isn't merely about ebayed characters. This, is about honor. I love....absolutely love, talking about honor here in the cess pool of Ayonae Ro. (I mean that)<br><br>This player is one of the most desgusting types of vile creatures you can encounter out there.( Cazic Thule, faceless masssster...guide me as I speak. Show the dishonest ones fear. ) I had my hunches about the player for a long time, but I kept most thoughts to myself. Yes, I thought Indra was an awful cleric, and I was told of her rumored ebayedness. Yet in real life, I was told she was a nice lil' old lady and the true Indra by sources. I nodded and suddenly felt bad, thinking so ill of a nice old lady. Being a nice old lady, my expectations were than lowered a bit. (Please, nice little old ladies, do not take offense). Nice old lady, like Happy Gillmore's mom. I wondered if her fingers hurt, and so on. <br><br>When Indra had the guild Lost Fires camping the Ragefire spawn...I was most often not present. I did not trust her, nice lady or not. Her familiarity with the guild didn't seem to be of a duration worth presenting such a prize to...and while I felt guilty at the time (somewhat I must admit) for not being present for any but 8 percent of the time...I now am somewhat redeemed...but it is not always good to be right. <br><br>How does this have anything to do with honor? <br><br>You take a class that a guild rising in power needs, let's say ...a cleric. You join that guild and begin doing the &quot;I need my epic, this epic is for the guild, not me&quot; sales pitch that everyone loves to hear and inspires aid. <br><br>(Note: I wish I could count how many times I read &quot;this epic is for all of you who helped me, not for myself&quot; type sentences in guild chat....there were quite a few)<br><br><br>Now, after your sales pitch, you've obtained your aid. Boom, incoming players who trust you and have decided to allow you to wield that essential manaless rez clicker. <br><br>Problem...it's a hassle to get that manaless rez clicker. You see....Ragefire, who dwells in Skyfire is the sort of npc who destroys reputations, ends friendships, creates monsters out of players, and takes a hell of a lot of time and devotion to camp. You almost need to lie and pretend you're in it for the long haul, to get people to do it for you.....<br><br>Now, enter your secret lack of desire to maintain the character who you're getting the rez clicker for. The character an entire guild is going to be counting on to achieve goals. A guild that took your &quot;this is for you all&quot; crap seriously.  Who cares though, continue on with your charade, after all...you don't have to look these players in the eye after you get your prize and you're gone, right? <br><br>Now, this rez click casting item was very important to this &quot;up and coming&quot; guild. Imagine your guild losing one of it's first rez clicking , sprinkler wielding clerics after bringing all that time and effort to help them obtain the cherished item. All for the strength of the guild....yet in the end, we discover that's just a fun thing to say. <br><br>This situation, may very well have more consequences than the simple &quot;Indra is a traitor&quot; theme. The players who felt betraid, will now be much...much less trustworthy. When you get screwed like this, you feel ....screwed....like....this. <br><br>It is important that a heavy price be paid for this kind of thing.  A heavy social price. <br><br>The clerics who seek their epic, often preach &quot;the guild will benefit from it most, not just me&quot; but too many times it's a lie. If you are a liar, I hope you're remembered. <br><br>The value of honor....the price check on honesty....is so horribly low. People do this kind of garbage, and it slips by. <br><br>The worst part about people getting screwed, is when it makes someone think &quot;If I'm getting screwed, I'll screw someone else. Time to fight fire with fire, I'm sick of getting screwed&quot; .  <br><br>That's what I dread the most. To the players who did trust Indra and spent time to get that item....<br><br>Please don't feel this means you have to be harder, don't look suspiciously or change anything about you. Don't change anything  about the generosity in you that caused you to camp this item for Indra. Your kindness and trust is far more important than any item. <br><br>A guild based on friendship, family atmosphere...has to take extra special care in the players it considers. You have to be ready to sniff out thieves, liars, loot mongers...anything to disrupt your desired atmosphere. This one was tough to see. <br><br>So, ends it. Let events like this....not go unpunished. <br><br>(This message is mostly for the literate lurkers who know better than to post anything, but come to learn the happenings.

Please keep this in mind when you camp RF for any cleric <br><br>I realize that some of the best ppl I have met in EQ are clerics, and I dont want them to think I just assume that every cleric is evil, I really dont. But I do think there is a Very high percentage of clerics out there that only make a cleric in the first place because they dont have what it takes to work for anything. Being a cleric is easy on many lvls, groups are garaunteed, getting into a nice guild is a LOT easier, getting people to help you get that epic is allot easier and so on. I would say that about enchanters also, but most of the low lifes that make chanters cant handle the class and then make a cleric anyway.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: if you are a cleric and you do NOT fit my discription above, in your own oppinion, then I am NOT talking about you.. If you are a moron loot ho user person and you are NOT a cleric, please insert &lt;your class&gt; everywhere I typed the word cleric above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dreadnok>Dreadnok </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/19/02 8:07:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Edit one sentence in there...I said &quot;The players who felt betraid will now be less trustworthy.&quot; or something similar.

I have to admit I recently left Lost Fire, but it was more so personal reasons then anything else. Now the short period I was with them, I know how hard they fought to get a cleric epic, I was there in SF on may occasions, and the epic happened to be Indra's. I know for a fact many guildies were there for days even weeks.  I know that Juts and Aprilsky were basically logged on the whole time, just going AFK here and there. Also,  the worst part is all the people that were &quot;On Call&quot;, so if RF did spawn they get a call, log in and be gtg. I have known the toon Indra from Amalgam of Force and believe me this is a bit shocking to me.Now if it was the same person then it really blows my mind! <br><br>I am currently tided into Renegade Alliance, if the toon you say is the old Indra ...well then it is going to come down to her/him/whomever leaving or me.  I am one that believes in fairness and Honor, and I will not be a part of what has or might happen.  I believe is Indra was going to quit then atleast offer the toon to one of the members of LF first, don't eBay it.<br><br>Ogan <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1230.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1230.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1230.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1230.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1230.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=1230.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1230.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1230.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
