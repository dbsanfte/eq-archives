I've spent several days on the IRC site and about .01% of it discussed whatever is going on on the boards.  Hell, most of the time Logix is asleep, no doubt dreaming of other worlds to conquer.  Don't blame her for Siaam or Momento's slapped wrists; they brought it on themselves.  <br>
<br>
But here, I'll cross Logix.  Let's watch.<br>
<br>
Logix, IMO, made a complete arse of herself with the whole Teptress/Plain of Sky thing.  <br>
<br>
There.  Done it.  Pretty sure nothing will come of it.  Now off to IRC.<br>

Logix was the one who got me invited to join the Illuminati Conspiracy. She owns my soul now. When she did that, her Dark Master moved the focus of his Mind Control Lazer Sattelite from her to me, and now he's moving it to YOU. So yeah, do get those tinfoil hats. Darned, foiled again! (Besides, she's my personal mistress and will spank me severely if I disobey her.)<br>
<br>
On a more serious note, I never asked Logix for her advice on those suspensions. She had exactly nothing to do with it. Several people had demanded Momentos banning for quite a while. I don't remember if Logix was one of them, but I don't think so. My decission was not based on those peoples demand anyway, but on Momentos own actions. <br>
<br>
If Logix indeed threaten people to use her power against them yada yada then it do really suck. My impression however is that someone who was angry with her took something from a argument out of context, blew it out of proportion and spread it as a rumor.<br>
<br>
I think Logix's attemt to make a IRC channel for our server is a good initiative and a project she deserves credit for. I hope and believe that the paranoia is unfounded. <br>
<br>
It seems quite clear to me that a very small clique of people have a personal problem with Logix and let their dislike cloud their judgements. Amadeus, I would also be angry if on of my friends got banned. But those suspensions was needed. And I did explain to Siaam in private. Would have talked to Momento as well, but she didn't contact me and I couldn't find her email adress. Blaming it on Logix is unfair. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

All Im saying is she is using her leverage of IRC to propell her to a higher status of power. You might not want to cross her, or you will almost certainly get banned.

I don't know why you had to come into this thread.  I mean, really, there are several people here defending my behalf, including the owner of these forums, basically saying:  You are talking out of your ass, sir.  Siaam will be back in a few days.  In the meantime, get a grip.<br>

You have ZERO (yes, 0) evidence for your claims (no logs, screenshots or names).  Perhaps you should give me names of these people and I can talk to them in-game to see what's up (provided they really aren't just figments of your imagination, but it's likely they are).  But, I had a log of you talking to me, which you did nothing but insult Siaam, but mentioned nothing of this 'conspiracy' of yours.<br>
<br>
I, however, have many folks in the IRC chan who have seen nothing of this sort and can vouch that I am not some evil monster out to get you.  Additionally, considering you are a friend of Siaam, the one who many posters were glad to see gone, I imagine most will think your claims are unfounded and you just need to sit down and shut up.  The only person mentioning IRC constantly is YOU.  However, I do appreciate the advertisement you're giving the chan, it's bringing a lot of people in.  But, your paranoia and conspiracies are not really making you look good, just making you the laughing stock of the chan.  I suggest you see a professional about your obsession.<br>
<br>
Edit -- &quot;It's so timely that you should respond after someone has defended you&quot;<br>
<br>
If you are trying to attempt to accuse me of having multiple EZBoard accounts to defend myself, I suggest you log into EQ, /w all thormir, /w all edeina, /w all malse, and see that yes, they all are individual people. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulogixspybreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logix Spybreak</A> at: 12/1/01 12:24:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uaamadeus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aamadeus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/1/01 12:44:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=640.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Lucin God</span><hr size=1> Did I say any of those things?

Once again, give me the names of these people.  And, no, as Edeina said, there is nothing 'fishy' about Siaam and Momento being suspended from the boards.  I had nothing to do with that, that was because of their own actions.<br>

you're such a dickhead amaedus or whatever the hell your name is.<br>
<br>
like..<br>
<br>
siaamm = a dickhead, useless, and a troll.<br>
<br>
we dont want him. we dont need him. he got banned, for 1 week only.. but yes, still a ban. he deserved it, for he is an idiot. momento or whatever her name is probably deserved hers a little more.<br>
<br>
in my oppinion.. if you're out in public (or on a board!) you conform to how people expect you to behave. if you decide to be a dickhead, you have to take the punishments. suck it up, you bring it on yourself.<br>
<br>
logix mighta wanted them banned, but i did too. and i guarentee im not the only one. it was my l33t jedi powers that got them banned <p><center><Br><img src="http://www.iinet.net.au/~arc/porndie.jpg"></center>

Oh my, how mature.<br>
There's a fine line between flaming and harassment you know. Mixing degoratory sexual remarks with strong accusations isn't a very good thing to do. (As a person, I also dislike when people make strong accusations without backing them up. Like claiming that someone have been threathening people and refusing to reveal what people he is refering to. But that's not anything I'd regulate as admin.) <p>Love, Edeina<br>
