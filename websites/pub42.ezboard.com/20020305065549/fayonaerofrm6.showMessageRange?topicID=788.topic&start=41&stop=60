So, we got into it, words were said back and forth (none offence of profanitized) (not even a word..?). So, Im talking to my friends over ooc about the incident, and I say &quot;*pulls the stick out of the gms arse*&quot; &lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
the guy asked the GM a question and the GM answered cluelessly... then he asked the zone about it and they knew...  the GM kept insisting it didnt exist... and he said that comment above<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt; Bam, was hit with a warning. Me and my people in my group started talking, Desilous came and met with us outta nowhere. He takes my last name away, then takes my buddies name away after he asks why he took my name away. <br>
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
the guy proved that the gm was wronge and that half of the zone was correct.. the GM then uses a vauge excuse from the naming policy to change the guys name and his friends name who was agreeing with him... btw last i checked &quot;arse&quot; was not oficially a cussword... and that is all he did say<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
<br>
So I get to talkin to the gm, telling him to please leave us alone. He pops me with another warning. I forget what that one was for, but, I get to talking to Desilous again. <br>
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
if i remember it was something like harassment and zone disruption...<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
<br>
Then I give up for awhile. Start talking to my buddies in OOC, someone says something in ooc, and he /t's me saying he was hit with a warning, more then 10 mins after the gm dissapeared. <br>
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
that was me... i got a warning for &quot;using profane language in a public channel&quot;... i also only said arse<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
<br>
So I /t the gm saying &quot;Can i ask 1 question&quot; /t &quot;Do you have a life?&quot; /t &quot;we are just having fun, this is a mildly boring game when your looking at the book and to please leave us alone and just let us have our fun&quot; <br>
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
man... that was kinda stupid of you...<br>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;<br>
<br>
Desilous tells you &quot;You are being suspended for one week for being disruptive over ooc&quot; When it was 4 of my friends and 1 or 2 others in the same zone and we were talking over ooc. <br>
<br>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br>
<br>
i agree that it was uncalled for as a suspension...<br>
<br>
btw yes i was there... me= eekos <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utreistaania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>treistaania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/9/02 7:05:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;server gm&quot; Desilous and how much we hate him</span><hr size=1> send a email to Sony online entertainment stating what happened and have your friends do the same thing.. i know of many people getting wierd responses from this Gm.. he helps a few with things he is prohibited to help with acc to sony policy aka Trades gone bad and sometime he refuses to help with things that are considered primary target aka sexual harassment and racial slurs over open channels and or in tells.<br>
<br>
you have the same right to complain against a GM as he has to do so at you.. and more often then not the GM draws the short straw in this.<br>
<br>
if sony gets alot of mails with complaints against a guide or a GM then he is removed from his job.. since the GMs and guides are here for you as player to aid and correct.. and this is borderline harassment and powerabuse.<br>
<br>
however.. <br>
he can threaten you all he like with warnings and bans but unless he can back this up with serverlogs they wont happend.<br>
<br>
if it was indeed your friends going nuts over ooc in a manner harsh enough to warrant a suspension then logs will show this and the GMs mistake to tell you that you are beeing suspended will also show..<br>

That pretty much sums it up.<br>

Note, despite all claims, you will still rarely get exp from a corpse that is unrezzed over a patch.<br>
<br>
If you DO have a time sensitive issue &quot;all my stuff has dissappeared!&quot; or some such,  Make sure to mail them with the details, as they only keep saves for so long, and petitions just go up in smoke if you leave the game, or are unanswered after 3 hours, while emails have the all important date/timestamp that you can refer to, if your complaint is not handled in a timely manner befitting the abilities of their hardware and the responsiveness of their cs.  i.e. if the gm takes too long to answer the email complaint, and your stored information is no longer saved, because he took to long, without an email, yer screwed, with an email, you have that all important time/date stamp to refer to....and by email, i mean to eqmail, not directly to the gm.  It's the only thing in their hardware that i've seen them be accountable for.

In every /petition I have made my &quot;problem&quot; was corrected. In 2 of those petitions I didnt get the most curteous of responces. One time was when I zoned into SF and landed in the middle of the zone and died before I even fully popped into the zone. In that case the GM was a bit reluctant ( I think I know why, because from what I have seen of people most give false info about this type of thing) But even so my corpse was summoned and I was given a rez. And one time I petitioned because I zoned into the hole and landed on some cliff in the middle of nowhere and had to petition to get out. This last one was answered by a guid and they were obviously new, once they passed it on to Desilous I was taken care of fast. All of the other petitions I have done have been taken care of very pleasently. <br>
<br>
From what I have seen the people that bitch the most about the service they get from a GM, are the same people that go and do something Pathetically stupid, then expect some GM to come save thier ass. I have only petitioned when I can clearly see that my situation has happened due to a bug, witch in 2 and  a half years has only happened 5 or 6 times. If you are running into &quot;bugs&quot; alot more often than that, maybe its not a &quot;real bug&quot; maybe you are just a dumb ass, and causing WAY more problems for those of us that have &quot;real issues&quot;<br>

Well what do you know Scilentt Bbobb does not violate the naming policy....... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvaldaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valdaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/10/02 4:24:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=56>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/image/33/3517933.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desilous is not all here</span><hr size=1> Good idea, moving down the chain of command...

<br>
first of all, the petition interface doesn't allow for &quot;handing&quot; off petitions to other people. You could check the petition back in and tell a guide to look at it though. Most likely what happened is he was busy, you were pissing him off, and he gave you the least information he was required to. Moreover, guides and GMs can talk you know. It's completely possible that he asked everyone on if they knew and noone did.<br>
<br>
Next time, have more respect for people and maybe they will treat you better.<br>

<br>
Here's a little tip: The public channels are not there for you to say every little thing that enters your head every time you wish to say it. If you disagree, then be ready to face the consequences when it pisses someone off.<br>

They can be anon right next to you and you'd never know it.<br>
<br>
It's simple -- you messed up, someone called you on your behavior. Learn from it and it won't happen again.<br>
