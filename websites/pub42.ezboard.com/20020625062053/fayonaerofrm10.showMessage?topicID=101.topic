I'm guessing not.<br>
<br>
Anyways...<br>
<br>
So there I am sitting in the EC tunnel, waiting for a guy to get a port from LOIO so he can sell me some DW gaunts, when someone shouts out that there's a huge number of GMs in EC. I do a /w GM and notice that there are indeed five GMs in the zone, three with the &quot;Ayonae's Chosen&quot; guildtag. I turn to my left and notice that a GM, Zantar the Tolerant (or something like that) is standing right there. Looked like a High Elf with shiny uber armor and weapons. Players crowd around him...What brings you to EC? Is there a GM event going on? Do you know when the next GM event will be? He answers that he has &quot;no clue&quot; when the next GM event will be; he is just there to &quot;mingle&quot; and to have a look around.<br>
<br>
Time passes...still waiting for my DW gaunts...eventually Zantar the Tolerant departs. I hit /w GM from time to time after he left, and notice that the other GMs are leaving one by one too. Eventually they are all gone, and my DW gaunts arrive. Just as I'm getting ready to leave though, some people shout out that there IS a GM event happening right now at Orc 2! Or maybe Inn 1! No actually it's near Nek zone!<br>
<br>
So I follow the crowd of people running from the tunnel out to near the Nektulos zone, and there are two NPCs with green names over their heads: Dragoon [something that begins with &quot;V&quot;], a male Dark Elf wielding a two-handed sword and whacking people with it for up to 94, and Guard [something that begins with &quot;T&quot;] a female Dark Elf caster. Both of em wearing some sort of plate armor. Both conned blue to me at 37. There's also a swarm of at least twenty players fighting the inkies and each other also. As I watch the battle, Guard T tries to cast a spell on me, but I am protected...presumably participation in the PvP aspect of this event must be initiated by attacking the inkies first.<br>
<br>
I pick out the person I think is tanking Dragoon V (named Weirus if I recall) and I start to heal him. This removes my protection from the PvP, and very shortly Guard T and three players turn and start to beat on me and nuke me. Doh! I didn't come to EC expecting a fight...I'm not bound anywhere near here. So I melee for a little bit but I am really getting my ass kicked here so I turn and run a short distance away; no one follows me. As I stand at a safe distance wondering whether or not I should rejoin the fray and to hell with getting killed on the other side of the world from my bind point, the announcement goes out that the Goons are dead: they dropped a few bronze armor pieces and FS weapons. No death-shouts from the inkies, no special uber rewards, no explanation.<br>
<br>
I hung around for a while to see if anything else would happen, or if someone would show up to explain what DID happen...nothing.<br>
<br>
Anybody know what this was all about? Just some bored GMs screwing around or what? But what I really want to know is: why aren't my DW gaunts the same shade of gold as my DW helmet??<br>

Both of those times resulted in exactly what you saw; some fine steel and bronze armor.  Do you know if any conversations were attempted with the Inkies before the attack?  I would bet there wasn't....and that's too bad.<br>
<br>
By the way, the third event I was in happened in Steamfont mountains around Halloween of last year.  I carried on a nice long conversation with an animated Scarecrow and was awarded a nice dagger in return.  Sadly, I must resign myself to the thought that that will be the last. <p>Feargal Axebringer - 52nd level Dwarven Champion<BR>Tides of Valor - Ayonae Ro<BR>Got Beer?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uwilrowe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wilrowe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/19/01 5:36:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <br>

They have done a similar event in the past except the dark elves were in the east commens tunnel fighting any random person.  Their drops were the same as well, since I was so fortunate to witness it and get the kill with Miomio.  Time to ask Malluas for a change in scenery.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=riotgirl>riotgirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(9/19/01 1:23:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My 1.5 GM Events</span><hr size=1> I fondly remember sitting on a hillock just outside Felwithe, when there was some sort of general commotion. There were a number of players /shouting as well as /ooc about reports of 'Faeries' visiting Felwithe.<br>
<br>
Slowly rising to my feet, I was amazed and delighted to see four faeries fluttering around on gossamer wings, whilst a small congregation of players looked up at them, open-mouthed, in wide eyed amazement.<br>
<br>
These particular faeries were all 'Windite' sisters, I seem to recollect; and delighted in the playing mischevious pranks on unsuspecting players e.g. blinding them, rooting them, levitating them etc. <br>
<br>
[rant] Unfortunately, some idiots took umbrage and whined to no-one in particular on /ooc about &quot;stupid GM events&quot;, claiming that they lost experience due to &quot;interference&quot;. Yada yada yada -- guess what? You as well as a couple of hundred thousand other players, pay your $10 dollars a month to play with a myriad of others. Do the actions of other players beyond your control count as &quot;interference&quot;? Or would you like to play in a vaccum (aside from the one between one's ears)?  [/rant off]<br>
<br>
I delighted in playing a form of 'tag' with these playful, yet mischevius beings and this event brought a sense of magic and wonder to my eyes (as a level 4 newbie).<br>
<br>
My parting gift from one of the faeries was a 'GBS' [Glowing Black Stone] - which I sold at a later date. <br>
<br>
I would like to think that the memory of this event is a more permanent gift<br>
<br>
On another occasion, as I was passing through Greater Faydark, on route to Butcher Block, I happened to accidentally 'bump' into Firionia Vie and I believe the Elven King, who were inspecting their realm and wished to tour Felwithe.<br>
<br>
Since they were already surrounded by a herd of players, I said a few words and departed. <br>
<br>
The final event was the Big Kahuna re: Cazic-Thule squaring up against Tunare in Lesser Faydark. Unfortunately, due to the mass influx of players, the greater majority of players had to either port or zone because the sheer weight of numbers was resulting in the whole zone becoming LD (link dead). It took me well over half an hour to zone into Butcher Block from Kelethin due to LD.<br>
<br>
<br>
**Note: while I do appreciate GM events which either add a bit of dynamism to the game or to further various plot-lines, the vast majority of people either whine or hang about for'phat lewt'. Thus, now I generally zone on rumour of a GM Event<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

If you do become involved in an Event (especially one which may shape the plot-line on the server) please attempt to role-play,or even interact.

A few started shouting that a GM event was taking place in DL and that there was a purple dragon running around the north side of KC killing giants.  So I ran over and was the second person there and started running toward him.  He instantly fear and dotted me was resulted in insta-death.  Luckily I had bound my self on the ridge so I sow'd up and ran back and got my stuff.  I noticed I hadnt lost any exp for the death so decided to have some fun.  I ran up again and tried to cast my subba dubba shammy DD on him, the next happened.  Resist, fear, dot, Loading please wait!!  I was actually having fun, by the time i got there for the second CR a couple groups had formed and was about to move in on the dragon.  No one would group me so I decided to solo and melee as much as I could.  I did notice how much faster it went down when I melee'd it..i must have added an easy 50pts of damage!!  At the same time I was having fun and cracking jokes and well Mr.dragon turned on me...SLAP SLAP SLAP...Loading please wait.  By the time I got back to loot my third corpse the dragon was dead.  The loot..FS great staff.  We stood around for a few minutes and a GM showed up, did his gm stuff on his computer and started handing out rewards.  I was the first, for dying three times he awarded me a Lodi sheild.  Over all he granted two CoF's, two Fungi's, my Lodi, and something else I cant remember.  He awarded me becuase I died three times and stuck with the event.  He awarded the person who got the kill shot and the person who organized the groups.  Over all it was a lot of fun and glad I didnt ignore it.<br>
