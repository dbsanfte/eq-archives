<br>
This happened one day about a month ago roughly at the infamous Raster Camp in Lower Guk. A friend has asked me to post it, seeing as how the main villain has been causing a number of problems lately and even did me a dirty turn last week in Sol B. <br>
Usually I just translate and 'humorate' my logs, but I've long since erased that particular one, so this one's from memory. And I'm SORELY tempted to use actual names here....<br>
<br>
Raster camp: 9 a.m. Eastern U.S. time. Personal camp time: Hour 83<br>
Valarian is sitting on the steps that lead up to Raster's spawn point, facing away from it, waiting for the next spawn.<br>
A Female Human Monk comes running into the room.<br>
HOTI FLASHBACKS! Valarian raises an eyebrow behind his screen...<br>
The monk comes running up to me.<br>
For posting sake, let's call this monk the ~Pushy femAle aND AngeR instigAtor~, or 'Doodyhead'.<br>
Doodyhead runs up to Valarian.<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;Hail&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;Hail&quot;<br>
Doodyhead runs off down the hallway and out of sight.<br>
A Greater Minotaur spawns. Valarian kicks it once in both nads (Val has wide feet). A Greater Minotaur bites the dust.<br>
Doodyhead runs up.<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;Are you camping raster?&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;Yeah, I am.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;how long will you be here?'<br>
Valarian says &quot;I dunno. If he doesn't spawn, it may be a while. I'm determined to get him.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;how long will you be here. what time?&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;A while. I don't know how long.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;I need Raster too.&quot;<br>
/who Doodyhead<br>
&quot;This woman is not interested in you knowing anything about her at all. Nyah nyah nyah!&quot;<br>
Valarian /cons Doodyhead (Val was level 51 monk at this time).<br>
&quot;Doodyhead would reduce you to a fine red mist hanging wetly in the air.&quot;<br>
/guildstatus Doodyhead<br>
&quot;Doodyhead is a member of  **** ****.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead runs off down the hallway......<br>
<br>
An hour or so later...<br>
Doodyhead runs up to Valarian.<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;Will you guard my friend while I powerlevel him&quot;<br>
Into the Raster camp runs a Male Druid, who then stands before Valarian.<br>
I think about this......I really don't want another group or really anything hanging about in the camp. I've taken pains to stagger the spawn in just such a way that I have time to use Bind Wounds on myself and use Mend when I have to between fights. The chance of a spawn aggro'ing on someone else sitting around is high, and it's easy to mess up a situation like this in L Guk. After the Hoti incidents the day before, I very much wanted to say &quot;No!&quot; But unfortunatly for me sometimes, I have this nature...<br>
Valarian says &quot;Ok, for a little bit.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead runs off.<br>
The druid, whom we'll refer to here as 'Shhh' begins to cast a spell.<br>
Shhh has just given Valarian Regeneration.<br>
Behind my screen, I give a small sigh of relief and let some of my tension go. If Shhh is going to throw me a buff unasked for occasionally, I'm more than happy to help.<br>
/who Shhh<br>
&quot;Move along, nothing to see here. You don't need to know, move along.&quot;<br>
/guildstatus Shhh<br>
&quot;Shhh is a loner, man! Doin' his own thang! Shhh don't need no guild!&quot;<br>
Shhh runs past Valarian and up the stairs to the Raster spawn point.<br>
I turn and watch. Anytime this happens with anyone lately, I get nervous.<br>
Shhh sits down next to the Raster spawn spot.<br>
A Greater Minotaur says &quot;Oh waiter, I'd like the monk buffet please....Just serve myself? Ok...&quot;<br>
Valarian settles a dietary issue with the Greater Cud Chewer, and not in it's favor.<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Could you please move? You're next to a spawn point.&quot;<br>
..........................<br>
No reply.<br>
2 minutes....<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Could you please move? You're next to a spawn point.&quot;<br>
..........................<br>
Still no reply.<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Please move. I don't want you sitting there. I have the spawn staggered, and the spot you're next to will pop soon.&quot;<br>
............................<br>
Silence.<br>
Up pops a fresh Hornhead. Valarian plays 'Whack-A-Mole' with it.<br>
Valarian looks at the Raster spot. Shhh is still there.<br>
Now this made me nervous as hell. Maybe it was my own paranoia, and maybe not, but I suddenly started having thoughts of this Shhh person actually KillStealing Raster from me in case Raster spawned. After all, the only thing a person has to do to 'claim' a mob is hit it first. And if Raster (who didn't always obey the spawn clock) popped up and this Shhh person got in the first lick while I was busy elsewhere, I could be in a world of misery. No GM or guide would see my side of things, they'd just give me the tired old routine of &quot;Nobody owns a spawn.&quot;<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Will you please move? I don't want you right there. Sit on the other side of the room please.&quot;<br>
...............................<br>
Yet more silence.<br>
I think of petitioning, but what's Shhh or Doodyhead done? Besides, I don't abuse /petition.<br>
Surprised_and_Battered yells for help behind you!<br>
Surprised_and_Battered yells for help behind you!<br>
I turn around to see some caster type getting a beating and a half from a Froglok Zol Knight. I jump in and help. Exit one Zol, Stage: Morgue.<br>
I run back to the Raster spawn spot to see a Greater Methane Maker smacking Shhh around.<br>
Thinking back on it, I should of let Shhh get shredded, but instead...<br>
&quot;Valarian hits a Greater Minotaur for 23 points of Damage!&quot;<br>
&quot;Valarian kicks a Greater Minotaur for 90 points of Damage!&quot;<br>
Wash, rinse, repeat....<br>
&quot;You have slain a Greater Minotaur! Let's eat!&quot;<br>
After having had to chase down this latest victim of mine, I run back to the Raster spot.<br>
&quot;Shhh begins to cast a spell.&quot;<br>
I watch as Shhh fades from visible sight beside the Raster spot.<br>
/who Shhh<br>
&quot;Shhh. (Anonymous). There is one in L Guk, and you probably know where.....&quot;<br>
In my internal monologue, I'm wondering if Shhh went invisible just so he could sit nest to the Raster spot and not be attacked, or something more sinister is happening. My paranoia at work? Hmmm.....<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Please don't sit right there.&quot;<br>
Deafening silence......................<br>
<br>
A while later.....<br>
Doodyhead runs past Valarian to the Raster spot.<br>
&quot;Shhh begins to cast a spell...&quot;<br>
Shhh has come into visibility, and he never moved. He proceeds to buff Doodyhead.<br>
I target Shhh.<br>
/con Shhh<br>
&quot;Look at this neat blue he is. This might be a fun fight. Bets, anyone?&quot;<br>
NOW I'm suspicious as hell. At level 51, I get green exp of maybe one Mino in 6. How can Doodyhead be powerleveling him? <br>
And at what range down here does exp not spread to other party members?<br>
Valarian says &quot;Doodyhead, please tell Shhh not to sit there. It's next to the Raster spot.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead runs off.<br>
Valarian /tells Doodyhead &quot;Please tell Shhh to move.&quot;<br>
I wait a long time for a reply. I never got one.<br>
<br>
More time passes.<br>
Shhh occasionaly becomes visible due to him buffing himself or Doodyhead, but he never leaves that spot. Raster hasn't <br>
spawned....yet. My nerves are fraying.<br>
<br>
3 p.m. Eastern U.S. time<br>
Doodyhead runs up.<br>
Dead_Again_04 shouts &quot;Need a ress at the zone!&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;go ress him.&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;Me?&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;yes. go ress him.&quot;<br>
(Just a note, but the Raster camp is about halfway across the L Guk zone from the 'main' zone.)<br>
Valarian says &quot;Ummm...I'm a monk.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;heheh. i know.&quot;<br>
I hear one of my nerves go TWANG!<br>
Doodyhead runs off.<br>
<br>
The clock ticks away the time.....<br>
Doodyhead runs up.<br>
Shhh is still next to the Raster spot.<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;what sleeves are you wearing?&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;Lupine.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says &quot;oh. not azure? don't you have any?&quot;<br>
(For those not in the know, there's a certain mob that spawns in Lower Guk that drops the muchly monk coveted Azure Sleeves. Low weight, high AC. Yummy.)<br>
Valarian &quot;I just haven't taken the time to go get them. And these sleves are nice too.&quot;<br>
Doodyhead says 'shame you can't leave here to go get them. heheheh&quot;<br>
Valarian says &quot;Would you move Shhh out? I'm not gonna guard him, and he's making me nervous.<br>
Doodyhead doesn't hear me probably, because she's already run down the hallway.&quot;<br>
Valarian /tells Shhh &quot;Move. Now.&quot;<br>
.........................<br>
<br>
There were more little things where my pleas went 'unheard', and Shhh and Doodyhead prowled around for quite some time. Raster never spawned, so I have no proof that anything would have happened. I've never seen Shhh since that day, and I confess to not looking for him either. Doodyhead and I have run into each other since that day, and I've ben hearing things about her, and nothing has been good.<br>
<br>
I recently died once in Sol B. Since we had no cleric in my group, we had to find one. One was found for me while I wasn't there (I was bound in Freeport, and it's a damn annoying and long run for a human monk at night to get back). A party member of mine found a cleric willing to give me a ress. He drug my body to the cleric, who was grouped with his guildmate Doodyhead. When I saw the  ress box appear on my screen, I really should have read it more closely so that I would have noticed that it was the lowest ress there is, the 'No Exp' one. It was explained to me later that &quot;we don't give exp resses&quot;. I wish I had known that then. And Doodyhead just laughed.....<br>

Actually its an incredible story.<br>
<br>
Maybe you call it paranoia, but me, having also spent many days in LGuk. I am sure they just messed you up.<br>
LGUk is war IMO. I HATE IT. Seriously, even the thought about it makes me getting angry. In LGuk, everyone is selfish and greedy. And not just a little. LGuk is really WAR IMO. Its really really bad. I personally hold the frenzy camp 2 times as group leader and got up to 25 people on the list. I been on many lists onmy own, I got ditched, I got cheated, I seen people having the strangest and most unbelieveable ideas and ways to get a camp and to kick you upt and such. Its really really nasty.<br>
If you do not absolutely need a no drop item out of Guk.<br>
STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM IT!!!!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately since 2 of my guildmembers have been able to join Frenzy at lvl35 (damn Chanters) and even won an FBSS after a few hours, my whole guild seems to be so excited about LGuk. But it does no good, loots are not that good (hell I camped Frenzy for around 40 hours and I HAVENT EVEN SEEN one Sash drop) and you really freak out there. <br>
<br>
So, after I told you about my view on LGuk.. just one more thing.<br>
<br>
This Girl...<br>
Was her name something like Pandora or Pandara or Pandana or whatever?<br>
Cause..<br>
My Guildie, Monk, had the Raster camp too for many hours. Sitting there even with a group (cause he was too low to solo it). Then:<br>
Raster spawns!<br>
MyGuildsMonk freaks out and tells the Guild: RASTER UP YES OMG !! YESSSSS!!!!!!!!<br>
Doodyhead immediately turns around the corner as if she was sitting there for hours already (and I bet she was, but my guildies aren't used of getting KSed so they were not suspicious).<br>
MyGuildsMonk pulls Raster and starts hitting it.<br>
Doodyhead starts hitting Raster<br>
My GuildsMonks tells the Guild: What the hell????`<br>
Doodyhead being 15 lvls higher than MyGuildsMonk and his Gruop kills Raster, loots up, walks away.<br>
<br>
I can't and won't even attempt to tell you what I read in Guild chat then...<br>
<br>
So if it was the girl, Valarian, lets just post her name. Cause if its the same, she really does this every day and casues much troubles.<br>
Well, much troubles is the wrong word but my english is not good enough to express what I mean.<br>

<br>
Sladen, Taino, that's amazing. I didn't know Pandara was such a 'lurker' like that.<br>
<br>
As to the identity of Doodyhead, I'll let you in in something......I usually do reveal the name of the offensive party somehow in my little stories. And I was a little blunt in revealing this one in my opinion. Let me show you...<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
For posting sake, let's call this monk the ~Pushy femAle aND AngeR instigAtor~, or<br>
                      'Doodyhead'.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In this case, all you had to do was read the capitalized letters. Doing so reveals the name: Pandara of Wolf Pack.<br>
<br>
It's my usual policy to not reply to my own stories, and to not just blurt out a name that I've hidden. Instead I usually put up my story, and then go find that person in EQ and say &quot;Hey, go look at this. This is you.&quot; I used to do this back on Solusek Ro, and in a couple out of probably a hundred cases, it did some good. Kinda broke the guidelines here though....<br>
<br>
I guess that in my heart, I was posting more of a actual pissed off NAG than a story. But if the name hadn't been guessed, I wouldn't have posted it.<br>
<br>
I've been hearing a lot of bad things about her lately. Had a couple bad experiences with her also, as I've mentioned above. What's the story on her?<br>

Written by a member of the Everlore Staff.<br>
Guess why it was there.<br>
<br>
People started somehow to do EVERYTHING to get their Phat Lewt. For me it looks like as if everone in the world is in a phat-lewt-frenzy where nothing and absolutely nothing counts but what you wear. <br>
<br>
Maybe I am just too low level and have no nice big guild around me which holds me warm and comfortable, maybe I need to go to the crowded places since I don't have the manpower at all to even make the smallest lvl45+ raid, but for me it looks like this. Its like everyone in the world just talks about lewt and even worse, every way is ok to achieve it. <br>
<br>
<br>
I personally would still prefer no lewt in the world over the adventure and fun I would have to make a raid in high level zones I haven't seen before.<br>
Thats what I play for, and thats why I need equipment, to use it to get higher and better. And if I don't get the items, I will manage without it. I am on a planar lvl. My equipment sucks. Who cares. If I have friends, I can get on planes. With good equipment I would survive 3 secs longer thats about it. Of course those 3 secs can mean kill the mob or get killed, but if I get killed, so be it. <br>

I still love lower guk.  It is one of the worlds easiest dungions (in my opinion) to pull.  It is alot of fun to fight solo in there.  The only problem is that if i want to get in a group (frenzy) i have to put up with a list that lasts longer then i normally play for at one sitting.<br>
<br>
Magi is normally camped, relatively easy to get in a group there...lord is camped by magi more then anything, and MOST spawns on the live side are uncamped now.  (raster being one exception).<br>
<br>
I still find guk to be great fun though, you just have to be prepared to solo if there are no groups open, or  not enough ungrouped people to form a group.<br>
