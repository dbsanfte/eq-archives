<br>
Even Toronto Canada is being affected. All landmarks were evacuated shortly after 10:00am EST, The Financial District in downtown Toronto were also evacuated. US Embassy, TSE, Subways and majority of downtown Toronto employees were asked to go home. Pearson International Airport stopped normal operations and were basically just accepting rerouted planes.<br>
<br>
Ive heard people in the military are being called in the US. <br>
<br>
A very sad day and my prayer goes to all those families who have lost loved ones.<br>
<br>
&quot;America Under Attack&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope all goes well from here on end. <p>

The sky is falling!!!</span><hr size=1> 15 minutes ago I posted this on the Jokers FOrum, and it perfectly fits in this thread.<br>
Please read it carefully and think about it!<br>
________________________________________<br>
<br>
I am, as hopefully everyone, completely speechless.<br>
<br>
My thoughts are with the people in NY / DC / Pitsburgh...<br>
I do not pray nor do I believe in a christian god, so even if I don;t include them in prayers, I sure feel with them in any way.<br>
<br>
BUT!<br>
After all, I am WAY more scared of what will happen now than I am terrified about what happened already.<br>
I am deeply scared about the reaction of George Bush.<br>
I do not believe that he is a man of strategy or a man of.. wisdom.<br>
Way more I believe that he just wants one thing: War.<br>
Everything he did since he is president was just done to make war.<br>
Now he has a &quot;reason&quot; to start one.<br>
<br>
I am really really scared about this.<br>
I understand all the anger, all the shock and the immense stress and deep pain people go through in the US atm, I personally spent the last 8 hours just following the happenings. Still, we must NOT NOT NOT have war!!!<br>
This attack was planned well and done by a big organisation.<br>
But please remember one thing.<br>
War would mean - World War.<br>
<br>
A World war would mean... well I guess you know what it would mean.<br>
In no way should be given all the terror back the way it happened now. Millions of people would die in a world war, so far its 10'000, maybe 20'000 people that died. Please don't make 10 - 20 millions out of it. Or even worse...<br>
<br>
I just pray (even if I do not actively PRAY actually) that please please please no WAR will start.<br>
I agree that every terrorism has to be found and erased. But attacking whatever country doesn't solve this. <br>
The terrorism comes out of underground organisations working all hidden, not out of one state.<br>
Attacking one state wil cause War, and whatever state in the world US would attack, they have allies, and they will help this state, europe and other countries will help the US, a World War would be started.<br>
<br>
Please, lets NOT have one man (that is absolutely not able to rule a country) deicde over the world! <br>
I am deeply scared about this now.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to mention this, maybe different, but logical and clearheaded thought, besides all the pain and suffering.<br>
Please lets NOT revenge this happening with the same or even worse acts, lets NOT revenge death with death.<br>
Or lets at least not revenge death with a World War!<br>
<br>
I hope the World manages this crisis and that Mr &quot;I hide in my bunker during my vice president and my speaker sitin the White House&quot; doesn't freak out and calls a world war.<br>
<br>
<br>
Love and thoughts toward the US... <br>
<br>

&lt;&lt;Bin laden got away with blowing up the world trade center over 7 years ago.<br>
<br>
He will not get away with this.<br>
<br>
Afganistan gives him to us on a silver platter or we wipe them off the map.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
THIS, EXACTLY THIS attitude and anger (which I unerstand, BUT) without ONE moment of clear reflection will put this planet in the 3rd World War.<br>
Please people (mainly Mr Bush) think about what you do to THE WHOLE WORLD if you react that way!!!<br>
<br>
Wipe out the damned terrorists! Goddamnit DO IT! But do NOT start a war! You cannot stop terrorism by starting a war with a whole country. Simply because NO country is responsible for this. Its underground organisations which stay underground. <br>
The only thing you will do by attacking a country is <br>
a) kill thousands, hundrets of thousands, millions of INNOCENT people, AS innocent as the poeple in the World Trade Center!<br>
b) Cause a World War which will kil millions of innocent people all over the world.. with the todays weapons maybe destroy the planet.<br>
<br>
Are you willing to do this to proove that &quot;noone can do this to us&quot;? <br>
Obviously they CAN do it to us, and no world war, no anger and no big words can change the fact.<br>
War is NOT the solution!!!<br>
But as I said 3 times, terrorism needs to be stopped SOMEHOW! I am not a military expert, I do not know how to stop them, but a WAR is not the solution.<br>
Please!!! Think about this!!<br>

Palestinians celebrate US tragedy <br>
<br>
Thousands of Palestinians are celebrating the terror attacks on the US.<br>
<br>
They have been chanting God is Great and distributing sweets to passers-by, even as their leader, Yasser Arafat, said he was horrified.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ananova.com/images/news/palestine_kidsceleAP410x244.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
In the West Bank town of Nablus, about 3,000 people poured into the street shortly after the attacks.<br>
<br>
Reports from the West Bank claim Palestinian extremists say the attacks in the US are a consequence of the country's policy in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
Demonstrators have distributed sweets in a traditional gesture of celebration and several Palestinian gunmen have shot in the air, while other marchers carried Palestinian flags.<br>
<br>
Nawal Abdel Fatah, 48, wearing a long black dress, threw sweets in the air, saying she was happy because &quot;America is the head of the snake, America always stands by Israel in its war against us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her daughter Maysoon, 22, said she hoped the next attack will be launched against Tel Aviv.<br>
<br>
In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, there was a smaller gathering of about two dozen people, many of them young children led in chants by adults. Some drivers passing the scene honked their horns and flashed victory signs from their windows.<br>
<br>
Yasser Arafat and his top advisers huddled at his office in Gaza City, watching the events unfold on television.<br>
<br>
He said: &quot;We are completely shocked. It's unbelievable. We completely condemn this very dangerous attack, and I convey my condolences to the American people, to the American president and to the American administration, not only in my name but on behalf of the Palestinian people.<br>
<br>
In the West Bank, meanwhile, the leader the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine denied his group was involved in the attacks.<br>

Also the other people there do not know...<br>
<br>
I also am completely shocked about those people celebrating the tragedy, it is unbelieveable.<br>
<br>
But I can just ask you to remember one thing.<br>
Who was it that said: "Forgive them father, they do not know what they are doing" <br>
<br>
_________________________________________<br>
<br>
I just heared that the US attacked Afghanistan.<br>
They didn;t even take ONE DAY to think about it, to settle down, to evaluate and to THINK about it all.<br>
They immediately attack a whole country.<br>
<br>
I do not know how they will attack, but they sure will kill thousands of INNOCENT people that are sleeping now, having no clue of what all happened... and the US comes and kills them during they sleep.<br>
<br>
Is that your vision of justice???<br>
<br>
I lost my faith in the good of the world... today I did.<br>
<br>
"The ones responsible must be hunted down" he said.<br>
I agree with this, I completely do, lets kill the terrorists responsible for this.<br>
But millions of normal citizen, going to work like you and me, having children, family having NOTHING to do with Ben Laden are NOT THE RESPONSIBLE ONES!!!!<br>
<br>
STOP THAT INSANITY!!!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Goddamnit, find out the responsible persons before you act! THink about it! Don't goddamnit attack a country out of an idea and out of anger.<br>
This will end in no good.<br>
<br>
I am scared.<br>
And I am not easy to scare....<br>

I don't have much sympathy for the countries that harbor terrorists and for ppl that celebrate our tragedy.  We need to withdraw all support for the Palestinians and also, once we find who is responsible, we should take strong military action.
