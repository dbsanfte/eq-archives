(Tien is a cleric but you prolly dont know him).

I set my rules and state that if you have a problem with my rules, or any decisions I might make, that you should stay away.

NBG vox/naggy raids turn into spy contests to see who sold their NBG loot first so that the players that didn't win shit can slander them and post nasty things about them on messageboards.<br><br>Wake up and realize that NBG is completely ludicrous.  The loot isn't balanced, the winners will ALL sell eventually and that is fact. <br><br>Take my real life example about a year  ago.  My enchanter at level 49 got an invite to a vox raid that was going to be NBG (the leaders of the raid were all melees).  Knowing that the RBB was the only good loot from vox I proceeded to log out my chanter and into my level 47 monk where I sent a tell and got into the raid on the condition that I knew how to skillfully pull ice giants.  <br><br>We wiped to vox the first time due to lack of enchanters and clerics.  <br><br>The 2nd time we pulled off a miracle with 1 cleric and 1 chanter.  RBB, white dragonscale, and the 100% weight reduce bag dropped along with a shitty spear.  The raid leaders said that NBG kicks in so monks and melees roll for RBB and bag.  <br><br>This started and uproar of all casters who had been at this raid for 4 hours and were just now guaranteed that they wouldn't even have a CHANCE at winning a damn thing.  Despite the mess the roll commenced.  With only 8 or 9 melees present the roll did not have too bad of odds.  Well, I won the roll and almost crapped my pants.  One of the co-leaders started getting angry.  There was a long pause while I was waiting for the trade window.  The co-leader that did not have the item said that the other leader was his friend in RL and refused to give the RBB to me because I was a late invite (he had the 2nd highest roll).  After some harsh words back and forth he finally gave it up.  He did however, win the bag.<br><br>For the next couple weeks when I would play my monk I would receive tells and inspections from people from the raid, obviously checking up on me.  They were just waiting for the opportunity to slander me.<br><br>Well, I sold that RBB later on that 2nd week and my monk has served as a mule since then, but my chanter benefited greatly from the large amount of platinum I had received.<br><br>This is the reason I posted on this thread, I have been there before and seen what NBG does to raids.

I wear the eyepatch of a friend who won it a long time ago.  It was never sold.  It never will be.  In the least it will be passed on to a friend or a twink, but such an old item and a gift means a lot to me, and even if I got better like NToV loot, I would not sell it.  <br><br>Lachdenen grew out of his RBB replacing a 31% haste item with a 40% epic haste item.  It didnt take long, but its a situation that in context is repeated.  A warrior that comes to a raid as a gimpy level 43 with crustacean armor and wins an RBB might some day be equipped with full HoT armor and get a Cloak of Flames to replace his RBB.  In this situation its the same thing, it just took longer.  <br><br>But not all items are like that.  You know many monks that can top a 10-slot 100% redux pack that weighs .4?  Most monks I know that come would TREASURE that bag for their life.  Not everyone is going to join IvM or EW.  Odds are likely that a melee that wins an RBB and doesnt upgrade to epic haste will be wearing that a LONG time before they can upgrade 4% of that haste with a CoF.<br><br>Times change, people grow, and I can accept that.  But all of these items will NOT be sold.  Some will be kept forever and some will be discarded once useless (Rez staff with no charges) or passed on to twinks (my patch).  Some are sought by high level players.. I know several wizzies interested in the Cloak now, and I doubt anyone with decent nuking power will EVER ditch a cloak with Improved Damage not true and even I can be a testament to that.III on it.<br><br>Believing that all items are sold is skewing the facts, its simply <br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>I'm not going to say you disgust me or anything, but your actions make you the type of person that I stated that i do *NOT* do these raids for.  But not everyone would follow your greedy actions.  It doesnt make a difference to you and I dont really care.  I dont spy on everyone who wins, and I forget 85% of them.  Unless I see a familiar name in the bazaar channel (Lachdenen) i wont ever keep dibs on someone or inspect them every 5 ticks to make sure they still have their RBB.<br><br>-------------------------------------<br><br>The positive aspects?  Another living testament.  The people who dont walk away like you just to sell the item to benefit your greed or another character or your bank are the positive aspects.<br><br>I can think of a monk in Phoenix still enjoying an RBB (I think).  Angeal has her white scale and is a few short steps form her epic.  Anaa *has* her epic, and I dont think her guild was raiding Gorenaire nor had 50K+ to blow on a scale.  Would she have her epic if it werent for NBG?  Maybe, but it cuts her chance to about nil with 40ish people rolling on an item.  Bassbox probably has his epic (not sure, havent seen him in a while).  Jefnfry has a beautiful cloak that I surmise he wont be replacing soon if ever.  <br><br>Those are your positive aspects.  The list goes on, if you need me to continue.<br><br>(Oh, and I can say that I know a lot of people have left my raids feeling like they accomplished something, -Including Karii and myself- even if we won nothing.
