However there isn't much benifit joining a guild at the lower levels if your intent on being a raider.  If raiding is what you wish to do later in life then just run solo and level.<br><br>if however your a more casual player that enjoys a slower leveling curve and raiding is not much your cup of tea then look at some of the smaller social guilds on the server that are more intent on a friendly game environment more so than killing uber mob_1.  If thats your desire I would suggest a guild like Raving lunatics great group of folks many lower level toons but there a social bunch mostly not really power gamers.<br><br>Just my thoughts. <p><ahref=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81993"target="_blank"> Kahla Treedancer </a> <BR> Warder of Tunare <BR> <a href=" http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/" target="_blank">In the Life long Service of PRISM </a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uapocc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Apocc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wanderer</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 4:43:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2761.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are there any guilds that accept lvls from mid teens and</span><hr size=1> I ran into a few them in BB while lvling my alt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uericaugustson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eric Augustson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wanderer</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 7:30:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2761.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are there any guilds that accept lvls from mid teens and</span><hr size=1> Ya, my old Guild &quot;Guardians of the Myst&quot; was like that in they didnt have a Level cap. Any level or class so long as you played well. GoM did a split a few weeks ago now, and I left with a bunch of my RL friends to form &quot;Draco Fidelus&quot;.  <br><br>Same kind of style, family &amp; freinds, but with a level cap of 35. Still dont like that decision but I'm stuck with it. I understand the need if you're forming a Raiding Guild to get everyone up and roughly equal so you can all group, but not recruiting lower I see as a handicap. You miss out on good people, and depending on how they play, they could BE at your level cap pretty quick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucarabellavalenteen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carabella Valenteen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 8:05:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2761.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.dragonsong.org/immortalmercy/images/carabella22.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are there any guilds that accept lvls from mid teens and</span><hr size=1> Most of the longer lasting guilds have level caps.  I too, have always struggled with this, and most guilds have to make a decision -- do you want to be an uber raiding guild, or do you want to be more lenient? <br><br>Prob is, when a guild gets to THIS point, it often means infighting amongst the leaders of the guild as part want to go one way and the other part doesn't.  This is the death of many a guild, I think.<br><br>Right now too, there are so *many* restrictions to getting in guilds, it is almost absurd.  You have to be level 60+ or be an 'in demand' character of at least level 55, and on top of that, you have to be willing to live, eat and BREATHE eq, and at times, be willing to sign over your first borne son..er.. well, ok. Not quite that extreme, but you get my picture.<br><br>Not only that, you have to raid 2093808230480348 times first with them and after that, make sure everyone and their uncle thinks you are fantastic, and woe be YOU if you at one point or another pissed off a member in that guild.  And that is only to get a temp tag!!<br><br>I remember well and with great fondness, my first guild.  Back on Karana, I was level 20 and a druid, and I soloed  often.. You know what?? People *wanted* me in their guild ANYWAY.  I spoke with the leader for a half hour and she liked me, I liked her... and voila.  I was guilded that day, and stayed until the guild disbanded over a year later.<br><br>We have gotten so far away from that, so fixated on being uber, so needing to have rules and regulations, that many guilds forget that eq is supposed to be fun. Instead of looking at the personality behind the character, we look at what loot they have (oh, god.. they don't have their epic?? newbs!  Scratch THAT applicant), at where they have been (what??! Never been to HOT?? Screw YOU), and what usefulness they might actually have to the guild.(Ie.. see note about living, eating and breathing EQ, and I won't even touch on being a druidess... )<br><br>I can understand the need to get 'good' people in your guild.  I can understand the need to also make sure people are a good fit first.   Sometimes, though, I think its a bit of overkill.<br><br>By the way -- no fingerpointing here.  I am not singling out any guild but saying what I have seen as a trend in many of our guilds on Aro. Prolly anywhere in EQ.<br> <p><center><img src="http://www.dragonsong.org/graphics/cara.jpg"><p>"The bonds of friendship are forged in laughter, but cemented in tears"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uericaugustson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eric Augustson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wanderer</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/10/02 8:53:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2761.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are there any guilds that accept lvls from mid teens and</span><hr size=1> Carabella I think You're right on the mark actually. I spent a good bit of time pokin around at the various guilds, getting an ideas for our new guild. I saw a LOT of that kind of &quot;Uber or Else&quot; kind of thing. <br><br>I espically got a laugh out of the ones who had Amazing Long &quot;Trial Periods&quot; requiring attendance &amp; particpation on Raids, and the way I read it, &quot;We're gonna Grind the hell out of you for two months, get what we Need, and If you haven't been Perfect you're GONE&quot;. <br><br>Definitly not my cup of Pepsi. <br><br>I play a Much lower-end game, I've got 8? Characters now on two servers, none over lvl 31.  One of these days I'll get around to raiding Vox or whoever, but ya know, there's still a Lot of Upper Guk I haven't cut a bloody trail through (or Splitpaw, Najena or half-a-dozen other places). <br><br>My guild now, we've got 5-6 who are in the 50's and heading for 60. But the majority of our people cover mid 20's to the mid 40's.  And with Alts, the spread is even wider. I couldn't even imagine going to a guild where its Uber/Raid all the time. I much prefer having Fun exploring and hunting with a few friends over that kind of mindset.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2761.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2761.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2761.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2761.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.threadControl?topicID=2761.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2761.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2761.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1>General Forum</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
