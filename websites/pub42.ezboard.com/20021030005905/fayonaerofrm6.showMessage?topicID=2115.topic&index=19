/cheer! Totally agreed. But Until we have some sort of utopian society, its not going to happen. :/<br>
<br>
You are right that Blizzard has made great PC games for a long while. However, they don't only make great PC games, they simply make great games.(hell, I still play Rock 'N Roll Racing on my SNES emu occasionally) The reason they have gotten so huge on PC, is that the great games they made were suited perfectly for PC's<br>
<br>
Certain types of games are suited to either PC's or Consoles. Fighting games, Rythym games, Platformers, Survival Horror games, just about all arcade-type games, Japanese style RPG's and these &quot;action-tactical&quot; games such as Metal gear solid, splinter cell, and Starcraft:ghost are more suited towards consoles. While RTS games, First Person Shooters, Turn based games, Simulations, American style RPG's and just about any other D&amp;D based game are more suited to PC's.<br>
<br>
I did play starcraft 64, and it sucks. The interface isn't that bad, but the game just ssslllooowwwsss down during huge battles. And for some reason it gave me a headache. There was also a warcraft two on the playstation. I never played it, but it did get good reviews. <br>
<br>
And as much sense as your point about microsoft makes, it isn't an xbox exclusive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If it was, you'd be sure microsoft would be shouting it from the rooftops. (Though they did just buy Rare from Nintendo,bleh. Very smart of them.)<br>
<br>
And about your last point, this game isn't going to keep that cycle of PC game's from happening. Blizzard has brought in an outside company(Nihilistic) to make the game, similar to what they did with diablo. So its not going to slow them down on the other games they are working on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, about Starcraft Two. I'm quite sure it is in development. Blizzard knows damn well that it will sell a million copies faster then you can say &quot;cha-ching&quot; in Korea alone. They're probably just taking their sweet time with the game, just like the original. <p>DiscoWliten<br>

On the site when I read it at least, it said that they were unsure which consoles it would be ported to. And that they thought it would be mutli-console but were unable to specify at this time.... Personally that SCREAMS &quot;We are fighting with one company (microsoft) right now to PLEASE give us the rights to port it to more than one system so that we can be more guaranteed a large quantity sold.&quot; But hey I could be wrong, take it as you will.<br>
<br>
Youre totally right about Rock and Roll racing... damn that was a fun game, I had totally forgotten about it. However to say they make good games for PC AND consoles may be a little over the top. I think its safe to say that on consoles they are probably hit or miss at best. Ever play 'Death and Return of Superman' for SNES? P.U. What a stinker that one was. How about 'Lost Vikings 2'? I never played it but I never could figure out part 1 so who knows. What about 'Justice Leage Task Force'? Please. Anyways quite enough of that :P<br>
<br>
As for claiming that &quot;some games are good on consoles and some are good on PC...&quot;, I think that is quite silly. What is the one thing that every console owner has that the PC owner most likely does not? A controller. A simple, homogeneous, quality, reliable controller. Make a game that needs a controller (possibly comes with one), is high quality (as any Blizzard PC game is bound to be, they have a reputation), and has multiplayer support, and any of those game types you listed can be a big hit on the PC. Honestly Im not really sure why noone has done it before. The silly idea that for some reason a fighting game can &quot;only be good on a console&quot; is quite frustrating to someone like myself. Im consigned to going to the arcade to get my fix of 'Xmen vs StreetFighter' or whatnot. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I will not be purchasing a console just for the sake of owning another Blizzard title, but they could have guaranteed at least one more sale by porting it to PC. Just my 2 cents.<br>
