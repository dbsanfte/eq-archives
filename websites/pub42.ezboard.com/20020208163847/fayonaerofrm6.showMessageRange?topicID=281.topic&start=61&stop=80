<br>
Actually this is a legend of Judiasim found in the Cabal not the Bible.  Lilith was an angel sent down to be Adam's wife but sought to make him and this world her submissive to herself.  She rebelled against her husband and against God himself wich is why, according to legend, she was cast out from Eden. Tho she was female in nature she was not a woman.  <br>

I would like to see the proof of the 6th and 7th books of Moses, that have been hidden.  You say they are outlawed, but I am sure there is a place on the net that has authenticated this and has the text.  You describe what is in them so you have read them right? or is this second hand information?  Just Curious.<br>
<br>
I am a Christian, I believe the first 5 books were written by Moses, as told to him by God.  I don't blindly believe that ever thing in them is factual to the letter, I do believe that Moses tried to do the best he could with his understanding.  <br>
<br>
I don't believe the world was created in 6 of our days.  I think Gods Idea of a Day is quite a bit more than what you or I would consider a day.<br>

Creating two lacking children and having them reproduce creates even MORE lacking children. And plus, more than two would have to be made to start a population, two is zero growth.

<br>
<br>
Two thousand fattened years like maniacs<br>
Have despoiled our common grave<br>
Now what necrophagous Second Coming backs<br>
From the cradle to enslave?<br>
<br>
Sickle constellations<br>
Stud the belts that welt the sky<br>
Whilst the bitter winter moon<br>
Prowls the clouds, dead-eyed<br>
Like shifting parent flesh<br>
Under silk matricide.....<br>
<br>
Watchful as she was upon Eden<br>
Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept<br>
Hid the hissing of a serpant Libido<br>
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe<br>
Soon to be kept<br>
<br>
Hear that hissing now on the breeze<br>
As through the plundered groves of the carnal garden<br>
A fresh horror blows<br>
But ten billion souls<br>
Are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees<br>
<br>
This is the theme to a better Armageddon<br>
Nightchords rake the heavens<br>
PAN DAEMON AEON<br>
<br>
And what use are prayers to that &quot;god&quot;?<br>
As devils bay concensus for the space to piss<br>
On your smouldering faith<br>
And the mouldering face<br>
Of this world long a paradise lost<br>
<br>
This is the end of everything<br>
Hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring<br>
<br>
Danse macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac<br>
Now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate<br>
What sick nativities will be freed when those lights burn black?<br>
The darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back....<br>
<br>
I see the serpentine in your eyes<br>
The nature of the beast as revelations arrive<br>
<br>
Our screams shall trail to Angels<br>
For those damned in flame repay<br>
All sinners lose their lot on Judgement Day<br>
We should have cut our losses as at Calvary<br>
But our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief<br>
Salvation, like a promised nation<br>
Gleamed a claim away...<br>
<br>
This is the end of everything you have ever known<br>
Buried like vanquished reason<br>
Death in season<br>
Driven like the drifting snow<br>
<br>
Peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war<br>
On our knees or another fucker's shore<br>
Hailing new flesh<br>
Read, then roared<br>
To a crooked cross and a Holy Cause<br>
What else be whipped to frenzy for?<br>
<br>
This is the end of everything<br>
Rear the tragedies<br>
That the Seraphim shall sing<br>
<br>
Old adverseries<br>
Next of Eve<br>
Now they're clawing back<br>
I smell their cumming<br>
As through webbed panes of meat<br>
Led by hoary Death<br>
They never left<br>
Dreaming sodomies<br>
To impress on human failure<br>
When we've bled upon our knees<br>
<br>
Tabulatures of gravel law<br>
Shall see Gehennah paved<br>
When empires fall<br>
And nightmares crawl<br>
From the cradle to enslave...<br>
<br>
This is the end of everything<br>
<br>

<br>
If there is one point that can be made it's that you can never get everyone to agree about religion, rather logical since we all have our own views upon it. I've always had great respect for religion but have serious doubts that I will ever find a reason to belive in God my self.<br>
<br>
I remember having a conversation about religion with someone on EQ before, we pretty much seemed to have the same idea about it up til' the point where she explained to me that "God will come to you to, just wait." this is the person that just agreed with me on basicly every point I made - alas that God doesn't exist he is a fictive person made up for ppl to have something to belive in, to have some divine purpose to live for. Beautyfull point, but I don't really get how she first can agree on the fact that there is none and then tell me that He will contact me too?! Weird..<br>
<br>
I watched some old movie with John Travolta the other day, I was tired but couldn't sleep it was all that was on, God thought he had done a bad job with human kind and was gonna start over. Funny thought isn't it? <br>
<br>
Well even though this is surely a thread that makes us use our intelligense I have to say it's pretty much a moot point =) <p>--------------------- <BR>

<br>
You can't make that kind of statement unless you have some thing to back it up.  Just because someone that knows a friend of a friend of a friend that thinks this, that won't count as proof.  I know that 99% of religious writings are second hand.  I want to see these 2 books he said exists.  There is plenty of evidence that exits that validates that the first 5 books.  Where is the same evidence for the other 2?  Where the hell are the other 2?  Never heard of them till now.<br>
<br>
BTW The Chritian Religion &quot;branched&quot; from Judism with the teachings of Christ.  So that means it dates back quite a bit farther than 1 AD.<br>
<br>
You can choose to believe in a supreme being, God, or not.  You can talk to others about your feelings just don't try to force them on another.  Do I believe that one religion is better than others?  No.  I choose to be a christian and people can choose to worship, a turnip it won't change my beliefs.<br>
<br>
How do we know the earth is Millions of years old?  The scientific evidence is there.  If you choose to ignore it that is your proragative, but if you think the earth is only 7-10k years old then, you are wrong.  There is plenty of evidence readily available to back this up.<br>
<br>
Are we from apes?  Don't have a clue and in the Great Scheme of things I don't really care.  Would it really change how people are today if we knew one way or another?<br>

Go to the Vatican and ask permission to see the 6th and 7th and while you are there ask permission to have total freedom in the Vaticans libraries.<br>
When you come out of there your skin will have turned so white the Klux Klux Klan will discriminate you since you are whiter then they are .. (No I am not a racist I am just trying to make him understand the impact of the shock) <br>
<br>
There are books there discovered by mankind, that have been preserved there so they will never ever be read by anyone but the people in the Vatican.<br>
<br>
And trust me if those books in there would go public it would mean the end of Christianity as we know it.<br>
<br>
How do I know this? Well if you are willing to believe the bible who is written by mankind then why would one not be willing to believe the writing of Archeologists who discovered these books and thought they would be doing a good job by presenting this to the church for research.<br>
<br>
These books do exist, we will just never see them, and if you only believe what you can see and not what people tell you, then in no way can you believe in god.<br>

<br>
So this all could have happened infinite times already.<br>
<br>
It's necessary for big bangs to happen, because eventually stars use up all their hydrogen, and there is none left in the galaxy. <p>-------<p>

<br>
1) Jesus was one of several people claiming to be the Masiah<br>
2) Jesus was not near as popular as the bible would have you believe.<br>
3) The Romans had no real fear of Jesus and they actually did not want to kill him. Romans hated making martyrs.<br>
4) Most Jews did not care for Jesus cause the masiah was suppose to be a general to lead them out of oppression.<br>
5) After Christ died, christianity was damn near dead for over 300 years. The reopening of the Colusium brought their cult out of the sewers really. The followers of christ would martyr themselves to the lions and not fight back. But the actual resurecction of Christianity came from the Ceasar Augustus whose mother was a christian and got Augustus to power through some very insidious tactics. The other reason Christianity became popular was because the religion appealed to Roman aristocratic women. Being that Christ had said that women were to be loved. This was a huge step forward in women rights at that time. So it was at the time when Augustus split the empire and created the Catholic church that Catholicism came to power and the religion was forced upon the masses.<br>
<br>
This has just been nothing more than a brief history.<br>
<br>
Also there are several books that have been omitted from the bible. One in particular that Ran on A&amp;E was about the book of Joseph and mysteriously that episode has never ran again and the video is not available. HMMMM<br>
<br>
Anyway the King James Version was a creation of 15 scholars along with selected Cardinals from the Vatican. These people Translated books from their original tongue and decided what went in and what did not. Seems rather selective to say the least. <br>
<br>
Just food for thought have fun.<br>

Gee... look ! The bible says &quot;woman&quot; so it must be offensive also.<br>
<br>
Ok class is in session.<br>
<br>
The origional Hebrew word used in Genesis is not &quot;Woman&quot;.  Woman is actually a derived word wich means &quot;wife man&quot;.  Unfortunatly when translating from one language to another you are limited by the vocabulary of the language you are translating to, especially when that language is english (I won't go into how bad a language english is compared to older languages).  In Genesis the word used for woman is &quot;Ishah&quot; wich can be litteraly translated as &quot;female man&quot;.  This is simply to state that woman is the female half of Ish, man.  It's also noteworthy that if they Bible had named her as &quot;Wife man&quot; it would probably have been &quot;b'tulah&quot; the married terse of woman.<br>
<br>
Now I do realize that the bible puts women in a lesser role than man, however, since the arguement was about a simple word this is my response ;p<br>

YOu never heard the adage to only believe half of what you see and nothing that you hear?  I have at least seen these things.  I have something to base an opinion on.  You have nothing by heresay to base yours on that I have seen so far.<br>

This is actually quite easy to show by pointing to Cain and Able. Cain slew Able, God told Cain to go and Cain asked something abunt being hunted and/or killed by other nations.  God marked Cain, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Point being. There were other people on the planet besides Adam, Eve, Cain and the corpse of Able.  Where did they come from? who the hell knows.. maybe the Jews really are gods people because they were the ones created by God and the rest of us are just smart monkeys who, through millenia of mimicking gods people have become liike them<br>

but answer this...<br>
how come you are and demand to be respected for beeing a christian but you are just a ignorant fool if your a satanist. i cant figure that one out since they are like + and - to eachother...<br>
<br>
satanism is to know and understand that we all manipulate eachother to gain control to wha benefits us the most weather we like it or not everything humans do they do for themself in some matter...<br>
<br>
in Domine satanas<br>
<br>
btw the cartoon peter pan is of pagan offspring <br>
Pan= winged deamon<br>
the way i see it God exist but hes a sadist that likes to watch while his counterpart takes notice of humans and acts with them, in other words the south one cares while the northern one doesnt give a flying....<br>

if satan brigs temptation and god gives us some sons of his for us to kill id prefer to have the temptations any day...  after all life is about pleasure and well beeing for yourself  everyone is an EGOIST to some extent  yes even jesus was an egoist if he came here to die for humanity..<br>
there is nothing wrong with egoism its natural, and capitalism is a form of freedom this can be hard to comprehend at times but it is so...<br>

Jesus was the creator of this world and humanity, as ordained by God. Then after he was crucified he overcame death, by resurrecting three days later ( and i know i don't have to explain resurrection to you). He overcame death for us, through the power of God, to save us, not just for the hell of it. He overcame death so that us who came from a spirit world, could overcome physical death and live eternally, whether it is in one of the heavens or elsewhere, because as you may know there wasn't physical death before the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. <br>
It is not like God the Father sent his son to die. The Christ is part of the Godhead (Father, Son , Holy Ghost) and he was sent in a physical body to save the rest of his Father's sons, or us.<br>
Yes, i can tell you prefer temptations since you are a hedonist by what you say. However, how is Christ dying for the sins of humanity a selfish or egoistical act? Elaborate on that one please, kkthx.<br>
Egoism is as natural as any other sin, another of our common mistakes through life, so what's your point? and where does capitalism enter this topic? Capitalism in principle is not about greed, it's about ...capital and competition.<br>
I find it pretty sad that you think this is your only instance of existance, and that you should indulge in every act of pleasure there is even if that means wronging other people, or even yourself, as your quote about crimes points out, that's pretty thoughful rationale right there, cough cough.<br>
Do you believe you have a spirit? or are your thoughts and feelings and morals just chemical reactions? What do you think it is that makes us different from other species? If you are going to say evolution, then please explain why is it that other species have existed on earth for unaccountable amounts of time and have not developed the same capacities we have?<br>
If you are going to respond to these, use something besides your dark lyrics, they are really putting you on the not so bright spot of the arguement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=281.topic&start=101&stop=114>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=872.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=875.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
