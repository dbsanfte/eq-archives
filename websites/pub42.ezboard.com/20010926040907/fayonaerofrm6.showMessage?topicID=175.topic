And agreed the loot rule is all in lotto.<br>
<br>
After slashed King, we rolled and I won the lotto and someone congrated me win it. Some times later, 4 LD in my group and leaving me and Poka at king. Waited over 10 mins and have mushroom roamer mezed. Waited a bit more then we decided gate out as it's quite dangerous there. <br>
<br>
After over one hour, I've seen Nandari and Elin at seb. zone in. Send one of them tell are they all ok. <br>
<br>
Elin sent me tell how about the Fungi Tunic, then Nandari sent me tell too. I told them I won it but they keep telling me I Steal the Fungi Tunic, I explained to them that :<br>
1) Poka was there and they can contact him for the truth.<br>
2) They ALL rolled and there's some time gap before they went LD. Nandari said he just saw 2 lottoed before LD. <br>
3) If I want to steal the Fungi Tunic, will I stay for king for around 10 mins to wait them to blame me.<br>
4) Will a 60 enchanter ruin her reputation for a fungi tunic ? hmm.... May be Nandari will, else how come she has such thought.<br>
5) They said they petitioned, then I replied np u can ask the GM to check it. <br>
<br>
Heard/read some BAD stories about CN, I just think it's a story and didnt tent to believe it. i've even met some nice members in CN like Cull and helped HIM transfered some valuable items (with value worths more than a Fungi Tunic) long before the King incident.<br>
<br>
Today I've received a tell from Craftie, another enchanter that they spread I've stolen the Tunic. (i've asked Poka and know that they've contact him about the tunic incident already)<br>
<br>
Shit. even at level 60 (Nandari) still cant trust others, not just Me but also level 56 shaman too. And think people with clean history will RUIN their reputation for just a fungi tunic. What a dirty mind. <br>
<br>
Nandari u're the FIRST high level player I've seen who cry a river when losing a lotto.<br>

So yeah I lost. I don't plan on asking to "re-roll" myself on the tunic.<br>
<br>
As for trust. The 4 of us got back online at about the same time, apparently some routers weren't letting much of anyone connect to the servers at the time. When we're back, neither you nor poka are online. About 30 mins later, we see a lvl 1 enchanter name Joeychung in EC, apparently selling a fungi tunic. You login slightly later and attempt to get a port to WC to sell your fungi. You had no interested in working back down to king until after you had sold it. (The king was up again at this time btw).<br>
<br>
Looking at it from our perspective. Fungi drops. 2 people roll and then mass LD. We come back, the shaman (poka) isn't online, and the person that looted the fungi (joey) claims that she won the roll and is going to go sell it now. Furthermore, you claim that poka (who is conviniently not online) will back you up.<br>
<br>
You were not interested in rolling on the tunic again, despite 2/3s of the group not agreeing that you had won it, with a 5th not immediately contactable. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
While I could have been led to believe you at this point, the simple fact that you had no one to back you up, combined with the fact that you were planning on selling the fungi before going back down didn't build a strong case in your favor.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Much later, Poka logs in, says that you won. He doesn't remember what everyone rolled either, just that you had highest and all 6 rolled. At this point I sell him that the 4 of us have already petitioned the GM and are in the process of having the tunic confiscated (specifically, that he's already checked the logs, determined Joey still had the tunic, and would confiscate it as soon as he received emails from the 4 petitioners.) I suggest that he contacts the gm and explains what he saw, since he was confirming Joey's story.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Personally its a trivial issue since I already concede the tunic (though not necessarily to you). My only actions were to serve as a contact to the GM since most of them didn't play at a time the GM was online.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
As for crying a river about it....<br>
<br>
You kept an item despite the majority of the group not agreeing that you had won it. You were asked to return and roll on it. You declined. You were then petitioned.<br>
<br>
Yes, members of the group that I was with later heard about it because I was still grouped with elin and pyth and we were discussing it, and how to handle it. Sorry, but from what they heard, they must have reached the same conclusion we did.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
My opinion on your actions? Don't know what I would have if it had happened to me. I would hope though if 4 people had a problem with me keeping the item I would at least consider returning it.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
What would I like to see? Elin, Pythaeon, Pyat, Joey and Poka roll for the thing.<br>
<br>
What is likely going to happen since the GM is invovled? That minus Joey.<br>

There's SOME time gap before u 4 went LD after the roll. I have completely no clue how many message u saw for the lotto and no valid point to claim I won the lotto if I DID NOT.<br>
<br>
2) If u rolled, u have to accept it even LD, else every time people lose a lotto, then /q and go back claim need to re-lotto. I dont think it's FAIR.<br>
<br>
3) I have NO level 1 enchanter auctioned in EC. the period I camped was going to play my monk solo. But I will still sell or trade my Fungi Tunic tho. There's nothing wrong when u won it. <br>
<br>
4) Poka already said that he will camp after one king or ph before we killed the king.<br>
<br>
5) When I hail u, it's around 12:30am for me. Assemble another group and fight till King would take time and not allowed to me as I need work the next day. If I leave group after killed the first king, then I should gate out immediate after u LD instead of waiting like 10 mins at king spot. <br>
<br>
6) Before u asked me go back to king, u've already said I stole the tunic. So contraditorary for asking a ninja looter in your eyes to group again. <br>
<br>
7) This post is NOT direct to CN tho, I've already said there're some cool members in CN. Like the case Cull asked me to help him transfer items worth more than Fungi Tunic. Just grouped with Cull several times only, it's time for u, Nandari, to learn the meaning of &quot;TRUST&quot; instead of just said who STEAL the tunic, petitioned him/her, spread out who stole item, but he/she JUST win it.<br>

Therefore, it doesn't count. Time gap....I would think that everyone knows that there is a delay between when a person stops receiving messages from the server and the server realizes the player is LD. As for how many saw the rolls? The majority of the group decided that they didn't see it.<br>
2) There is a difference between 1 person going LD and 4, with one of people that didn't declaring themselves the winner. The majority of the people in the group really should be present when deciding the winner. ASSUMING you did in fact see 6 lottoes (which, 4 members did not), its a moot point as we weren't there to verify. One or two people miss seeing the lotto, fine. Over half the group doesn't see it? Thats getting to be a problem.<br>
3) There was a level 1 enchanter with a named Joeychung in EC, I don't know that it is yours but it was a single letter different. Not long after I saw him in EC, you logged in and started asking for a ride to WC. Again, could be coincidence, but it certainly didn't bolster our confidence in your trustworthiness.<br>
4) Yes he did, I merely said he wasn't available to talk to when the 4 of us got back.<br>
5) Assembling another group was kinda moot as we had all but a chanter ready to go when "talking" to you about it. You of course, have the option to group with whomever you'd like, but once again it gave you the image of someone that took advantage of the situation (4 members LD and unable to return for a good chunk of time)<br>
6) We asked if you were coming back to roll on the tunic and head back to king at basically the same time. You said no the tunic is mine to the first and no i'm not going to king i'm going to sell my tunic to the second.<br>
-----------<br>
Its obvious in your eyes the tunics is yours, and it ours it is still undecided. <br>
<br>
Guess what.<br>
<br>
If the majority of the group thinks you've taken it unfairly, that is pretty much the definition of it.<br>
<br>
If what you say is true (that the server sent 6 rolls to you, and that you had the higest), I'm truly sorry it is like this. But you cannot ignore two thirds of the group. I cannot vouch what the others saw. I know I only saw 2 rolls before going LD. And you've said that we all went LD at roughly the same time. Seems likely to me that they didn't see the rolls either.<br>
<br>
I did not consider it acceptable to be decided by 2, especially when the winner was one of the 2. Quite simply, I found it too coincidental to let stand on merely you guy's word.<br>
<br>
Hence, I supported the decision to petition the matter.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly, if you weren't in possesion of the fungi tunic when the servers dropped everyone, you would have re-rolled (well, or not gotten the tunic). But because you had it in your posession, you chose to ignore the wishes of the group.<br>
<br>
That is simply unacceptable behaviour. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=3290">Nandari</a><br>

<br>
Hmmm, poorest group I'd been in was when we arrived on the server and I had the misfortune of grouping with &quot;Joey&quot;.<br>
<br>
The two warriors in the group asked for some form of haste for, wait for it, over ONE hour real time.<br>
<br>
Was about 1 1/2 hours, the reason we stayed was we were finding more and more inventive ways to ask for haste that just fell short of &quot;HEY FUCKHEAD - HASTE PLZ KKTHNX!&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think in the end we basically bantered about how if enchanters, like y'know, hasted melee classes, downtime would be less, more mobs killed, more fun, less chance of mobs beating on key classes...<br>
<br>
All the while &quot;Joey&quot; sat there and /auctioned.<br>
<br>
Funny thing was, I was later told by a few friends they had had the same experience. One rog was blessed with aug if im not mistaken. The others got nada. Super group dynamics.<br>
<br>
&quot;merchant lfg send tells plz&quot;<br>
<br>
The above rambling justification by Joey on the &quot;bit-o-phat-loot&quot; is merely a preemptive and hollow whine.<br>

Kinda funny you mention the names of the CN players but no one else except Poka, given that he/she's backing you up, lemme guess he/she is a guild mate?  <br>
<br>
I dunno what exactly happened, but from the sounds of it your just being greedy.  I've known Elin for quite some time, and she happens to be one of the kindest most selfless players I've met.  If she thought you did wrong, I think you better start thinking about what you've done cause she wouldn't point a finger without due reason.<br>
<br>
Nice win a role with 2/3 of the group LD, gg champ.  If you weren't greedy you'd reroll it after reallizing the situation.  But of course if you want to be greedy you can claim whatever you want since the rest of the group was LD.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the pickup groups, cause with an attitude like that you'll be destined to them for eternity.  Lucky for you there's always half a dozen groups in Seb OOCing for an enchanter, or you'd be shut out of them as well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubamdarcn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BamdarCN</A> at: 4/8/01 7:47:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udartanianartagel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dartanian Artagel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/9/01 8:43:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The POOREST Group I've in</span><hr size=1> This sounds like a crock of shit to me.<br>

Fungi tunic drops, people see that they lose, so they go LD right after the lotto?<br>

Must be spring break, the kiddies are home from school.<br>

I liken you chickenshit cocksuckers to people who go around vandalizing cars.  You think it is &quot;fun&quot; to scam people, you can sit around during your short bus school lunch break and brag about your l33t h4x0r skillz.<br>
<br>
You all rolled, you went LD.  Too fucking bad you &quot;didn't see&quot; the lotto, you'll just have to take other people who didn't go LD at their word.  Think of going LD as part of the lotto process...yeah...the part where you LOSE THE FUCKING LOTTO!!!!<br>
<br>
Anything else is waving a big red flag that you are a convertible keying, lieing, scamming cocksucker.<br>

To repeat for the stupid, going linkdead RIGHT after you roll is bullshit, if it happens you get to take whomever DIDN'T go linkdead at their word.  I don't give a shit how many people went LD in the group, assholes like you put together little scams like this all the time.

I just am wondering about a few things which made me think:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> He doesn't remember what everyone rolled either, just that you had highest and all 6 rolled<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hmmm... He doesn't remember that everyone rolled, but he does remember Joey had the highest and all rolled? Well so he DOES remember that everyone rolled? Or are there more than 6 spots? No there aren't, and you said, ALL 6 rolled.<br>
Now THIS is what I call a contradiction in one sentence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If the majority of the group thinks you've taken it unfairly, that is pretty much the definition of it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I do not really agree with this. If you define fairness or rules in EQ by &quot;what the majority of the group says&quot;, then it for sure will never be fair. If I group with 3 friends and 2 foreigners, I will for sure in 90% of all cases support my friends. <br>
If 4 friends just decide to bitch around and if your definition is King, then you will ever and always win everything since &quot;the majority of the gorup sees it that way&quot;. So you do not even have to roll, you can just VOTE on who gets the loot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Not pretty what I call fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think its a pretty sad story and I must say being Joey I would have acted the same way. Hell I assume she said it right that she won the roll (like her getting the roll messages which told her that she won) and then most of her group goes LD. SHe is sitting on a hot spot, being 2 people.<br>
Now I would for sure not stay at that spot and like refuse to loot that tunic, die and risk a long CR or something (I don't know the zone there, but I assume the King is not really closer to the entrance and it would have ended in a longer CR).<br>
See her situation. You all rolled, she won, you go LD and she is alone there with the Shammy. Yeah great. I would for SURE loot the TUnic, then wait a little (as long as its possible to hold the camp) and then I would also for sure gate.<br>
Then she is fed up with the zone, has no more group and decides to do somehting else. Then after &quot;god knows how long&quot; you logg back in and wonder why she is not there anymore? Well what did you expect??? Noone touching the Tunic and let it rott since you went LD? <br>
<br>
I understand that you are pissed since you may have not seen her roll (I have no clue what happened, I just put the pieces of your posts together to one story) and now the tunic is gone.<br>
<br>
It is not your fault that you went LD, but it is eve much much less Joey's fault.<br>
<br>
Crappy situation...<br>
All in all I just think that you guys should be mature enough to handle this situation umm.. SLIGHTLY different, maybe like a little more mature, but what do I know...? <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br>

<br>
Doesn't matter.  If you go LD after rolling, for whatever reason, you go along with the folks that DIDN'T go linkdead, suck it up.  Quit whining.<br>
<br>
There are two scenarios here.  <br>
<br>
The first is that everyone in your happy little commune is honest and smells like apple pie, they did in fact honestly go linkdead....GREAT, so they are UNLUCKY, they don't REALLY know if they won the lotto or not because they didn't see the rolls.  Recognize the situation, say to yourself &quot;gee, that sucks&quot;, and MOVE on.<br>
<br>
The second scenario is that everyone in your disease infested little commune is a bunch of lieing cocksuckers and they smell like a unwashed latrine shovel.  They saw the roll, pulled the plug, typed some emails, and hoped to chalk up another fungi tunic for trade bait.<br>
<br>
Are you and your bitches so fucking STUPID that you can't see how transparent your scheme is??<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a massive conspiracy!!! fucking hax0r goatrapists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter if it is or not.  Are you stupid?  This scam is akin to asking someone you DON'T know to do a trade but the items are &quot;on this other character, gimme the fungi and I'll brb with my mule.&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you incapable of rational thought?  <br>
<br>
Put your brain in gear dumbass!  <br>
<br>
This is for EVERYONE'S protection, do you want to be in some group where the other five know each other and pull this VERY same scam on you?<br>

<br>
If I'm in a pickup group I don't give a rat's ass about the loot.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming this is probably the case with people I know that were in this group.  They just probably didn't like the attitude and actions of Mr. Chung.<br>
<br>
Kinda silly to do something of even questionable ethical standing in a public situation for a common drop.  But the mighty power of the fungi tunic over the average Seb farmer is great.<br>
<br>
Kinda funny you think this is a big scam.  4 people, 2 of which I'm sure hardly know the other two, and all of sudden their scheming to work over the others who they probably don't know either.  Then on the other hand you have one person who has an, apparently, notorious reputation.  Yet you point the finger the other way.  I think you are the stupid one.  But I guess that's kind of apparent seeing the way you express your feeble opinions.      <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubamdarcn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BamdarCN</A> at: 4/9/01 10:20:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udartanianartagel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dartanian Artagel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(4/9/01 10:23:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The POOREST Group I've in</span><hr size=1> &quot;If I'm in a pickup group I don't give a rat's ass about the loot.&quot;<br>

It's not about loot.  Its about being taken by scamming assholes.<br>

What I consider unethical is rolling, or at least claiming to roll, while most of the group is LD.  While you find this perfectly acceptable, apparently.  <br>
<br>
I guess it comes down to who you beleive in this case.  Call me crazy but I trust my guildmates and friends over someone with a notorious farmer reputation.  Call me crazy, but I do.<br>
<br>
Also note who started this thread.  I'll also go out on a limb here and say that Mr. Chung probably spends a TON more time in Sebilis than my two guildmates mentioned.  We happen to prefer more challenging zones than Guk2.<br>
<br>

<br>
Funny?<br>
<br>
&quot;4 people, 2 of which I'm sure hardly know the other two, and all of sudden their scheming to work over the others who they probably don't know either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Probably?  You are SURE?  Nice language for &quot;YOU DON'T FUCKING KNOW&quot;.  And even if you did KNOW for CERTAIN that these people didn't know each other, *I* wouldn't know that you were not a damn liar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then on the other hand you have one person who has an, apparently, notorious reputation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, you have two people from a guild who has, NOT apparently, HAS a &quot;notorious reputation.&quot;<br>
<br>
How many people bitch about Joeycheung, then how many bitch about Coterie Nocturne.<br>
<br>
I could give a shit less either way.  You're all scum suckers if I don't know you, remember Strike's little tirade about 95 percent of the people who play on the server are assholes, and him and his friends are the remaining 5 percent?  He has lots of friends I guess, I'd put it closer to 99 percent assholes.<br>
<br>
I don't care if Joeychung is the biggest ninja looter of all time, I don't care if Coterie Nocturne is a guild full of ninja looting retards who lick latrine flavored lollipops.<br>
<br>
I DO care about people pulling lotto scams, it pisses me the hell off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yet you point the finger the other way.&quot;<br>
<br>
I point the finger at the fucking scammers.  Anyone with two braincells can see that shit coming a mile away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you are the stupid one.&quot;<br>
<br>
That entire sentence is inaccurate, especially the part where you assert that you &quot;think.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are obviously incapable of rational thought (or choose to appear that way when convienent).<br>
<br>
It is quite simple.  A rational person would take a look at this thread and realize that going linkdead after rolling doesn't leave you with much options.  ANYONE can figure that out, EVEN stupid people.  BUT, stupid people think that everyone else is stupid just like them and will believe random bullshit that spews out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
It is RUDE (look the word up you uncultured turd, no, really, I mean it) to put someone in a position where the have to choose between trusting that you are not a lieing, cheating, asshole or cutting off all relationships whatsoever.<br>
<br>
IF YOU GO LINKDEAD AFTER ROLLING ON A LOTTO, TOUGH SHIT!.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I guess that's kind of apparent seeing the way you express your feeble opinions. &quot;<br>
<br>
That the best you can come up with bitch?  Are you reduced to attacking me based on how I express my outrage at your infantile phat lewt grabbing scamming shit?  Tuck your tail between your legs and run out the door while you can bitch.  Don't let it hit you in the ass on the way out.<br>
<br>
On a side note, does anyone know if Verant logs lotto's?  I am guessing not since this is still a rather common scam. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/line.gif"><br>[60 Oracle] <I><A HREF = "http://eqforge.com/shaman/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=537">Dartanian Artagel</A></I> <<A HREF=http://www.transcendents.org>Transcendents</A>> ZONE: ezboard<BR>

<br>
Again you spew factoids.  Joeychung rolled, won, saw 4 people go linkdead.  THAT is a scam, I hope to hell the GM recognizes it as a scam and tells the 4 scammers to fuck off.<br>
<br>
Nandari said &quot;the only rolls the 4 of us saw were mine at 526 and elins at 536&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno most groups that you've been in, but in the groups that random that I've been in. We usually wait until everyone is present to roll.&quot;<br>
<br>
No shit, everyone was present, when your buddies saw that they lost the roll they disconnected.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Now that might have taken some patience and would've delayed the uber trade that may have been in the making, but it's a common courtesy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Common courtesy????  What, now scamming assholes expect courtesy from their marks?  Unreal.<br>
<br>
&quot;What I consider unethical is rolling, or at least claiming to roll, while most of the group is LD.&quot;<br>
<br>
I find it hard to believe that you find anything unethical.  Anyone that thinks it is ok to lotto scam people relates to this game differently than I do.  I bet you don't make any differentiation between NPCs and other players.<br>
<br>
&quot;While you find this perfectly acceptable, apparently.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, you are obviously incapable of stringing together facts yet again.<br>
<br>
* YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FUNGI KING.<br>
* I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FUNGI KING.<br>
* FOUR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FUNGI KING BECAUSE THEY WENT LINKDEAD AFTER THEY ROLLED.<br>
* TWO PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GO LINKDEAD.<br>
<br>
Those two people who know could be opportunist punks.  But get this, they DIDN'T know for sure if the other people in the group didn't see the lotto's.  They DIDN'T know that the four people were going to go linkdead.  They had one option and one option only, that is to play it straight.<br>
<br>
These FACTS alone make your buddies look like scamming assholes.  I think even the stupid people can understand that now.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess it comes down to who you beleive in this case. Call me crazy but I trust my guildmates and friends over someone with a notorious farmer reputation. Call me crazy, but I do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good for you.  You trust your buddies.  And since you asked, &quot;you're crazy.&quot;  There, ya happy?  Now go scam someone else plzkkthx.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also note who started this thread. I'll also go out on a limb here and say that Mr. Chung probably spends a TON more time in Sebilis than my two guildmates mentioned. We happen to prefer more challenging zones than Guk2.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whoopty fucking doo, again you try to cloud the issue.  Aren't you all high and mighty, maybe you should tell your scamming asshole friends to stick with lower guk since even the foreigners in guk 2 have caught onto their sorry asses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Btw, have you killed Velk's Efreeti friend or is he still owning you?=)&quot;<br>
<br>
Have not tried him yet, thanks for asking!  (We did manage to kill Kerdelb or whatever he is called :P).<br>
<br>
Edit:  Actually, &quot;we&quot; might have tried, but &quot;I&quot; was probably bizzaro Dartanian (i.e.  Buff ho/slow ho), everyone in the guild says I am much more pleasant when Zebb runs me :P<br>
