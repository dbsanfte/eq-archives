Thank you for your reply.  But basically if you re-read my post your asking for me to respect your opinion is the very same thing I was asking from you.  We dont agree - we probably never will.  So please dont read things into what I am saying.  I am simply saying that this whole damn thread doesnt have a right or wrong.  Because we are all individuals who make free will decisions and therefore what is my choice will not be yours or the choice of anyone else on this board.<br>
<br>
As you can see this topic enflames me a bit.  What everyone here wants to morally and ethically debate is something I live with - myself and hundreds of thousands of other parents and children around the world.  But as I said in a previous thread I am lucky because my son's condition is fairly mild.<br>
<br>
To quote a letter I recieved from a friend (that I got to know through EQ) who has a disabled son - &quot;basically you dont give a rats ass what anyone else thinks - you are responsible for caring for him and not responsible for educating everyone else.&quot;  Yet I feel that inorder to make things easier for him I must be responsible for educating the people we come in contact with.<br>

But I write these posts as a discussion participant, not as a admin. And I think I should follow the same rules as everyone else.<br>
<br>
Editing typos and such should be permitted, really. The problem is that it is exploitable. Happened several times that the original post of a thread was heavily edited after the tread had reached three pages of replies, but I allowed it to pass those times because it woudl suck so much to disable editing. The final straw was when some jackass got angry with another player and changed all his posts in a long thread he had started, thus faking that everyone was flaming that other player.<br>
<br>
On a related note, right after I made my first &quot;STFU&quot; post in this thread, I made a post in the admin corner and resigned my adminship for this particular thread. I'm too personally involved. If someone goes too far, then that will be for Albarath to judge, not for me. On a principal level, this is also why we have always tried to have more then one admin/moderator and be sure that they arn't all in the same guild. One of the prime reasosn why hired Jzonn once upon a time was that Shadowcross (Darkwind member) resigned his adminship and Kivorn joined the guild that I was allready in.<br>

End Quote<br>
<br>
An abortion is an abortion no matter how you see it. You are right in saying it is emotional, IT is also a philosophical and ethics issue, too.<br>
<br>
My personal views on abortion is this:<br>
Rape-being forced to have sex, not a good thing<br>
Insest-for obvious reasons-namely Popi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  kidding bro<br>
and endangerment to the woman(ie. if its going to kill the chick, giving birth to the kid).<br>
These are the only instances that I would consider abortion<br>
feesible.<br>
<br>
Now to have an abortion to just have one is WRONG, period.<br>
<br>
This whole issue goes back to us parents, to teach our children, that abstanance is not wrong. We need to teach, our children, to respect themselves and others around them.<br>
If we teach them, that when the time is right and when they are ready, they have the right to procreate. <br>
If you look at the BIG-picture, take a step back and think about this situation, the reason we are having this debate, is because of us, the parents. We need to take an active roll in teaching our children, what is right and wrong. If you don't know what is right and wrong, then ask someone that does. If they don't know, then ask someone that does know. Higher powers are there, for us. For the christians, its God, for the athiests, it I don't know what it is for them. Buhhda for Buhhda and so on. <br>
ALL, I am saying, who has the right to take away the life that is growing inside? Sadly to say, I don't have that answer. Its up to you and your Maker<br>
<br>
Teach your children, period.<br>
Its our responsability, to teach them. If we don't, who will?<br>
I can not emphazise this enough.<br>

<br>
Gonna try to explain my view a little bit better, kind of hard for me to do it properly in english I'm afraid but I'll do my best.<br>
<br>
It is a huge burdon for the parents (mentally and somewhat even physicly) to take care of a disabled or retarded child, for those who do it I give you my outmost respect.<br>
<br>
I would probably have it easier raising a child who was missing an arm or a leg then one that had brain damage, but that's me. <br>
<br>
To be allowed to have an abortion is an option everyone should have, for their own personal reasons. Something that may not be a big reason to us may be a huge reason to them.<br>
<br>
But I don't think abortion should be taken so lightly upon as it is in some cases now, when it's more used like a birthcontrol (damn that sounds better in Swedish), which it surely is not ment to be. If you don't want children, use protection for christ sake. <p><html><TABLE><TD valign=top><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/tana1.jpg"></TD>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;. I have been really holding this back because of the implications, but considering your view on abortion and the explanation of why you feel it is right, I feel a need to bring it up.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Notice my disclaimer, I did not intend to imply all that comes when you say the name Hitler. My point in using his name and comparing his actions of selectively killing people ( also groups of people ) to aborting imperfect fetus's lies solely on the point of trying to change the human race thru weeding out of imperfect people.<br>
<br>
Understand my side for just a moment and I think you would probably understand why I see the comparison. I feel the purposeful premature ending of the gestation ( pregnancy ) period thru very unnatural means is wrong. I see it one step away from out right murder.<br>
<br>
So for myself whether you are killing people after they are born because of defect or before because of defect, you are still doing the same thing. How ever you choose to label these people, born or unborn and not yet fully matured, defective makes no difference to me. You are still taking your perception of the world and drastactly affecting  and effecting someones life, in this case the potential life. All because by your standards they are not perfect or atleast they are so imperfect as not to have a decent standard of living.<br>
<br>
That mentatility scares the shit out of me and sickens me. Oddly enough I can still understand it. I think it is one answer to the solution, I just do not see it as the right one. No matter which way you look at it, if you want to change/weed out the imperfections in the human race, then do it thru technology not killing. Though even going that far is an entirely different conversation.<br>
<br>
For those that would argue they wouldnt be doing it to rid the Human race of imperfections, but for the child not to have to grow up in the world with these imperfections..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE END RESULT IS THE SAME </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I tend to subscribe to the &quot;clean slate&quot; theories about human evolution from birth to maturity. Meaning we are not born with thoughts and dispositions already in our head just waiting to be released. I feel we are a product of our enviroment more than anything. No matter what your &quot;defect&quot; given the proper surroundings you can excel and lead a life with a good standard of living.<br>
<br>
For these reasons and many more that are off this subject I find abortion to be wrong. Especially in cases where the sole reason is because of possible birth defects. Where do we stop and say &quot;Ok you can not abort your baby just because it won't have blue eyes.&quot; As best I can tell from the &quot;Pro Choice&quot; side you can and should abort your child for any reason you see fit. That to myself is just sickening.<br>

Your references to Hitler fill no function whatsoever, except to smear your oponents names. It's dishonest and dishonorable. And it's also very CHEAP. Finally, it starts to approach the treshold of harassment. I ask you twice to stop bringing up Hitler and I tell you exactly why. Then in your next post you start with a half page of chanting &quot;NAZI nazi NAZI nazi NAZI nazi NAZI nazi NAZI nazi&quot;, and follow it up with claiming that it's &quot;off the subject&quot; that I am in fact not a nazi.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hate monger is something I do not think I have ever been accused of. Hopefully my above statements clear it up for you a little. My comparison to Hitler and this subject is listed for the above reasons. I only bring his name into this because what he did is what happens when you take the attitude of ending human life for sake of defect to an extreme. You draw a line between born and unborn, I do not.<br>
<br>
I did not even mutter the word concentration camp it has nothing to do with this thread. I never mentioned the Nazi Party as a whole anywhere in this thread. Reality is amongst the Nazi party things were not always clear. After all it was Hitler's own people that tried to kill him more than once, because he himself had strayed way beyond the guidelines he had origianlly set forth for the Third Reich and Nazi Party.<br>
<br>
My intent was never to smear your name or harass anyone. I have not taken to sending you messages privately calling you a Nazi Baby Killer or anything of that sort, and I won't. If you can not understand my perception of the comparison I placed out there that is fine. You are more than entitled to your opinion and perceptions. I do think you are under a misconception of my intent, and are responding rather irrationally and immaturely.<br>
<br>
Dishonorable to me would have been to hide my thoughts from public view. You assume I said these things strictly to smear your name. I didn't, this is directly how I feel. I put it right out in the open and I will do it again whenever I see fit. <br>
<br>
I did direct them primarily towards yourself. In every debate there are two sides. You took the side opposite of my views and you were the only involved on that side that I saw any real merit in responding to. This is a debate/discussion, try to not take my views so personally.<br>
<br>
For the most part it seems that you didn't. You rebutled my remarks but, you added some things to imply I was purposefully trying to harass you. Again I was not trying to harass you in anyway.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I bet this make you feel good about yourself. If you can make people angry, then you must be right. Or some bullshit like that.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
 It is too bad you do not know me and we are not friends, this statement never would have been made. I do not take my self worth from the anger of others. I do equate making someone angry to being right. I find this a terribly odd statement to make for that matter. The only thing I can guess is you just are not understanding my reasoning fully. I hope what is written above clarifies things for you.<br>
<br>
Yet again my posts are nearing 3 screens full so I will add this one last thing then cut this short from here.<br>

NOT a flame.. just want to understand your feelings a bit more... let me start buy saying I am neither pro life, nor pro choice, I dont beleive abortion should be used as a form of birth control by any stupis unresponsible person, nor do I feel there are not good reasons to HAVE abortions... &lt; rape, life threatning, etc&gt; <br>
<br>
So as a mother of 2 boys, I ask you simply this... you replied to a person in this thread with the following...<br>
<br>
**Caean,<br>
Again, it's our minds that entitle us to human rights. NOT our number of toes. With lump of tissue I do not mean it have to be spherical or anything. Hey, it can look like a fully grown Pamela Andersson for all I care. If it doesn't have a mind and doesn't have a brain that could fit a mind, no way in hell I'm going to consider it a person and care about it.<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
All I want to know is, if you were with child.... during those nine months, while you carried that growing life inside you... mindless as it may be, would you know love it? nuture it, by taking care of yourself?  speak to it ? &lt; many pregnant woman speak to their bellys, and many strangers speak to pregnant womans bellie, etc, etc<br>
<br>
However RIGHT , or wrong, you may be about it being a lump of tissue.. it is still living... &quot;LIVING&quot; mindless or not.. just cause it cant open its little undeveloped mouth and say dont kill me&quot; makes no less a &quot;living , ALIVE , lump of tissue&quot;.... so while i DO see your side to somethings you said, and disagreed with some as well... &quot;lump of tissue&quot; is just... well wrong... undeveloped, mindless fetus, yes..... lump of tissue , no.... if you took a lump of tissue, and put it in my uterus, it would not thrive and grow, and develope into a baby... however... a fetus with a heart, toes, fingers, will .<br>
<br>
/hugz<br>
<br>
and again, this is NOT a flame... I just cant grasp calling a fetus&lt; with a beating heart&gt; mindless as it may be... a lump of tissue....<br>

Little sidenote: If you havent figured it out yet, I am terribly bias towards the issue of abortion for rather intamate reasons. Never the less even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> if</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I found abortion ok I am not sure I would condone it just for the sake of birth defects. No matter how hard I try to &quot;wear the other shoe&quot; I just can not see it. That might be becuase of my ignorance. As I understand it you can not test for birth defects properly until the second trimester, in which the child is more than well on its way to development.

<br>
as for having a 'retarded' child .. I'd be 10x as happy having a deaf/mute/crippled child then a normal child. Killing yourself and the child because it is 'retarded' is pretty fuckin stupid (if you think that way, don't have kids)...<br>

Why would I want a 'retarded' child instead of a normal one? well as somebody who was born crippled (I'm not anymore) I would love to help that child grow into a strong person (as I have). So that they could make the best of their life, regardless of what 'retardation' they may suffer from.<br>

do you really think the 'retarded' girl feels like shit when people talk about her? do you? When I fall over out of nowhere because of my hips, or I trip over my own feet because of my hips and people laugh at me or make comments. I just remind myself how much better I am then them, because I don't go around making fun of the less fortunate.

Indeed some pregnant women talk to their bellies and in other ways display their happiness over becoming mothers. Good for them. It doesn't make it right to label less fortunate women as murderers as some people do. Abortion is rarely a easy choise, and I find it horrible how people often do all they can to make the woman feel as bad as possible afterwards. <br>
<br>
I chosed to use cold and detatched words, because of the subject. And the subject is abortion, not pregnancy.<br>
<br>
Cute little hands and beating little hearts and stuff can be nice to think about under happy circumstances. I'm sure it can be very relevant on emotional issues. However, it is NOT relevant at all when it come to ethics, and to throw it in the face of a woman who just had a abortion is cruel and pointless torture.<br>

So, you are not cynic in your way of screaming &quot;hitler, Hitler, HITLER&quot; at me in post after post. Instead you are honest. You know what? That only makes it worse. <br>
<br>
If you disagree with my opinions, fine. You should have been able to debate in a sensible manner. Instead you let you personal fears take over you, and you go out on some wild ghost crusade. Take a long shower and then take a close look at your own posts. Maybe you'll realize how fucked up they are. You could just as well have quoted the book of revelations and point as some loose connection between me and the antichrist. And then kept babbling about that imaginary connection in post after post. <br>
<br>
The only connection between me and Hitler is that you personally consider both him and me to be evil, and that you somehow gotten it into your head that this feeling of yours is a important truth. That's why you can keep saying that my opinions are the same as Hitler's in spite of the fact that you agree that is not the case. That's how you can spit out sick stuff like that the results are the same, in spite of the fact that even you agree that they are not. It's all in your head, mister. <br>
<br>
History contain a lot of very interesting philosophers. Hitler is not one of them. Hitler was fucked up, period. Everyone know that, everyone agree with it, and that is also the only way his name is ever used. As a petty insult or as a scream of moralistic panic. When it come to debates, Hitler is nothing more and nothing less then the bogeyman. And you most likely know that allready, if you think about it. If someone spent his posts babbling about you being as bad as Hitler, would you be impressed? Do you think it would give you something to think about? Of course not.<br>
<br>
I am interested in discussing the philosophical and ethical issues. I have nothing against discussing my won or the other debaters personal feelings a bit further. However, I am not the least bit interested in your personal fears and how you take them out on me. I am not interested in if there might or might not be possible to imagine connections between me, Hitler, the devil, the Illuminati and the men in black. And if Usama Bin Ladin happen to have a opinion on abortion, please leave it out of this thread. I don't care to hear it.<br>
<br>
It's a really good thing that you admit (especially to yourself) that this is actually about your personal emotional reactions to my opinions. However, unless you can leave that mess behind (and take your bullshit back and leave it behind) I'm not interested in communicating with you. I don't know you, and I am most certainly not your therapist. I have no obligation to listen to this. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Biological life from conception, yes. But not a person.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I tend to subscribe to the &quot;clean slate&quot; theories about human evolution from birth to maturity.

<br>
No matter what your &quot;defect&quot; given the proper surroundings you can excel and lead a life with a good standard of living.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
(Linebreak added by me.)<br>
<br>
I agree completely on both statements.<br>
The first part is what make me feel that abortion shouldn't have to be a moral problem. It's a blank slate that gets discarded, not a person that gets killed. Since you said earlier that you are not totally against abortions, I assume that we also share this view.<br>
<br>
The second part is the interesting one when it comes to our disagreement.<br>
<br>
We both believe that individuals have the same rights and value regardless of if they are crippled in one way or another or not. We also believe that it's possible to live a good or at least reasonably endurable life, almost regardless of how well the body and brain functions. You might be more optimistic in this later regard then I am, but if there is such a difference then it's irrelevant.<br>
<br>
However, I'm unsure if we both believe that it is preferable to not be crippled over being it. I do, adn I assume you do too. I think it's VERY preferable. Crippled people usually wish that they could walk or see or not have to suffer pain all the time, while I have no desire whatsoever to suffer any of those problems. Health seem to be very preferable indeed.<br>
<br>
We both agree that canceling a fetus is not like murdering a person. We both agree that it is preferable to not be crippled over being it.<br>
<br>
From here, our conclusions differ a bit. I think it's preferable if the clean slate you start out with don't have any major built in flaws. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I must also disagree with you. I can only assume that you are one of those people of perfect health who never had a single flaw at the time of their birth.<br>

I'm sure that if you asked people who actually were born with defects that many of them would rather be alive than be denied that chance at all.<br>

<br>
Of course they prefer to be alive!<br>
They exist, and they prefer to continue to exist.<br>
<br>
Hey, there's a lot of things about the past I prefer...<br>
My mother didn't have a abortion, my father didn't use a condom, both of them actually MET each other once upon a time.<br>
<br>
If my father had stayed with his old wife, then I would most certainly not have existed.<br>
<br>
However, if he had stayed with her, it would NOT have been a crime against me, it would not have been something done against me in any way. I didn't exist yet.<br>
<br>
In the same way, YOUR existence is not a crime against the children your parents might have had instead of you if you hadn't been. <br>
<br>
Please see the difference between what DOES exist and what MIGHT exist.<br>
<br>
As for me having perfect health, yada yada...<br>
Currently my health is quite average. My eyes and my stamina are not as good as I would wish, but no big problem. I can't run a marathon, and If I was a cardriver then I would have to wear glasses to see the streetsigns from far enough distance, but that's about it. When I was eight years old I was sick for a year. Really bad diease, don't know what it's called in english. Took another year or two before I could walk normally, and a few more before I was fully recovered. Took a hell lot of work and pain.<br>
<br>
I never contemplated suicide, that would have been silly. Life is to precious for that. However, if I could have backed time 9 months or so and never got the disease...<br>
YES that would have been preferable. You got a problem with that? And no, I wouldn't want to go back in time to get rid of teh disease now. Cancelling 17 years of my life, and important years at that, just to get rid of a problem I got rid of over a decade ago anyway? How silly wouldn't THAT be?<br>
<br>
Similary, OF COURSE people who allready exist don't want to be aborted. If you did read my previous posts, maybe you saw the part about my friend in highschool.<br>

Ed,<br>
<br>
Can we agree that you are obviously emotionally involved in this topic? You posted something similar to that earlier in the thread. You then comment on trying to be only involved on an ethical standpoint and this detactched. I would put to you that you are not able to emotionally detach, and thus going to &quot;go off&quot; a bit like we all do on topics where we are highly invested in.<br>
<br>
Terhas has posted some similarities that he sees in your opinions and that of some other people. He's not screaming Nazi at all. He seems to be putting forth a different perspective. That perspective is not pretty at all, but it's no less valid than yours. It's all opinion. Your entire position would fall apart if you simply held the opinion that life begins at conception.<br>
<br>
Perhaps before you get all worked up again about something someone posts, you should shift your perspective a bit to see it from their point of view. If you truly care about an ethical discussion and not just forwarding your own opinions, it would seem a helpfull tool.<br>
<br>
I don't have a lot of involvement with this topic to be truthful. I'd never go through with an abortion decision willingly, but I would take on the full responsibility of that position. That is just a personal decision based on my belief system and ethics. I don't expect that to be the way the rest of the world see it.<br>

<br>
One of my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> closest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> friends has Cerebral Palsy(among other ailments. He's a truly great friend. I shudder to think of my life without his friendship.<br>
<br>
His mother was a drunk and his father a drug addict. From birth he has been wheelchair bound. He has incredibly poor coordination(putting on shoes and socks is about a 30 minute endeavor for him). To tie those shoes would be another 30 minutes so he wears mostly hightops(for support) With minimal lacing required and is simply not possible somedays. He appears &quot;retarded&quot; (descriptive and not meant to be a put down. When he talks about being misunderstood, he uses that word). He has a very large forhead, and his left eye does not track what he is looking at. His speaks very slowly and with some modal(mouth movement and tongue movement) difficulty. He learns left brain activities VERY slow(comparitively) and has difficulty understanding anything involving math or pure logic. He grew up in various homes of friends and other family from 14 years old on as his mostly single mother was not able to care for him.<br>
<br>
He leads his fullest possible life and we've spoken many times about his &quot;quality of life&quot;. He states, emphatically that he would never consider suicide or that he should not have been born.<br>
<br>
I spend an average of 15 hours a week with this friend seeing movies, eating a meal or BS'ing about books, films life the universe and everything. I hate to think of what I would have lost had he not been born. Had he been aborted (and he fits the profile that most of you in this thread have put forth as &quot;worthy of abortion&quot;) the many people's lives that this guy has touched would be far less for it.<br>
<br>
Since he's reading this thread, I want to say somethign to him. Thanks for being my buddy Dustin, my life has been enriched by yours.<br>

Yep, I'm emotionally involved. As you noticed, I mentioned that before without anyone pointing it out for me. HOWEVER, regardless of our individual emotional reactions, ethics as such is still a matter of logic and philosophy, not of emotional outbursts. We shoudl try our best to think clearly.<br>

As for Terhas, he have a lot of a lot of interesting points, and is obviously intelligent. That's why I get so angry when he throw the &quot;hitler&quot; bullshit into the mix and keep clinging onto it. <br>

As for your friend, I'm sure he's a great guy and make a lot of people happy. However, that's because of his personality, not because of his handicaps.  <p>Love, Edeina<br>
