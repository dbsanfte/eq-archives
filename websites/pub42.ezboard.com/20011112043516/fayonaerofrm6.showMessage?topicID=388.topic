<br>
In an effort to bring Norrath's continuing storyline, they created a dragon, and posed as characters such as Firona Vie and her companions.<br>
<br>
At first the entire &quot;play&quot; was quite entertaining, apart from the odd person making stupid comments and interfering with the flow of the story. Then a flash of lightning fried the GM's brain (the only explanation I have for the stupidity that followed).  <br>
<br>
One of the GMs companions *tracks* an evil monster, and of course all that were assembled proceed to follow.  We're talking Skyfire here guys.  50 people, of various levels totally unprepared to fight following the GM and her Tracker.  The GM for some reason decides to stop dead in her tracks just as an ancient wurm, several chromo's , ancient wyvern and a few sperms show up.<br>
<br>
The massacred that ensued was lovely (insert sarcasm), and thru this entire incident you think that the person portraying Firona Vie - a supposably good and compassionate character - blithly continues this dumb Roleplay and ignores the dead bodies, the fighting, the mobs.<br>
<br>
Not once did that bloody fool raise a hand to help, not once was it offered to rez these poor people that simply wanted to watch her story unfold.<br>
<br>
So next time you send in a petition, or otherwise require a GM's or Guide's help....think twice about it - because obviously the IQ requirements for the job are lower than my pet rock's.<br>

Guess what? There is yet another GM event which I had totally forgotten about, but yet was still privy when I was playing with my Druid alt in Kelethin.<br>
<br>
I was just making the final preparations for a trip to the Chessboard when my Wizard companion informed me that he would be a little late as there was a small, intimate GM event whereby a Paladin had gathered a number of newbie/lowbie players outside Felwithe and had charged them with a 'special mission' to recover a number of items.<br>
<br>
These items were - if memory serves me - rusty weapons of various types. Once various newbie players had collected the alloted amount, some small reward was shared out amongst them, as well as a pledge from each of them that they may be called again at some time in the unspecified future.<br>
<br>
Quite a nice touch, I thought.<br>

<br>
If you choose to be in any zone outside of a city, then you are choosing to allow yourself the opportunity to die.  Its that simple.  City zones that you have good faction with are the only safe zones in the game.  No other place should ever be considered safe. EVER.  And if a GM event is taking place inside a city, that city should no longer be considered safe.  If you want to be safe, stay logged out.<br>
<br>
If you choose to go out unprepared to fight whatever creatures you may encounter (or at the very least be able to retreat from them) or to go into areas where you could not possibly expect to live should you encounter a monster, then you are opening yourself up to death.   (at this point i would like to insert a great big DUH!!!)  So when someone cries out &quot; We werent prepared! or We could never possibly fight those things!&quot; Then all I have to say to you is: WAAAAAAHHHHHH<br>
