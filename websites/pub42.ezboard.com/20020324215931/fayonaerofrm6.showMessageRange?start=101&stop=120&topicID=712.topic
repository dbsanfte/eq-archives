If limiting the right of one person to kill another is wrong or &quot;totalitarianism&quot; or punishing one person for the death of another is an infridgement of civil rights, then your persepective is skewed.<br>
<br>
Hartmut, your post just tops them all off, with your inflametory bullshit. <br>
<br>
This is called our country being at war. Some of the security is a bit extreme, but even then, others would argue it is not enough. Mostly it means now that you have to think about your actions beforehand, unlike that jackass in the Atlanta airport a few months back. As long as you arn't acting like a complete asshole in someway, there is no noticeable infrigements on personal freedoms. Yes, some of our freedom died on Sept 11th, yet, how would you suggest defending a country that is the shear land area of the United States from an attack that is almost as invisiable as a virus? Also, should we wait for the next attack and maybe try and catch them or prevent such attacks from taking place in the first place? Considering these people don't respect their own lives or those of anyone else, the chances of catching them alive is slim.<br>
<br>
As for the press, Bush and the &quot;McCarthy-esque&quot; terrorist scare: <br>
<br>
The newspaper is not going to print everything, and thats fine. If you are at war, you don't share your hints of your battle plans in a media as accessable as a newspaper.<br>
<br>
The terrorist witch hunt is a bit extreme, but its happened before. Unlike a communist country, we have due process. The government still has to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> prove</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that you engaged in terrorist activities in a court of law. Hey, anyone can call the cops and have someone picked up and taken to some holding tank for a while, but being arrested is only one part of the legal system. <br>
<br>
As for Bush... would you want to be him Hartmut? Walk in his shoes, so to speak? Do you think you could do a better job than him if given the opportunity to manage attacks on your nation, the resulting outcry and lousy national economy? You are welcome to try, pal.<br>

if you watch the american press these days its all the same flavor, you cant deny that....  doesnt make you that a bit curious?<br>
<br>
ever seen the movie  &quot;wag the dog&quot; ?  <br>
if the economy rocks bottom  you need war ...<br>
<br>
btw: bush cheated pretty much with the elections ...  his brother is governeur in florida  etc.... you know the story.<br>
bush senior and most of his administration were involved in the iran-contra-affair and the BCCI bankscandal  , most of these people exept oliver north representing the today administration of bush again. doesnt make you this think?<br>
<br>
the bush family owning parts of the carlyle group , which was also financed by the bin laden family and they produce a lot weapons .. actually most bomb in afghanistan fill up bush coinpurse. dick cheney was working a long time for chevron , on of the biggest oil-companies worldwide , condoleezza rice aswell , there was even a oiltanker named after her, after she joined bush administration the tanker was renamed quickly. <br>
strange thing is that chevron has big contracts running in middle asia (turkmenistan, kazakhstan,uzbekistan) and they tried to build the pipeline in 1998 through afghanistan , but the buissnesstalks failed since mullah ormar(taleban leader) wanted more money than they wanted to pay. <br>
just check this site  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.gasandoil.com">www.gasandoil.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
and use the search engine a bit , enter some bush administration member names.<br>
<br>
this war happens also pretty much for the reason that the Us-american can waste more cheap gasoline in their oversized cars ....<br>
<br>
US-troops were in the last 15 years only involved in conflicts with countrys with either big natural resources or in geographical important area to access transit routes: iraq(3rd biggest oilresources worldwide),serbia/albania(chevron building a pipeline through albania coming from the black sea these days ...),somalia ( big oil and gas resources), afghanistan(huge gas resources have been found , very important transit route from middleasia to the indian ocean).<br>
<br>
the worldleader ignored the genocide in rwanda(middleafrica) , just 1 000 000  people died in less than  1 year by primitive weapons(i.e machetes) ... countless other conflicts  , too many to mention.<br>
<br>
another thing is that america doesnt want to join any international contracts regarding the banning of biological weapons, isnt that strange? even with all these anthrax at home? <br>
<br>
well this &quot;eye by eye and teeth by teeth&quot; mentality  is deep embedded in the american history when the poor stupid farmers from europe invaded the american continent and robbed the ground of the indians , armed with bible and handguns. the most extreme variation of this mentality i have seen by myself this year in south africa , the white farmers where isolated almost 300 years from europe , so if you really looking for people who think like the average american make friends with south african white rednecks ....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
yes everthing is fine ....  <br>
<br>

<br>
If you accuse Connador of aiding terrorists he will be investigated.  If there is some evidence he will be arrested by civilian authorities.  If there is enough evidence a hearing may take place to determine if a trial is appropriate.  If It is decided that the evidence is solid he will be tried by civilian authorities.  As a US civilian he cannot be tried in a military tribunal nor can he be held indefinitely without charges being laid against him and a trial being set.  If he is in the military then of course the process would be somewhat different because when you join the military certain rights are given up in order to maintain discipline but he still can't be held indefinitely and has the right to appeal any verdict.<br>
<br>
There is no published source of information I don't have access to as an American.  I may not read everything available but, if I want to, I can.  These constant suggestions that the American public has no idea what's 'really' happening because we don't get access to information is bullshit.  The underlying premise is that the person suggesting this is either smarter than the American public or that the freedom Americans are so proud of is a sham &amp; that we have all been fooled...again, that the person is smarter than the American public because they can see through all that to the truth.<br>
<br>
Bullshit.  I guarantee you aren't any more intelligent or educated than the 300 million folks over here.  SOMEONE has thought of the same points any of you might make and they have broadcast them.  The networks can and do put absolutely anyone on TV to explain their ideas, no matter how lacking in evidence or clearly wrong.  The problem with the article Hartmut posted is not that we are all too brainwashed to see the truth, it's that there are obvious logical fallacies in the professor's theories.  His language is not intended to pursuade or inform, it's chosen to inflame and anger.  In short, it's a piece of propaganda for the anti-corporate socialist political wing.  Nothing wrong with that, as long as the reader is intelligent enough to understand what they are reading.<br>

<br>
Halo, Taino, Hartmut, &amp; anyone else who thinks the supporters of this war are stupid and uninformed: We read the same information you do.  You have no access to special information that we do not.  The fact that we disagree simply means you have a differnt moral/ethical code.  The fact that you may interpret that as proof that those disagreeing are stupid says more about you than them.<br>

It was his decision not to demand a full recount of all Florida votes. Hell, it was BUSH who wanted to do the full recount right from the beginning and if that had happened he would have lost.  Gore didnt want a full recount because he thought military votes would cause him to lose.<br>
<br>
However, I completely fail to see how the history of the Bush family has anything to do with the current war in Afghanistan.  Will a new government in Afghanistan be possibly beneficial to US oil supplies and trades? Yes. But that isnt the reason we are there!<br>
<br>
All politicians are crooked.  Even the ones who start out great and do their best to hold to their beliefs quickly become emeshed in the garbage that is our political system.  Because eventually, they all want to keep their job and that becomes more important than fulfilling the wishes of those who elected them.  Gore. Bush. Same difference.  It wouldnt really matter one whit who ended up taking the oath of office, i can guarantee you that if the same attack had happened while Gore was in office we would STILL be in Afghanistan right now and people would be coming up connections for how this benefits HIM instead of Bush.  <br>
<br>
The same goes for governments.  They are all out to do what they think is best for them.  the United States, England, Isreal, Palistine, China, Japan... they all want what they want and none of them really care about what the others want.  They only care about how much they have to let the others get in order to get what they want.<br>
<br>
the United States is obviously not perfect. thats a big Duh.  but neither is any other country or government.  If I am going to have to live anywhere i'd prefer to stay where I am because its the government i know and trus... ok, well maybe i dont trust them, but its the government i know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

even this video is soo strange, bin laden himself pointed out that none of the terrorists  had any clue what kind of mission they where doing until they entered the planes, which is pretty much in conflict to all earlier versions of the history of the attacks:  like the &quot;testament of mohamed atta&quot;  and his handwritten religious rules  both written in 1998  and all that stuff that has been published  in soo many different version and soo many talkmasters chewed it again and again.<br>
<br>
if the boss himself says: they didnt know what kind of mission they had to do and the video has been released by the us government and they called it authentic , so explain  what about all this testament stuff ???<br>
<br>
please explain  that .... ?!?!?   therer are pretty much 2 version of the terrorist attacks colloding   : <br>
<br>
1st they planned it for years   and they planned exaclty for the cashes  <br>
<br>
or 2nd ,    a bunch of brainwashed assassins  waiting for orders like robots and do what their master told them to do in the very last minutes .....<br>
<br>
the video , the letters of attas last will , his testament , his religious guide all this is still accessable for anyone , but it pretty much doesnt fit alltogether into the story ... like soo many other things  , e.g. arabian handbooks for driving a jumbo jet, isnt the  language english  in the airplane industry?<br>

<br>
i love this line.  especially this part: &quot;crashed a few airplanes&quot;  roflmao thats great.  your right.  i mean, it was only four thousand or so people.  fairly trivial. i'm sure in the grand scheme of things 4k people wont be noticed.<br>
<br>
and of course we Americans are trying to fuck up the world some more.  no no, our government is in no way trying to bring to justice those it believes are responsible for killing those measely four thousand people in new york.<br>
<br>
ok, /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
First of all, if the United States wants to fuck up the world some more then you can just consider it to be still our turn to fuck things up.  After all, Germany got two turns, Japan had a turn, England had a turn that lasted what?  a few hundred years?  Russia and France and Italy and Spain have all had their turns.  So its our turn.<br>
<br>
And we will continue to do what we see as best (even if it does just make things worse in the end) until we start to falter and it becomes someone elses turn to fuck the world over.<br>
<br>
i guess i'm done. <br>

<br>
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 —   The Justice Department apparently has ruled out treason charges against an American who fought alongside Taliban and al-Qaida fighters, but what to charge him with is less clear. Justice has advised charging John Walker Lindh with providing material support to a terrorist group, sources told NBC News, but the White House and the Pentagon are weighing other approaches.<br>
<br>
       TREASON NO longer appears to be an option given the demanding legal standard set by the Constitution: that either two eyewitnesses testify against someone charged with treason or that the person confesses in court that he fought against the United States.<br>
       White House sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told NBC’s David Gregory on Thursday that a decision could be made later in the day, but one official said it could be to do nothing for now.<br>
       Some White House officials have questions about whether there is sufficient evidence to go with the Justice Department’s advice because Walker’s participation in a terror training camp might not fit the statute for which he’d be charged.<br>
       And the Pentagon might soon submit its own recommendation, which the officials said would be a court martial proceeding. Walker could be tried as an “enemy belligerent” and could receive the death penalty.<br>
       NBC’s Pete Williams reported Wednesday that U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said prosecutors were preparing to charge Walker with providing material support to a terrorist organization.<br>
       The maximum penalty for a conviction on that charge is life in prison, under the just-passed USA Patriot Act, “if death resulted from the offense.” By contrast, the maximum penalty for treason is death.<br>

I guess now they can convict him of supporting the terrorists and toss him in the general population of a correctional facility (after they make sure the other inmates know why he is there). <br>

<br>
Tell me EXACTLY where I said this!<br>
It makes me very angry and I feel very offended, or in one word, fucking pissed, when you guys keep saying that a) Hartmut, Haloface and I are the same kind guys, when you b) think just because I disagree with you guys on a few points that I am an anti american asshole and c) that you directly assume that not agreeing with you in topic A, then I automatically am a liberal, have no clue about the real world, that I am a braindead hippy and other insulting things!<br>
<br>
Keep your points towards or against me AT LEAST TO MY QUOTES!!!!!<br>
<br>
Goddamnit!<br>
<br>
<br>
One quesiton:<br>
Why do you think that everyone that disagrees with your guys in one point, is automatically an antiamerican Talibanfriend?<br>
Why do you guys think that just becasue some people do not completely agree with you whatever you say, that those poeple automatically say that you should 'let it slide'?<br>
<br>
Where did I ever say, or even pointed a little towards 'that you should let it slide'?<br>
Those goddamn Terrorists MUST be hunted down!!! THis is a fact! <br>
I do just not always completely agree in HOW!<br>
<br>
<br>
Simply because I don't completely agree with the way the US handles all the things that happened lately, simply because I do not think that everything you do is completely right, simply because of this, you call me names, say that I ask you to ignore it, say that I don't think terrorism is bad and so on?<br>
<br>
Ya know, you do A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K... Z.<br>
And simply because I don't agree with D, and maybe X, you call me names?<br>
<br>
So you invade Afghanistan, you kill al those poeple, you consider attacking several other countries, you do so many things. And because I don't agree with 1 or 2 of all those things, you all hate me and call me anti american, say I am a friend of the Taliban and whatever!!!<br>
<br>
Other example.<br>
You want a blue bed, pink dishes, green couch with flowers and want brown walls and yellow shoes. I then say that I wouild like not to have flowers on the couch. <br>
So am I an asshole now?<br>
Am I anti american?<br>
Did I lose my sense for reality?<br>
Am I a stupid euro which would see everything different because the planes didn't crash in my city?<br>
Am I liberalist, communist, nazi, unthankful idiot?<br>
<br>
NO! I just disagree with you in a few points. Finally realize the difference between disagreeing in a few points and being a terrorist or Taliban sympathisant.<br>
<br>
Maybe its not een your fault. Your president said this himself (which is a completely stupid and arrogant statement): Either you are on our side, or you are in theirs.<br>
Means, you are ally or enemy.<br>
WTF? With this sentence Bush actually cut every single country in this world from having an own opinion, from having a right to think of a situation themselfes and come to their own conclusions!<br>
Either we kiss your feet, or you invade us.<br>
Right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Uhhhh, thats two words, bro.  but i get your point.<br>
<br>
I dont really consider you anti-american, Taino... i reserve that more for Halo (/wave Halo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Personally, i think that line was directed more for Hartmut than for anyone else seeing as how some of Hartmuts posts inferred that US citizens are completely uninformed about the goings-on of the world<br>
