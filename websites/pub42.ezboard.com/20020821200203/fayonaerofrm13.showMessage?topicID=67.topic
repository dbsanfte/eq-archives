Go extort the money from his poor unemployed and totally uninvolved sister.<br>*Go and kill a imperial buerocrat. It's a legitimate bounty, I promise. Just don't let the guards catch you.<br>The quests probably gets even bloodier from there.<br><br>Guildmaster Hard-Heart<br>So, I killed his lackeys in the guild and his master in the Cammora Tong. And now I am here to kill him. But this guy is not the one to hold a grudge. Instead of attacking me, he simply tells me something like &quot;Hiya byddy! Lets betray the empire together, shall we? Now be a good boy and slay everyone who might stand in the way of the Cammora Tong.&quot; Oh well, I guess he thought it was worth a try...<br><br>The holy knight<br>A holy knight wanted my help to slay a necromancer. You see, necromancy is bad, bad, bad. Remember that. So, we fight our way through Vas all the way up to the necros chamber. Then I slay him, and she thank me for ridding the world of someone foul enough to summon the undead. And what's that behind her shoulder? Why, yes! It's her own undead pet! She have been summoning these little beauties the entire time, quite a few of them died in the fights or simply expired. Holy shit, Batman!<br><br>Wrath of the avenger<br>Some random person wanted my help with slaying a really bad monster in a Dweemer ruin. I talk to her and then enter the ruin. She don't follow me, so I return outside. There she is, but what is that spell she's casting? A fireball is released from her fingertips, and she screams &quot;you are no match for me&quot; as the fireball comes flying my way. I draw my sword, but instead of drawing her own or casting more spells, she simply walk up to me. I look around a bit and find the corpse of a rat at my feet. She was quite right, that rat was no match for her. After this crisis being dealt with, she entered the ruin with me.<br><br>Looks safe to me...<br>A young and inexperienced researcher hired me to help her explore a anicent stronghold. As I fly towards the place, she decide that it looks safe enough, so she goes in without me. I find her note on the door, and the first thing I see inside is a Ash Ghoul. Uh oh. I found the silly little bimbo shivering on a table in a small room quite deep in the dungeon. Seems she was quite happy that I showed up. <p>Love, Edeina<br>Retired Highelf Arch Mage of Erollisi.<br>Citizen of <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero">Ayonae Ro</a>, member of <a href="http://www.eternalwrath.org">Eternal Wrath</a>.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upontiusont.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pontiusont</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/10/02 2:32:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> lol I rememeber doing the mage quest where you gotta escourt this wizard to another town. Well I would constantly run into monsters along the way and the wizard would try to help with his bad ass lightning spell. <br><br>Of course he was ALWAYS standing behind me and would accidently fry my ass and I would have to reload my last saved game hehe. <br><br>And there were some NPCS or Merchants that I could walk up to and start a conversation with, then id leave<br>and suddenly they'd attack me. <br><br><br>This game really gets me going sometimes. I cant believe how much I yell out curse words. Like if im running away from a monster with my FPS currently around 5, then suddenly it starts to rain or a sand storm starts up, and then getting a message stating that I have contracted swamp fever, then suddenly my hard drive starts going insane and the red button is lit up hardcore..NOOOOOOO<br>I blink my eyes for a good 3 seconds and open em up to see Morrowind has crashed and an ICQ message flashing in the middle of my screen from my GF...<br><br>Take all that crap and let it happen around 11 pm at night when its so damn hot and you have NO air conditioning or swimming pool, and you gota try to go to sleep in 15 min because you have work in the morning. <br><br>I dont know how I get through life, but playing Morrowind is so fun sometimes so its all worth it hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=67.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=67.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=67.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.threadControl?topicID=67.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=67.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=67.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm13>NWN & Morrowind</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
