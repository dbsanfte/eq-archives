The article below was taken from Yahoo and regards a lawsuit filed recently regarding reparations for slavery.<br><br>Take a read and post your opinion on the topic...I'll post in a bit after I've gotten my thoughts together.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three large U.S. companies were named in a lawsuit on Tuesday filed on behalf of black Americans descended from slaves, the first-ever class action seeking reparations from firms for profiting from slavery. <br><br>Photos <br><br>Reuters Photo  <br> <br>  <br>Aetna Inc., CSX Corp., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. were named in the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn federal court by 36-year-old black activist Deadria Farmer-Paellmann in the latest step by some blacks to get compensation for what their ancestors suffered as slaves. <br><br>&quot;The practice of slavery constituted an 'immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty, African citizenship rights, cultural heritage' and it further deprived them of the fruits of their own labor,&quot; the 21-page suit said. <br><br>Both Aetna and CSX said slavery was a regrettable chapter in U.S. history but the events in question occurred so long ago that a courtroom was not the proper venue to decide on reparations. <br><br>Plaintiff attorneys said 12 other companies would be getting letters in the coming days requesting a dialogue on a settlement. The other companies were not named. <br><br>The suit said yet-to-be-named corporate defendants from the industrial, manufacturing, financial and other sectors would be named in subsequent actions once they were identified. <br><br>The complaint did not contain a monetary damage figure, but did estimate the current value of slaves' unpaid labor as $1.4 trillion. The gross domestic product of the United States at the end of 2001 was $10.25 trillion. <br><br>BANK CONNECTION TO SLAVERY <br><br>&quot;This is a case about wealth built on the back and from the sweat of African slaves,&quot; said plaintiff attorney Roger Wareham at a news conference. &quot;We expect those companies that are targeted to stand up.&quot; <br><br>Advocates of reparations for slavery argue that the descendants of slaves are still being hurt economically and sociologically by their ancestors' bondage. Those who argue against compensation say, among other things, that it happened so long ago that reparations would be punishing people who had nothing to do with the practice of slavery. <br><br>According to the lawsuit, FleetBoston is the successor to Providence Bank, which was founded by Rhode Island businessman John Brown. Brown owned ships that embarked on several slaving voyages and the suit says FleetBoston lent substantial sums to Brown, thus financing and profiting from Brown's slave trade. <br><br>FleetBoston also collected customs fees due from ships transporting slaves, thus further profiting, the suit said. <br><br>FleetBoston did not return a call seeking comment. <br><br>The suit alleges Aetna's predecessor actually insured slaveholders against the loss of their human chattel. Aetna knew the horrors of slave life as is evident in a rider through which the company declined to make payments on slaves who were lynched, worked to death, or committed suicide. <br><br>Aetna, the No. 1 U.S. life and health insurer, said in early March it was considering making an unprecedented public apology and restitution payment over profits it made from insuring slaves in America 150 years ago. <br><br>COURTROOM 'WRONG SETTING' <br><br>On Tuesday, an Aetna spokesman said: &quot;We have not been served with a lawsuit. We do not believe a court would permit a lawsuit over events which, however regrettable, occurred hundreds of years ago.&quot; <br><br>CSX is a successor in interest to numerous predecessor railroad lines that were constructed or run, at least in part, by slave labor, according to the suit. <br><br>CSX said in a statement that while slavery was a tragic chapter in U.S. history, the lawsuit was wholly without merit. <br><br>&quot;The claimants named CSX because slave labor was used to construct portions of some U.S. rail lines under the political and legal system in place more than a century before CSX was formed in 1980,&quot; the company said. &quot;The courtrooms are the wrong setting for this issue.&quot; <br><br>The lawsuit seeks a jury trial, the appointment of an independent historic commission, restitution of the descendants' slave labor, disgorgement of illicit profits and compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial. <br><br>According to the suit, over eight million Africans and their descendants were enslaved from 1619 to 1865, many brought to the Americas to work as slaves on tobacco farms, cotton and sugar plantations. <br><br>The complaint said the exact number of plaintiff class members was not yet known but it estimated the class included millions of slave descendants . <br><br>In afternoon New York Stock Exchange (news - web sites) trading, Aetna shares were up 44 cents at $37.78, CSX shares were up 66 cents at 37.55, and FleetBoston shares were up 24 cents at $35.38. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br> <p>Regards,<br><br>Halagar Skullcleaver<br>Warlord of the North<br><a href="http://www.guildrip.com"><b>Rest in Peace</b></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ublearchie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blearchie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Benefactor</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 4:24:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~jim_howard/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Slavery Reparations</span><hr size=1> More folks with their hands out.<br><br>Anyone who actually was a slave please stand up.

First of all, how do you determine who gets any awards that result? How do you differentiate those Americans who are descended from slaves from those who are not? How many current stockholders of these companies are descended from slaves and should they be punished as well? How many stockholders are descendents of immigrants who came to the US long after slavery was abolished? Would it not be better to apply any awards to foundations to provide scholarships, home or business loans to African Americans?<br><br>It also brings up the question &quot;How far back can you go?&quot;. Should I, as an American of northern European stock be allowed to sue Italian entities because a couple thousand years ago my ancestor's indigenous culture was subsumed by the Romans? Or a less extreme example, should African Americans not be allowed to sue the royal family of Britain or even the government of the UK for having prospered with the introduction of slavery to the colonies in the first place?<br><br>Currently the precedent has been to award those victims still living with reparations. Extending reparations for multiple generations gets messy. Maybe not impossible, but certainly it opens up a huge can of worms. The question is will such lawsuits end up being a benefit to our country or will they cause more damage than help?<br><br> <p>Gulor Gularin55 Paladin of Tunare- Vallis Scortor</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufandros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fandros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 4:52:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Slavery Reparations</span><hr size=1> Totally absurd and foolish in the extreme.<br><br>All we need is yet another reason for racial division.<br><br>Hell I'll go so far as to say all racial specific holidays/celebrations and/or committee's ( be they private or govt sponsored) should be terminted.<br><br>This means no more National African heritage month etc etc<br><br>Say no to causes for division...<br><br>And definately say no to stupid lawsuits lol<br><br>Fandros Finglaflin<br>Human Warder<br>Eternal Wrath <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 5:12:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Slavery Reparations</span><hr size=1> The legal precedents this would establish are mind boggling.<br><br>Instead, it will establish itself as one of the most absurd lawsuits in American history (which says quite a bit).

I do not see that handing out cash reparations would serve any useful purpose whatsoever, even if all the decendants of actual slaves could be properly identified.  And what about all of the individuals in this country who have suffered harm due to racism, but who weren't actually slaves?<br><br>2)  Some people may not regard this as a valid comparison, but in the queer community, we deal with, and talk a lot, about one of the greatest problems we face being not the abuse and oppression that is heaped on us from 'outside' communities, but the oppression and negation that we have *internalized* and impose upon ourselves, limiting our lives and our view of the world.  I've done a lot of work in 'at risk' minority communities (mostly black, in L.A. and South Dallas), and I can tell you that internalized oppression is alive and well.  Ironically, race relations are *much* better in the small Georgia town where I currently live (where there are few jobs and little opportunity) than they were in Dallas, which has had a robust economy during most of the 17 years I lived there, but *much* tension between racial groups; and black/white segregation there is nearly as severe as if someone had built a wall across the Trinity.  Probably the strangest thing I witnessed while I was there was tension between the Black and Hispanic communities as Hispanics slowly but surely became the 'majority' minority population; instead of forming coalitions, which one might expect, the groups fought each other distressingly often.  My best friend in Dallas is a Black woman my age, originally from New York; she has had a very difficult time making friends there (and almost all of her friends there are white, while her New York friends are all races) because of the entrenchment and 'cultural divide' that separates the races there.<br><br>To say that slavery, and the 'Jim Crow' laws, the KKK, events like the Tulsa massacre, etc, have not left their mark upon the African-american population in the U.S. would be rediculous.  However, cash reparations, in my opinion, will do nothing to solve the problems created by our historical legacy.  Only understanding and reconciliation of these events in our history (and dealing with our ongoing racial divide) will do that, and while we should strive to make sure that equal opportunity *is* a reality for all Americans, simply throwing 'blood money' out in some bizarre gesture of 'apology' will only create more problems than it solves, in my opinion.<br><br>Regards,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel<br>Autonomous Collective<br><br>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ublearchie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blearchie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Benefactor</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 7:21:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~jim_howard/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: getting what's coming to you</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  My understanding is that the oft-maligned 'Affirmative Action' programs in this country <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Don't even get me started on this one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Blearchie Pooh<BR>Phantasmist of CoFE<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uyuegouwindwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yuegou Windwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 7:54:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: getting what's coming to you</span><hr size=1> You guys need to stay away from the touchy subjects like slavery and focus on the less confrontational things like religion. ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uprezto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prezto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 8:10:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: getting what's coming to you</span><hr size=1> Hey,<br><br>I know what slavery is....How do I get my cut...<br><br>-Prezto<br><br>Oppressed white guy<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uwayfarerwindwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wayfarer Windwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/27/02 8:22:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bestanimations.com/Animals/Mammals/Dogs/Wolves/Wolf-03.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: getting what's coming to you</span><hr size=1> <blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"You guys need to stay away from the touchy subjects like slavery and focus on the less confrontational things like religion."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Hmmm.....what about combining the two...<br><br>We could sue all women - and force them to pay reparations to all men - because Lilith and Eve screwed us all out of the whole Eden deal.<br><br>Give it some thought guys.
