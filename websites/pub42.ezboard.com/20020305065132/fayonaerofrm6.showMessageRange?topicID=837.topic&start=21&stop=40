Guys, when you think about how uncomfortable it might make you to have a man make a suggestion or a pass at you, consider that this is how some of us females feel every day of our lives , due to the fact that many guys seem to take this as a 'right', and will get downright ugly if the female in question makes it clear that she is not interested...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is why I am glad I'm a guy.

The same may not go for the &quot;N&quot; word used to discreminate african-americans, but the fact that so many younger people hear isomething about gay every day for everything cannot be ignored.  All it shows is a total lack of understanding, small vocabulary, and failure to accept life.  I'm sure sometimes comments will slip out &quot;Don't be gay&quot; or &quot;That's gay&quot; but its just an underlying beast in our heads that have a definition for this word, although it may not seem the same when it comes out in public channels or whatnot.  Again, I try not to use it on message boards or EQ, but in real life situations, I have to admit I am in fact a hypocrate.<br>
<br>
I was raised in an anti-black and anti-gay community.  It sounds bad and I now know it is, but I was able to form my own opinions young and decide that it is indeed wrong to discreminate against a minority.  People are people, and there will always be a black-white, gay-straight battle.  There are too many thickheaded people in the world that choose to not accept the fact we live on the same floating ball in space, and our time here is trivial.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I would explain more but I have to go pick up my vehicle.  I will check in later to see how this evolved.<br>
<br>
I would also like to state that this is a pretty good discussion..DISCUSSION <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I like it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukinorstoneblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinor Stoneblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/23/02 12:07:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=837.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~jcassidy41/biopic.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deviant, evolution, get over it?</span><hr size=1> Quickly to clarify <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I likened 'fag' to the 'N' word in that in general, if I, a straight white person, were to call someone  either of the two words, it would be much less socially acceptable than were Elton John/Chris Rock to do so, respectively.  Plus they're both derogatory (and bigoted, IMO) words.<br>
<br>
I think that gets the point across.  It's been a long day.<br>

<br>
Women are a lot touchier about this.  Some women in the community will call each other 'dyke' and use it as a term of affection, some really *don't* appreciate this as it reinforces the stereotype of gay women as 'masculine'.  And (rolls eyes) let's not even *get* into the whole 'gay woman' versus 'lesbian' thing... <br>
<br>
People in the game calling someone a 'fag' has always kind of amused me.  It makes me think that the speaker is a 13 year old who thinks somehow that this is something really *bad*, a whopper of an insult...  It's also, sadly, one of the first 'insults' that preteens seem to learn; I can remember being 12 years old, at a skating rink, and being called a 'fag' (last I checked, I was female) for doing a 'couple skate' with a mentally retarded female friend (she couldn't skate well and we had fun with my holding her hand around the ring).  it may be a rediculous insult, but it still has the power to hurt, and if I think people viewed 'faggot' in the same way they viewed 'nigger', and scratched it off their list of 'acceptable insults', we'd all be better off.<br>
<br>
I think that most commonly, however, when people say something or someone in the game is 'gay', however, they simply mean that it (the object, the remark, whatever) was 'weak', and I don't really see it in a perjorative sense, even if the use of the word 'gay' to describe something is well, kinda, gay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

j/k<br>
<br>
sorry had to say that!<br>
<br>
<br>
In all seriousness,  i too think society as a whole looks at gay as deviant.  <br>
<br>
I also think the majority of people that speak up on this thread will not have such a negative view of gay people.  So i think part of this thread will be biased.  Typically,  a person that shows their true negativity about or toward gays, get flamed themselves. So ironically some of them also keep their negative feelings &quot;in the closet&quot; as some gay people choose to do about their sexuality.<br>
<br>
i personally have no prejudice against a gay person.  I have no close friends that are gay, but i have plenty casual work friends that are gay.  I notice too often at work that someone will be friendly to a gay person to their face, but then when they are gone,, they seem to do nothing but become a gay bashur.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I do have one question myself though, that ive always wonder about.  I notice that some gays, get very offend when someone calls them a &quot;queer or fag&quot;.  this has always confused me.  i know the person is calling them this as an insult, but i wouldnt personally care if anyone called me a straight guy. Even if they meant it in the worst kind of way.  Even if they said that to me meaning im inferior to them or the rest of society.  So could someone broaden my horizons on this subject?  I have asked a couple of friends at work why they would be bothered by this, and they say its how the person is putting it or meaning it,  but i still dont get the insult. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhyddin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hyddin</A> at: 1/23/02 4:11:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uselwensoulgazer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Selwen Soulgazer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/23/02 4:39:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=837.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.deadman.crowfans.com/sadness.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deviant, evolution, get over it?</span><hr size=1> I had a gay friend in college who you could call just about anything under the sun and he would just smile at ya...except the word faggott.One day we were jokingly insulting each other and I called him one and he looked very hurt.I asked him why that one word above all others would hurt him(Ive called him everything from non-diposable dousche to dinky dunker,never with any malice,just as a joke).That was how I found out that faggott was a word origonally as a term for kindling wood and when they would burn witches at the stake they would sometimes use homosexuals to get the fire going <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
 Its amazing the power that we can give a single word.However we also can take that power away.A word cant hurt us unless we let it. <p>   <font color= ffoooo>Selwen SoulGazer</font >

<br>
On a more general note, do you 'choose' when you are going to be attracted to someone period?  Think carefully before you answer... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Or would the table be turned if you were that 1%, and the other 99% laughed at you while they called you an Idiot. Im a white male, and I can think of no way for anyone to call me Crakka, or whitey or anything that would bother me. But I can clearly see how a black male or female would take offence to being called the &quot;N&quot; word.<br>
 <br>
As far as my opinion on the term &quot;Gay&quot; being used the way it has been so much lately, I will just be glad when this trend of usage is over. I don't look down on the Children that use this term too badly, but at the same time I wish they would pick a new trendy phrase to use.<br>
<br>
As for Palimax saying that the majority of people think being Gay is deviant behavior, I think he is right, the majority of people do think this. But that doesn't mean they are correct in there opinions. Hell just look at who we have representing us in washington, and remember they were elected by a majority of people. I personally feel that those out there that are outraged by gay people, are either too lazy to try and understand gay people, or homophobic, or not smart enough to try and understand how or why anyone else on this planet doesnt think exactly like they themselves think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=837.topic&start=141&stop=158>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=837.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=837.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=837.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=837.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=837.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=837.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=837.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
