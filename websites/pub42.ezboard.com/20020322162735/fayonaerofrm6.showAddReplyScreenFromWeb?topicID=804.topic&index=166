<br>
You mean, owe him anything except the fair shake he got at the green scale, right?<br>
<br>
You're the only person who seems to think we're making any less of the warrior's contribution to the raid.  I'm just making it clear that, however helpful he was, his presense wasn't necessary -- nor for that matter, was mine, as I died pulling him (forgot to adjust clip-plane) and was left to rot on the ground while they killed him.<br>
<br>
You avoid any question asked of you where you don't like the answer.  You continue to harp on the most insignificant of things, pretending you have some insight into the situation, which you most assuredly, do not.<br>
<br>
Don't you get it?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EVERYONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who was at Serv this weekend walked away satisfied with the outcome.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EVERY LAST PERSON</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who was there got a fair shot at treasure - except Kinuvan, whom we kicked to the curb the second his resist song ended.<br>
<br>
The only reason the Serv killing even got mentioned at ALL was to demonstrate their are times that the person with the luckiest dice (Azeroth or Small) wasn't the person who'd get the loot.  The dice this time only determined if it was staying in-guild, or going to our guests.<br>
<br>
If in my posts I've inadvertantly made that warrior look bad, I'm sure he knows I respect him, or I would have NEVER given him a chance at the scale. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Nobody &quot;reminded&quot; our guest that he was only there &quot;by our leave&quot;. How-do-ya-do's were exchanged, buffs were cast and we went into battle together. Afterwards, he participated in a lottery for the spoils. A good time was had by all.<br>

Do you have multiple personalities or something??<br>
<br>
Maybe you should schedule a meeting with all your other personalities and come to one decision and save the rest of us the Head Ache of explaining the logic to 8 or 10 different Christ(Zero)'s.<br>

If you dont like other guild loot procedures dont go on raids with that guild and dont even THINK of joining a guild that doesnt have /rand as its only method for guild distribution.<br>

<br>
Where did you get the clam statement btw? Wasn't from one of my posts ) I said..oh screw it its like 3 posts up i am not sayin it again.<br>
<br>
I remain anonymous(somewhat) when i spout personal opinions, much as I am doing on this thread. I don't like bringing guild into it because a) well. they aren't part of it. and b) most of them don't give a rats ass about what i'm arguing over anyway most of the time. <br>
<br>
If you really were wondering who I was I do put my name down under posts sometimes, I just don't feel the need to end all my posts typing out my name, some silly quote, then guildname. God forbid I ever get some gaudy dorf-wearin-nothing-but-a-smile gif to tack on as a sig. <br>
<br>
I know most of you will appreciate that.<br>
<br>
Nope. Didn't get a shot at anything, didn't care to get a shot at anything, you mighta missed it up in all that, but i really don't give fig newtons for loot.<br>
<br>
I had fun, I hit things(well, slashed), I got to talk some (friendly)smack back and forth with a guy i know in the guild doing the raid. That classifies as a &quot;Good Day&quot; in my book. Only thing missing was training a guildie chanter.<br>
<br>
I don't know what went on at the raid, thats not the issue, his role(hence he himself) was belittled on these boards. I probably wouldn't have cared about that either, but it was in a post explaining how good x guild's policy was.<br>
<br>
I saw it, so I make a statement:<br>
<br>
If I helped you on a raid, and you belittled me, in tells or in an exceedingly public place(these boards), I wouldn't want to help you much anymore.<br>
<br>
I was told it was very unusual for a guild to even allow this respected nonguildie to fight such a mob. I gave an example from personal experience of the exact same nature to the contrary.<br>
<br>
I don't have a beef with vision, or its officers, or Palimax.<br>
<br>
I just called you on something you posted.<br>
<br>

&quot;I have no &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Biggi, for your information I have been playing EQ since beta 4 and this obviously is not my first character. I probably saw Vox and Nagafen before you even started playing the game&quot;<br>
<br>
I love contradictions, don't you?<br>
<br>
Shorty, I know alot of people from FD, and have a pretty good opinion of your guild, as well as most members of it i have come across. <br>
<br>
You however, have been on my list of people not to exp with since i first grouped with you.<br>
<br>
Thats about as close to a flame as you're gonna get, and a flame for a flame seems perfectly fair.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kaitan, this ISN'T about loot, stop bringing up loot forget about it. This is about saying in a pretty public place that x person helped kill something, then putting emphasis on the facts that they didn't need his help and they didn't owe him anything.<br>
<br>
Maybe you missed the part where i said you're right, he wasn't needed and he wasn't owed anything. Thats not the point of this at all. <br>
<br>
The point is its rude to point that fact out repeatedly to that person and everyone else that this was so. <br>
The closest I can see to someone at least acknowledging what I am saying is Lummus' post about the golden rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrist0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crist0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/02 12:04:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=179>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> Rofl pali, you gotta stop pullin stuff out your ass.<br>

<br>
I made the observation i've been making, if that had been me, you wouldn't get much help from me anymore after what to me is a pretty obvious belittling on this board.<br>
<br>
Then y'all jump down my throat about saying that.<br>
<br>
Then y'all called me dumb for thinking like that, and said &quot;that's the way it goes&quot;. <br>
<br>
I give an example that indeed, it isn't the way it has to go and then you flame me some more.<br>
<br>
Then I'm the loot whore(check kaitan's post).<br>
<br>
Whatever makes you happy, say it if you feel better.<br>
<br>
Then I got told i wasn't uber-leet and should go play my midlevel character(shorty)<br>
<br>
I say I'm not midlevel.<br>
<br>
You say prove it.<br>
<br>
I do.<br>
<br>
More random flamings.<br>
<br>
Then we end up with pali saying i should apologize to the warrior in question.<br>
<br>
Pretty much right?<br>
<br>
I'm not defending anyone, except my own view which you REALLY don't like to hear evidently. You did tell me to &quot;butt out&quot; after all.<br>
<br>
As you said, 4+ pages of attacking my character, my reputation, my guild(see velk/vulak post from pali), and of course my uberness.<br>
<br>
All because I said &quot;you know, if that'd been me i wouldn't help you much anymore&quot;.<br>

your first babbling bitch on this issue was about palimax saying, i said it was &quot;fair&quot; to let him loot on it.(how is that belittling someone?)<br>
this was not AFTER we killed sev,this was all BEFORE we even engauged sev.<br>
palimax told him to send a tell to me, to see if it was ok with me and the rest of the warriors in the guild ,if he could help KILL and get a SHOT at the green scale.<br>
i told him i didnt mind(based on the knoledge he sent a tell to us that sev was up), the other warriors  there didnt mind (though a couple were a bit leary about the prospects of losing on a rare as all hell  item that vision only ever got one of ,since epics went live,to someone outside the guild).<br>

1) I like Vision and didnt intend on all this garbage happening <br>
2) Was a simple point out<br>
3) *only bone to pick* Crydee YOU sir are retared, do some damn research and you will see which ranger in your guild is WEARING tolans leags right now, and has been, and he got them from a VS raid.  Now just bacuse you dont know about the lil 14 person thing, only proves my original example, it wasnt really a raid but he ALMOST got the legs taken away.  And part B of that, I am not attacking &quot;this mysterious ranger&quot; hes my fooking roomate and I just knew from 1st hand experiance is why I brought it up.  Vision IS a good guild and works well, I know that. BUT just beacuse someone doenst know about it, doesnt mean it doesnt happen, I KNOW of 2 seperate times where iwas directly told by my best friend of 20 years, who plays alot of eq with me since before most people even knew what everquest was.  And from what he told me &quot;I may be looking for a new guild soon, there is a meeting tommaro about the possible break up of vision&quot; at which point I offered to sponsor him into my guild i was in At the time.  <br>
        In summary, Crydee, you are just not smart, sorry man.  If you knew your guildmate who plays 12 hours a day and goes to almost all raids a lil better you whould see the big brown legs he wears.  And supprisingly just because you dont know of somethign doesnt mean it doesnt happen.<br>
     Palimax and others, I am sorry, I was supposed to just be posting a lil brain fart about how Blizz's shit should be his shit, I used the 1st example that poped in my head, and it blew up on a huge tangent.  I find it kinda funny though, most people dont listen to me till I threaten thier lifes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Hunter you know what im talking about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Anywho, this is just a huge post going on<br>

<br>
Who respects Palimax, raise your hands.<br>
<br>
Why Biggi has taken on the defense of a warrior who clearly had no problem with the arrangement or he would have posted himself for eight eye blurring pages is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Most of our raids in the Testing Halls or versus uber mob_01 are slow.  Why?  Cause way too much time is spent with people arguing for others in their class to take the item.  Gosh, we almost had to threaten Allamar with physical violence to accept almost any drop. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Same with Taygon etc.<br>
<br>
Honestly what two people I have never even heard of think of Vision really doesn't matter.  I am sure most people gave up reading 6 pages ago when they all read some anonymous guy attacking Palimax and Vision in a thread about Blizz.  Vision is very large by membership numbers and raid participation, we must be doing something right?  The guild isn't just run by Palimax, the class leaders and officers simply rock.  The guild has a direction they are going, and the members have bought into the (sorry for this) &quot;Vision&quot;.  If ya don't like it...heh who cares.<br>
<br>
BTW Blizz what the idiots think of you, don't worry about it.  I rather just have the respect of the intelligent, considerate and friendly members of the server.  And you could have kept the CoF <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you left because they are greedy etc, why listen to them?<br>

The meeting never happened.<br>
It wasn't scheduled to happen.<br>
Vision is not close to breaking up.<br>
Vision hasn't ever been close to breaking up.<br>
There is nothing to have a conversation about.<br>
<br>
Whoever told you that there was a meeting to discuss Vision breaking up was, without a doubt, 100%, completely, absolutely, wrong.<br>
<br>
