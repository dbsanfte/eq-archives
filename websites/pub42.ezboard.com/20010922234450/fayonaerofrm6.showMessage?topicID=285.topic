<br>
If a lore item drops should someone who already has the item roll on it?  <br>
<br>
Both times I saw this situation get nasty followed along the same lines - item drops, group rolls, winner tells someone else to loot it because they &quot;deserve&quot; it.  Someone else in the group complains because that must obviously mean that the highest roller already has one and can't loot it, and therefore it is &quot;understood&quot; that they are not allowed to roll.<br>
<br>
The first time this happened, the the fight got nasty because the highest roller didn't give it to the next highest roller, he gave it to someone in the group who actually needed it.  It could be argued that the winner either misread the rolls (the person he gave it to was 3rd highest), or actually thought it should go to someone who could use it as opposed to someone who would sell it.  The arguement went on for a half hour while the room respawned around us.  The casters were all threatening to gate out, the meleers were demanding an escort back to the zone, the 2nd highest roller was putting on a tremendous display of profanity while petitioning, and the person who looted the drop was screaming at the curse-happy petitioner for being a greedy bastard who couldn't stand the fact he lost the roll.  Through it all the high roller continued to swear he didn't already have one and thought the whole arguement was stupid.  The group ended up disbanding, and I doubt the petition ever got an answer, because no gm in their right mind would touch that arguement with a 10' pole.<br>
<br>
Round 2.  Item drops, everyone rolls, high roller passes it to the 2nd highest.  3rd highest inspects the winner, sees the item that just dropped, calls a reroll, and 4th highest backs him up.  (I still don't know why I end up dead last every time I roll on anything worth more than 100pp, but that's a different issue altogether <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  1st and 2nd argue, camp continues to spawn, group gets wiped out - fights through the entire CR, and the 2nd highest roller still walked away with the drop.  <br>
<br>
So then, is it supposed to be &quot;understood&quot; that someone can't roll on a duplicate lore?  Personally I see no reason why it should be a problem - it's no different than someone who can loot the item passing it on to someone else.  Is there some unspoken law spreading through the lands?  If the loot rules stated at the start of the group say ffa/roll on rare, and don't specify that people can't roll on duplicates, the gm is never going to order a reroll (despite the guy in the first example who insisted it was against Verant pnp to roll on an item you can't loot).<br>
<br>
If not for the fact that both events cost me endless wasted hours and some xp the second time around, I find the whole thing ridiculous.  What's the consensus on this one? <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig5.jpg align=center>

Personally I think need before greed is a great way to do anything. <br>
<br>
But, there are situations where it makes sense. Lets say we are talking about something everyone can use. Like a 10-slot weight-reducing bag (I made this up, aren't I clever ;P) Say the whole group has been there the same amount of time, one Mr. FunkWiz0rd already has one but rolls anyway. What good is it? just so he can play favourites and give it to his best friend in group? Kinda sarks!<br>
<br>
BUT lets say its a super Uber melee weapon. OK rangers, paladins, SKs, and warriors can all use. There's a ranger, a paladin, and a warrior in the group. Paladin has one, the others don't. We don't necessarilly know that they *need* the item. They might just go and sell it because they have better... But they don't have the item itself. Then maybe the paladin may roll on it? Sounds ok to me. Maybe. <br>
I don't know. I'm confusing myself....  =/<br>
<br>
But OK good example. Sarnak earring of station. No Drop item - so no use to someone who can't wear it. I'm a bard - can't wear it. But my brother is in the same group as me, and he can use it... may I roll so that if I win I can waive looting rights to him? Giving him twice the winning chance in the roll. Sounds kinda sucky to me. Not fair. Not everyone can bring their little bard friends along to help them win rolls <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway I think it would be ideal if only the people who plan on using an item would roll on an item. But I live in a world of lollipops and bubblegum happy kitty cat bubble rainbow fuzzy monkey sunshine... I think everyone should be nice ;p<br>

You all put in the same effort, you all deserve the same chance at a reward. If you have an item, I would even go so far as to say let a fdriend loot for you to sell later.<br>
<br>
I hate the whole need before greed thing. It assumes peeps are honest. First thing a dishonest person does is drop off lore item on a mule when going to Seb. Than they can roll on everything, they appear to need the item too. Like door locks.....Nb4G only keeps the honest people out.<br>
<br>
Also, my need for gear is the same for yours. This is not a socialist driven game. I can sell that RBG or whatever and buy something really sharp for my Shaman that he really &quot;needs&quot; ie. Lodzial Shield.<br>
<br>
Guild groups are different, they should always be decided on utility IMO. But in pick up groups.....I wouldno't know those people if I hit them with my car. Makes no difference to me what they need.<br>
<br>
Now before you get all &quot; you greedy cocksucker&quot; on me: I often don't roll on stuff that I already have or can't be bothered selling when I am in pick-up groups, and I have won stuff and given it to someone else in group. Just I don't think that I should have to, because (insert name here) says he &quot;needs&quot; it more than i do.<br>

Going into a camp without pre set rules will always give food for mishaps like these.<br>
<br>
You know that when you go into LGuk to camp Frenzy that the Casters in your group don't need it for 1 bit, but you can not deny them this item because you go play there without a healer unless ur a farmer boy you won't last long.<br>
<br>
Now you can only call for NBG between Guild (with us there is no lotto at all, I decide who receives an item by need, that's why all our members list their items so the decission can be made as easy as possible) in no way can you expect a non Guild member to say hey man you take that 10kpp item cause I don't need it and was only gonna sell it. It would be great if it went like this and all our Guild members are instructed to act like this unless they are not group leader, in that case they folow his set of rules.<br>
<br>
What also bothers me is that people die because of loot and its always the loot hungry people who totally waste a good group, waste some precious exp and usually waste your day of fun.<br>
<br>
So to never have this problem ever again in a pickup group, do as they already suggested here.. Open lotto all/all, no mistakes no discussion, he has the item already then tuff luck but if he wins he wins ..<br>
<br>
It may not sound fair but it will sure safe ya a lot of trouble and keep it a good exping day.<br>
<br>
(I personally feel that he who rolled on a duplicate was an ass for doing so, but that's just my personal opinion)<br>

<br>
For my part, example say... ES gaunts drop in KC ... I already have a pair, so I would be out of roll, well that's what I'd do...<br>
<br>
For items that can be used only by some classes, or 'logically' by some classes, I think it's up to the player's intelligence. I mean I've been in a group in TT for the Seb key (warrior 50 ranger 49 me druid 43 at that time I think, shaman 51 and 2 clerics 50 ++). We killed a named that drops a haste item (Noose whatever) . It is no drop . The clerics INSISTED on rolling for it, claiming they were still meleeing at that lvl . I objected. The shammy and Myself had from the beginning given up on the roll, having no use for that. Ranger warrior (neither having any haste item) clerics rolled, a cleric won. Then I called for a roll for myself. I won and told the warrior to loot it (my husband at that time), which I thought was fair. <br>
<br>
I think the same goes for tradeable items. You cant use, you dont roll. Exception made for items like FBSS or fungi I guess...<br>
<br>
But that would never go for pickup groups I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usortilegewolfsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sortilege Wolfsoul</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/18/01 1:18:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvalamarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valamarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/18/01 2:04:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rolling on Duplicate Lore</span><hr size=1> Not having a 50+ main like most on the server has, I ve been in plenty of groups where everyone rolls and the winner either lets me loot, or they loot and give to me.  <br>
<br>
I think this happens because looking at me you can tell I'm not a twink.  I have close to 200wis but at the expense of a lot of AC.  Some people like to be generous, who are we to say they cant give an item away if they want.  <br>
<br>
Need before greed only works with guilds or groups of friends.  I could care less if a twink with 5K in the bank is whining about not winning a roll on an item because the high roller gave away the loot.  I'm only worried about my poor level 39 cleric and looking at 300pp in the bank thinking, woohoo this item will really help me. <p>Belzac Fleshmender<BR>

I've been in groups where we had 1 person who wanted to do ALL/ALL random, and everyone else wanted to do NBG. In all cases the ALL/ALL random person was told that if he didn't like the loot rules, he could find another group. In one situation, the group leader booted a cleric out of a NBG group simply because the cleric wanted ALL/ALL random.<br>
<br>
In cases where an item drops and I have it, I stay out of the random.<br>
<br>
<br>
In cases where an item I can use drops but I think someone else needs it way more than I do, I'll let the group know ahead of time that if said item drops and I win it, I will give it to that other person.<br>
<br>
Though if there is an especially greedy type in the group. [ie Loots all corpses before they hit the floor and wants to random on stuff even after winning things.] I'll just loot the item myself without saying anything to the group and give it to that other person.<br>

If you join a group comprised of people who belong to the same COMMUNITY as you do, expect loot to be handled on more than a &quot;who did the most work in the last 10 minutes&quot; fashion.<br>

This had absolutely nothing to do with NB4G vs FFA, but people managed to drag all that bullshit into it yet again.  All I wanted to know was if the majority of people roll or pass on lore items they already have.<br>
<br>
I'm just curious tho, the people harping on about setting rules at the start of the group instead of answering the very simple question I asked- do you start a group by saying:<br>
<br>
FFA/ all roll on all unless it's a lore item you already have unless you have a friend in group and want to roll to give them an extra chance, first 3 gems to the cleric excluding black sapphs, diamonds, and bd's, in the event of a linkdeath during the roll all players will /log the rolls unless 3 or more go ld at which time we will wait for the group to return in full to random and &lt;so and so&gt; will be designated looter of any valuable droppable items if this happens, if a no drop falls and this happens we will go with the rolls of those left who can use it, unless the mob is 55+ and will not time out before the ld's can return spells go to the class who needs if nobody needs it will be rolled on but will not count against your rolling on large loot which btw you aren't allowed to roll on more than one unless you want to give up the item you already won to be rolled on by the other members of the group assuming anyone actually wants it.<br>
<br>
I guess you must keep it hotkeyed to save time... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukinid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/21/01 4:18:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rolling on Duplicate Lore</span><hr size=1> Pick up groups : Almost every group I'm in everyone rolls, even on class specific armor drops.  I'm a ranger and a tolans Bracer drops everyone in the group has the right to roll even if they aren't a ranger because of the trade value of the item for something they can use.  In the case of Lore items it's almost an unwritten rule not to roll on a lore item you already have.  Although playing Devil's advocate I really must question this rule.  example.. I have a RBG I'm in a pick up group in seb and an RBG drops should I roll ? well most would say no(and personally I wouldn't) but why?  just the fact that I am wearing my RBG and didn't dump it on a mule prior to coming to seb in the off chance of getting another helps the group by me actually using this item to the groups benefit.  now if I was dishonest and dumped it on a mule and used an fbss I would get to roll on the item I contributed to getting as much as any other group member.  Now you can surely bet that any cleric or other class that wouldn't wear an RBG which wins one.  First thing would dump that item on an alt so as not to be excluded from future drops.  So why should the mellee who wear the item be excluded. the value of such an item is the same to everyone involved due to the fact that at least 40% of peoples items are typically traded for.  By the same token you cant exclude a caster from melee loot especially in seb just for the fact that there is almost no caster loot in that dung.  This may be an extreme view, and is never and will never be practiced (nor do I care)but imho it is the only truly fair way to do things in a pickup group.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udyschord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dyschord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/22/01 9:06:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rolling on Duplicate Lore</span><hr size=1> I found a simple solution that seems to work for me...<br>

<br>
personally, if i already have an item that drops and it's a minor one, i won't lotto for it. why? i already have it, probably don't need a second one, and i can't pick it up.<br>
<br>
if it's an expensive item i would probably roll for it and ask someone else to pick it up for me, because i distributed as much to the group and camp as everyone else in the group and shouldn't be out of the lotto for it just because i have one on me. it's mainly theory though, this hasn't happened to me yet (or the item wasn't expensive enough to be worth the trouble). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=292.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessage?topicID=277.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=285.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=285.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying<option value="ayonaerofrm11">Fight the Plague!<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
