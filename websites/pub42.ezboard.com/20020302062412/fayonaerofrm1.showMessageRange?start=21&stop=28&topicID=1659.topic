Mage epic pet does not need an upgrade.<br>
<br>
Why? Regardless, of what any magician says.  It is still the most powerful pet in the game. Period.  In game, if you take a look at the damage comparisons between the 59 necromancer pet and any mage pet you'll see that there is in fact a considerable difference in damage, (with or without damage-shields/augmentation of death).<br>
<br>
As far as damage avioidance is concerned.  Giving root/mez/charm to a magician completely negates their role entirely.  There is a reason for that. <br>
<br>
To Livinth:  At the moment..Dire Charm isn't work as it is intended. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I sat in Arena with someone with Dire charm for an extended period of time... yes he could solo there if he wanted, trust me.  Why would I want them to nerf something that works well, because Im pissed about my class?  Thats kinda lame don't you think?  I mean he HAD to do some work to get the skill right?  So why decide to screw him for working hard to get it?<br>
   <br>
   About mage epic being bagged... uhm well the nice thing about our epic is you don't have to have the thing in your hand to get the effect... Just summon your pet and destroy your summoned skittle stick if you want.  So you have something better to use, summon pet, skittle stick destroy, gtg.  I don't quite understand how you could EVER find something to make you bag that, being as the lvl 60 water pet is not like an epic pet and that is the effect on epic.  Sure you may not have the thing equipped but we don't need it equipped. <br>
   <br>
   About nukes, yes we are second best nuking power, problem with it is, the master of elements, shouldn't we at least be able to use all elements?  Not just fire and magic... I mean maybe a DS like our fire line that uses cold instead and adds to cold resist, and a cold nuke or two.  BTW, something I enjoy from luclin... the summoned elemental blankets and defenders.  If your with a raid party that isn't exactly perfect on resists and have a mage along, you can get summoned resists. Now those are decent, and can be used everywhere.     <br>
   <br>
   I just get tired of seeing everyone thinking every mage is just whining up a river about there class, don't you think if it bugged me enough I would have quit my class long ago... I like Deke and deal with shit as it works out... Doesnt mean I am not allowed to express a wish along with others for a change, right?  I know mages are not the only ones to get the shaft, I agree MANY classes still need improvements for a perfectly "class-balanced" world. <br>
   <br>
   IMO whoever the guy was that was doing the questioning (my apologies if your on this server) was looking for something to start shit with and got the answers he was looking for.  If you approach someone picking a fight and don't expect them to try and discourage you, your a fool.<br>
   <br>
   Class balancing sucks, deal or start over.<br>

Why?  They don't spend combat rounds casting highly resistable 100dmg nukes or roots, they PROC their lifetap once in awhile instead.  The main thing that makes mage pets superior is that they can actually tank for a bit if they have too. Necro pets get beaten down mighty fast if they have to tank.  Problem is, except in a solo situation pets no longer CAN tank since they have NO aggro if there is a single PC within combat range.<br>
<br>
  As for upgrading the Epic pet, I agree it isn't necessary--and isn't where Verant should give mages more power, if any. IMHO classes should be balanced based upon their NATURAL abilities, not by whatever extra perks they get from their Epic.  Most mages will never get their epic, as it is far beyond a Rangebringer in terms of difficulty, and it doesn't exactly incite guild motivation and collaboration like the Cleric epic does. An epic pet won't help much in NToV from what I understand, but cleric noodles and ragebringers' sure will.<br>
<br>
  As for mages not getting snare, root, charm, mez, fear etc because it's never been &quot;what the class is about&quot;, I'm afraid the &quot;vision&quot; of class definition has been warped so much since the days of EQ's release it's not even funny.  Rogues, upon release, were never intended to be the ultimate damage dealing class--but since Verant could never really make disarm traps and picklock a skill of any great value, the &quot;Vision&quot; warped so that they would be &quot;assassins&quot; instead. I agree that mez, fear, charm are NOT what the mage is about.  But can you think of any uber ability a mage has in the age of Luclin that he should be penalized to the extent of not being able to handle a mob 25 levels lower if he/she doesnt have a pet out? How about a single add while soloing?  If you had asked me at lvl 50 pre-kunark, I would have laughed at the need of any damage mitigating/escape spells-- my damage output could not be matched by anyone, and I saw the lack of root to be a fair trade-off.  Now at 59 with mobs quadding for 150+, and a mages damage ability being middle of the road, yeah I'd like the equivalent to the lvl 1 druid root spell.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents<br>

Like Deke says the class balancing sucks bad in the game and is only getting further apart...I also think people missed the point on the Mage epic. Its extremely difficult to get and most guilds wont put the effort into getting a mage his epic. I would like to see epic quests be a little more balanced..why does one class need so many trips to a plain in hopes they will get a random epic piece while others get static spawns and camps that can easily be done with a few groups and maybe need a guild raid for the &quot;final epic&quot; battle.<br>
<br>
Nerfing Dire Charm would be silly. It takes a hell of a lot time and energy to even get the skill. /pet hold here is BS and should just be implemeted into any pet playing class from lvl 1..we are after all master of pets!<br>

<br>
The same argument could (and should) be made for the AA skill for illusions lasting through zoning.  It's an inate ability that should start working after a certain level.  Probably around 20 when Enchanters get their last pre-Luclin racial illusions.  Necro at level 24 or 29.  Rogues and Bards at 45/49. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &ltFinal Destiny&gt</B></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Post-o-holic</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/1/02 6:26:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1659.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Love for Mages...NOT</span><hr size=1> 'Still quite powerful in grinding zones.

<br>
- Yes, but do you realize that when an enchanter actually gets this skill (can you say endless AA grinding, and needing to be 59).. then there won't be any need for them to be hanging around in seb? It will be a long time before more than little will get this skill, and I doubt when they're at the stage that they do get it, they'll want to hang around in zones with sub 50 mobs in. It doesn't remotely effect epic encounters, and yes perhaps groups, but like I said you won't see many enchanters in groups exp grinding with this, if at all. <br>
People often just think unfair when they hear 'perma charmed pet', well what about the VP stick with right click 49 charm? <br>
Hell, I can hold a pet for all day, with a lvl54 cap, with the least bit of work - and a lot more fun. And in some cases, if I ever get Dire Charm, I could see myself using it half and half.  <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>
