I worked in a cytogenetic lab for a summer. I've helped autopsy aborted fetuses. Let me tell you that while you can make the argument that it is best to abort for the sanity of the mother and the wellbeing of the family etc, the fetuses being aborted in cases where genetic anomalies are the problem (e.g. fragile x, downs, etc) are not balls of anything but fully formed miniature human beings with 10 fingers and 10 toes, eyes, noses, arms, and legs. A normal pregnancy is 40 weeks. Tests are usually done (in my limited experience) from around week 8 up to around week 20. Most typical is probably around 10-12 from what I saw. These are first trimester fetuses and are not balls of anything.<br>
<br>
You are entirely entitled to your opinion, but I felt it should be based on fact rather than fiction.<br>

<br>
As for abortions, I'm not for it nor against it. I think that in some cases it's needed, but in most not. Since it really seems to be used as a easy way out these days, and abortion is not like a condom or taking the pill but it's treated about the same way now days.<br>
<br>
You know the first thing they ask you if you show up at the school nurse/hospital and you're under 20 and they realize you're pregnant is? "So, you're gonna have an abortion right?" if you answer no to that question you'll get the "You sure you don't wanna have an abortion, you really should think about it". With it being phrased that way, atleast in the lil' town where I live, I can't blame girls for getting abortions everyone will tell you it's the easy way out.<br>
<br>
Now back to the real topic, most of these people don't realize that there's something wrong with them (bare in mind that those I work with are from the age 30 - 65, they all have homes of their own and they all work, I talk about her as a girl since it's how I see her =/ ), or rather they don't quite understand what's wrong with them. None of them has been abandoned by their parents, their apartments and the care they get are payed by the state and the families. <br>
<br>
They live rather good lives from a "normal" standpoint, but it's that one girl that really twists my world.. she's so aware of the fact that she's not normal, she has the same education that most Swedes do she has a clear and bright mind, but she can't do jackshit with it since certain parts of her brain wont let her.<br>
<br>
Most of them get stuck mentally at the age of like.. 12-15 they talk about the same things that you talked about when you were that age, to see a 63 year old woman talk like a 12 year old hurts ME to see. Don't get me wrong, I'm giving them the absolute best care I can, but it's hurting me to do it.. it's like isn't there something that could be done for them.. well you get my point.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How do you feel about it now?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Abortion is final. Whether you choose to acknowledge a fetus as a living person in development, or a ball of tissue that will after time become a living person, you can not deny the fact that things left to mother nature it will one day become a living breathing human being.<br>
<br>
Yes there are cases when women have abortions just because of the fact the baby will not fully gestate for various reasons but that doesnt seem to be the topic here.<br>
<br>
I am personally against abortion, just for the sake of birth adnormalities and just about any other reason except under extreme circumstances. For very simple reasons. One of them:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You never know what will happen tommorow.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I can list an endless supply of &quot;what if's&quot;, and can show several examples of disabled ( from birth defects) people thru out history who have literally changed the world. When you make such a final descission you have destroyed any possible future for the unborn child, yourself and the world around you both.<br>
<br>
How someone can completely shutout any possible positive future, just over fears of a negative one are beyond my comprehension. I will never understand that mode of thinking. I look upon most that imploy it as either cowards who know better but still do it, or someone so lost and confused all they need is a little help to see the possible positive future.<br>

It all boils down to: <br>

It's perfectly ok to bring a child up in the world, regardless whether that child is *normal* or has a birth defect, fully knowing that in either circumstances the mother doesn't wish, want, have the emotional strength, financial means, or even for that matter maturity to bring that child up in a loving enviromnment.<br>
<br>
No wonder so many kids these days are so fucked up.<br>
<br>
Abortion is a way better option than an unloved child.  The quality of life is what is the most important - and a *normal child* isn't going to get that without knowing that he/she is loved.<br>
<br>
So, carry on yer pointless debate about killing and murdering.  An unwanted child is already emotionally dead.  Period.<br>

This scenario gets played out daily by umpteen twits and they keep the child for whatever godforsaken reason.  Where is the quality of life for that poor wee one?<br>
<br>
A couple knows by tests that their child will be born with major birth defects, and will have a very short time to live (2-5 years).  They, or adoptive parents should be subjected to the pain of losing that child?  As well, the child will be subjected to intensive hospital stays for his / her entire life.<br>
Where is the quality of life for the child in an antiseptic environenment where he/ she may get held for maybe 2 hours a day tops?  Where is the quality of life for the poor parents?<br>
<br>
A woman due to religious beliefs cannot use birth control, and gets pregnant year after year, until her body wears out and she simply dies in childbirth.  Where is the quality of life for that woman ?   Your argument values the life of a fetus over hers?<br>
<br>
Where is the quality of life for the unborn you so champion?<br>
<br>
Life is precious yes.  But at the cost of the child's contentment / happiness / emotional well being?  In other words - What Life?<br>
<br>
Lets reverse it entirely.  Okies, you are as an adult afflicted with either the diseases of old age, or have an incurable disease (pick one there's a zillion),  which make your life miserable, horrible and unbearable, or were in an accident which made you a brain dead vegetable.  You wish to live this way ?  How is life precious when everything that makes you enjoy life - are gone?<br>
<br>
Quality of life must be greater than the almighty *life is life* arguement.<br>

Nothing is black and white - the world must be seen as a zillion shades of grey.  <br>
<br>
As a firm believer in abortion being evil, picture yourself and your mate finding out you're about to have a child, yet, if the woman carries that child to term and gives birth her chances of surviving are about 10%.<br>
<br>
Why is her life worth less than the child?  Her life is equally precious, and her death as a person who has lived for a few decades will affect WAY more people in a negative way, than the death of an unborn, unknown child.  The pain cannot be compared.<br>
<br>
What's adoption gonna do to solve that problem?  Who will adopt the grieving father, the couple's family and friends?<br>
