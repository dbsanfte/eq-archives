<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Christ Kills Two, Injures Seven In Abortion- Clinic Attack</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
HUNTSVILLE, AL—Jesus Christ, son of God and noted pro-life activist, killed two and critically wounded seven others when He opened fire in the waiting room of a Huntsville abortion clinic Tuesday. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3417/christ.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->    <br>
Above: A U.S. Marshal leads Christ to a holding cell. Inset: One of the injured is loaded into an ambulance.  <br>
<br>
      Security guards at the Women's Medical Clinic of Huntsville were able to disarm the Messiah before He could reload His weapon, a secondhand Glock 9mm pistol that authorities said He purchased legally at a Jackson, MS, sporting-goods store. <br>
<br>
      &quot;Abortion is a sin,&quot; said Christ as He was led away in handcuffs. &quot;It is an abomination in the eyes of Me.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Witnesses said the attack, which took the lives of Dr. Nelson Woodring, 51, and clinic nurse Danielle Costa, 29, came from &quot;out of nowhere.&quot; <br>
<br>
      &quot;He walked up to the admissions desk and asked if He could see Dr. Woodring,&quot; receptionist Iris Reid said. &quot;The next thing I knew, He was shouting Biblical verses and opening fire on everything moving.&quot; <br>
<br>
      &quot;It was horrible,&quot; said injured clinic nurse Jessica Combs, recovering at a local hospital with bullet wounds to the leg and abdomen. &quot;He put his hands over Dr. Woodring's head and told him He forgave him for his sins, and then He shot him right in the face.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Huntsville police officials are not certain how the Messiah was able to bypass clinic guards and proceed undetected past security cameras and into the clinic waiting room, where He produced the gun from its hiding place in the folds of His robe. Federal investigators are similarly baffled, saying that the heavily armed Christ had moved in &quot;mysterious ways.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Speaking to reporters from His holding cell, Christ, 33, said He had &quot;no regrets&quot; about what He had done. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3417/christatrally.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->    <br>
Above: Christ (second from right) leads pro-life demonstrators at a 1995 rally in Washington, D.C.  <br>
<br>
      &quot;As I said in John 16:21, every life is precious,&quot; Christ said. &quot;This means every life, not just those who have already been born. My father, the Lord, feels the same way I do. In Jeremiah 1:5, He said unto the prophet Jeremiah, 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.' The unborn fetus is a sacred, living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Added Christ: &quot;What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so. After all, it wasn't even her decision to conceive me in the first place. But in the end, she made the right decision, bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior. Blessed is she among women.&quot; <br>
<br>
      According to legal experts, if convicted, Christ could face the death penalty. <br>
<br>
      &quot;The state of Alabama has the death penalty, and this crime is certainly the sort that would be construed as a capital offense,&quot; University of Michigan law professor Arthur Lipscomb said. &quot;With the right judge and jury, Christ could very well be put to death yet again.&quot; In such a case, Lipscomb said, Alabama would likely use lethal injection rather than crucifixion. <br>
<br>
      Christ said He is unafraid of the prospect of execution. &quot;Those who know me know that I am willing to die for the sins of others, whether those sins be avarice, slothfulness, false idolatry or the butchering of unborn life,&quot; Christ said. &quot;The bottom line is, abortion stops a beating heart.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Tuesday's shooting is not Christ's first brush with the law. On April 8, 29, He was arrested in the Roman province of Judea for alleged false claims to the throne of the Kingdom of Israel. On Jan. 11, 1996, He and six other pro-life activists were jailed for blocking the entrance to a Cheektowaga, NY, abortion clinic. In October 1997, He was arrested for plotting to mail anthrax-laced packages to two dozen abortion doctors across the U.S. <br>
<br>
      &quot;Abortion is an abomination. It is a sin. It is murder,&quot; Christ said. &quot;I only did what any good Christian would have done.&quot; <br>
<br>
      Christ's followers have been overwhelmingly supportive of their leader. <br>
<br>
      &quot;As it says in Psalm 139:13-16, 'For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother's womb. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body,'&quot; said Ralph Anson of the Houston-based Every Life Is Precious. &quot;Those people at that clinic were killers, and they deserved to die.&quot; <br>
<br>
      &quot;We may not understand everything He does, but we must believe it is for the best,&quot; said Rev. Joseph Abernathy, minister at First United Baptist Church of Huntsville. &quot;As Christians, it is not our duty to question what our Savior does. We can only live according to His example.&quot;<br>

If your intended audience does not subscribe to the tenets of that particular faith, the whole if...then thing kind of falls apart.<br>
<br>
Think about it for a second.  If someone does not have a belief in 'sin' (transgression against some supreme entity or it's 'laws') because they do not believe such an entity exists, then it is kind of pointless to argue whether something is or is not a 'sin', isn't it?  It becomes a nonsequitur.  But, to be fair, can you state your argument without invoking religious faith or the word 'believe'?  If so, I would like to hear it.<br>

And it's pointless, in any case, to argue whether something like homosexuality is 'perverse', anyway.<br>
The very question is leading in nature, and people's responses to it are going to be emotionally, not rationally, based.<br>
<br>
I for one could not care less what other people think about my own or anyone else's sexual orientation, save where it becomes a human/legal rights issue.  *People* (regardless of their sexual, religious, or ethnic orientation, as well as their race, gender, or ability) should have the right to the same legal protections, of fair housing, employment, freedom from harassment, and the freedom to choose their families and designate their heirs.  (In case anyone is wondering, this last statement also means that I personally support the rights of the tens of thousands of religious polygamists in southern Utah and northern Arizona to their plural marriages, provided all parties are of the age of consent). <br>
<br>
If you want to say that you *believe* that homosexuality is a 'sin', that is your right.  If you decide to act on your beliefs and petition your government to legislate that equal rights are *not* granted to homosexuals, then that is also your right.  But to those who travel that path, just remember that your right to swing your fist ends where my face begins... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

And to the rediculous example involving an animal: Animals cannot give consent, which is part of the reason we have animal cruelty laws.  A sexual act involving two consenting adults, and one involving *any* party who cannot give consent (including minors, and the incapacitated) are two completely different things...<br>

- You couldn't be more wrong. You could try, but you would not succeed. Sexual intercourses main goal is not to reproduce. Sure, it's a function, but it's not the only function. A lot, LOT, more people choose to remain single or childless today than ever before. It's an increasing state of living, especially with females - yet they still have sex. And even so, why would there be something 'wrong' because they choose to do what they want? I can't see something more right about it! What would you rather have, people walking around, pretending to be what you want them to be, or people living their lives, true to themselves? I know what I preffer.<br>
And practicing? When I have sex, I'm not thinking 'This is great practice for having a kid', I'm more thinking 'Who's the man?'. Now get over it.. because there's NOTHING unnatural about living how you want.<br>
You want to know what's unnatural? What's sick and disturbing? People who live how others want them to live. I could not think of anything more sadder.<br>
I know when I die, I want to beable to say 'Yep, I did it how I wanted,' not 'I lied to myself, never did what I want, but hell! Other people thought it was right!'. <p>Halo 57th Beguiler<br>

Have you ever stopped to think that your brain has been wired over the milennia to equate saying &quot;who is the man&quot; to yourself with practicing? Or if not practicing at least fooling yourself into thinking maybe I can make a child.<br>

We've left the realm of thinking here, Halo. It's biology and it's a lot harder to break away from than you might want to believe. I'd even go so far as to offer that homosexual urges originate with the very same urges that lead people to want to procreate. You could go so far as to say that homosexuality, in particular male homosexuality is the urge to procreate gone too far. It's fairly well established that the gate-keeper effect of women on sexual frequency is negated when considering men. Not 100% negated but it's there. Now if the biological urge is the act of sex and not a cognitive process of performing sex where the person actively acknowledges the likelihood of conception occurring, then it's not all surprising that we should see the sex drive alive and well if not more pervasive than ever in both the homosexual and heterosexual communities. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36323">Caean Sacroguerre, Knight of Tunare</a>
