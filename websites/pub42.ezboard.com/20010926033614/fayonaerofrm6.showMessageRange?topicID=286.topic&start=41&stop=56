I agree.  Keyword <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> epic</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Make a separate spawnable Quillmane that is level 60, AEs stuns, with 200k hitpoints, now that would be fun, and he should always drop his item.    Same with the Magi...<br>

<br>
For example the Shadow Knight epic most rare drop is the Decrepid Hide from POH.  This one drops approximately 1/100 Ashenbone Drakes.  With 6 or 8 Ashenbones per 12 hours its a long haul trying to get this item.  Each class should have something similar where you have a bottle neck item to get.  The Epic quest difficulty doesnt seem to be equal difficulty for all.<br>
<br>
I believe that "Epic" quests should be hard otherwise everyone would own one and what fun would there be in that.<br>
<br>
However it does get frustrating when you have several bottle necks in your quest... and others do not. (vent) <br>

<br>
What they should be is EPIC, mobs should require at least 1 and preferably 3 or 4 lvl 70 encounters, with 200k hp and hard hitters. They should require large attendance, they should require skill and dedication to get and most importantly the reward should be EPIC, none of this <br>
MrWarrior_01 &quot;hmm I have my epic but I think I'll use blahblah as it taunts more and thats my job&quot;<br>
MrRogue_01 &quot;hmm I have my epic but so does every other 50+ rogue on every server everywhere, and this priceless/primal outdamages it&quot;<br>
MrRanger&quot;my offhand epic is amazing but this mainhand one sucks in anything other than exp groups as the proc gets me killed too fast and I'll use my [insert other weapon here] instead&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Sure people will moan, the ones in smaller guilds maybe, but not everyone should have the epics and you can always make an alliance with another guild to get yourself the epics, that was the intention from the start, EPIC in my eyes is a large, tough battle not a long ass sitting about on my ass camp. Plus ALL epics should require ALL pieces to be combined in a no drop container and ALL the pieces should be no drop too, buying parts for epics is lame and just detracts from the entire epic thing.<br>
<br>
The ranger epic is a good example, and the one I'm most up to date with. This thing is pathetically easy to get. Guild doesn't want to do PoA? mq it as loads drop and someone gonna have one in bank, guild can't kill VS? easy just pay to mq it, or take on the watered down, pussy version aka venrils remains. The hardest part of Ranger epic is Hole, and even that can be done with 1 good group, the time consuming part is the 4 forages and there is nothing in the least bit epic abot sitting in 4 different newbie zones with anon on to avoid beggars clicking forage every time it refreshes for up to 10+ hours per item. There is nothing epic about making us run between surefall glade and kunark, its just an excercise in boredom or paying some lootwhore dr00d to port you for 100pp.<br>
<br>
Mainly anyone complaining about epics being too easy should be shot, they should be harder, and all of them just as hard, the only things about epics that do require moaning about are stupid spawn like rage, and the pegasus, decrepid hide and stupidly rare drops like that, nothing at all epic about them. <p><A HREF="http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=9924" TARGET=_blank>Kalaar Kururuc</A> <BR>

<br>
Actually, I've only had once &quot;epic proc death&quot; in the entire time I had epics [since March of this year] and it was my own fault too. I knew I was fighting mobs that were 100% magic resistant, but neglected to swap out some gear that was boosting my dex a lot. On top of that, I had a dex buff on. What happens? Eartcaller does a bunch of back to back times on one of the mobs. Naturally they all get resisted. Resisted procs taunt more than non-resisted ones, so naturally the mob beats the crap out of me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> guild can't kill VS? easy just pay to mq it, or take on the watered down, pussy version aka venrils remains.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, you're a bit off here. Full strength Venril Sathir hasn't droped the Pulsing Green Stone [for the epic] for months now. If you want the epic drop, you have to use the &quot;watered down, pussy version&quot; that is triggered through Venril Sathirs remains. This was done because of the massive amounts of complaints that were occuring based of the fact that paticular guilds would claim ownership of VS and sell off the epic drop to the highest bidder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The hardest part of Ranger epic is Hole<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree here also. The hard part is the Shattered Emerald of Corruption from the Plane of Hate. The bottleneck on this item is hudge. First you have to convince your guild to go there and secondly you have to play the planar lottery and hope it drops. It used to be a guaranteed drop off Innorrurk. However, killing the upgraded version won't guarantee that you get one. You can kill every mini-boss and Innorruuk in the same clearing and still not get one.<br>

I said the hole was hardest for a reason, stone from hate is NOT hard to get it's just potentially time consuming, one of the things I said isn't epic, the hole is full of shit pathing and if you don't know what you're doing its a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
VS, he was changed because some people were not getting a chance at him for the epic pieces, and tbh some of the guild who were crying about not getting their shot at him couldn't take him down anyway, the watered down version IS a pussy and he shouldn't be, he should be at least as hard as normal VS, but just drop epic items. Why was he made easier?<br>
<br>
As far as the epic taunt, how many times have you tried CT version 2? Sontalak? Tormax? etc etc, I don't mean to sound condescending (sp?) but the epics are supposed to be EPIC, in other words I should NOT have to swap it out for some mobs, I always have 230+ dex at raids (except when wearing resist gear) so it's always proccing lots and takes me right towards the top of the shit list.  <p><A HREF="http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=9924" TARGET=_blank>Kalaar Kururuc</A> <BR>

Other than bard, they are not that Epic at all. Rogues, Rangers, Paladins, and SK's can all get better weapons than their epics. Granted most are not gonna clear North wing ToV any time soon and many are not getting into ST real soon. But that still exists. Although ranger Slow epic blade is awesome. Warrior epic is laughable really if you consider HOW many weapons for warriors are just flat better.<br>
<br>
Bard Weapon is the only melee weapon that is truly epic IMO. The affect it has on songs is irreplacable.<br>
<br>
I am not sure I agree everyone should have 3 or 4 UberAssBeat mobs, but atleast one. <br>
<br>
Also keep in mind this came out before SoL so I think you have to exclude that part from the equation. It has been my feeling that every class should have had a piece come from each of the 3 planes, &lt;prior to sol I know there are 5 now&gt; a piece from an outdoor dragon and piece from an indoor Boss mob (Trak, VS, King Queen or Prince in Chardok)<br>
<br>
Then all should have had some minor questing that resembles collecting information.<br>
<br>
Now if you really wanted it to be epic I guess you could have asked for EVERY class to have 1 item drop inside VP. Oh well.<br>
<br>
But I do believe have bottlenecks are stupid, Quillamaine is still a bigger pain in the nuts that Rage any day. Rogue, Shaman and Monk epics are TOO damn easy. Might as well just have em drop in sebilis. Druid and Ranger are a bit easy but not like the first one mentioned. Also not everyone is entitled to an Epic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feeling better yet yasp? Anyway if I come across a quillimaine robe yasp I will multi it for free bro. <p>Cuthbert Dirgewielder

The only thing &quot;hard&quot; about The Hole part is getting there. The fight is very lackluster.<br>

<br>
My point was more of you really have no choice as to which version you fight. Want the leg armour? Great - fight the normal one. Want the epic drop? You MUST fight the spawned version.<br>
Moving the epic drop to a spawned version was a good thing, but I do agree with you that the spawned Venril Sathir should be just as hard as the normal version.<br>

Warrior Epic-Queens blade was made much more common<br>
Ranger Epic-Spawned version of VS<br>
Rogue Epic-Changing robe drops<br>
Wizard-Broken golem carries cazic skin 100% planar drop<br>

Im sure there are other examples for all the other epics as well, the only change made so far in mage epic... was changing earth staff to a random 3 day spawn... and the drop is still rare..<br>

<br>
Paladin and Shadowknights, your Epics don't exactly suck but Risk doesn't equal Reward. They are cursed with tedium in the course of obtaining the items.<br>
<br>
Warrior Epic. If your guild and yourself can obtain this, plan on getting something better within weeks. This Epic really sucks you in as well. Silly easy to begin but very hard to finish due to the green scale bottleneck (If you are in Europe its easy though) Too bad after all that, it is going to rot in the bank along with your Indo armor. Swiftblade of Zek and any Primal Velium Weapon will put the Jagged Blade of War to shame and out to bank vault, dust collecting pasture.<br>
<br>
<br>
The 3 turds could all be made worth it by adding the Haste component that the other Epics either grant permantly or though Effects. Heck, even if they just PROCed what the ranger epic haste for Haste full time that would be an improvement. I sometimes wonder if VI really wants people to play these 3 classes that wield these items. It just proves the old cliche: All is not fair in Love and War, is still quite valid.<br>
