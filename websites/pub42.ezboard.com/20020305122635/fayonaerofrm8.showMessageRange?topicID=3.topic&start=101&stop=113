first of all i like to target the ones comparing sebilis with a plane do we claim seb? NO but... is the spawntie in seb 10h or more? NO..<br>
thats that...<br>
<br>
if u skim the top layer of these posts u will soon find out that it is the top notch guilds that cry loudest for FFA for planes but rotation on Trak..<br>
reason...<br>
these guild are strong enough to do Trak they will never meet any competition in the planes they can and will take what they want...<br>
have u guys been to a plane recently? go there and check it out when a major guild is there..<br>
seen on this thread many times is &quot;we will share all unvanted loot&quot; BS when they brought their 55plus chars they also brought the twink alts... nietly logged at the side....<br>
<br>
<br>
lets drop the Ubers for a bit then...<br>
the smaller or should we call them not as big as the biggest guilds will also have a problem since planes armor isnt very common nowadays NOT because its bad but because its not something u can get..<br>
there are plenty of 60 war out there that still has a treeweave cause its the best they can get, while some farm it for twinks. /rude<br>
<br>
ok back to the so called ubers...<br>
Why do they go to the planes if they already have better things? well Epic bullshit quests (thanx alot verant u screwed that up)<br>
and while they are there why not farm for the alts we have to clear it anyway...<br>
and the fact that IF the &quot;not so big as the biggest&quot; guilds get stuff  weeee then they will also become stronger and might even someday compete!!!!!<br>
wow do u think the &quot;ubers&quot; want competition more than now? no they dont and what better way is there to eliminate the risk of that happening than to prevent the next step down on the ladder called uber from gettin any stuff...<br>
<br>
Dragons.<br>
Rotation on Trak but not on vox/naggy ????? hey the guilds that can do Trak cant do Vox/naggy or....<br>
well guess why they made those twink alts and gave them all that planes armor...<br>
the dragons counterpart in Kunark is to hard for their taste and trust me tougher mobs takes more skill/time/power so why do it that way when there is a shortcut..<br>
<br>
i came from Sol ro and the raidboard sucked royal (back end of a famus monkey) and lets not do anything like that..<br>
<br>
BUT something has to be done or this will be exactly like it is now which is Good as hell for the strongest and bad as hell for the weaker...<br>
the yes to shcedule or FFA really is irrelevant this problem will stay unless radical changes are made..<br>
and its only Verants fault really for designing it the way it looks today.. but we tend to use the word communication on this board  speak to eachother and come to terms ....<br>
then if we are soo good at communication (we arent)<br>
then why dont we all unite and adress this problems to the ones that created the problem at first...<br>
surely this is a problem in any form on all servers and the only one to blame is Verant entertainment.<br>
a good pair of claims could be that ...<br>
green con mobs  in planes cant be touched and will not agrro on the highest players, make the epic quest mobs triggered and not a loot on a old mob (lazy)<br>
why not have a copy of the zone plane of bla bla bla for the ones 55 plus with higher mobs in it rather than doing the usual upping the ones that exist now (there are players that dont own kunark and are therefore not over 50) (ok not many but still)<br>
why do we accept these &quot;easy to use&quot; solutions all the time? we are custumers here we pay to play this game they are our servants not the other way around.<br>
and in the name of balance (they use it alot)<br>
there cannot be a balance if there are guilds or groups that can and therefore will overthrow the small ones and if it is ok to do so then why is there a system to prevent people from beeing treated badly this is also treating people badly but nothing is done.<br>
<br>
infact it seems verant wants more uberguilds controling zones they are to big for otherwise they wouldnt have put the epic mobs in such a zone... or are they what we all think they are...<br>
<br>
ok a bit off subject but hey i got a bit wound up..<br>
<br>
Final thing stands<br>
Schedule or FFA?<br>
wont matter unless a non player does someting about the system that it is today...<br>
<br>
p/s why a 10h spawntime on regular mobs that hardly ever drop anything? this also adds to the frustration people will just stay longer if it takes longer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Treistaania  flame me all u like<br>

Schedule or FFA?<br>
wont matter unless a non player does someting about the system that it is today..."<br>
<br>
I don't understand how people can still ask this question.<br>
<br>
Without 100% adherance to a shcedule by 100% of the planar ready guilds, there can be no schedule.<br>
<br>
It has been clearly stated by numerous planar ready guids (mine included) that they will not participate in a scheduling system.<br>
<br>
Ergo, there is no schedule.<br>
<br>
While I strongly suggest that other guilds try and announce their larger raids, be courteous of other groups, and cooperate and share when appropriate, the simple fact remains that it's a big freakin' free-for-all out there in Everquest-land. <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufaydin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faydin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/29/01 11:43:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conesus--- FFA planes or schedule</span><hr size=1> My Two cents.<br>
<br>
If 5 or 6 of the uber big guilds were to get toghter and say there is going to be a sechdule than there wouldn't be much for anyone to say. They would come up own the plane. won't matter who is and isn't there. Then eveyone would be stuck cause no loot would be there for the less number guilds. the big guilds would have most of it and than the other guilds would conform to the sechdule system. That is how it happened on Karana so long ago. The old rule order out of force will always stand no matter what a person says. It is just if that force is just after it is in control is all that matters.<br>

<br>
In your outlandish scenerio, we'd simply go up, pick a nice place to camp, and then pull what we could - while still being as neighborly as possible - if it still made sense for us to be there.<br>
<br>
We've already had several "dude, we were here first, respect our plane!" /shout-storms from guilds who don't believe this is the way to do things; but frankly, we quietly did our own thing, called our extra drops (sadly, all of them) and tried to be as cooperative as possible.<br>
<br>
[As a footnote, back before I was the HGIC over in Vision, I kicked a person out of the guild for mouthing off in a plane to a "bigger badder" guild who showed up after we did - both to demonstrate our desire to be peaceful cohabitors, and because he managed to break one of our small handful of rules.] <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufaydin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faydin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/30/01 12:36:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conesus--- FFA planes or schedule</span><hr size=1> Say you are in your corner and they pull all the spawns.

<br>
No matter how much one person wants or does something. If the majority of the people want something else then that will happen. <br>
<br>
Society is like this. If the majority adheres to something than in time people will conform to the norm and standard or lose out.<br>
<br>
So as I said if enough people enforce a schedule than it will end up a schedule, if enough people enforce FFA than it will stay FFA. The real question is. What is going to happen when someone tries to form a schedule? When that happens we will actually see where this server is headed and what the norm or standard is going to be on here.<br>

<br>
If 90% of the guilds make a schedule and stick to it, the 10% of guilds who don't believe, care, or aren't concerned with that schedule will come and go as they please - and it will degenerate into FFA.<br>
<br>
The reality, however, is much more swayed the other way.  First of all, this server, lacking a scheduling system, has been FFA since the day it came up.  ...and get this, unlike the systems that many of us came from, it works.<br>
<br>
It's still possible to schedule things which a small number of groups have the resources for.  While the number grows every week, there are still probably few enough guilds with the strategy and numbers to kill <insert-big-target-here>.<br>
<br>
Those guilds can work out any rotation they want because it's possible to reach 100% agreement.  Or, if a single member of those guilds decide no schedule, they are FORCED to work in a similar fashion.<br>
<br>
The added burden is you can ~always~ enforce FFA.    You can ~never~ enforce a schedule.  The "rules" of the game support it.  Even in situations where GMs have asked other guilds to leave raids, it's because they made a determination that the <large-target> was "engaged" and supported the group that got to it first.  [We acknowledge things like clearing the fire giants and sitting in the prep-room to be "engaging" Nagafen, for example.]<br>
<br>
If you are in Nagafen's prep room buffing to kill the 'leezard, and another guild who just walks into Sol.B petitions that they scheduled to kill the dragon on leezard-schedule.com, guess who's gonna get to kill the dragon.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
...and to answer Faydin's question: "Say you are in your corner and they pull all the spawns. Why would you stay[?]"<br>
<br>
If we went to [plane] and set up camp, and a vastly superior force were there, one able to beat us to all - or nearly all of the spawns, we would leave.  I think I've made that clear.  FFA sometimes means you get 40 people, jump into the [plane entrance] and find 100 other people there.  On those days you go somewhere else.<br>
<br>
[We would of course have known 100 people were there, but guilds go /ANON so they don't get tells from other guilds asking when the portal is clear - so they can stay alone for as possible. -- But that's another rant.] <p><img src=http://www.goodnet.com/~matts/sig.bmp > </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/unexusck.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nexusck</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/13/01 11:10:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> schedule or ffa</span><hr size=1> I thought that I'd stick my own 2 cents in on this topic.
