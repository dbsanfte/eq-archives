<br>
WASHINGTON, DC—Calling the theological giant's stranglehold on the religion industry &quot;blatantly anti-competitive,&quot; a U.S. district judge ruled Monday that God is in violation of anti-monopoly laws and ordered Him to be broken up into several less powerful deities.<br>
   <br>
      &quot;The evidence introduced in this trial has convinced me that the deity known as God has willfully and actively thwarted competition from other deities and demigods, promoting His worship with such unfair scare tactics as threatening non-believers with eternal damnation,&quot; wrote District Judge Charles Elliot Schofield in his decision. &quot;In the process, He has carved out for Himself an illegal monotheopoly.&quot;<br>
<br>
      The suit, brought against God by the Justice Department on behalf of a coalition of &quot;lesser deities&quot; and polytheistic mortals, alleged that He violated antitrust laws by claiming in the Holy Bible that He was the sole creator of the universe, and by strictly prohibiting the worship of what He termed &quot;false idols.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;God clearly commands that there shall be no other gods before Him, and He frequently employs the phrase 'I AM the Lord' to intimidate potential deserters,&quot; prosecuting attorney Geoffrey Albert said. &quot;God uses other questionable strongarm tactics to secure and maintain humanity's devotion, demanding, among other things, that people sanctify their firstborn to Him and obtain circumcisions as a show of faith. There have also been documented examples of Him smiting those caught worshipping graven images.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Attorneys for God did not deny such charges. They did, however, note that God offers followers &quot;unbeatable incentives&quot; in return for their loyalty, including eternal salvation, protection from harm, and &quot;fruitfulness.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;God was the first to approach the Jewish people with a 'covenant' contract that guaranteed they would be the most favored in His eyes, and He handed down standards of morality, cleanliness, and personal conduct that exceeded anything else practiced at the time,&quot; lead defense attorney Patrick Childers said. &quot;He readily admits to being a 'jealous' God, not because He is threatened by the prospect of competition from other gods, but because He is utterly convinced of the righteousness of His cause and that He is the best choice for mortals. Many of these so-called gods could care less if somebody bears false witness or covets thy neighbor's wife. Our client, on the other hand, is truly a 'People's God.'&quot;<br>
<br>
      In the end, however, God was unable to convince Schofield that He did not deliberately create a marketplace hostile to rival deities. God's attorneys attempted to convince the judge of His openness to rivals, pointing to His longtime participation in the &quot;Holy Trinity,&quot; but the effort failed when Schofield determined that Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are &quot;more God subsidiaries than competitors.&quot;<br>
<br>
      To comply with federal antitrust statutes, God will be required to divide Himself into a pantheon of specialized gods, each representing a force of nature or a specific human custom, occupation, or state of mind.<br>
<br>
      &quot;There will most likely be a sun god, a moon god, sea god, and rain god,&quot; said religion-industry watcher Catherine Bailey. &quot;Then there will be some second-tier deities, like a god of wine, a goddess of the harvest, and perhaps a few who symbolize human love and/or blacksmithing.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Leading theologians are applauding the God breakup, saying that it will usher in a new era of greater worshipping options, increased efficiency, and more personalized service.<br>
<br>
      &quot;God's prayer-response system has been plagued by massive, chronic backlogs, and many prayers have gone unanswered in the process,&quot; said Gene Suozzi, a Phoenix-area Wiccan. &quot;With polytheism, you pray to the deity specifically devoted to your concern. If you wish to have children, you pray to the fertility goddess. If you want to do well on an exam, you pray to the god of wisdom, and so on. This decentralization will result in more individualized service and swifter response times.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Other religious experts are not so confident that the breakup is for the best, pointing to the chaotic nature of polytheistic worship and noting that multiple gods demand an elaborate regimen of devotion that today's average worshipper may find arduous and inconvenient.<br>
<br>
      &quot;If people want a world in which they must lay burnt offerings before an earthenware household god to ensure that their car will start on a cold winter morning, I suppose they can have it,&quot; said Father Thomas Reinholdt, theology professor at Chicago's Loyola University. &quot;What's more, lesser deities are infamous for their mercurial nature. They often meddle directly in diplomatic affairs, abduct comely young mortal women for their concubines, and are not above demanding an infant or two for sacrifice. Monotheism, for all its faults, at least means convenience, stability, and a consistent moral code.&quot;<br>
<br>
      One deity who is welcoming the verdict is the ancient Greek god Zeus, who described himself as &quot;jubilant&quot; and &quot;absolutely vindicated.&quot;<br>
<br>
      &quot;For thousands of years, I've been screaming that this third-rate sky deity ripped me off wholesale,&quot; said Zeus, speaking from his Mt. Olympus residence. &quot;Every good idea He ever had He took from me: Who first created men in his own image? Who punished mankind for its sins? Who lived eternally up in the clouds? And the whole fearsome, patriarchal, white-beard, thunderbolt thing? I was doing that eons before this two-bit hustler started horning in on the action.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Lawyers for God say they plan to appeal Schofield's ruling and are prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.<br>
<br>
      &quot;This decision is a crushing blow to God worshippers everywhere, and we refuse to submit to a breakup until every possible avenue of argument is pursued,&quot; Childers said. &quot;I have every confidence that God will ultimately win, as He and His lawyers are all-powerful.&quot;<br>
