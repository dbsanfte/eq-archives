<br>
First, the &quot;but where did the apes come from&quot; response demonstrates a very poor understanding of evolution.  Man and modern day apes both evolved from the same primitive ancesters quite a few million years in the past.  These ancestors, in turn, evolved from more primitive life forms right down to the so-called &quot;primordial soup.&quot;  From here evolution leaves off and abiogenesis -- the origins of the first lifeforms -- begin ( a whole 'nother discussion, but one quite open to scientific discussion without appeal to supernaturalism).<br>
<br>
Regarding the consistency of the bible over time, this is not quite the case.  There are no extant copies of original biblical documents. All we have are copies of copies of copies and so on.  Over time, not only are transcription errors made, but with the evolution of language and differences in interpretation, different translations emerge.  Remember the phrase, &quot;peace on earth, and good will towards men&quot;?  This is a mistranslation caused by the loss of a single letter (a sigma, IIRC).  The actual, less virtuous, translation is &quot;peace on earth toward men of goodwill.&quot;<br>
<br>
A simple overview of current bibles shows quite a few differences in translation.  The traditional King James supports the views of the ruling monarch.  The New International Version is generally regarded as a good translation, but smooths over places where the bible would contradict itself (such as Jeremiah, where the unjustified addition of the word &quot;just&quot; prevents contradiction with teh burnt offerings of Exodus).  The Jehovah's Witnesses have their own translation as well, suited to their beliefs.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls don't really support or verify anything said in the bible.  At most they are copies of books therein.  However, at least one book of the prophets (don't recall which one, Nehemiah maybe) differs quite a bit from the translation we're accustomed to.  Mostly, the scrolls concern the way of life of their writers, the Essenes.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;C) Other histories written by people in the area/time of the bible's writings (IE Egyptians, Sumerians etc) also support things written of in the bible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Erm, not quite.  There is no certifiable archaeological record of a massive Hebrew presence in Egypt, nor of the exodus.  There are no archaeological findings of 2-3 million Hebrews wandering for 40  years in an area roughly the size of WVa.  Egypt was never uninhabited and uninhabitable for any period as recorded in Ezekiel.  The book of Daniel makes many errors regarding the history of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, and biblical scholars (excluding fundamentalists) recognize that it was written in the 2nd century BCE, rather than the 6th.  Lastly, much of Genesis (e.g., the Flood) was derived from earlier Sumerian and Babylonian myths. <br>
<br>
Lessee...ah, the Koran and the Big Bang.  The Koran's view of creation doesn't mirror what is suggested by science quite as well as promoters might wish you to think.  The Koran suggests that everything began with &quot;smoke,&quot; for instance.  But our best understanding is that the earliest moments of the universe began with a burst of pure energy.  After some billionths of a second this cooled to plasma, and eventually to gases (which still doesn't really equate to smoke).  There are other creation errors, some of which mirror Genesis (plants before sun, that kind of thing).  I recently read a very good article on just this topic.  If anyone is interested I'll try to find the link.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing&quot; is a meaningless term, scientifically and philosophically.  Or, at best, so ambiguous as to be nearly useless.  Also, the Big Bang didn't necessarily have a &quot;first moment.&quot;  Relativity leaves the arrow of time open both ways, allowing for an infinite temporal regression.  While this isn't necessarily the case, it does remove the pretext for First Cause arguments.  <br>
<br>
This thread just scratches the surface of religious discussion, something I've been involved with for a few years now in various forums.  Raised a Christian, I've studied the issue intently and have learned quite a bit.  But some years ago now I realized that Christianity didn't hold water and realized I was quite agnostic about the whole thing.  More recently, I've found myself an atheist and secular humanist, and find it a much more rewarding way to live.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, a quote:<br>
<br>
&quot;We are both atheists, I simply disbelieve in one more god than you do.  When you understand why you don't believe in all the other gods, you will understand why I don't believe in yours.&quot; (no idea who first said this)<br>
