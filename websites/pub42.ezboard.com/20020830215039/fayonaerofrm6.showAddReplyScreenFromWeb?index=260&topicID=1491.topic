Nice post Sithgear, did you win the 5th grade essay competition with that work of art?<br>
<br>
Im not a new toon and I guarantee I started playing Everquest before your punk ass did. I have been playing since beta, but just because you have better gear from sucking better dick, doesnt mean I am less of a player. I have earned my gear more than you will ever know, I havent had the luxury of being in a giant guild, handed shit just because im part of the gang. Every piece of gear you have is because you are just the pawn needed in your guild, congrats, you didnt earn shit asshole. Im far from a newbie, you fucking loser, but anytime you want to find that out, you just come looking for me. Im not afraid of you just because of that tag behind your name, ive learned that that tag doesnt stand for what it once did. Ive been around since day one, and you are just another fart in the wind, thinking you have some lasting power, when in reality, you will simply fade away while Ill still be here.<br>
<br>
Ive had to work 10 times as hard as your punk ass since I dont have 60+ people to hold me up into the spotlight. You are a chimp, dont act like you are anything different. Just stand there and catch the heals and your job is done.<br>
<br>
And for your information, you fucking idiot, I have characters on all 4 pvp servers. Next time, take your head from your ass and then remove your foot from your mouth before speaking up when you arent told to.<br>
<br>
I would be surprised if you knew jack shit about the old Mickey Mouse Club, im sure you are just spouting off shit you heard while sucking on mommys teat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usaeelielbuffmaster1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saeeliel Buffmaster1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/17/02 8:09:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1491.topic&index=268>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMG What is the world coming to!!!??!?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Next time, take your head from your ass and then remove your foot from your mouth.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Saeeliel are you really that stupid or do you just try hard to give that impression? 10 page essay? Go back to preschool and learn how to count. I never said I was superior, Sithgear did. He also was talking about shit that he has no clue about, much like you did in your last 20 posts repeating the same shit over and over. You have yet to add something to the thread worth reading. All you do is prattle on about shit that makes no sense nor difference. Now get off others dicks and post something original for once. I know you are the official guild cocksucker, but that shouldnt extend to the message boards too.<br>

<br>
Yogurt was in a zone where he felt relatively comfortable trying to flex his muscle and did, someone called him on it and when he came to someone he knew he couldn't beat he tried for 15 minutes to talk his way out of it. When he couldn't get out of the duel he accepted just to try not looking like as much of a prick as he is. In return for being killed he posted it on a message board to try and flame the one he lost to and brag about beating some others.<br>
<br>
Was Caeralee the main, obviously becouse it's the main of the person playing a toon at the time no matter who owns the toon. Caerelee was playing her brothers toon when she 1st offered to kill him and was playing herself when she did.<br>
<br>
Yogurt has done nothing but contridict his own ideals on dueling several times. Some think he has balls for dueling when he knew he would lose but what balls does it take to commit suicide, especially with a toon in the game, there was nothing to be lost with a death.<br>
<br>
I have to say Yogurt you are an ass and behave like a child. The new knowledge that jerks like you are out there have actually made this game less enjoyable for me in a single post.<br>
<br>
As to the duels with Fanny and Kinuvan, you're gonna get your ass handed to you. 2000k on each of them not going below 90%.<br>

<br>
#1.   People in EW will go to the wall for each other.. right, wrong, or unsure.<br>
<br>
#2    Yugo would in all likelyhood lose a duel to every member of EW, besides me, cause Ive been in 3 duels and lost them all.<br>
<br>
#3    Some guilds who constantly get their ass throughly whipped and embarrassed by EW in game, (sometimes I feel like we should sell tickets to our raids) jumped on this thread in a sad sad attempt to in some small tiny, nearly insignifcant way, not be our total bitch.  So get your jabs on the boards in..   as long you keep us laughing in game..<br>
<br>
Yugo in all honesty I dont think your a bad dude..  You seem to have fun doing what you do..and enjoy the game on your own terms, and are prolly a decent player, more so than many But you havent risked anything, risk something in a duel against a stronger opponent and I can respect that.. what did you risk before?  No exp lose, no cash loss, obviously no rep loss because you couldnt wait to post it on the boards.  Caer was the only one risking anything..  if she had loss you would have taked billboards out on highways and ran radio spots.   So you want respect?<br>
Put up 20k in plat..   and challenge one of our players..  for that mere 20k you get the chance to duel a server champ.  OR Hell.. if Aeno was back..  a Game Wide champ.  but imagine the shit you could talk if you beat a &quot;Champion&quot; or a &quot;minstrel', a &quot;Rake&quot; or a &quot;Disciple&quot;...  if you challenge a &quot;Vicar&quot; that pretty lame though.<br>

I have fought in many zones thruout Everquest. I hardly think the zone had jack shit to do with where and when I flex my "muscles". Let me guess, we have another Freud on our hands with you eh Ralphy boy?<br>
<br>
<i>"someone called him on it and when he came to someone he knew he couldn't beat he tried for 15 minutes to talk his way out of it."</i><br>
<br>
Aye someone did call me out, and then that someone logged in someone elses character and beat me. If you did indeed read the thread like you have claimed, you will see multiple people saying that Alamara logged in her brothers character. Now read that last sentence multiple times before you reply, because her brothers character ISNT HER CHARACTER! Get that thru your thick skull before replying on the matter.<br>
<br>
If anyone was stalling, it was Caeralee. I said from the start, a yes or no answer was all I desired, and I would still fight her. Read the logs, its right there. She refused to answer a simple question and guess what, I still fought her. Now im sure that looks like the cowards way out to you, but what do you think I should have done to look like a man... tucked my tail between my legs and slink out of the zone? Get a clue, you have shown no logic at all either.<br>
<br>
<i>"When he couldn't get out of the duel he accepted just to try not looking like as much of a prick as he is."</i><br>
<br>
You act like you know so much, yet you know so little. I have no qualms about being a prick. If you think you or any of your buddies in the big circle jerk you call a guild have any influence on what I think of myself, then you are only fooling yourself. I can also post screenshots where I said before she even challenged me with the /d command to my guildmates to not interfere with the duel even tho I am going to die. Now if you think that I was trying to get out of the duel, then why did I tell my guildmates to stay out of it way before hand? Quit trying to paint it like I was trying to get out of it. I actually wanted to duel the Sage and see if she was stupid enough to miss the instant kill button.<br>
<br>
<i>"In return for being killed he posted it on a message board to try and flame the one he lost to and brag about beating some others."</i><br>
<br>
Newsflash Freud, I have dueled lots of people on this server, please show me how many of those duels have been posted by me, in what you call bragging. Please come up with the posts, and the screenshots. Wait, ill save you some time, you will find none, because when I do beat someone, I say thanks or good fight or keep my mouth shut and thats that. I dont go bragging about it in zones or on these boards because so far all the people I have dueled have done so fairly. Until now. Your guildmate decided to take the honorable way out and log in someone elses character to beat me, dont think so much of yourselves and you might see the flaw in that line of reasoning. Once again, I reiterate, I dont brag on these boards when I beat someone if they fight with honor and respectably.<br>
<br>
<i>"Caerelee was playing her brothers toon when she 1st offered to kill him and was playing herself when she did."</i><br>
<br>
Why dont you guys pick one story and stick with it, your different twists each post are getting very old.<br>
<br>
<i>"I have to say Yogurt you are an ass and behave like a child."</i><br>
<br>
And Im sure when I say that you are an ass and behave like a child, every single person out there knows that every single word is truth right? They all must believe it, because anything wrote in these forums is always fact and never opinion. I suppose you are the only one that is the adult in the entire game, thanks for pointing that out to us Dad. I also would like to point out that you have resorted to name calling *Yogurt in the same sentence that you accuse someone of behaving like a child. I believe the word you are looking for is hypocrit.<br>
<br>
<i>"The new knowledge that jerks like you are out there have actually made this game less enjoyable for me in a single post."</i><br>
<br>
Well quit then. Like you and yours preach, action not words. Quit the game or stfu. Its quite simple. Dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Show everyone how you are a man of conviction and quit the game you say is less enjoyable for you.<br>
<br>
<i>"As to the duels with Fanny and Kinuvan, you're gonna get your ass handed to you. 2000k on each of them not going below 90%."</i><br>
<br>
You have 2,000,000 plat to be betting on each of them or were you talking out your ass, adult style? I am sorry, im not that rich, but I will gladly bet some coin that I can get Kinuvan below 90% health if he goes toe to toe with me like he said previously he would. Since you are so sure of it, im sure you will give me more than even odds on it right? And im sure you will accept others wagers too? You will bankroll everyones bet against your guildmates, right?<br>
<br>
Lleauaric: <i>"#1. People in EW will go to the wall for each other.. right, wrong, or unsure."</i><br>
<br>
I am glad at least one person has thier eyes open and isnt under the god illusion so many others seem to be prey to.<br>
<br>
<i>"#2 Yugo would in all likelyhood lose a duel to every member of EW, besides me, cause Ive been in 3 duels and lost them all."</i><br>
<br>
I beat Ainwein, perhaps you mean in the future. ;) He made the mistake of underestimating me, perhaps another will in the future. I have tried to set up duels since this thread started, however my tells arent answered. Funny, everyone yapping how they will kick my ass so fast, but not taking the time to back it up. :/ I am being understanding that people raid alot, so I better not hear no bullshit about me pussin out when im in the middle of a raid and people finally get off thier asses to duel.<br>
<br>
<i>"But you havent risked anything, risk something in a duel against a stronger opponent and I can respect that.. what did you risk before? No exp lose, no cash loss, obviously no rep loss because you couldnt wait to post it on the boards."</i><br>
<br>
In all honesty, its the 2nd duel ive lost on Aro. I could have ducked out and kept that total to one loss to a necro and been satisfied. I added another loss to my record, so I did have something to lose. It may not mean anything to you or others, but it does mean something to me. I do take satisfaction in the knowledge that I had almost no chance in hell to win. I say almost because I did screw up a couple things that I should have thought thru first before accepting. In the future they will hopefully be remembered and come into play. <br>
<br>
<i>"Caer was the only one risking anything.. if she had loss you would have taked billboards out on highways and ran radio spots."</i><br>
<br>
I would have shut up. Like I said above, you cannot find a single post from me outside of this thread where I bragged about killing someone as long as they kept thier yapper shut in the first place. I dont rub it in peoples face when I duel and win unless they were being a dick in the first place, and sometimes not even then. I try to be humble about winning, until someone throws something similar back in my face. Then I will make damn sure I point out, that while you are calling me a newbie, I kicked your ass. If I had beat Caeralee, I would have stored that nugget away for the day when someone did try and throw it up in my face. But then again, im sure the twist would have been that it wasnt an EW member that I beat, but an EW members sister. She had nothing to lose either with a excuse like that in waiting contrary to what you say.<br>
<br>
<i>"Put up 20k in plat.. and challenge one of our players.. for that mere 20k you get the chance to duel a server champ. OR Hell.. if Aeno was back.. a Game Wide champ. but imagine the shit you could talk if you beat a "Champion" or a "minstrel', a "Rake" or a "Disciple"... if you challenge a "Vicar" that pretty lame though."</i><br>
<br>
I fought Aeno in the battle royal, although he was avatar snared, I did some damage and was pleased with myself. In light of new info, there are ways of screwing bow users that im sure will piss off Rangers in duels in the future. I am not as wary of rangers as I once was.<br>
<br>
I have not said I can beat any EW in duels. Skill makes a difference in fights, but gear with the slightest bit of skill makes an even bigger difference. So unless you have complete idiots in EW, and I mean in game tactics, not the stupid shit some post in the forums, then I have no illusions about being able to beat any of them based on thier gear. It just wont happen. Now if you want to have them geared on an equal level as me and duel, that will be a different story, wouldnt it? As your members have pointed out, people arent so brave when they dont have the advantage.<br>
<br>
However I will agree to the foolish 20k wagers on one condition. Since I obviously have no chance in hell of winning and its an obvious ploy to separate a fool from his coin, I will require a contest of wits after each 20k duel. I will pick a number between 1 and 10 and the dueler gets to guess it. One try and if they get it wrong, I get to keep the 20k I would have lost from the duel. Whats wrong, dont like the sound of that? Well you have just about as much chance of guessing the number correctly as I do of winning any duels against EW. Nice try tho. None of the EW reps for dueling are worth a 20k wager.<br>
<br>
Now, im sure, since I type out a 10 page essay in answer to 3 different posts, that somehow I need some anger management or that I am a child, but I didnt think 3 different posts Saeeliel style are in order. Two of the three people that I replied to here received sarcasm and insults, the other didnt. Perhaps there is a reason for that. In the future, if you dont want to be treated like shit, then return the favor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukinu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kinu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/17/02 1:37:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1491.topic&index=278>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eternalwrath.cjb.net/members/kinuvan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMG What is the world coming to!!!??!?</span><hr size=1>                  Actually deidal posted about the 8hours stuff.In a toes to toes duel you will probably get me lower than 90%,I m a bard maybe with a good gear but still a bard.In a real duel thats another story.I didn t get a tell yet i m still waiting tho!<br>

                 One advise tho,I could resume your post really fast.Quote stuff and type the exact oposite of what the person said,add some crappy flames and hop thats your post.I guess you enjoy useless arguing on boards.I don't:<br>

It may be possible to have a decisive victory, but the argument will never end until people get bored with it. Whatever anyone says can be picked apart into 100 little things that they phrased wrong and can be challenged. Thus the art of board agruing. Your arguments don't really have to be that sound, you just have to be good at it. At least that's how I think it works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usulaspsychoblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sulas Psychoblades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/17/02 3:06:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1491.topic&index=280>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMG What is the world coming to!!!??!?</span><hr size=1> Actually from his last post I thought he look quite the opposite of retarded.

I guess I could have typed out 3 separate posts to each person I replied to and done it blissfully ignorant Saeeliel style, but why look like a dipshit replying to myself 3 times in a row like others do, like you. <br>

Question Saeeliel, do you sit on the street corner and yell at all the cars driving by for doing shit wrong, even tho they cant hear you and wouldnt give a flying fuck if they could?
