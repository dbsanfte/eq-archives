Its nice that you flip the bird to everyone else who you recruit into EW in the future.....since you are takin away their chances at primal and when you have members that start to retire, you will wish you still had your little primal farm there intact.<br>

<br>
Eternal Wrath have not called anyone anything.<br>
Gladstone speaks for himself, he have NEVER been appointed as spokesperson of any kind. <br>
<br>
Anyway, like Gladstone and Thalanx said: DW have yet to show us any consideration. On the contrary, they have so far done their best to monopolize spawns, using their timezone advantage to shut us and everyone else out of whatever mobs they can kill and want. We don't pout over that, but it certainly doesn't inspire us to return their attitude with pampering and special consideration that they have not even asked for. Why would we?<br>
<br>
I agree with Mephana that it would be a bad thing to shut others out of sleeper's forever. However, that is not the case. The new zone-in message on Rathe makes it clear that the Warders will return, we just need the plot to take a few more twists first. <br>
<br>
If we kill the last warder it will delay us and DarkWind a bit. Other guilds will most likely never be effected at all, the warders will be back by the time they get enough keys.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, we have not slayed the 4:th warder yet. It will be a interesting fight, and I am really looking forward to meeting a mob I have never seen defeated before. Lets not assume the outcome, only that it will be a interesting fight. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
EW is a guild made up of about 80 people.  These people are all typical people, just like all of you.  Some are pacifists, some are warmongers, some are very humble while others are arrogant.  Everyone in this game has an opinion on things whether they voice it or not.  Everyone has the right to their own opinion.<br>
<br>
We as a general rule avoid flaming others or putting people down.  It is no secret that some are unhappy with people following the path we cleared so they could go to the Plane of Mischief (Plane of Trouble would be a better name), and others are unhappy to see people move mages into north ToV so they can CTH to that spot.  All of that really does not matter.  It is a game and folks are going to do what they want to do, sometimes without regard for proper etiquette (and yes, some of our actions can fall into this category, we are not perfect either).<br>
<br>
What this leaves us with is a situation we have to deal with.  From my understanding, we already have tried to work out a deal with certain folks about the rotation of some boss mobs and were pretty much told to get bent, they will take whatever mobs they can take.  My loyalty is to the guild I am in, the same as most of the rest of you.  Some of you profess that you are concerned with the entire server as a whole and that may or may not be true.  But the reality of human nature tells me that many of you are concerned with your circle which includes you, your friends, and your guild.  Nothing wrong with this, you can't know everyone and save the world, you have to just deal with what you are able to.<br>
<br>
Looking at things from this perspective, see what the pro's and cons are.  I am not going to bother to list out what our guild's reasoning is for doing what targets.  That is guild business and as far as I am concerned, it will not be otherwise for me.  Put yourself in our shoes and honestly think, what would you do and for what reasons?<br>
<br>
As for killing the fourth warder, popular opinion on this board seems to be that we are going to do it.  And based on some of the rablerousers in this thread, some of you are certain that we can do it.  I think we can do it, and there are only 4 mobs on this server that we have not killed (aside from mobs like guild leaders, merchants, the level 7 npc in zone x....etc).  The Avatar of War, Tunare, the fourth warder, and The Sleeper himself.  AoW is a 30 minute fight that requires zerging beyond what is even remotely realistic (since the charm nerf), Tunare....hmm, 2 necro pog robes anyone?  So, are we going to try the fourth warder?  I don't know, maybe we will.  But, if we do and I am online, I guarentee that we will at the very least pass the message to Sky Shrine and East Commons.  This will provide ample opportunity for people to find out and take a seat as they wish, be it to see the mobs and be slain, avoid dying and coming out at a suddenly kos bind point (or change your bind point), or to move out of the zones with potential to be affected.<br>
<br>
<br>
From information that I have read, The Sleeper will appear in Sky Shrine and Western Wastes for sure.  Rumor is that Kael and Temple of Veeshan are also spots fit for an appearance.  Nagafen is believed to have spawned with Kerafym's death also, which means probably Lady Vox will also (beware of Nagafen for you Ragefire campers).<br>
<br>
<br>
I again stress that what I wrote is my personnal opinion and not that of EW.  I am not here to flame any of you, merely to add my opinion as you have, or may yet do.<br>

They will come back, just give us some time and we can probably respawn the funny dragons again for you all.<br>
Verant is not stupid, they dont just shut down one major zone for infinity, they want our cash to keep flowing in and it costs LOTS just to make one zone!<br>
Remember when they didnt plan for anyone to kill Nagafen, and he didnt drop anything? =)<br>
Ooops mistake, but was corrected rather fast, and look how far we have gotten since then. <br>
Verant might be evil, but they learned something from that. We as players, can kill anything, given time. We are pure addicts and just wont give up until the silly whatnot mob is dead. <br>
Right? <br>
This is the spirit of EverQuest...dont forget that...its not all about loot.<br>
Remember when you killed your first orc centurion as a newbie? Wow what a rush! Thats what I want to feel again...thats what makes this game worth playing, at least for me.<br>
<br>
Think about that for a while....<br>
<br>
Dont be angry with us for wanting to try something heroic, your time will also come, the warders will be back for you to marvel at, just like I did. <br>
If you cant keep your faith in the game, just believe in the greed of Verant...they will be back up.<br>

See if this expresses your feelings Mephana.  It was written by a player on Cazic-Thule (I believe he's still there -- reprinted without permission).  Since it references bottom-feeders it is especially appropriate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
This is for the haters: for the people whose pleasure in the game is derived from lording their achievements over others; for those who would deprive those who would like a chance from having one out of their own bottomless greed; for those whose twisted morality sees them as the top of some virtual food chain by virtue of their trinkets and baubles.<br>
You revolt me.<br>
<br>
Now, I know you don't care about my opinion, you shit on my views, I am nothing to you. You will denounce me as jealous, covetous, a &quot;bottom feeder&quot;, or you won't reply at all. Doesn't matter. What I have to say will be said, and heard, and people will agree with me.<br>
<br>
Yes, you have more fake money than me. You have more colourful toys than me, with longer names than my toys, and they were taken from cartoon monsters much more dangerous than I've yet seen. You can run in and take my cartoon monsters away from me, so that I have to wait to stand in front of them and push a button some other time. Bravo! Very laudable.<br>
<br>
But I am better than you.<br>
<br>
Many of us are better than you.<br>
<br>
Why? Because we have compassion, and consideration, and we are good people. We take care of people we don't know, because it's the right thing to do. We are courteous to people we don't know, because it's the right thing to do. We are generous to our friends and to strangers, we take care of those who need our help. We assist and advise, we comfort, we bring some happiness that otherwise might not exist into the game. <br>
<br>
I am a man of honour and integrity. Moreso ingame than out, if truth be told. There is a wondrous potential in this strange virtual world that not many seem to have realized; here, you can be better than you think you are. You can BE the knight that you are not in the real world; you can BE the beautiful girl that escapes you in reality's mirror. You have the opportunity EVERY TIME YOU PLAY to touch the life of a stranger and make them glad they came into Norrath. You can befriend people across the world. You can show people that you are a good person, a kind and loveable person; you can show them who you are, or who you want to be.<br>
<br>
Could there be any greater opportunity?<br>
<br>
But too many squander this in selfishness and small-minded greed. To you, the haters, the game is a different sort of opportunity: seek, take, hold, profit, dominate. You become clutching cyphers, without any real identity to distinguish one of you from the others. You are all equally loathesome, your names equated with the worst of what people expect from the game. For all you declaim your greatness and flaunt your toys, you hardly exist at all. You are spectres, phantoms, the REAL monsters of EverQuest. Does anyone WANT to know you? Does anyone CARE? Perhaps a few of your fellow monsters, I suppose; and then only to further their own ends. What a ridiculous, pathetic existence you choose for yourselves.<br>
<br>
You revolt me.<br>
<br>
I won't name names in this post, because this is not about any particular person, or group; it's about a philosophy. The &quot;elite&quot; philosophy. You set yourself above us by virtue of your junk and platinum, your empty boasts and your silly posturing, your grand assaults on make-believe monsters. You must understand; we see through you. We see the little soul you've built such a grand container for. We see you for what you are; a challenge. Not to our characters, but to ourselves. You give us something to rise above, as men and women. Your example is the lowest common denominator of society; might makes right. There are other ways, and the strong among us will take those harder roads. Many of us are already walking them.<br>
<br>
I hope you are reading this and feeling angry. I hope you think I'm referring to you. Because if you do, then I am. And I don't like you, frankly. Just wanted to be clear on that. Will this post change the way you feel, the way you act, how you treat the other human beings who share EverQuest with you? Doubtful. You'll laugh, you'll flame, maybe; or you'll stay silent. But I've said what I needed to say, and I feel better for it. I bet others are glad, as well. <br>
<br>
&quot;Elite&quot;, feh. You are a parasite. You are a sour stench. Your contempt for us is painful, but it will be overcome. You cannot destroy me. You cannot destroy US. Keep your toys, laugh your boasts, steal my cartoon monsters; you still lose in the end. You are a weak person, with a weak soul, and I am better than you. Scorn me, scorn us, if you will; time will prove me right.<br>

Those traits aren't reserved to high levels or those of a powerful guild anymore than compassion, consideration &amp; being a good person are automatically traits of someone that's lower level or in another type of guild.  In fact all guilds are made of a mix of people of all the good &amp; bad traits of human nature.  And yes it's &quot;just a game&quot; but one which some ppl like to excel in just like any game, sport, or hobby.  And as far as slamming ppl who happen to have more game toys than you do - that doesn't make them vile &amp; disgusting.  What's vile &amp; disgusting are ppl who play the game but can't quite get the hang of doing it well &amp; then use phony altruism &amp; think they're somehow better because they &quot;don't&quot; have the cool toys that they're secretly lusting over.<br>
<br>
And tho I don't speak for Gladstone I believe that he wasn't calling ALL players outside of EW bottom feeders.  I believe he was referring just to the ppl who entered POM or who bound near there to COH ppl thru when they hadn't cleared the way themselves &amp; didn't earn their way in.  Many ppl went there in the wake of EW clearing NToV &amp; have spent days &amp; weeks clearing POM.  POM is a zone that a group or two can clear &amp; keep cleared - let alone all the ppl who're permanently camped there &amp; farming.  To most of us it's not even worth going there because not much is usually alive long enough.  There are now several guilds there around the clock - none besides EW have killed a single NToV dragon - &amp; many ppl express shall we say negative feelings towards EW &amp; none that I've heard have even said &quot;thank you&quot; for us clearing the way to even make it possible for them to be there farming.  Sometimes I wish there was a key from Aaryonar or Vulak needed just to enter POM.  <br>
<br>
And yes, even compassionate, considerate &amp; good ppl can harbor bad feelings when they feel like they're doing other ppl's work for them &amp; still being reviled in the process.  Kinda like we buy the food, cook it, serve it for 'em at a banquet, they eat it all &amp; then call us assholes.  Doesn't leave us with a warm fuzzy feeling.   <p>Magna Maleficus <BR>

Part of the &quot;price&quot; you pay for having killed the North ToV dragons is opening the way to PoM for others.<br>
<br>
A Vision member recently enter PoM, walked around, and took some screenshots.  He did so, with the assistance of, and directly as a result of the work done by Eternal Wrath.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly sure he expressed his gratitude at the time, but if he didn't, consider this a &quot;thanks&quot; from me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usirtaino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirTainO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(8/24/01 7:37:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/pally.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a question about ST....</span><hr size=1> I find it absolutely sad and sick that this post, made by ANta in all peace and simply asking a question IMMEDIATELY ended in a stupid goddamn ever again repeating DW / EW Flame.<br>
<br>
Goddamnit people! <br>
<br>
This post could have come from me, exactly same words and same reason.<br>
Stop that goddamn crap and get mature. Your neverending fights are boring! They get on my nerves!<br>
<br>
Its so old!<br>
<br>
As other people said, I am scared. <br>
I do not know the exact script about the Sleeper and what comes afterwards. But what I know is that on the Rathe NO warder has been seen anymore since the sleeper has been awakened. I know hundrets of people have been killed out of nothing. If the sleeper is despawned and if the warders are back up after the server reset, then I am fine with all that.<br>
Go kill him, enjoy.<br>
If the warders are gone - screw you egoistic arrogant buggers.<br>
As I said, I do not know what EXACTLY happens. But those are the 2 possibilities and the 2 reactions you would get from me. Either /clap clap and grats or then I gonna be damn pissed.<br>
I'd assume you know that the Warders WILL come back and all you do is just temporarily and everything will be ok again.<br>
I do not know what you know. But all info I could gather so far says one thing: Warders are gone. You all know what consequences this would have, the "you also get primals from other mobs" excuse is crap since the chance to get em is WAY WAY lower.<br>
<br>
Well, to my point. If the warders come back (and hell, if you really DO KNOW they will) - good luck. I hope you really do warn everyone in advance.<br>
If the warders do not come back (or if you are not sure about it) - just get outta my way, forever. Cause such an action would in any way be absolutely selfish and arrogant.<br>
<br>
<br>
@Edeina: "using their timezone advantage to shut us and everyone else out of whatever mobs they can kill and want". PLEASE FINALLY stop blaming DW for their timezone. Hell, goddamn - its simply their time zone. They don't abuse it, they don't monopolize mobs, they don't screw you over. They just kill stuff when they are online, which is, sadly, when you are not online yet. Be pissed at Verant for "making it possible for DW to kill mobs before you are on" - but not DW.<br>
<br>
@Gladstone: "You're bottom feeders"<br>
Do I have to say more? No.. still I do...<br>
Go back under the rock you came from, screw you!<br>
You are an arrogant dipshit and a friggen idiotic ass!<br>
This must be the most arrogant, selfish, idiotic and stupid remark I ever read on an EQ Board!<br>
My english is not good enough to express how incredibly lame this remark is and how insanely stupid you just made yourself look. I am happy most people at least noticed it.<br>
You have no clue in what way you just put THE WHOLE SERVER down and with this called EVERY SINGLE PERSON on this server - with all efforts, all time, heart, will and love they put in their work in Norrath - simply.. not ggod enough to kiss your feet.<br>
Go away!<br>
<br>
Yes I use a way harsher language than I usually do, but this STUPID ever repeating EW/DW fight and especially Gladstone just REALLY REALLY GODDAMN pissed me off!<br>
<br>

<br>
EDIT: "And tho I don't speak for Gladstone I believe that he wasn't calling ALL players outside of EW bottom feed"<br>
<--- Sure... :)<br>
You don't believe this yourself, do you? He DID call everyone of us bottom feeders, intended or not. If he had a brain or would not have the mentioned attitude, he wouldn't post this stuff in any way.<br>

If you are monopolizing the spawns there after we cleared the way, you are an asshole bottom feeder.  Don't expect to be treated with any form of consideration or respect because you haven't earned any.  Well, I take some of that back.  Fifty zergs from some wanna be guild running by as you kill the last roamer mobs (which they can't handle btw, not just the dragons) to play in PoM is some funny shit.  Thank you for the humor.<br>
<br>
Darkwind made their position very clear in regards to what they're willing to share and negotiate upon.  The early discussions of an informal Trak rotation come to mind.  The &quot;We're killing mob X in 30 min regardless of who you have there&quot; warnings come to mind.  The total monopoly they put onto CT for months comes to mind.<br>
<br>
Those decisions were made in hopes of bettering your guild (if they worked, congrats, you're a solid guild).  But, they brought consequences.  Don't be totally unwilling to negotiate 99% of the time, and then expect total mercy when something suddenly doesn't go your way.<br>
<br>
We're kind enough people to send the word out that we are trying the 4th warder.  Here's a big secret, we might not be able to do it Sunday, but we'll learn.<br>
<br>
To the rest of the server, your odds of actually seeing a warder anytime in the next 4 months are slim to none.  Outside of the few hours of chaos once the sleeper awakes, this does not affect you, so deal with it.<br>
<br>
I'm an arrogant person.  I'm proud of the things we've accomplished because I understand the work that went into it.  To say I'm evil, greedy, selfish or anything else is just pure speculation.  Baseless slandering is the tool of the simpleminded person who cannot dispute the actual points and facts of the argument.<br>

Everyone who reads this board in the slightest bit has seen his elitest attitude for some time.....it isn't a case of him being a good person being tired of taken advantage of, it is him being one of those people furtivus speaks of that can only feel better about himself by degrading other people.  And as for Gladstones remarks earlier in another post about why stuff isn't disclosed on vulak.  Personally I don't give a crap if you disclose your items (i haven't gone to a spoiler site in months...i simply don't care)....But for you to get this false sense that because you can gather more people than other guilds that you are a better player you are wrong.  Better gear and a larger guild Doesn't make you a better player.....maybe you can accomplish more because of the gear and the bigger guild....but it does not make you a better player.   Honestly, I feel pity for you because your attitude towards other people in eq....if it carries over to real life....will cause you to be one lonely bitter old man.  <br>
<br>
And to say that no other guild will see sleepers for another 4 months.....thats not accurate....VV will be there soon as well<br>
