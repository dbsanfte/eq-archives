i really learned something's from this,<br>
about , not letting others use acoount.....about get the facts before you blow off steam.about sometimes your eye's play tricks on you...... and you were right Ullric , i should have spoken to you first.<br>
so with that said..and for what it is worth .I am Here to Say that i am very sorry ...and i hope you will consider forgiving me for the situation i helped(your buddy logging you in did alot ) put you in.<br>

But I suppose this is as good a forum as any.  (Edit:  I did check the safehouse, I suppose he posted another flame there, but the moderators pulled it down.)<br>
<br>
For the record, the ranger item in question was Tolan's Gauntlets.  As far as I can tell, this is what I have pieced together..<br>
<br>
Live Captain group sees a dead capt up, and pulls it.  They engage the mob first, despite there being a dead capt up.<br>
<br>
Dead capt steals the pull, or takes it back, whichever you prefer.<br>
<br>
Ullric and the dead capt group engage the mob, Ullric gets the kill, using his Deadeye discipline.<br>
<br>
Ullric loots Soul Binder, a SK only 2hb.  He then tells live capt group that he is giving it to dead capt.  He gives it to the ranger, then comes up with some lie that Tolans dropped but disappeared, and he had a pair in the bank (or something, I dont know).<br>
<br>
A GM appeared, I still dont know what happened with that, Ullric logged.<br>
<br>
I talk of this in the third person, because I wasnt actually there.  A friend was playing my account.  This is not the only incident I have heard of me doing such evils, and I am correcting them as I can.  Unfortunately, said friend also relieved me of all my excess trade bait, thinking I wouldnt notice the extra packs missing from my bank.<br>
<br>
I am currently auctioning for any tolan's I can get, in an effort to pay Darksome back for the misdeeds my character (not me) commited.  Likewise, I owe a few other people some drops (he did it again in Dead Capt, I owe a shaman a Sarnak Mask, and he looted ES Gaunts and ran while in hands, I still dont know how to deal with that).<br>
<br>
All of the gear in question he transferred to his account, which has been suspended for a month.  I didnt get a lot of my trade bait back, and am doing the best I can to work my way back from poverty.<br>
<br>
Once I do, Darksome will get his Tolan's.<br>
<br>
As for why I dont have a guild, I was removed from Vision after a heated argument, and Vision's policy not to let such emotional things ruin the game for the officers (or something similar).  That I was removed was probably a mistake, but an irreversible one.  And since then, I have simply been picky about the guild I choose to join.  As a matter of fact, I have had several invitations to join various guilds.<br>

While at the time, there was some discussion as to if Ullric's removal from Vision was the ~most~ prudent course of action; Ullric's removal was, from the standpoint of the leadership of the guild, not a mistake.<br>

<br>
We were fighting in Live Capt. and you went off with the monk and got a kill on a Dead Capt. and looted a Soul Binder.  Putting aside the issue of whether or not the rest of the live group should have been allowed to roll for it (SK in our group had a Noc blade), you admitted that you took it from a dead captain group and agreed to give the soul binder to them.  The group agreed that was the right thing to do and it was forgotten about.<br>
<br>
I find out that not only did you kill steal (which I knew at the time but didn't say more about because you agreed to give them the loot) but you lied to your group about what you were going to do with the loot (in my opinion if it hadn't been kill stolen from dead capt. it should have been lottoed with the group).  <br>
<br>
To use the excuse that someone else was playing the account is quite frankly pathetic.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you exposed his lies Nevtay.  I know safehouse doesn't allow personal attacks, but a ring warden should not be allowed to get away with Kill Stealing and Ninjalooting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/10/01 7:59:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ahem.</span><hr size=1> I was about to ask &quot;Ok, I give up, WTF is a Ring Warden,&quot; but since I have eyes and fingers and a few other apendages...<br>

Though neither ninja looting nor kill stealing are basis for having rank removed, since the job is entirely voluntary, I figured I would not want my name to reflect on the Safehouse badly.<br>

I still maintain my innocence, however the character and name Ullric Littleblade now carry with them what could possibly end up being a bad reputation.  People see what they want to see, and in EQ, they see characters, not players behind toons.<br>

I admit to having made the mistake of trusting my character's name with someone else.  Whenever you do this, you run the risk of ruining that character's (or account's) name.
