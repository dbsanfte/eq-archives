<br>
Bullshit!<br>
I suppose that in some people's eyes, black people always look like dirty niggers who are prone to thievery and rape. And these people should just &quot;point out what they see&quot; without being ashamed of themselves, because they are only &quot;telling the truth&quot;?<br>
<br>
Nope, didn't think so.<br>
<br>
In the same line of thought, tall white men with shoty hair look like the nazi ideal. Still, it's not a really good thing to tell those men they look like nazis, eh?<br>
<br>
Like i said, prostitutes do tend to dress up in a sexy way. This does NOT mean that all women who dress up in a sexy way are for sale or look as of they were.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm quite sure that this person did not mean to hurt or offend me. But that's part of the problem. Spitting on sexy women is so commonplace in our culture that some people don't notice when they do it, or even think they do her a favor. After all, if she just get rid of that pesky selfesteem and put on some western culture equaliant of a burqua, then people will stop having dirty thoughts about her.<br>
<br>
It is true that sexy clothes gives a hint that you might be aviable for sex, and for sadomasochistic games in the case of black leather and stuff. This does however NOT give anyone any right to behave dishonorably. Same thing with if someone is rumored to often have sex with strangers, or whatever.<br>
<br>
Forcing oneself on another person is NEVER ok. <br>
There are some really discusting ideas floating around in our culture that it's ok to sexually harass or even rape someone under certain conditions, like that she is dressed in a certain way, have a certain reputation, have made sexual advances or have agreed to have sex with the person.<br>
<br>
YES, if two (or more) people are having sex and one of them say &quot;stop, I don't want to continue&quot; and the other(s) don't honor that wish but force the act to continue, then it is in fact a case of sexual molestation. Of course, the exact words &quot;no&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; doesn't have to be the stopwords, it depends on teh situation. For example, if people are tickling each other, the'll have to listen to the tone of voice rather then on the actual words. And in S/M-games people can sometimes beg for mercy and sound really sincere without meaning it. But then they always have a agreed upon safeword. Something that they wouldn''t say by misstake, and that REALLY count if they say it.<br>
<br>
Finally, I don't have anything against prostitutes. What I *do* have a lot against is people who degrade people by implying that they are for sale. As it was shown in the movie Pretty Woman, it is NOT ok to treat someone &quot;like a prostitute&quot; even if she in fact happens to be a prostitute. Asking a stranger how much she takes for a blowjob is harassment. Walking up to a stranger and tell her that with her ugly face and clothes she's probably making her living from cleaning toilets, so how much does she want for coming along to his home and workplace and clean it up, that's also harassment.<br>
<br>
Before I move on, I would just like to clarify that I am NOT attributing any of this to Wliten or to anyone else here. I am talking about the western culture on a whole, not about individuals. And the reason I started this hread is that I am pissed about the attitudes, not at any speciffic person(s).<br>

I mean some gays do...<br>
All goth people must also be hookers and or gay, cause they also wear leather.<br>
People who wear sexy undergarment most DEFINATELY are prostitutes.<br>
Congratulations people, you have just shown how people get put in Burqas and veils.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

To each her won.<br>
Every woman have a right to dress sexy or have sex with whoever she pleases (within obvious restrictions of course) without anyone getting abusive or spiteful about it.<br>
<br>
Men allready have this right, so no need to demand it. Men get other bullshit tossed their way, and that's bad as well.
