<br>
I realize we play on a first in force server, but I thought perhaps some measure of respect was alotted to those who posted their plans ahead of time.  It seems I was wrong.  I've seen several other posts on the forums between other guilds and contested areas or Mobs (I've lurked for a while, but rarely post).    Closer to home, plans that have been posted in the raid forum on behalf of my guild have been ignored by those who managed to arrive before we could mobilize.<br>
Even more shocking, there was an occasion where another guild trained us at safeside in Hate, resulting in a wipeout on their part and a wasted hour on our part as we reorganized.  Even when asked to leave the Plane, they refused, set up and pulled.  For this, Rage of Dragons is on my personal shit list.  Well done, RoD!<br>
<br>
What bugs me is this: My fellows and I try to be considerate and diplomatic in our dealings with everyone.  If we have something planned, but go there and find out someone is already there, we will just pass and find something else to do.  When the situation arises where two organizations are arriving at the SAME TIME, I thought perhaps consideration would have been given to the people who had planned to be there in advance.  Once again, I was mistaken.  Divine Legion: You arrived just as we did.  Since we were both starting to set up at the same time, we did have our rogue run ahead and grab his epic book.  You stated you wanted the second floor, but we both know you have to pull a large part of first floor to get there.  We were not going to race you or get in your way, even though you stated you didn't need the drops.   I hope you undesrstand, and I hope you enjoyed Hate.  <br>
<br>
Where does this leave a guild plays fair?  The options are limited.  We can ruin our reputation, be jerks and try to compete for the areas we are just now starting to be able to do with the other guilds in our ability range, as well as those from larger guilds who do things like pull the Statue of Rallos Zek as we are trying to pull arena mobs (no matter how helpful they are after the wipeout or how nice they are when they tell us to get lost).  That, or we can roll over and "make other plans".  As an organization, we would never do the first, so that leaves us with the second. As I said earlier, I've seen the outlook for what awaits us as we grow larger and larger: more friction from guilds already playing at that level.  I hope it gets better, I hope there is some fun to be had.  I really do.<br>

Thats one of the most idiotic and self righteous things i've read on this board, &quot;asked them to leave the plane&quot; ?? where do you get off telling another guild what zone they can or can't hunt in? you think posting here gives you any more right to be there than anyone else? 90% of the people on this server moved here so we wouldn't have to deal with this kinda BS.  Just because another guild happens to be in the same zone you are does not have to mean one of you has to leave or that one of you is more or less respectfull because they don't leave.  Learn to work with other guilds or get used to this kinda thing happening. <p>"the day i die will be the day i shut my mouth and put down my sword" - Tremain, 55 Myrmidon</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukaerilabuffaholic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaerila Buffaholic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/5/02 12:54:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is the raid forum worth a damn thing?</span><hr size=1> Tell me your entire post is a bad attempt at humour please.<br>
<br>
A big part of the player base on Ayonae moved from servers such as SolRo and Karana to flee a Raid Board and Schedule, where Planes were booked 6 months in advance.  Look at the two servers and the pissing contests over scheduling a zone are still going on to the point that many players rarely get to see a Plane before they get to level 55 average.<br>
<br>
&quot;What bugs me is this: My fellows and I try to be considerate and diplomatic in our dealings with everyone.&quot;  &quot;Even when asked to leave the Plane, they refused, set up and pulled. &quot;<br>
<br>
Am I the only one thinking that your idea of diplomacy involving telling another guild to leave, because it doesn't fit in with your plans, as opposed to ...oh....lets say...coming to an agreement on sharing the zones and making sure your pullers aren't crossing each other, is idiotic? :P<br>
<br>
And, NO you do not need to pull ALOT of bottom floor mobs in Hate to get to the second floor.  Get your facts straight before coming to whine here.  There's plenty of mobs for a guild to do the bottom and another the top - IF you talk to each other....oh wait.....you did that, by flipping em off as non important and telling them to leave.<br>
<br>
As a whole, the AyRo community seems to deal fairly well with each other without having to resort to a ridiculous Raid board.  It's called communication and respecting the other players / guild.  A new concept to you obviously, since your answer is that you own the zone simply because you called it first.<br>
<br>
Why didn't you simply type &quot;But Mooooommmm, I was here first&quot; and have done with it.<br>
<br>
Grow up or move to another server where you can be all by yer lonesome with yer guild in a Plane.....in 6 months from today.<br>

First, scroll down those raid posts. I know a while back we tried to look and not go if we saw folks posting intent. Of course there are guilds that would go park in somewhere like hate for over a week or we'd cancel and find they never went. Those get to learn to share.<br>

Try doing that when you are setting up. If someone is where we want to be, that usually shows you. A few polite tells to find out the raid leader and a little coordination and most of the time, everyone can find that happy place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Blearchie Pooh<BR>

There was no problem at all. We shared, both side were very respectful. No way leader told them to leave the plane hehe.<br>

I don't know about you all but I don't have fun when I'm watching over my shoulder or finding out the mob I came for just get taken buy another guild ect...<br>
<br>
I set aside time to play and we plan and set up times and then others show no respect for your raid.  I was present at the RoD debacle, and its a prime example of overcrowded.  We were setting up at SS and RoD tried to do rush to SS.<br>
<br>
Here we are just quietly setting up when RoD comes and trains SS.  Sad part was they didn't get any of there clerics camped after they wiped us all out luckily we had got some clerics out.  This killed tons of our time, and my time is expensive They had no respect for us in the zone, if I'd had my way I'd have let there asses rot up there but instead we rezzed there clerics and then they continued to raid our understanding was they were taking second floor but only to find out later they'ed been double dipping and pulling first floor mobs as well.<br>

<br>
Just seems stupid to me that we beat each other up half the time when were all trying to do the same thing.  Wether its intended or not from my raiding experiance thats what has happened.<br>
<br>
plus as time goes buy there will be more players attempting the high end game, meaning more crowded raid zones and if we can't all respect each other in them then were all going to walk away with a sour taste in our mouths.  Currently using the raid forum there are a good number of up and comming guilds give them half a year to get some more levels cause they have the numbers and you'll have even more people raiding the same zones.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a young player (in game time) And just getting to the high end game, Its frustrating to come here and see this attitude thats like....oh sorry about your luck.  I had always thought that this was an attitude of only a handful of guilds but its sad to see its the attitude of most guilds.<br>
<br>
Its just an eye opener for me to see it and I guess I'm left with 2 choices I continue to play with respect for other guilds plans.  Or I say screw it sorry guild A we got here first better luck next time.<br>

<br>
A good use of this forum is soliciting help from other players, like you see being done for the Naggy/Vox raids.  Also, it's a good place for people to post if they would like to join a specific raid for instructional/epic/whatever purposes.<br>
<br>
I would still like to see guilds post their intentions on raiding the planes as it helps other guilds schedule their own raids.<br>
<br>
For example, I had organized my first PoG raid on the Saturday that EW decided to drop Tunare for the first time.  This involved them and a handful of other guilds clearing the zone as fast as they could.  We showed up a couple hours after the clearing began.  Had there been a post on EW's intentions, we would have rescheduled our raid and not wasted our time.<br>
<br>
Of course, not all plane raids are planned in advance as 1 group can go to Hate/Fear and do well.  It also seems like only the smaller to mid-sized guilds post their intentions to raid a plane.  Couple thoughts to cloud the issue.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/5/02 5:07:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.questing-ranger.com/images/epics.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I would like to add</span><hr size=1> I've done a few multi-guild plane raids. If the guilds in the plane are willing to either keep to their own end of the zone or raid together it works out. Many times the guilds would contact each other about extra planar drops that they didn't need. In some cases you will find that guilds who are only going into a plane to kill its god or to go after epic mobs, will just give away all the regular armour drop to a smaller guild they are sharing the plane with.<br>
<br>
I think this all gets down to your attitude. Walk in with the attitude of &quot;we were here first so fuck off&quot; will not lead to a winning situation no matter how nice your words may be.<br>

We've done Hate a few times, Fear a few times, Growth with other folks, took down our first Fear golem the other day, etc.  We haven't been that involved in pissing contests and racing to mobs until pretty recently.  Our last couple goes at this or that place (especially Hate) have been dampened by the presence of other guilds.  Esbat has a temper and the diplomatic skills of a bullet in flight, thus the rant (which he's been bottling up for some time).<br>
<br>
The real problem with the RoD situation in Hate wasn't that they went to Hate in the first place (tho', having posted our plans, we would have liked them not to).  The problem was that, even knowing where we were camped and rezzing our dead, they trained us anyway.  Luckily, they all died and we did not.  And once we were all ported up and in place we rezzed their cleric; they weren't too happy to wait, but that's the price to be paid.  They did their thing, we did ours, and unneeded drops were called.<br>
<br>
The whole issue is a matter of tension between our ideals of honor and playing nice with the other kids in the sandbox and the realities of the server.  I don't want a schedule any more than the other guilds who fled such systems (and I'm pretty certain Esbat doesn't either).  But so long as people don't go overboard with scheduling on the raid forum PRISM, at least, is willing to give the plans of other guilds some consideration and respect.  Cheers,<br>

Raid Forum = Declaration of intent.<br>
Which everyone *will* ignore.<br>
Why? Simple... we won't allow a rotation based server. No schedules, no nothing.<br>
Now if that's wrong, that's something you'll have to take up with the rest of the server. If you wish a raid forum that declares ownership of mobx or planey, create a new board. Because I can tell you that Ayonae.ro won't help the least, and will probably counteract your intent.<br>
<br>
The part about &quot;asking them to leave... and they didn't&quot; made me ask myself who the hell you guys are to tell them to go anywhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
They were the jerks, yes. They messed up, they trained you. But they had a right to be in hate just as much as you fellas.<br>
The fact that they're idiots without skill and skilled leadership doesn't remove that right.<br>

<br>
1) Karana did not have a planes raid system that blocked up the planes for 6 months.  Planes were scheduled one week out on a first come first serve basis (and everyone started at the same place).  The gods/dragons <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on a rotation.  Pre-revamp, these could easily take 3-4 months to kill.  Post revamp, the rotation greatly shortened for a while.<br>
<br>
2) Not everyone left Karana because of this system.  Most, perhaps, but not all.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I may be the lone exception, it did not factor into my thinking when I made the decision to move.<br>

<br>
I forgot to mention this before.  We did NOT ask RoD to leave.  Or, at least, I did not, and since I was leading the raid that's all that matters.  I am aware of how the server works and the occasional need to share.  Instead, once we were set up we rezzed in their cleric.  This isn't the first time we've done this for another guild in Hate; we've shared planes before.  <br>
<br>
As Esbat said, he posted his thoughts, not those of the guild to which he belongs.  <br>

I disagree somewhat.  A lot of time we post something internally like, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Hate: Next weekend?  Any thoughts?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and then someone will post a link to another guild going up and then we'll reschedule. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>, Guildleader <a href=http://www.guildvision.org>Vision</a>, Grandmaster <a href=http://www.base-nine.org/available_tinkering_items.htm>Tinkerer</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukivornteleri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kivorn Teleri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/5/02 6:32:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is the raid forum worth a damn thing?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

What I replied to.<br>
<br>
Palimax, I'm quite aware of that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I know many guilds do.<br>
I was purposely being harsh because it's better for people to think the raid forum does nothing than to believe it will reserve something for them.<br>
