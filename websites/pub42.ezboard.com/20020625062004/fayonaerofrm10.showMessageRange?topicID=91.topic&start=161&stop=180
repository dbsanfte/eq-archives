New inky camp in the west common. Not just a group of those darky but tents and materials. After sending them back to hell, first surprise no faction hit! Second one they where not ready to attack me but just threatening. They had just some money on them, unfortunatly during the fight the priestress was going backward under my hits and she died inside the tent by the way it was not possible to loot the corpse. A lieutenant said as i was engaging him i fight something that he is from Indigo brotherhood...<br>
Report from Beffelen<br>
Again a lot of inky... and almost all creatures in this place have new names. One had a madaillon (magic lore no drop) with racial restriction to dark elves, orgres, trolls and very stange Hight Elfs!!! Lot of them have Robe (magic lore). Faction hit about Beffalen inhabitant,but as they died they say that they give there lives for the dark lady (neriak queen???). On the 3rd level there is an other new inky she is indifferent to me and answer to my Hail but not possible to go in any dialogue with her...<br>
By the same time a friend of my go to check in Black Burrows if something happen there, but no new troubles there.<br>

As you may have noticed, all Befallen inhabitants have the lastnam T'Vyl, or even names like Follower of T'vyl or Protector of T'Vyl or so.<br>
<br>
Lanys! <br>
Innoruuks Daughter, Firionas biggest enemy, she was defeated by Firiona during Bloody Kithicor and has to flee, she wishes to have vengeance on Firiona.<br>
<br>
She also wants to kill her Father (with what she WILL fail) - she is an enemy of Neriak as much as she isn't (as we formerly assumed) an ally of Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
She is simply EVIL. I think even Innoruuk got more honor in his heart than she does.<br>
<br>
So far we wondered how Lanys should be able to fight in any way cause she has no foces, no army, no folloers, just enemies.<br>
Now we got an answer. <br>
There are even Dark Elfes in West Commons now.<br>
No Faction hits, no drops.<br>
<br>
Very very concerning. She is way too close to Freeport - Neriak - Kithicor to not be concerned.<br>
<br>
- <br>
<br>
The Lady in white is not killable.<br>
I was hitting her for 15 minutes straight, did around 20khp dmg. Her HP didn't drop. Als doesn't she actually react.<br>
She is (or seems) invulnerable, even if she does take damage.<br>
<br>
Many quest items with no known purpose so far (see Lfay).<br>
Thats all I found out in around 1-2 hours in Befallen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Further investigations are needed! Post everything you know here pls.<br>

For your Info, Sir Banegrivm and I had long talks lately and our Guilds are now allied for the good of Norrath and also to have our information exchange as fast as possible.<br>
We are honored to be allied with the great Paladin of Light and I am sure it will be for the good of Ayonae Ro.<br>
<br>
________________________________________________<br>
<br>
West Commons had two camps. One being empty and the other housed dark elves all loyal to Naythox Thex the King of Neriak but yielded nae any information; other then that they seemed to be awaiting orders.<br>
<br>
Enter Befallen, the 1st floor housed necromancers and shadowknights everywhere. Some of these carried various Symbols of T'Vyl of varyious metal types. They all identified normally. The necromancers all had Gray Sr. Apprentice Robes which identified as a &quot;Robe of the Dead&quot;. Meaning the Lodge of the Dead, loyal to the Queen of Neriak. So it appears that the Queen has allied with Lanys. Now we know the real reason the Queen objected to the King's mannerisms of the hunt for Lanys, and why certain factions of Neriak allied with their King and Queen respectively.<br>
<br>
The second floor, further supported that Befallen was none other then Takish Hiz, the first elven city from which Innoruuk captured the first elven King and Queen and tortured them over hundreds of years to create the first Teir'Dal. Also note the flooring througout the entire place, can only be found in one other place throughout Norrath. Felwithe. The very same black and white checkerboard patterns.<br>
<br>
Remember that Solusek Ro arched the spine of the serpent mountains bringing the son down upon Tunaria (what we now know as Antonica) and scorched the lands. This caused all the formation of the desert of Ro and the elves abandoned what remained and made way to Faydwere where Felwithe and Kelethin came to be. The ruins are still scattered about, ever notice the scrawlings in east karana on the walls in the gorge? What goddess tis that depicted near the ruins? Contrasting black and white...definitely does nae look like Tunare.<br>
<br>
Also what further supports this is all the undead that appear throughout the area that are &quot;arisen&quot; and when slain and such seem to reflect as if armor and weapons (specifically to Arisen Knights) from an ancient time collapse into a heap. Also note that on three replacing the &quot;ELF Skeleton&quot; is now a Commander named Winddreamer I believe, sounds very elvish to me. He now carries the remenants in place for the Thex Mallet quest which coincidentally the Queen of Neriak wished, a quest coming from the Lodge of the Dead as well. Tis still unknown WHY she wanted the Thex Mallet.<br>
<br>
One other item of note on two twas that the room where the ogre remained with the locked door could nae be opened...at all. We waited for the key but could nae find it from the human female shadow knight that used to appear in the room across from the hall. The lock on said door twas also nae pickable by the 60th season rogue in our party. The only door she could nae pick within those foul blighted ruins.<br>
<br>
Down upon three we saw the same types of things but many Servants of T'Vyl as well as Guardians of T'Vyl...and heres the interesting part about it. Many were Half Elves. Some of the items down there identified normally, however were only useable by dark races...and half elves.<br>
<br>
It has been said Tayla Ironforge is a Bloodsabre and we know Lanys has sworn allegiance to the Bloodsabres. Definitely would explain the Half Elves. Something else, is theorized somehow the Nybright sisters of Lesser Faydark (still there) may be tied into it as one tis also named Tayla Nybright. Their father tis a fallen high elven paladin whose now seen as &quot;A Drunkard&quot; walking in Kelethin lamenting over his daughters who went to Antonica and &quot;something happened&quot; and they came back as murderous cutthroats. Also when the Nybright sisters are slain factions lost with Dervish Cutthroats. What happened that turned their hearts dark so? <br>
<br>
This would definitely explain how Lanys has half elf followers now, also...there tis a new quest in Qeynos which deals with investigations of the affairs therein, that rumor has it implicates an Ironforge as a Bloodsabre during the course of this investigative quest. Remember again, Lanys swore allegiance to the Bloodsabres. Also what is Tayla doing in Cabalis? If the theory is correct as stated about the alliance and Venril Sathir is involved, then that could explain her presence in Cabalis...Venril Sathir wants his empire back, and will stop at nothing.<br>
<br>
Also on three was Valizrae D'Tor the successor to Lanys as the Child of Hate, chained and shackled to the wall. Lanys twas to be ritually executed and Valizrae would siphon off the power that had been imbued into Lanys through the process of the sacrifice that would bring about Valizrae as the new child of hate. <br>
<br>
One final note, also how fitting that the Lodge of the Dead and the Queen side with Lanys...think about it, Takish Hiz is an old old old city...imagine all the bodies entombed within. Their own virtual army, just waiting for the Lodge to slowly bring to unlife. Every wonder why the place now has so much undead within? Also remember Bloody Kithicor, it starts with Tyrana Sil who takes Nurgles Stone to Neriak...she being a known member to the Lodge of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Also note she stands on the highest floor with Carson McCabe, she being an emissary/envoy to High Keep...the alliance becomes deeper entwined. Also note the Teir'Dal torturer on the lower floor and the lich of a Teir'Dal above. Also one final thing, all beings within shared the same faction.<br>
<br>
Much to ponder...  <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br><b><font size=2>~ Taino the Earth Caller ~ <br>Cavalier of the 51st Call</b><br></font>

I do not think  he has anything to do with the Tier'dal. <br>
With us he appeared in the settlement of Firiona Vie and chose an Erudite wizard to assist him, not a Dark Elf. He is surely up to something he used this Erudite to strip his apprentice from his magical powers after he supposebly sold some of Al'Kabors new spells he had researched. The apprentice tried to speak in defence but wasn't allowed and constantly interupted by Al'Kabor. Then the apprentise was sent off.<br>
This may have to do with the release of the new teleportation spells.<br>
The new Freeport newspaper also speaks of Al'Kabor chipping away at the Dreadlands wizard spires. It is still unknown why he does this. Some suspected he wanted to destroy it and be the only one who could teleport around Kunark. I suggest you read the paper yourself. If he was really trying to get only rights to teleportation on Kunark then his plan was probably failed by the apprentice who released them to the rest of the world.<br>
Oh and I also ran into a Bloodsaber necromancer in the Freeport sewers from west to north Freeport, by the name of Driana Poxsbourne. I know she wasn't here before and I think this pretty much confirmed the Bloodsabers are active in Freeport too.<br>
Just thought I'd help you out.<br>

<br>
I cannot say much about Al'Kabors plans and spells since I do not know much about it yet.<br>
I just know that the idea of Al'Kabor wanting to destroy the Teleportation possibilities for other people sounds very unpopular to me. <br>
Noone is really sure whether Al'Kabor is good or evil, but I do not think that he would want to force such a situation.<br>
<br>
After all, this assumption came from the Freeport Observer, which is written by the Milita - in an extremely unpleasant way. <br>
Actually I tend to believe that whoever the Observer attacks in the paper, is more on the good than on the evil side. <br>
The Milita is as evil as the Dark Elves in Neriak, for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
But now about Driana Poxsbourne.<br>
&quot;Oh and I also ran into a Bloodsaber necromancer in the Freeport sewers from west to north Freeport, by the name of Driana Poxsbourne. &quot;<br>
I had the exactly same happening to me and i thought the exactly same.<br>
I think, especially connected to the Observers voice against Qeynos, that we need to investigate Freeport - all of freeport, especially the Tunnels. I have the feeling that the Bloodsabres are comming over to Freeport too. <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br><b><font size=2>~ Taino the Earth Caller ~ <br>Cavalier of the 51st Call</b><br></font>

<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hey taino<br>
After reading your post i decided to throw down some of my own thoughts on aspects of your theory.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been said that Venril Sathir and Mayong Mistmoore are not on good terms, but if they could reach common ground and unite for a common goal and eliminate mutual enemies...then why not?&quot; <br>
<br>
No way bro, lol. There is no hatred more worse than that between Mayong and Venril. I don't think they'd ever ever ally, although I know what you mean, it would benefit both parties involved. But that's just like saying Firiona and Inny should ally to kill Lanys. It just wouldn't happen.<br>
<br>
Also, I seem to be the only one who is over-emphasising Trakanon's involvment in all of this. Redemption I dont think is what he is after. Revenge is his quest. He wants nothing more than the downfull of the Ring for throwing him out and laying him to waste in the ruins of sebilis. His presence is ever more so. Just take NK for instance, the center of attraction of late. The ruined stone north of the zone which once stood tall and plain is covered in tributes to Trak, and in signs of Trak himself. Why?!? It's puzzling me no end. <br>
Ok now check this out. Ak'anon. Trak'anon.<br>
Am I the only one going &quot;wtf&quot; here? Could Ak'anon have been named after a Dragon, also exiled by the Ring of Scale, and layed to waste in the now named lands of Steamfront Mountains? What if Trak'anon and Ak'anon were exiled for the same reasons as Naggy and Vox? Although we know that wasn't the case for Trak'anon. <br>
Now enter the evil lil gnomes, who I have seen more and more of within this War than at first glance. We even have a gnome walkin around reportedly in PoH.<br>
Now correct me if im wrong but there is a Gnome on Bloodsabre faction within Ak'anon, and supposedly more. What if these gnomes once served a dragon called Ak'anon and pledged revenge on the Ring of Scale?<br>
Would explain their allegience with the Bloodsabres who are strong allys with Lanys. <br>
Now enter the Lanys/Trak relationship. <br>
An alliance there isn't such an extreme possibility, surely? Both wish to see the old world in ruins, and what if Trak would forge an alliance with Lanys? Lanys is an immortal enemy of the Ring, and so is Trak. Surely with the Malevolence Lany's would make a great ally for Trak, and we all know that Trak isn't one for being loyal, he could easily turn on Lanys himself and take the Malevolence. Trak with an almighty powerful weapon? I bet the Ring of Scale wouldn't look like such a scary opponent then. Such an allegience would also benefit Lany's. Take out the Ring, and Firiona can kiss her support goodbye, and also her aid in regaining her stolen memories from the Iksar's. And that is one crucial thing Lany's wants.<br>
And this is the most evident factor which leads me in to believing a Lany's and Trak'anon alliance is that Dorvias N'keth, the archpriest of Innoruk has discovered that Lany's finally knows where the staff part of the Malevolence, the second piece, also known as the Arm of Malevolence, is. And it has been reported that the ONLY person who could possibly know its specific location is Trak'anon himself, seen as he is the one that killed the Iksar General, Tzashk, and obtained the arm of Malevolence many years ago.<br>
<br>
This theory may seem far fetched, but whenever i think about Trak'anon's involvment, it just seems that his hatred for the Ring of Scale could lead him to alliance with probably anyone. Seen as he isn;t really a bad guy, or a good guy. Just a guy looking for revenge. <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, one last thing, I have yet to check out Befallen. And the reports I'm hearing are VERY interesting. I suggest a number of us go and farm the zone, and identify any drops and check out the new spawns. If this is indeed, as Taino suggested, a new base of operations for Lany's than it is the strongest link we have in finding where Lany's is, and what she is up to. Besides, I want to see if the rumours are true about the new child of Hate being chained up in the basement. Could this be the person  Lany's kidnapped when she fled Neriak? All very interesting.<br>

<br>
hmm remember that the majority of the gnomes worship bertoxx. the ones that live in the mines. the two cults worship the same god so it stands to reason that there should be some bloodsabres in akanon.<br>
<br>
read this about trakanon<br>
<br>
The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled widely. &quot;So,&quot; Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the very ground, &quot;at last you have come.&quot; Edril, great among the elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery eyes. &quot;You have no reason to fear me, warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder races. I have been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death and gods and man.&quot; With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow knew the great beast spoke the truth. &quot;And yet,&quot; the dragon continued, &quot;I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed, warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching.&quot; Edril lifted his head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. The dragon simply nodded. &quot;Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are those among the races untouched by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man.&quot; Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair. &quot;His name is Miragul,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;a human mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics.&quot; The next face that formed was that of a troll, but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering. &quot;He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a powerful kingdom.&quot; The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. &quot;You, elf, are my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny.&quot; Trakanon spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant flashed into existence around Edril's neck. &quot;To Miragul I revealed the existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess. To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me always. But it does much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken. Soon either the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction, and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures.&quot; Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his cave. &quot;That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for their coming into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the dark of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and he will watch the whole world burn.&quot; <br>

thats just a snippet of all the info. now read it over again closely. hmm sounds like he was a exilded god/demi god before he became a dragon. who exiled him. inny? bertoxx? or maybe even tunare? ok you spoke of a dragon living where the steamfront mountains were. here comes another copy/paste about endril<br>
<br>
Of the gnomes and the empire of Felwithe: <br>
<br>
Ever the since the first days of the elven rebellion, it had been decided by the emperor of Felwithe that the gnomes would be a free race allied with the elven empire and able to live on elven lands, much unlike the almost slave-like persecution the little tinkers suffered under the rule of the dark elves. The gnomes had been granted lands surrounding the fertile Elizerain Lake and there existed for a century or more in peace with their elven neighbors. However, being on elven lands also meant the gnomes would have to follow elvish customs, and increasingly the gnomes began to feel out of place. The gnomes were builders, not artists, and they could not sing or dance or play musical instruments. Elves prided themselves on their use of the bow and their long, graceful blades but gnomish arms couldn't support the lengthy elven weaponry. And while the elven language was meant to be spoken in long, descriptive, and fluid verse, the gnomes were always prone to speak in jittery and incredibly fast sentences. Slowly, a general concensus began to form among the gnomes that someday a separate gnomish kingdom would have to be formed. The gnome most responsible to bring about this change was named Biddyn. <br>
<br>
Biddyn was born the fourth son to a poor farmer on the east of the Elizerain Lake, the gnomish territories closest to the heart of the empire. Almost immediately he recognized how much he, and even his brothers and father, hated farm work. The most joyous times in his life, as he later wrote, were the monthly festivals the gnomes held where they would gather and build all manner of fascinating machines. This, he thought, is what gnomes should be doing and he bestowed upon himself the responsibility to make sure this came to pass. Studying elven mannerisms and rhetoric on his market voyages to Felwithe with his father, Biddyn soon became a speaker the likes of which no gnome has ever equaled. His very charisma charmed everyone around him into the idea of a separate gnomish kingdom, and he soon was ready to bring his demands before the emperor. The emperor at this time was none other then Carandril, past lord of Kelethin, who had appointed the warrior Edril as his first soldier long ago and also as the head of the imperial army. Edril had served loyally and skillfully as Carandril's guard for more then a hundred years, the warrior elf being only a little more then middle-aged for his race. <br>
<br>
Charmed by his determination and skillful speaking, Edril supported Biddyn for a separate gnomish kingdom. Even the emperor was attracted to the proposition, as a new allied kingdom would open new opportunities for trade while the gnomish loss would not be a big drain on the imperial economy. After only six days of deliberation, Carandril granted Biddyn's request and plans were immediately formed for the creation of a new gnomish homeland. The emperor severed the southern part of his empire, mostly unused and barren fields beyond the steamfont mountains, and gave it to the gnomes. The land was renamed &quot;Akanon&quot; which is elven for &quot;Gift&quot; and ten gnomish settlers as well as five elven guards were prepared to make a journey into Akanon and chart the lands. <br>
<br>
Of the plague dragon and the formation of Akanon: <br>
<br>
The fifteen settlers rode out surrounded by the cheers of elves and gnomes alike, but were not heard from for many months. Finally after the fifth month of their disappearance, only one elven soldier, his clothes torn to pieces and his weapons shattered, rode solemnly through the gates of the empire. He was the last of the settlers who remained alive, and recounted his tale before an astonished imperial council. A plague dragon, with scales of an oozing black, had attacked the party soon after they had crossed into the southern lands and had claimed that the lands of Akanon were his own. For months the plague dragon chased them and hunted the gnomes and elves down. The soldier had watched each man die a slow and horrible death, and believed the dragon only let him go to give this message to the elves. <br>
<br>
The gnomes were instantly furious that Carandril had given them cursed lands to settle, and the emperor immediately ordered the death of the dragon. Frightened by the terrible story of the soldier, most of his warriors were reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril would not force anyone to fight such a terrible beast. Edril, however, immediately offered his services as a personal favor to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself volunteered five more gnomes joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish friends, Edril rode to the steamfont mountains to meet the terrible beast. What happened next is best summed up by Biddyn's own &quot;The History of the Gnomes&quot;: <br>
<br>
I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking when we approached the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our previous encounters, and from the memories of our lost friend Dolyn, we were all terrified of the beast. All of us, that is, except for Edril, but I don't think Innoruk himself could scare that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the tobacco in my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague dragon's domain, Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, looked back at me, and said &quot;wait here.&quot; With a proud determination he marched toward the black cave entrance, a portal to the lower planes if ever there was one. He marched to his death, or so we thought. But when we saw him next in two days time he pulled behind him the head of the evil beast, which left thick trails of a green poison behind it. He breathed heavily, and painful scars covered his body. I laughed, thinking that while Edril was obviously hurt, the dragon must have felt much worse before his death. Anything that inflicts that much pain to the elf must be prepared to receive the same thrashing tenfold. <br>
<br>
The skull of the dragon sits still on the entrance to the gnome's own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes would be written into gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode tirelessly through the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and charting the perfect hillside location for the first ever kingdom of gnomes. Edril spent much more time in Akanon then originially expected, personally overseeing the kingdom's construction. When the first houses were made and the first gnomish settlers came pouring in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of the gnomes and he in turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue depicts Edril's battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish craftsmanship made it enormous and actually useful: it sits in the heart of Akanon even today, acting as the central part to Akanon's extensive irrigation system. When Edril returned home to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds of proud soldiers and again proclaimed a hero. <br>

there was a dragon living in steamfront but he wasnt named akanon. read it carefully akanon means gift. this is just a small bit of what EQ told every1. to read the entier collection of stories go to everquest.allakhazam.com/..._List.html  <p>~Lvydro the water caller~

But still keep in mind.. Trakanon presented those that found and challenged him with Gifts. And you said that Akanon stands for Gift. Just..weird.<br>
But thanks for the clear up, that lays my Ak'anon theory to waste. Although, i still have a confidence in the idea that Lany's may have discovered the location of the second piece of her staff through an allegience with Trakanon. Even if it is for his own benefit, such an allegience can only strengthen the ever-growing powers of Lany's. <br>

[Sun Jun 24 13:24:37 2001] Luminere says, 'what is this malevolence of which you speak?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:24:37 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I see the name means little to you.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:24:52 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Malevolence is an artifact of tremendous power.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:24:53 2001] Golgothas says, 'The Arm of Innoruuk?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:24:54 2001] Uradis says, 'i know of maleolence'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:24:54 2001] Khyll says, 'The arm of malevolence.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:25:10 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'No, not the arm alone. That is just a piece of it.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:25:11 2001] Luminere says, 'how can we find this malevolence before lanys does?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:25:35 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I will tell you all in good time. Patience.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:25:37 2001] Golgothas says, 'Is it the power of hate, the will of Innoruuk, the spirit that I follow which you speak of?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:26:14 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Yes... it was of evil, and of so much power that Innoruuk himself ordered it dismantled.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:26:44 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'The pieces were taken to different points of Norrath and hidden in hopes that it would never again be complete.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:03 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'But Lanys seeks to do just that... to reassemble this artifact and gain the power within it.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:11 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'She already is in possession of one piece.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:27 2001] Golgothas says, 'If lanys completes it, will hate be destroyed?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:31 2001] Luinne says, 'If Innoruuk ordered it dismantled then she must not succeed'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:39 2001] Zellet says, in Dark Speech, 'she defyes the father, she knows no bounds she must be stoped'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:27:52 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'If she completes it, it would be disastrous. She must not.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:05 2001] Nephrenia says, 'So we must gather the pieces'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:07 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'My Arch Priest Dorvias works to prevent her.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:09 2001] Cazzaran says, 'How can we gain possession of those pieces before she does?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:22 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'No, you must not. Do you think I trust you with the pieces any more than I do Lanys?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:28 2001] Naythox Thex sneers contemptuously.<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:38 2001] Breldaria says, in Dark Speech, 'we should slay her?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:28:39 2001] You say, 'Then what would you have us do m'lord'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:29:08 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Dorvias works to secure the location os the arm of Malevolence and stop Lanys from retrieving it.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:29:31 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'The third and last piece, the gem, has been given to Mayong Mistmoore himself to guard.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:30:22 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'You are eager to help in this matter, but I do not desire your help in this.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:31:03 2001] Khyll says, 'If you do not disire help Sir why you speek about it then?.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:31:16 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I do not desire your help in anything. Only that, should Lanys battle the forces of Neriak, you understand which side is truly Innoruuk's.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:32:20 2001] Thorrack says, 'screw that ill run her through with my blade'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:32:33 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'You underestimate Lanys, Thorrack.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:32:35 2001] Thorrack says, 'i say we waste her'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:32:58 2001] Thorrack says, 'your saying that all the dark race ing its full power could not defeat her?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:33:09 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'She is still Innoruuk's Daughter.. her power was not fed to her constantly by the god, but was given to her in total at her creation.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:33:32 2001] You say, 'What does Lord Innoruuk desire her fate to be?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:33:51 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'She is to be killed, by Innoruuk's command.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:33:57 2001] Luminere says, 'understood sire'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:34:04 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Ahh, but in Kithicor she was doing the Father's work, and well.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:35:00 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'She is travelling at the moment... you will not find her, I doubt not.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:35:49 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Yes, most certainly, should she gain Malevolence.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:35:55 2001] Thorrack says, 'why can innoruuk not stop his daugter?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:36:21 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'He would prefer us to do his work. Through our works, the Hatred of Him spreads.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:36:53 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Mayong Mistmoore is not a deity, and it is said that the arm is guarded by the Ring of Scale. Powerful they are, but not gods.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:37:04 2001] Thorrack says, 'if tis is of such great importance to him then why doesnt he put an end to it?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:37:10 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Lanys became too wild, too haughty for her own good and for ours.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:37:21 2001] You say, 'So Mistmoore is her next target?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:37:48 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I believe she searches for the arm, not the gem, though I may be mistaken.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:39:00 2001] Golgothas says, 'So, Lanys has found the piece which Rile died with?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:39:16 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'No. The piece Rile was guarding was the arm.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:39:29 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Keep your eyes open for signs of conflict.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:39:35 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Spread the Hatred of the Father.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:40:18 2001] Naythox Thex nods.<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:41:00 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I am pleased to see that not all the Teir`Dal are zealots fallen to follow Lanys.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:41:17 2001] You say, 'I follow you M'lord and Lord Innoruuk'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:41:37 2001] Canniboliz says, 'Fear now also spreads...'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:41:53 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Yes, I have heard of Cazic-Thule's workings in the Faydark.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:42:21 2001] Calimike says, 'Should we be concerned with that, or does the Father of Hate wish to allow fear to spread un-hindered?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:42:31 2001] Luminere says, 'is there a war brewing between cazic and firiona's minions?'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:42:56 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'There may be. Our main focus at the moment, however, is that of Lanys and her schemes.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:43:56 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'If there are no other matters that need addressing, I will be going.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:44:05 2001] Calimike says, 'I believe I have learned what I need to know'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:44:24 2001] Calimike says, 'Unless you gave give me some more information on the locations I might find ring of scale members'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:44:47 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'They are deep in Kunark, and reside mainly in Veeshan's Peak, though I doubt they'll welcome you there with open arms.'<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:45:35 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'Spread Innoruuk's will, and keep a look out for the fallen child. '<br>
[Sun Jun 24 13:45:45 2001] Naythox Thex says, 'I will return when the whim takes me.'<br>

Event in SF...<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
<br>
 While hunting in Skyfire, we heard a message to the following extent:<br>
<br>
&quot;The ground shakes and rumbles as a majestic Grey dragon swoops out of the cauldron otherwise known as the only exit of Veeshan's Peak.&quot;<br>
<br>
The following messages described him flying above and looking for a place to land, finally landing at the orb near the Overthere zone. His name was Lord Kazira.<br>
<br>
Lanys T'Vyl then entered the zone and approached Lord Kazira demanding to know where the Arm of Malevolence was hidden. He said he couldn't give it to her, as it was actually a part of him. He said the power of the staff would destroy Lanys T'Vyl if she were to hold on, she got impatient and blew the dragon to smithereens and picked up the staff. Then:<br>
<br>
&quot;Black smoke rises from the ground as a dark elf steps from the mist&quot;<br>
<br>
Lanys shouted Reward to the first one to give his name!<br>
<br>
Almost on instict I shouted Dorvias N'Keth! Yes, it was him, Dorvias N'Keth. He told Lanys to give him the staff before she got the third part and she doomed the rest of Norrath. They fought and whined and cried to each other for 10 minutes and then he said You do not understand the origin of Malevolence! Lanys said Well then tell me, pawn of Naythox, what the origin truly is?<br>
<br>
The staff once had the essence of Innoruuk in it as it was passed down generation to generation in the Dark Spires. The power of their god was feared, so they broke the staff into 3 parts and hid them at opposite ends of Norrath. She accused Dorvias of being Mistmoore's brown-noser, he was trying to ally with Lord Mayong so he would be given the third piece of Malevolence which she confirmed, indeed, Lord Mayong has, a gem. So after Lanys kicked Dorvias' arse he disappeared and she rewarded me and some warrior Keef with coins and summoned us to neriak to hand them in. I am very sorry I do not have logs for this, but it should happen on all servers so be on the look out!<br>
<br>
The plot thickens..<br>
<br>
-Kolyenyo Riftkeeper <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
<br>
She has the second piece of the Malevolence, now all she needs is the Gem from Mayong.<br>
Now hoping this hasnt happened on Ayonae Ro yet, we need to get some ppl in SF quick. I camped Halo there, by the orb and am gonna keep a close eye on it.<br>
Also.. MM!! We need scouts and a mini-army there for when Lany's shows up, which she inevitably will.<br>
However, what was strange about this event was King Naythox's priest said that the only dragon who knew where the arm of Malevolence was, was Trakanon. Howcome it was Lord Kizira? Wierd. Anyways, lets be on the guard ppl, Lany's only needs one more part, and we need ALL of our efforts to makesure she doesnt. And you heard what will happen if the staff is whole again: &quot;doomed the rest of Norrath&quot;<br>

Just one thing, do you have a Veeshan's Peek key? LOL<br>
Lord Kazina exists in Veeshan's Peek, and that would be the only way to contact him.<br>
But we need our armies in SF, and quickly. Its happened on 4 other servers since last night, so this won't be as delayed as the Firiona and Cazic event was.<br>
We all need to meet there tonight, let's make a time or just all say that we'll head there when we log on.<br>
It's important that we confront Lany's, and at least launch some sort of attack if she shows up, even if she kicks our asses. Although if she can kill the dragon Lord Kazira, we do not hold much hope. Even if she is attackable by PC's.<br>
Even if we can't attack her, we can at least gain much more information than usual. And just a chance to see her battle it out with a dragon is cool :P<br>
Anyways, take high note of this guys, we need to be in SF now!<br>

The problem is they don't fit with his ....reputation.<br>
<br>
Trakanon was once a noble blue dragon, a trusted friend of Jalad Dar, and speculated wingmate of Phara Dar long ago. As well, he is said to be a first brood dragon, which would make him one of the direct descendants of Veeshan herself. Yet...he claims in the story of Eldril to be even older than the others. The first of her descendants perhaps? Or did he exist as an entity before ....Yet his claim may suggest he is in league with another force. One might think him some sort of possible link to The Nameless. That is...if he is gifted with prophecy as the Eldril story suggests ! Klandicar, I believe (not sure as I havn't been able to speak to him for some time) claims to be the oldest, as his time to rest in the Necropolis comes soon. I've never entirely thought the Eldril story &quot;fit&quot; so well with the way things were going. We seem to have more than one dragon claiming to be the Elder. Trakanon, in Sebilis (meaning this was after his imprisonment by the Ring for his actions against the Iksar fleet, and after the death of Jalad Dar) discussing the future with Eldril. It may be he has maintained his &quot;nobility&quot; then, or he was quite mad, and at the time merely considered himself a prophet, and ancient in the sense he claims. <br>
<br>
Now, were he a prophet, and able to see things that would come to pass. It's safe to say there has been a reason for his actions that went against those dragonkin he was most  &quot;loyal&quot; to. Perhaps exile was a small price to pay, to ensure certain events were or were not allowed to take place. It may very well be that Trakenon went against the wishes of the Ring of Scale to assault the Iksar fleet those years ago because had the fleet not been stopped....something unfortunate would have happened. Wether in Trakanon's eyes (it's not yet clear when he lost his &quot;nobility&quot;) or Norrath as a whole.  As well, it could very well be that Trakanon knew even then the importance of the Talisman kept by Rile.  <br>
<br>
Incredible speculation , that I thought to share. It would rely on the story of Eldril being &quot;legit&quot;, and would mean that the story line taking place currently has been in the works for some time. Trakanon did wish for the Iksar to be stopped, and whispered among the Ring of Scale they were a threat. Even then, long ago....did he know of the Talisman ? What else did Trakanon see.....?<br>
<br>
Now he may wish revenge on the Ring for making him an outcast, but we're not yet clear on the facts behind it all. Is Trakenon wise, and blessed with foresight? Or his he manipulative and treacherous?<br>
<br>
Just some possibilities of Trakanon's involvement <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I just wanted to clarify a few things, mainly about the new chosen child of hate etc, anyway here's an event which is interesting that happened last week:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With orders from King Naythox Thex, Dorvias N'Keth (the King's royal advisor) sent a herald to locate and bring back Tsajin K'Layn. She was found lurking within the East Commons tunnel.<br>
<br>
Once she arrived, the King offered her 10% of the Neriak Royal Treasury if she could accomplish one task. King Naythox explained &quot;The Dead have removed an item from Neriak that we desire. An item that deserves to be in the hands of the Priesthood. There is one named Ashteth T'Dral...he is the son of a Prophet, and a young Prophet himself. Queen Cristianos has removed this item, a Tome of Rites, to the depths of Najena. There Ashteth is guarding it. The Priesthood needs this Tome. You need not know why, just that we need it, and that you will be rewarded for its return to Dorvias.&quot; Tsajin called to the small crowd around her and they ran to Najena to retrieve the Tome.<br>
<br>
<br>
Drelzna was found already waiting outside of Najena, yet was no match for the crowd that had gathered. Moments after Drelzna fell, Ashteth appeared. As soon as Tsajin questioned Ashteth about the Tome he slipped it out from his robe and handed it to her, then cryptically said, &quot;You have done well to fulfill your part in history. Take the Tome with my most sincere regards to his Majesty and inform him we will meet in due time. Return quickly lest her Majesty take note of the missing Tome&quot; The crowd hesitated momentarily, wondering if it could have really been that easy, yet Tsajin reminded them there was a reward to be claimed and they all excitedly traveled back to Neriak.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving into Neriak's Third Gate, the crowd located and gathered around Dorvias, who asked for the Tome. Tsajin, was wary and so refused to give up the book until she spoke to the King himself. She wanted the promised reward! Dorvias led the group to King Naythox who, after assuring Tsajin of his and the Priesthoods appreciation, struck Tsajin down and said &quot;There is a lesson to be learned from her actions.&quot; The crowd stood helpless and appalled until the King brought them from their thoughts by shouting, &quot;My fellow Tier'Dal, listen a moment. A powerful ceremony is to be attempted.&quot; The crowd then followed the King down thru several passages until they came upon a large room.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Across a small moat and up a small hill stood two figures, an Elfin youth and a Dark Offerer, awaiting to be sacrificed. Dorvias pulled the Tome, a Book of Dark Rites, from his bag and swiftly killed the Dark Offerer, then shouted, &quot;Innoruk, the Dark Father, to you we give the blood of an innocent, the child of your enemy and the body of our birth.&quot; Then, just as swiftly, the frightened Koada'Dal died beneath his hands. Dorvias slowly turned around and shouted, &quot;With these children of light and dark, now cradled forever within your hated embrace, accept your gifts and return us to your guidance.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
The very walls of Neriak shuddered as waves of Hate surged thru the city. The Avatar of Hate appeared atop the hill and searched the crowd. Suddenly Ashteth stepped from the group and with a bow, conversed privately with the Avatar for a few brief moments. With a nod, Ashteth turned to address the crowd as the Avatar disappeared. &quot;It would appear,&quot; Ashteth shouted, &quot;that your assumptions concerning &quot;The Child&quot; was indeed correct. A duty has been placed before each of you. Dorvias, Lanys is no longer required. She has become a waste, a mockery of his work. You are to perform another rite, as you have done here today. This power will restore the power lost in the creation of Lanys. The Avatar told me of another...a child. She has been taken by those loyal to Lanys, and placed in a Keep that has been warded against all these that are tainted with the Touch of the Plane of Hate. It has been so strongly warded that Lanys herself cannot safely enter there. This place is Befallen. You must recover the child. This is the will of the Father.&quot; King Naythox had listened intently thru all of this, then turned and said to the group, &quot;My fellow Tier'Dal, we shall soon call upon you again, to bring us all to glory. We will rightfully take what is ours. Prepare yourselves, and your countrymen! You shall hear from us again soon.&quot; With this said, the King and Dorvias turned and were gone.<br>

Anyways what I'm thinking is real interesting is that this new child of hate, Zerinae D'Tora, is chained to the wall on the bottom level of Befallen. Why?<br>
Me thinks VERY strongly that this is linked to Mayong.<br>
Mayong wants revenge on Innoruk for cursing him in to his present state, no? What better way to do that than to kill his new chosen child of hate. Thus, Lany's has the best trade for Mayong, in order to get her last piece of the Maleovence, the gem. <br>
However, we know that Lany's has taken over Befallen, BUT, she herself cannot even entred as it is blessed with so much hate &quot;It has been so strongly warded that Lanys herself cannot safely enter there. This place is Befallen&quot;<br>
So, how the hell is she gonna use Zerinae D'Tora to her advantage?<br>
Just some new things to think about.<br>
Also, is it me or is there a real lack of activity on this board lately? More happenings than ever lately and not many ppl seem to be acknowledging them.<br>
