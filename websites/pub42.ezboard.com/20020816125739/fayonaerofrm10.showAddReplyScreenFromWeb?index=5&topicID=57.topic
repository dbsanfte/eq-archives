<br>
The sun had climbed high into the sky, and bright yellow beams of sunlight cut through the forest canopy over Kelethin, on what would normally be a cheerful spring day.  From the shadows in front of the caged door of his room, Ullric judged he had an hour until midday. Maybe less.  A pair of travelworn leather boots crossed his field of vision, and the barbarian looked up from where he sat against the back wall of his cell.<br>
<br>
Standing before him was another wood elf, his long blond hair tied back into a pony tail that fell to his waist. His skin was tanned as much as any other, but to the rogue, his skin tone was darker, almost sinister. He wore no cloak, but a breastplate of shining mithril over a long sleeved green tunic, and simple leather leggings.  Slung at his waist were a pair of wicked looking longswords, with ornate silver handguards wreathing the laquered black hilts.  Ullric recognized him on sight.  &quot;Guard Captain Elowyrn.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man smirked, &quot;Ullric.  Long time no see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ullric grinned wryly, &quot;Not since you kicked me out of your city two years ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elowyrn slowly wrapped his hands around the bars of the cell door, &quot;Yes, it seems longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does it?  Seems like just yesterday to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf glared, &quot;I should have killed you when I had the chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ullric chuckled, &quot;Looks like you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed.&quot;  Elowyrn turned his head, &quot;Guards!  Prepare the prisoner.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two guards entered the room, pulling Ullric to his feet by his arms.  They quickly made sure his bonds were secure before tying the loose brown robes to his limbs, so that no clothing swung freely from his body.  Once this was done, he was pushed into the dappled sunlight.<br>
<br>
Up and down ramps, over crowded and empty plazas and platforms, he was lead, through the winding tree city of Kelethin.  Everywhere they went, people stared with subdued anger and fear.  Ullric kept his eyes on the back of the guard in front of him.  Occasionally curses were flung at him in elvish that he only half understood.  Presently they convoy reached its destination.<br>
<br>
The large platform was teeming with wood elfs, all there to witness the event.  The crowds murmur rose to a fever pitch as Ullric was led through them to a cleared area, where he was roughly shoved up against the wide bole of the tree the platform was built around.  There he was held as four guards wound cord around the tree, binding him securly in place.  For the first time since leaving his cell, Ullric looked up, his pale blue eyes scanning the crowd.<br>
<br>
Most of the onlookers shied away from his gaze, but he picked out a half dozen who didnt, all familiar faces.<br>
<br>
Aracelt was there, his bow strung and propped over his shoulder non-chalantly.<br>
<br>
A pair of half elfs, resplendant in blue armor, trying their best to look inconspicuous, but on the whole failing.  Faranor and Poldar.<br>
<br>
Another half elf leaning against the wall of a building built at the edge of the platform.  His cloaked form was hidden mostly in shadow.  Skotti.<br>
<br>
A human, standing by himself, a satisfied lear on his face.  Zommy.<br>
<br>
And standing nearly in the front of the crowd, so he could view the event, was Haak.<br>
<br>
At the end of the platform, across a lane cleared of crowd, Elorwyrn stood, holding a black laquered recurve bow, strung with an arrow nocked.  Even at thirty paces, Ullric noted the black fletching.  Across the crowd, he could hear someone shouting above the din.  He couldnt make out any words, but the rogue recognized the voice as that of the head of Kelethin's High Council.  The crowd roared, and Elowyrn raised his hand in recognition of their approval.  Eventually, they quieted, and after a long pause, the elf raised the bow, pulling back the string until the arrow fletching rested next to his cheek.<br>
<br>
Ullric watched his doom patiently, prepared to accept the death he had so often cheated.  Time seemed to draw out, the murmur of the crowd silencing around him, the edges of his vision blurring as the Captain of the Guard came into crystal sharp focus.  Elowyrn blinked once, and took in a deep breath.  This was it.<br>
<br>
Reality crashed back into him in one breathless jolt.  Seemingly from nowhere, a white fletched arrow struck the blackened bow just above where Elowyrn held it.  Elowyrn cried out in suprise, the force of the impact pushing the bow down and to the left as he released his own arrow, which struck the wooden floor of the platform with a quiet thud, drown out by the roar of the crowd.  Ullric looked around in suprise, but found Aracelt standing as stunned as him, bow still on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Haak was the first to spring into action, as chaos erupted around them. He lept forward, drawing a slim knife and slicing the cords binding Ullric in one uppercut sweep.  Ullric stumbled, but Haak was there to catch him, sliding the shiv into his palm as he did so.  Already Elowyrn was rushing forward, closing the distance between them.  He drew his wickedly keen longswords, aptly named Guard of the Fay.  Ullric knew he stood no chance against him with just the small dagger he wielded.<br>
<br>
Yet before the captain could reach him, another stepped into his path.  Smaller than him, the female form wielded lightning and steel in her hands, bringing the flashign weapons to bear on the charging man.  Elowyrn only just saved himself from her initial assault, and recovered quickly.  Ullric knew at a glance that the woman, her face covered by a full helm carved in a grim, stoic visage, was the legendary Warderess, Scarabae, Lady Gently.<br>
<br>
Haak shouted a warning, only just in time, Ullric found himself backpedalling from another assaulting guard, who swung a rapier in clumsy strokes at the skilled rogue.  Behind and to his right, the barbarian could hear friendly voices, calling for his aid.  One quick riposte and the guard fell, bleeding badly from the neck.  Ullric scooped up the fallen elfs rapier and looed around.<br>
<br>
Chaos had ensued on the platform.  The crowds were panicked and rioting, amid them he saw three half elfs, a bastion among the angry swirl of the crowd.  The larger man began making his way towards them, shouldering his way easily through the crowd.  He had covered half the distance when he looked around again, catching his bearings.  A flash of light caught his eye, and he found Scarabae again, at odds with Elowyrn still, now dueling near the edge of the platform.  Her green scaled armor was scored and scratched in several places, and he was bleeding from a deep cut to the thigh, but neither was lagging in ferocity.  For a moment, Ullric was torn in his course of action.<br>
<br>
Then she stumbled.  Elowyrn captiolized on her error, pressing forward as she tried in vain to fend off his blows.  Ullric surged through the crowd, heedless of his own danger.  He saw her stumble again, and Elowyrn pounced, bringing one of his blades down on the defenseless ranger.<br>
<br>
Not fast enough, for at that moment, Ullric was upon him.  The shiv in his left hand stabbed into Elowyrn's attacking forearm, giving only when it struck bone.  The elf yelped in suprise, twisting his hand and pulling the dagger from Ullric's grip.  Ullric's momentum carried him forward, colliding with the smaller man.  In the close quarters, he could not defend himself from the guard captain, who brought up the other blade, half to strike, half to defend himself.  More luck than skill brought the blade into Ullric's flesh, biting into him at his left wrist, the blade sheared easily through bone and cartilidge.<br>
<br>
Ullric could react in no way, staring at the bleeding stump that remained of his left hand, as he and Elowyrn fell into the abyss beyond the platform. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A> at: 12/4/01 6:11:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugreldek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Greldek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/11/01 7:24:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gnomesig.homestead.com/files/gnome1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Execution.</span><hr size=1> Nice story &amp; well writen, one thing is missing though..<br>
