It was the doctor-killers I called rightwing extremists, not Bill O'Reilly. Surely we can all agree that a person who walk armed into hospitals, with the intention of murdering the first whitecoated person he see, is a extremist?<br>

Again, it's our minds that entitle us to human rights. NOT our number of toes. With lump of tissue I do not mean it have to be spherical or anything. Hey, it can look like a fully grown Pamela Andersson for all I care. If it doesn't have a mind and doesn't have a brain that could fit a mind, no way in hell I'm going to consider it a person and care about it.<br>
<br>
Lets say the real Pamela Andersson had a really bad accident. Lost both legs and arms (including that nice and even number of toes and fingers) and had the skin burned from her head and torso so the silicone fell out and she could no longer be physically recognizeable as human. But with medical help she would still be able to survive and communicate, her mind would still be intact.<br>
<br>
Then some doctor gets the idea to clone her organs (all except the brain) and assemble them to a new body that looks just like her old one. This new body would have human genes, looks that many consider beautiful, and it would have that precious number of toes. Which one of these Pamelas do you consider to be the one that should have the identity and the human rights? The person without the ten toes, or the mindless flesh-doll with the pretty smile and the right number of toes?<br>
<br>
Terhas,<br>
&quot;What if's&quot; works both ways. I'm talking about odds and chances, if you allready know the future then you don't have to consider it. Just follow the one true map. Must feel comfortable. But not really useful, because you will always end up with those questionmarks no matter what you do. Which feels worse, btw? Having a abortion and knowing that things might have changed so it might have had a chance of leading a happy life, or not having a abortion and see a person as in Flexure's example suffer for almost the whole following century because of YOUR choise? Which do you think would have generated the largest numver of questionmarks?<br>
<br>
ainwein,<br>
Yes, you can adopt away children you won't care for. Sadly enough, those who don't care for their children often don't care to adopt them away either. Far too many children grows up unloved. Anyhow, you can't adopt away the child from you, but you can't adopt away from the child the body you have once given it. Even you you don't have to live with your choises, your child do. <br>
<br>
Children deserve to be born without defects. If they come out crippled then it's not their fault. The blame belongs to the parents and doctors who wouldn't care enough to let the child have a healthy start in life. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I would like to add that the horrors you bring up are REAL.<br>
As opposed to the &quot;children&quot; the &quot;pro-live&quot; people claim to care about.<br>
<br>
If we are to label abortion as killing or murder, then it's only because someone have decided in a very abstract and theoretical sense that these limps of tissue should somehow be considered children. <br>
<br>
Sure enough, some anicent pope once decided that the Soul is inserted at conception, and every good scientologist &quot;know&quot; that the egg is flooded with milions of stray souls the first time it divides.<br>
<br>
But if you arn't a conservative chatolic or cult member or such, then you have no rational reason to believe in any of that stuff. And even if you are of the faith, it's your faith alone that give you your opinion. And faiths should not be pushed on other people. If I believe that trees have souls it doesn't give me a right to wreak vengance upon those who cut down trees, and so on.<br>
<br>
If you have to weigh obeviously real people against things that are only people in some theoretical abstract sense according to some or other esoteric faith or theory, reality must take priority. faiths may be true and they may not. They might all be wrong, they might most certainly not all be true. But the real people are undoubtely there.<br>

<br>
I agree either way you end up with question marks. My point is two fold. One, I personally given a chance even if it is 1 in a million would rather have the chance at a normal life. Which brings the second part. If you end the life before it even has a chance you elimate all of the posiblities good or bad.<br>
<br>
You, I or anyone can not tell the future. I certainly would never attempt to even guess at it when it involves the life or potential life of another human being, let alone my own child.<br>
<br>
There is always another option aside from termination. Abortion is the quick easy answer to a larger set of problems. From what I know of the women and men who have consented for their female partner to have an abortion, all of them have done it as a way out of the consquences of their actions. There are of course those that have had abortions for other reasons, I am speaking directly of the women and men I know.<br>

<br>
Watch an ultrasound of an abortion in progress sometime. You will see the Fetus even at 3 weeks so signs of self preservation. Is that not a sentient act?<br>
<br>
All of that aside, the fetus will grow into a sentient human being after a normal gestation period. Abortion stops the normal growth of the embryo into a fetus into a baby. So IF you destroy a fetus then you have destroyed a Baby?<br>
<br>
Not bad logic but slightly flawed. There is an assumption the gestation will go as normal and the baby could have been born. Which bring me back to my point. There is no logical reasoning that isnt flawed on abortion. You just do not know, because you can never know the future.<br>

I agree 100 percent that children should be able to be born without defects. The answer is not killing imperfect fetus's though. I have been really holding this back because of the implications, but considering your view on abortion and the explanation of why you feel it is right, I feel a need to bring it up.<br>

<br>
Gettin awfully close when you talk about aborting just because of birth defects then tossing in blaming the parents. Unless the parents knowingly enage in sex to have a baby knowing 100 percent that the child would be born with defects, then how can you blame the parents?<br>
<br>
It is always sad, when a child is born and there is no one there to love them and raise them in a decent manor. Even in that realm there are still shining examples of people overcoming their inadequate birth rights, and literally changing the world.<br>
<br>
Under your point of view their lifes would have ended before they ever began and the world would be that much worse for it.<br>
<br>
I feel the best that any of us can hope to do, is to help whenever, however we can. So that the odds of someone with disabilities, birth defects, an unloving home enviroment, and any other diveristy that has lead them to an abnormal/negative upbringing can actually have a better chance at becoming something better than where they started.<br>
<br>
In Flexure's case, I do not see the problem 100 percent in their disability. I see the problem with the enviroment. People talking in the third person right in front of them. That is just rude and hurtful. It shouldn't happen. To leave someone to sit and rot away is wrong. The answer I see is not in aborting any and all possible birth defected fetus's. It is changing how we treat people with such problems. So that they can lead some form of productive life, and enjoy atleast a basic quality of life.<br>
<br>
Watch the Special Olympics&quot; tell me those disabled people have life so horrible. They don't because of the enviroment they are in. By your reasoning <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> as I understand it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> they never should have been born in the first place for fear of the opposite.<br>

Bad argumentation Cristo, "what if" can also be employed with "what if your child is the ante christ?' and so.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this thread has slipped from it first subject : Will you be able to keep a child that has physical or mental problems. But the abortion theme can bring some different colors : you know your child will have problems, will you keep it ? As I said, if you don't know anything before the birth, you will keep him/her and love him/her because (s)he's your child. But at the first ultrasound, the doctor tells you there are 95% chances of malformation. What are you gonna do ? And this I can't really answer. Especially as a man I think.<br>

Never EVER use the cheap &quot;that sounds like something Hitler could have said&quot; trick in a serious discussion. Plzkkthx.<br>

Hitler did a lot of things. Some good, some bad, and some horribly bad. He made sure good roads got built, and then he had 12 million individuals murdered in concentration camps. (The six millions who WASN'T jews are still forgotten by most people.) This doesn't mean that building roads is a bad thing, okey?<br>
<br>
As for the part you quoted, it's race mysticism and totally of topic. Either you don't understand what I'm talking about or you just try to smear me. I'll assume it's the former.<br>
<br>
I am not talking about building a master race or any such nonsense, and I find the question itself offensive. All I'm talking about is that if you are born without disabilities then you have better chances in life then if you are born with serious disabilities like the ones mentioned by Flexure. And you allready agreed on that part, so it's not even a issue.<br>

If you never have a child, then you don't give your children any chance. True. This goes not only for abortion, but also for not getting pregnant in the first place. This is one of the prime reasons why the Chatolic Church think condoms are evil. Logically they should also consider celibacy to be evil then, but one can't expect too much logic of them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

On the other hand, if you have a certain number of children, they should have as good chances as possible. Lets say you will have one and only one child. Getting a damaged fetus and abort it and then get pregnant again and keep the undamaged fetus, that will give your one child a much better chance then if you have the damaged fetus evolve into a child and then use pills or condoms to not get pregnant the second time.<br>
<br>
Your point would thus be quite illogical if you didn't cinsider the fetus to actually be a child. That's the core difference, I think. I cosider them potential children, while you consider them to allready be the people they might one day become. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
I do not believe that we humans are merely products of our genes. We evolve by input from our surroundings and from the choises we make ourselves. A fetus have a genetical and biological structure, but the development of the real person have not yet started. If time was split in two worlds and the child was born in both, it would be likely to evolve into two very different persons, no more alike then two twins who havn't grown up together.<br>

You don't know unless you look. And if you can look, it's your responsibility to do so. All parents can know 100% if the fetus is damaged or not, just go to the hospital and take the tests.<br>

If someone is crossing a street and is about to get run over by a truck, is the answer then to pull him in so he can cross again when it's safe, or to visit him in the hospital and try to make him feel good about never again being able to move his legs or be without a diaper?<br>
<br>
Well, of COURSE the first choise should be to pull him in. Failing that, done is done. Do what you can to cheer him up, but don't fool yourself that it's as good as it would have been to save him in the first place. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
Really ... if we talk about the soul and for those who actually do believe, then the soul is something granted by God. Now the question for you is does God give you this soul pre-birth or at birth itself .. once you can proove me the actual "conception" of the soul then I will discuss that topic. Then again you would need to proove that God actually exists which again you won't be able to do.<br>
So let's please put religion aside and look at this topic scientifically (sp).<br>
<br>
When you are pregnat several tests are being made. Due to these tests you can at least tell if your child has noticable defects. If the child you bring onto this earth has defects that could be considdered life threating once born, then why would you want to put a child on this earth that will probably (let's say 80+%) die.<br>
Now a lot say .. what if ...<br>
<br>
Now what if you put your child on this earth and the child has defects that will make it whish every day it rather would not have been born?<br>
What if you put a child into this world that from that day on will be called elephant man because YOU felt the need to put a child with big defects on this earth making it a freak of nature that will never ever ever be able to live a joyfull life?<br>
The same reaso people say you can not decide for this child will probably also make this persons life hell.<br>
<br>
Would you marry this person? Would you even think of touching this person? Do you do so now?<br>
I think not .. yet you feel that people can not decide to not bring this person to earth because of some reasons that all have to do with a what if ...<br>
<br>
I think you should look at yourself and how you react to these people before you decide to judge on those people who feel they don't want to bring a kid on this earth that will live a living hell.<br>
<br>
You don't deny people life .. you prevent people from joining hell.<br>

<br>
[/quote]<br>
<br>
We are not discussing people who get born and then their mother/dad sorta neglects them... I agree .. there can be a chance this kid may grow old a better man/woman.<br>
<br>
But please take a look into the gettho .. how many people out there who are denied a normal way of living due to their surroundings have come out for the better?<br>
How many kids die out there day by day? Is this because they are defected people? No ... It's because society fecked em up and is not willing to put their arms around em. This is your life as well .. you too can do something about it yet probably choose not too .<br>
Because if you feel that these person should get as much love as you do .. then why don't you take this kid into your home? (this goes to the one who keeps saying adoption)<br>
<br>
Now .. again about the adoption thing.<br>
<br>
Ehm .. but why don't you take some kids into your home from like central africa who have no chance to live a normal life .. <br>
<br>
And while we are at it ...<br>
I think a lot of people who are "faithfull" to God are also out there bombing innocent people .. they are called soldiers and take lifes every day.<br>
What gives them the right to kill people?<br>
Hmmm .. see .. if you take this a tad bit further where you seem to feel you are saying you can not kill a pre-born person .. then why can you kill kids/men/women because your "leader" said so?<br>
<br>
Now ofcourse a lot of that has to do with protection of your own etc etc ... but ... Isn't aborting a kid who is defected pre-birth protecting of your own also?<br>
Aren't you protecting that kid for the horror he is about to enter?<br>
<br>
Please .. think about the kid and not about yourself .. think about the life you can or can't give. Think about the pain you are or aren't going to cause before you start saying that .. this kid may be an einstein... because 99% won't be .. 99% will end up rotting away in some home .. where you might visit it about 2 times a week ..<br>

<br>
I can't wait to have my own kids we've even discussed adoption.  Our family income will ensure that we can provide a great home and lots of opportunity to our kids however this doesn't mean we don't want to enjoy our lives as well.  <br>
<br>
Certain disabilities impact the familys significantly not just parents but syblings.  A child with a mental disability might be enjoying themselves but causeing depression on all the other members of the family.  I would never choose knowingly to have a child with down syndrome.  As for wether you agree or disagree with abortion the point is moot luckily freedom of choice exists where we live and freedom to exercise that choice is up to the individuals involved.<br>

You may think that there's no difference between killing a person, any person, and aborting a fetus that don't have a mind and don't yet even have the biological foundation for developing a mind. I think it's a silly opinion, but that's up to you. <br>
<br>
However, it is NOT up to you to attribute such a opinion to people like Khala, Ytrok and me, when it's so obvious that we don't share it. IF we shared that opinion and yet was pro-choise, then your statement would be logical. But it's very clear that we don't. And if you don't assume we share the opinion, then there is no honorable logic to your statement. Either it becomes pure nonsense, or it becomes a threat - a vauge hint that people who don't share your views ought to be murdered.<br>

MURDER: the act of taking a life.<br>
<br>
Now before I get started on this post, I would like to say Terhas, I love you man <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now some will say how can it be murder, when there is no life to be taken? Simple answer. IT IS LIFE. It has a heartbeat, it has a nervous system, IT HAS A BRAIN. It moves on its own, it even sucks its thumb, for petes sake.(lump of flesh, what load of horse crap) <br>
Some say, your arm is a lump flesh, lets cut it off because its got a defect. I have an aunt, her arm is malformed from birth, but boy, can she do stuff with that arm! Now her parents could have had the arm amputated, but they didn't. I see her so full of life, she's had her ups and downs, but she has LEARNED, how to deal with it, and turn it around and make something good about it.<br>
<br>
I have this neighbor kid with down syndrome. What a spunky little kid he is. He has lots of friends and they stick up for him when others come pick on him. He shrugs it off, and goes and hugs the person picking on him. How many of you, would go hug that person that was just picking on you? We ALL can learn from these people.<br>
<br>
What gives us the right to take a life? These two prime examples, are what life is all about. Live and learn to overcome our hardships. My wife is expecting our fourth child, now say that this child has some serious defect, what would I do? I would let the doctors have their say, and it would be up to my wife and I to decide. Our descision will have already been made. My other three children, has had the chance for life and I would say from my standpoint, they are enjoying life, to their fullest. One of them even has a defect, his hands are stuck in the forward position, but that hasn't slowed him down any, he has LEARNED how to over come his disability, and is very active and happy.<br>
<br>
Abortion= MURDER<br>
<br>
Even when this so called (lump of flesh) is in there, there is still life inside, its growing, if it wasn't alive there would be no life. <br>
<br>
So, lets sum up, what we have learned today:<br>
<br>
1. ABortion=MURDER<br>
<br>
2. Life is a learning experience.<br>
<br>
3. Those with defects, still have the zest for life.<br>
<br>
4. Life is full of surprises, some good, some bad, and we learn from them.<br>
5. My wife is pregnant, OH BOY!!<br>

I don't think that anyone here is saying that abortion is a good thing.  However, if carrying a child to term is going to result in horrendous circumstances for the mother or the resulting infant, (and as an already extant person, the rights of the mother must supersede that of the fetus, all else being equal) then yes, I would have to say that there are situations where having access to a safe, legal abortion is the least harmful alternative.  And yes, women do still attempt to inflict pregnancy termination on themselves in this country when they do not have access to proper facilities or shame, poverty, or lack of access to transportation (91% of the counties in the US have no provider, including 7 entire states) prevent their going there.  Outside the US, particularly in Latin America, the number of annual hospitalizations and deaths due to illegal abortion attempts is truly staggering.<br>
<br>
I've already participated in one lengthy abortion debate on this board some time ago, and don't particularly care to get involved in another.  Flexure asked what *we* would do if put in the situation she described; and if it were my pregnancy, and I knew early enough that my offspring was going to be profoundly defective, I would choose abortion as the most humane course of action, for myself and the child.  Under my current circumstances I would be hard pressed to care for a normal child, much less a 'special' one; and the State schools here in the US are full of children (and adults) who were left to languish there when their parents could not or would not care for them anymore.<br>
