Most of you made me feel quite welcome in the world of Norrath, and were wonderful friends.  From my begginings on the Cazic Thule server (hence my EZBoard name) up untill now, I have been haveing fun with a great many of you.  <br><br>When I first started playing Everquest, I had no idea what I was getting into.  I remember my first time signing on and really feeling like I was in and part of a different world.  Yes, at first it was the game that made it fun... running around killing bats and rats and whatever else I felt brave enough to fight.  But as my character grew I came to find that it was the people in Everquest that really made it so special.<br><br>Now, I have decided to quit playing Everquest, and have come to find myself missing it.  No, not the game its self... that is really what I was the most bored of.  What I miss the most, is all of you.  The people, the community, the soul of Everquest.  That is one of the reasons that I come back to this message board so much.  I want to know what's going on.  <br><br>Especially I want to tell all of my EQ friends thank you though.  <br><br>Tzaria, who was my most recent friend in EQ, but the one that I spent the most time talking to in the last month or so.  She is really a great and beautiful person, inside and out.  Miss you, always.<br><br>Fadorn, one of my longest EQ friends.  I met him way way back on the Cazic Thule server when we were both in a guild called Kunark's Elite (or was there one before that?  hard time remembering).  I must admit, I always kinda admired Fadorn and followed him from guild to guild.  Kunarks Elite, to Sanguine Crusaders, to The Imperial Order, to now.  Though tward the end our paths split and he went to Casus Belli and I went to Tides of Valor, we always kept in contact.  A really good monk and a really great guy.<br><br>Figgs and Caromon, two more of my longest EQ friends.  Figgs, Fadorn, and Caromon were always together (in the same guild), being RL friends and Figgs and Caro being brothers, so I was always in the same guild as them.  They were both always really good friends to me, and they will be sorely missed, as will all of my friends.<br><br>Xaeviouran and Kaesana, married in real life and two of my best EQ friends.  Though I admit I was closer to Kaesana (not gonna use RL names, don't know if my friends would appreciate it), they both ment alot to me.  I remember spending time with Kaesana, talking about life... sitting in her favorite spot in Felwithe... not really doing anything... just sitting there.  Then we'd decide to go swimming in that rather unused pond they have there.  Oh the memories.  I regret that we didn't get to spend much time together in my last couple months of EQ... things just kept getting in the way.  I never did get to take you on that fishing tour of Norrath...<br><br>Isva, the great Mage...  though he's almost all together quit EQ (at least I havn't found him on) we had a lot of fun in the old days of the Sanguine Crusaders.<br><br>Galahaad... the leader of the Sanguine Crusaders in its glory days.  I had a great deal of fun in SC and much of that was due to Galahaad and the other officers of SC.  He was a truely great leader and a very fun-loving guy.  Though he kinda came back when Luclin came out, I didn't see him on much.  I always had a lot of respect for him, even though I don't think I ever told him.<br><br>Volox, another great monk.  I always considered him a co-leader of SC... and he too earned a lot of my respect.  It made me sad to see him and Galahaad leave Everquest, way back when.  I was glad to see them back when Luclin came out but, alas, I don't think they were back for long.  They too will be missed.<br><br>Incomoon... a fun loving paladin, who always seemed to be able to get herself into some sort of trouble, like dieing in the middle of Skyfire at level 30, but I was always glad to help.  She's a true sweetheart and it pained me to see her quit EQ.<br><br>Utius (aka OOTZ!)...  I remember the first time I met Utius... I knew she was a wonderful person from the get go.  Just a feeling I guess.  And she proved me right.  A really sweet girl, and being one that I've seen a RL pic of, I can say she is beautiful.  I have fond memories of her... teaching her how to quad kite in Cobalt Scar... /sigh<br><br>Flairbane... Utius' in game husband.  He was a really good guy and a good friend, and I was very sorry to see him leave EQ, especially since it saddened Utius so.<br><br>Starrior, another one of those friends I made early on.  He's a good guy, and made a really good mage... though I hear he's playing a rogue on Sullon now.  Was a truely sad day when he decided to leave Ayonae Ro, but I understand his reasons.  I was very suprised to see him post on my farewell post... didn't know he even checked these forums... suprised and happy.<br><br>Baltyn and Sarrana, another RL married couple... really great people, and were key in keeping SC alive though hard times.  Will miss them both very much, as I have already, being that they quit EQ right around the falling of SC.<br><br>Lamystique, also one of those people that I was in a couple of different guilds with.  Though I didn't know her well, I do know that she was a good person and was a nice friend to have.  I don't really know what happened to her, wether she quit, or just stoped playing Lammy, but a couple of months ago she just dissapeared.<br><br>Tandaina and Yinil, friends from SC.  Was a true loss to Norrath when they decided to cancel their accounts.  They also have been and will be missed.<br><br>Brall, Dalmber, Ellysium, Faithlilly, Warfrost, Katarra, Tumadre, Faranor, Ullric, Druclin, Tass, Donnel, Buvas, Baramin, Popi, Skelz, Dougye, Bise, Kargon, Sivass, Karanur, Marcos, Libn, Tamdara, Trakin, Darensian, Jaderaven, everyone who made me feel at home in every guild I've been in, and everyone that I'm forgetting...  these are all people that I was friends with, but I wish I had been closer to.  Some still play, some quit long long ago.<br><br>Anyway... back to the reason for this post... its been a great two years, and I will miss all of you.  Thank you for being my friend.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>   <p><center><b>Akom</b><br>60 Heirophant of Ayonae Ro<br>Master Smith 177 -- Master Brewer 165<br>Master Fisherman 182 -- Master Tailor 168<br>Master Potter 165 -- Master Baker 135<br>Master Fletcher 176 -- Master Jeweler 165<br><IMG SRC="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~peq/ayonaero/ubb/uploads/Unholy.JPG"><br><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufadorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fadorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/19/02 4:48:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thank you...</span><hr size=1> *sniff*<br><br><br>Always Shine On bro! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br> <p><center><b>Fadorn Floyd</b><Br>59 Bubble Master of Ayonae Ro <Br> Proud Member of Casus Belli <Br>  <a href="http://www.casus-belli.net"><img src="http://www.nwlink.com/~bstevens/Rogues/images/cbtag1.jpg" border="0"> </a> <Br> <marquee> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=661>My Profile</a> </marquee> </center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utesaikimone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tesai Kimone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/19/02 6:37:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/business/reception/452/934508e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thank you...</span><hr size=1> Man i thought u were gonna come back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  thanks for the kind words.
