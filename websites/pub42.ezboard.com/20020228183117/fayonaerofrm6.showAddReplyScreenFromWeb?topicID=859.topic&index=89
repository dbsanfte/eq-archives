I really needed to buy a pair of large bronze legs instead because it would be mighty uncomfortable and draw too much attention if my &quot;sword&quot; was always dragging on the ground.<br>

<br>
Humm if memory serves, we DID beat you to the mobs 3 days before that. You KINDLY asked us to wait before we killed the statue so that you can have the AoW. Guess what? We waited for you, for 5 hours, out of common courtesy, I even remember getting thanks in ooc. Well...we find it kind of annoying that every time you wanna do the AoW, the whole kael zone has to stop and follow your directions. We gave you a shot at him, you failed. You went back a few days later and you killed him (with help from tov? i dont remeber). Grats, you have made another Ayonae Ro first. Well deserved. But...now you go back, and you wanna kill the same mob again and pull the same stunt? I'm sorry, but I can't support that.<br>
<br>
Your guild is the most successful on the server, you have done more, seen more and killed more than any other on the server. Again, I congradulate you, well deserved, I aknowlege youre achievements. But now...there are 2 or 3 guilds which are APPROACHING (i didnt say equal to) to where you are in terms of end game challenges. Get ready for competiton. As EW said before, they welcome competition. We will fight for our spawns if we cannot agree upon them verbaly. We will not sit back and watch you monopolize what you have already &quot;owned&quot; for months. It's our turn.<br>

Tis okay, it let my itchy trull arse breathe more than that plate armor would.<br>
<br>
Is it me, or do the peeps who try to flame others just end up looking like the assholes in the end?  Y'all take yerselves WAY too feckin' seriously.  No really, you do.  What kills me is that 99.9% of the stuff peeps say on these boards would NEVER be uttered if the parties involved were face to face.  Acting tough in a computer game or on a message board is a waste of time and/or effort.  Who the hell cares?<br>
 <br>
If CB were truly out to get under EW's skin and nothing more, it seems by this thread that we have succeeded.  I've never seen more peeps from EW lose their cool since that time Gladstone threw his collar, pulled off his muzzle and started barking about EW's exploits.  Unfortunately, all this fuss is for naught...all CB wanted to do last night was kill Statue without waiting 4+ hours (like we did for EW only a week or so ago) and then maybe see what AoW had up his sleeve.  I'm still not sure why EW is clamoring about how we trained you or pulled your mob when the log clearly shows you weren't ready to pull -- Aeno repeatedly asked for 2 hours to prepare.  I guess you needed time to round up the Landslide and Tides of Valor peeps.  But we're the zergs.  Riiiiiiiight.  As for any deal we supposedly broke between you and Landslide...har, we weren't party to that deal (hell I didnt even KNOW about till today), so we couldn't have broken it.  Basic contract law there, folks.<br>
<br>
Oh, and no one PnP'd anyone.  I've been PnP'd before.  You KNOW when you've been PnP'd.<br>
<br>
All this posturing over a mob is laughable.  When it comes down to it, this game is NOT really that hard.  In fact, and I think many would agree, the high-end game is not that impressive and lacks content.  Success has more to do with the # of peeps in the zone, the clerics' internet connections, and whether VI's servers lag burp in the 3 mins you're fighting a mob.  Anyone who thinks that killing uber_mob_001 is a feat of skill and is self-impressed as a result needs a reality check.<br>
<br>
Those jokes about prison rape, bubba, etc. may seem funny...but few, if ANY, of the peeps on this thread would last 10 minutes in a maximum security prison.  We'd ALL be SOMEONE'S bitch.  =P  No personal experience, thank god, but I've seen and heard about it firsthand.<br>
<br>
As more guilds level up and fill out their Kael armor sets, the competition for mobs will increase 10-fold and this issue will rear its head even more often.  Same story, different guilds.  Until Verant adds a substantial amount of high-end content (or, heaven forbid, another 10+ levels), or we all learn to get along and share, things will likely not be pleasant.  <br>
<br>
The ironic thing is that 90% of us, from EW, VV, CB, etc., would prolly get along well in RL.  Heck, our love for EQ is one common interest.  Its kinda pathetic, however, that a couple toons and some phat lewt prevents that from ever happening in-game.<br>
<br>
Nuff of my blabbering...time to roll outta the office and enjoy another fun filled night of LagQ!<br>

AoW is a hard mob, yes, and im sure we won't be able to kill him for a while. But that does NOT mean we do not have a right to try him. Let me say that again, the inability to kill a mob does NOT rule us out for a try. How the hell would guilds advance if they could not TRY things first? I guess that is easy for you to say because you have had every mob in the game 1 on 1 without some guild breathing down your back. It's your advantage and it's our disadvantage, too bad for us, grats to you. It's the way life is.<br>
<br>
But we will carry on, we will try mobs that we cannot kill because we need the experience (not level experience). We will try mobs with EW and VV breathing down our necks because we HAVE to. EW had the luxury of being all alone in their areas with KT, Vulak, Tunare etc...we won't have that luxury, and we accept it.<br>
<br>
We won't give up, this WILL happen again. We are prepared for it. Good luck. See ya on the battle field. <p><IMG SRC="http://www3.sympatico.ca/mustaine/bok.gif">
