<br>
It's not.  <br>
<br>
My company has a nice campus and sponsors basketball, softball, volleyball, bowling, and soccer leagues.<br>
<br>
You don't have to sell basketball, softball, and bowling leagues.  People get together to play, and lots of them.   Without advertising, you can fill multiple leagues.  If we have the time to advertise volleyball, we can put together 3 full leagues.  If we don't, we have 2 full leagues (16 teams each).  <br>
<br>
Soccer?  There's enough interest for one or two teams.  <br>
<br>
Yes, soccer is often popular in school.  I went to U of I, and there were unsanctioned (student supported) leagues.  Of course, there were many MORE football, softball, and basketball leagues.   When people get out of school, they don't seem to play a lot of soccer.   I don't know why.  Truthfully, over the last 10 years I've met maybe 10 adults who play soccer.   <br>
<br>
When soccer becomes popular, you won't have to worry about it.  It will make it to television.  Basketball, football, and baseball didn't have TV timeouts 20 years ago.  Those games are on TV now because people basically DEMAND that the games be televised.<br>
<br>
Are you supporting soccer?  Do you tape games?   Do you call your local cable provider and order Fox Sports World?  Do you attend several MSL games per year?  Have you done so for many years?  If not, well... that's why soccer isn't on television.  There's not enough demand to justify it.  <br>

Cut out into something televison can digest. Soccer as a sport doesn't need that. another reason why it won't make it here.<br>
<br>
No one cares about the MLS because it has no competitive level, and they have already changed the game a bit. Why would you watch that when there are already plenty succesfull leagues in the world that are televised here. In other words why would you want to see the &quot;Lithuanian booming basketball league&quot;, when you have the NBA.<br>
<br>
In a way you guys are correct. I think it isn't about soccer making it here, it is about the MLS making it here. The MLS wont't make it because people who care about soccer already watch something else. MLS will have a hard time becoming popular. Specially if it isn't televised and it goes against other fast-paced, hi-scoring multi-diversion top games like Baseball and Football, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uxyln.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xyln</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/28/02 7:47:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1541.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Soccer wont make it here because we have too many other sports that are far more entertaining.The way you soccer fans keep bringing up the fact thats its number one in the world bothers me.Do you realize its number one because the sport draws its fan base from the entire World?Its really the only sport that the world can play as a whole.So its as if America has 10 movies to chose from and rest of world 1 movie to choose from,which one do YOU think would be chosen as number 1 watched movie in the world?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>WARNING:Peek-A-Boo can be hazardous to your health</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukivornteleri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kivorn Teleri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gimpy Ranger Admin</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/28/02 7:56:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1541.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Are you ignorant enough to believe that us 'in the rest of the world' only have soccer to choose from?<br>

Hate to break it to you bud, but we europeans have American Football leagues too. It's just that we prefer soccer.<br>
Nothing stranger than the americans prefering American Football.<br>
<br>
It's the same deal.<br>
Maybe street urchins of guatemala can't afford the american football gear, but if you're foolish enough to pit america against the world at least realize that we're as poly-sported as you guys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I have played through college and I would hesitate to play in a soccer adult league now...the shape you have to be in is freaking incredible!!!<br>
<br>
Basketball takes somewhat close to the same effort.. but adults play softball and bowl because alls it takes (as far as conditioning) is a good strong bicep to lift beer to your mouth(not that both aren't fun pastimes).<br>
<br>
BTW....the Colorado Rapids outdraw the Denver Nuggets by a very good margin.  Of course we have some High schools teams that do as well &lt;joke.  There are pl;enty of &quot;world class&quot; players in the MLS, no it isn't anywhere close to the European opr South American leagues, but as you could see in the World Cup, the US team did pretty well with mostly MLS products.<br>
<br>
I never thought I would ever see the term &quot;fast-paced&quot; and baseball or Football used in the same sentence...give me a break Thuram.  High scoring, perhaps, multi-diversional, definitately...but face-paced!!!  I would perhaps call basketball or hockey fast-paced, but definitely not the two sports you picked.<br>
<br>
I am supporting soccer, I do tape games, I buy MLS merchandise, I do attend several MLS games a year...since there has been MLS.  I do not order Fox sports world, but then I don't &quot;BUY&quot; any TV sports and I just have no emotional tie to international club teams.<br>
<br>
Xyln - I truly hope you are wrong and Pro soccer keeps a foothold in the US.  Other countries have plenty of sports to chose from, depending on the country of course.  They choose soccer because it is this planet's main sport.  As cool as being &quot;World-Champion&quot; in American Footbal is....it don't mean crap to most humans on the planet.<br>

American Football is not a &quot;Major&quot; sport by some definitions...because it is follwed by a very small percentage of the worlds population.

Hockey, Basketball, Cricket, Rugby, Tennis (quite international), Golf, Auto racing (if you define as a sport...depends on who you are), Ping Pong (stretchin' quite a bit, but fairly big in Asia), Boxing, Baseball (Japan, Cuba, a few others), Autralian Rules Football (at least in Australia), Skiing... enuff? :'p<br>
