The one key thing I have a problem with.<br>
<br>
This "jihad" that the taliban and other terrorists are fighting....<br>
<br>
How exactly does one fight a holy war on a country that has freedom of religion or the freedom to have no religion, as many of us do?<br>
<br>
That would seem to be one of the essential requriements of a "holy war", an opposing religion....<br>
<br>
People complain when the US doesn't get involved, people complain when we do get involved.<br>
<br>
Seems like we're always the bad guy, but then again, isn't the bad guy always number 1?<br>

Of course, anyone who speaks out against the war right now is labeled un-patriotic and anti-American...makes ya wonder about a country founded on freedoms including speech.  As far as those articles are concerned, if you want to know what's going on behind the scenes try reading a history book.  US history (esp. Vietnam and conflicts in Southeast Asia, Guld War, Contra issues, Alien and Sedition Acts) has ample evidence of how our government works, and continues to work today.<br>

Not trying to flame in the slightest, just pointing out that no one should be too surprised by how we do things.  Evidence is all around us.<br>

Interesting thought, very western <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Remember that for many countries religion and government are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the sepparate elements they are in the US.  For example, the Crusades which are pinned on Christianity were more an act of government than they were of any church - politically motivated by a government that essentially was the church.  For those crying jihad today, the threat from the United States is to their religion - which encompassess their governement, way of living, and belief system.  You hit it dead on when you said that many of us have no religion, it's difficult for us to look at it from the perspective of a culture that completely embraces a faith versus ourselves who see church as an outside element in daily life.<br>
<br>
This war, and the domestic panic over attacks and biological warfare, is largely being fuled by our own media.  They don't have much to say, so they say the same things over and over.  Two months ago CNN reported world news, now it's 24 hours of &quot;America's New War.&quot;  Problem is these talking heads run out of information very quickly, so they start interviewing everyone available and putting out as many possible stories as they can.  Theories run rampant, people get scared, and overall very little is actually being said.<br>
<br>
Just, my thoughts.<br>

Happy reading:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The &quot;Real&quot; Deal about Nuclear, Bio, and Chem Attacks<br>
by SFC Red Thomas (Ret)<br>
<br>
 Since the media has decided to scare everyone with predictions of chemical,  biological, or nuclear warfare on our turf I decided to write a paper and  keep things in their proper perspective.  I am a retired military weapons,  munitions, and training expert. <br>
<br>
 Lesson number one: In the mid 1990's there were a series of nerve gas  attacks on crowded Japanese subway stations.  Given perfect conditions for  an attack less than 10% of the people there were injured (the injured were  better in a few hours) and only one percent of the injured died.  60 Minutes once had a fellow telling us that one drop of nerve gas could kill a  thousand people, well he didn't tell you the thousand dead people per drop was theoretical.  Drill Sergeants exaggerate how terrible this stuff was to  keep the recruits awake in class (I know this because I was a Drill Sergeant  too).  <br>
<br>
Forget everything you've ever seen on TV, in the movies, or read in<br>
a  novel about this stuff, it was all a lie (read this sentence again out  loud!)! <br>
<br>
These weapons are about terror, if you remain calm, you will probably not die.  This is far less scary than the media and their &quot;Experts,&quot; make it sound.<br>
<br>
 Chemical weapons are categorized as Nerve, Blood, Blister, and Incapacitating agents Contrary to the hype of reporters and politicians they are not weapons of mass destruction they are &quot;Area denial,&quot; and <br>
terror  weapons that don't destroy anything.  When you leave the area <br>
you almost always leave the risk.  That's the difference; you can leave <br>
the area and  the risk; soldiers may have to stay put and sit through it<br>
and that's why they need all that spiffy gear.<br>
<br>
 These are not gasses, they are vapors and/or air borne particles.  The agent must be delivered in sufficient quantity to kill/injure, and that defines when/how it's used. Every day we have a morning and evening inversion where &quot;stuff,&quot; suspended in the air gets pushed down. This inversion is why  allergies (pollen) and air pollution are worst at these times of the day.<br>
<br>
 So, a chemical attack will have it's best effect an hour of so either side of sunrise/sunset. Also, being vapors and airborne particles they are heavier than air so they will seek low places like  ditches, basements and underground garages.  This stuff won't work when it's freezing, it doesn't last when it's hot, and wind spreads it too thin too fast.  They've got to get this stuff on you, or, get you to inhale it for it to work.  They also have to get the concentration of chemicals high enough to kill or wound you.  Too little and it's nothing, too much and it's wasted.<br>
<br>
 What I hope you've gathered by this point is that a chemical weapons attack that kills a lot of people is incredibly hard to do with military grade agents and equipment so you can imagine how hard it will be for terrorists.<br>
<br>
 The more you know about this stuff the more you realize how hard it is to use.<br>
<br>
 We'll start by talking about nerve agents. You have these in your house, plain old bug killer (like Raid) is nerve agent. All nerve agents work the same way; they are cholinesterase inhibitors that mess up the signals your nervous system uses to make your body function.  It can harm you if you get it on your skin but it works best if they can get you to inhale it.  If you  don't die in the first minute and you can leave the area you're probably gonna live.  The military's antidote for all nerve agents is atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Neither one of these does anything to cure the nerve agent, they send your body into overdrive to keep you alive for five minutes, after that the agent is used up.  Your best protection is fresh air and staying calm.  Listed below are the symptoms for nerve agent poisoning.<br>
<br>
 Sudden headache, Dimness of vision (someone you're looking at will have pinpointed pupils), Runny nose, Excessive saliva or drooling, Difficulty breathing, Tightness in chest, Nausea, Stomach cramps, Twitching of exposed skin where a liquid just got on you. <br>
<br>
 If you are in public and you start experiencing these symptoms, first ask yourself, did anything out of the ordinary just happen, a loud pop, did someone spray something on the crowd? Are other people getting sick too?<br>
<br>
 Is there an odor of new mown hay, green corn, something fruity, or camphor where it shouldn't be?<br>
<br>
 If the answer is yes, then calmly (if you panic you breathe faster and  inhale more air/poison) leave the area and head up wind, or, outside.  Fresh air is the best &quot;right now antidote&quot;.  If you have a blob of liquid that looks like molasses or Kayro syrup on you; blot it or scrape it off and away from yourself with anything disposable.  This stuff works based on your body weight, what a crop duster uses to kill bugs won't hurt you unless you stand there and breathe it in real deep, then lick the residue off the ground for while.  Remember they have to do all the work, they have to get the concentration up and keep it up for several minutes while all you have to do is quit getting it on you/quit breathing it by putting space between you and the attack.<br>
<br>
 Blood agents are cyanide or arsine which effect your blood's ability to provide oxygen to your tissue.  The scenario for attack would be the same as nerve agent.  Look for a pop or someone splashing/spraying something and folks around there getting woozy/falling down. The telltale smells are bitter almonds or garlic where it shouldn't be.  The symptoms are blue lips, blue under the fingernails, rapid breathing.  The military's antidote is amyl nitride and just like nerve agent antidote it just keeps your body working for five minutes till the toxins are used up.  Fresh air is the your best individual chance. Blister agents (distilled mustard) are so nasty that nobody wants to even handle it let alone use it.  It's almost impossible to handle safely and may have delayed effect of up to 12 hours.  The attack scenario is also limited to the things you'd see from other chemicals. If you do get large, painful blisters for no apparent reason, don't pop them, if you must, don't let the liquid from the blister get on any other area, the stuff just keeps on spreading.  It's just as likely to harm the user as the target. Soap, water, sunshine, and fresh air are this stuff's enemy.<br>
<br>
 Bottom line on chemical weapons (it's the same if they use industrial chemical spills); they are intended to make you panic, to terrorize you, to herd you like sheep to the wolves.  If there is an attack, leave the area and go upwind, or to the sides of the wind stream. They have to get the stuff to you, and on you.  You're more likely to be hurt by a drunk driver on any given day than be hurt by one of these attacks.  Your odds get better if you leave the area. Soap, water, time, and fresh air really deal this stuff a knock_out_punch. Don't let fear of an isolated attack rule your life. The odds are really on your side.<br>
<br>
 Nuclear bombs.  These are the only weapons of mass destruction on earth. The effects of a nuclear bomb are heat, blast, EMP, and radiation. If you see a bright flash of light like the sun, where the sun isn't, fall to the ground!<br>
<br>
 The heat will be over a second.  Then there will be two blast waves, one out  going, and one on it's way back.  Don't stand up to see what happened after the first wave; anything that's going to happen will have happened in two full minutes.<br>
<br>
 These will be low yield devices and will not level whole cities.  If you live through the heat, blast, and initial burst of radiation, you'll probably live for a very very long time.  Radiation will not create fifty foot tall women, or giant ants and grass hoppers the size of tanks. These will be at the most 1 kiloton bombs; that's the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT.<br>
<br>
 Here's the real deal, flying debris and radiation will kill a lot of exposed (not all!) people within a half mile of the blast.  Under perfect conditions this is about a half mile circle of death and destruction, but, when it's done it's done.  EMP stands for Electro Magnetic Pulse and it will fry every electronic device for a good distance, it's impossible to say what and how far but probably not over a couple of miles from ground zero is a good guess. Cars, cell phones, computers, ATMs, you name it, all will be out of order.<br>
<br>
 There are lots of kinds of radiation, you only need to worry about three, the others you have lived with for years.  You need to worry about &quot;Ionizing radiation,&quot; these are little sub atomic particles that go whizzing along at the speed of light.  They hit individual cells in your body, kill the nucleus and keep on going.  That's how you get radiation poisoning, you have so many dead cells in your body that the decaying cells poison you. It's the same as people getting radiation treatments for cancer, only a bigger area gets radiated.  The good news is you don't have to just sit there and take it, and there's lots you can do rather than panic.  First; your skin will stop alpha particles, a page of a news paper or your clothing will stop beta particles, you just gotta try and avoid inhaling dust that's contaminated with atoms that are emitting these things and you'll be<br>
 generally safe from them.<br>
<br>
 Gamma rays are particles that travel like rays (quantum physics makes my brain hurt) and they create the same damage as alpha and beta particles only they keep going and kill lots of cells as they go all the way through your body. It takes a lot to stop these things, lots of dense material, on the other hand it takes a lot of this to kill you.<br>
<br>
 Your defense is as always to not panic. Basic hygiene and normal preparation are your friends.  All canned or frozen food is safe to eat. The radiation poisoning will not effect plants so fruits and vegetables are OK if there's no dust on em (rinse em off if there is).  If you don't have running water and you need to collect rain water or use water from wherever, just let  it sit for thirty minutes and skim off the water gently from the top. The dust with the bad stuff in it will settle and the remaining water can be used for the toilet which will still work if you have a bucket of water to pour in the tank.<br>
<br>
 Finally there's biological warfare.  There's not much to cover here. Basic personal hygiene and sanitation will take you further than a million doctors.  Wash your hands often, don't share drinks, food, sloppy kisses, etc., ... with strangers.  Keep your garbage can with a tight lid on it, don't have standing water (like old buckets, ditches, or kiddie pools) laying around to allow mosquitoes breeding room.  This stuff is carried by vectors, that is bugs, rodents, and contaminated material.  If biological warfare is so easy as the TV makes it sound, why has Saddam Hussein spent twenty years, millions, and millions of dollars trying to get it right?  If you're clean of person and home you eat well and are active you're gonna live.<br>
<br>
 Overall preparation for any terrorist attack is the same as you'd take for a big storm. If you want a gas mask, fine, go get one.  I know this stuff and I'm not getting one and I told my Mom not to bother with one either (how's that for confidence).  We have a week's worth of cash, several days worth of canned goods and plenty of soap and water.  We don't leave stuff out  to attract bugs or rodents so we don't have them.<br>
<br>
 These people can't conceive a nation this big with this much resources.  These weapons are made to cause panic, terror, and to demoralize. If we don't run around like sheep they won't use this stuff after they find out it's no fun.  The government is going nuts over this stuff because they<br>
have to protect every inch of America.  You've only gotta protect yourself, and by doing that, you help the country.<br>
<br>
 Finally, there are millions of caveats to everything I wrote here and you can think up specific scenarios where my advice isn't the best.  This letter is supposed to help the greatest number of people under the greatest number of situations.  If you don't like my work, don't nit pick, just sit down and explain chemical, nuclear, and biological warfare in a document around three pages long yourself.  This is how we the people of the United States can rob these people of their most desired goal, your terror.<br>

As for the propaganda and hysteria as you call it, a lot of people died. We're not used to American's dying at others' hands..so it tends to focus our attention. Let's also not forget that the news media is hysterical in its own way. Since the confirmation hearings of Thomas Clarence, they have engaged in non stop coverage of events..even when there is no news, they will have a panel of 5 people talking about yesterday's news, or commenting on the fact that there is less news today than yesterday...we have several 24 hour a day 7 days a week cable news programs...if you think they are going to bury stories, I think you misunderstand how the American media operate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukanyli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanyli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/19/01 7:17:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: US Propaganda</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;Of course, anyone who speaks out against the war right now is labeled un-patriotic and anti-American...makes ya wonder about a country founded on freedoms including speech<br>

Mmm, yes and no.  You're right, and I do know the difference...but...it's the public that ultimately supports the laws.  While the government isn't thankfully beating down my door for expressing anti-war ideas, it scares me when the public verbally and physically threatens people who don't go with the mainstream ideas.  Do a search, or check your own local papers, there have been a few articles recently that are specifically about columnists being threatened for badmouthing Bush, the war, and so forth.<br>
<br>
So if we, collectively as a nation, believe in free speech, how do we justify forcibly silencing those who say the wrong thing?  Anyhow, didn't mean for this to be an issue, was mostly an observation and personal experience.<br>

&quot;&quot;The danger of such unbounded liberty and the danger of bounding it have produced a problem in the science of Government, which human understanding seems hitherto unable to solve. If nothing may be published but what civil authority shall have previously approved, power must always be the standard of truth; if every dreamer of innovations may propagate his projects, there can be no settlement; if every murmurer at government may diffuse discontent, there can be no peace; and if every skeptick in theology may teach his follies, there can be no religion. The remedy against these evils is to punish the authours; for it is yet allowed that every society may punish, though not prevent, the publication of opinions, which that society shall think pernicious: but this punishment, though it may crush the authour, promotes the book; and it seems not more reasonable to leave the right of printing unrestrained, because writers may be afterwards censured, than it would be to sleep with doors unbolted, because by our laws we can hang a thief.&quot;<br>

<br>
hehe this is the misconception that starts so many arguements.  Propaganda and truth are not mutually exclusive.<br>
<br>
prop·a·gan·da n. <br>
<br>
    1.The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause. <br>
    2.Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda. <br>
<br>
It is nothing more than a tool, no different from a bomb or a soldier.  Sometimes it is more effective, other times it is not.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the news, they may as well be working for Binladen for all the fear they are creating.  Shortly after the first attacks but before the first Anthrax case, Nightline showed a gruesomely realistic dramatization of what the news would be like had we been attacked with an effective biochem weapon.  It showed troops in biohazard gear, hospitals overflowing with dying civilians, and basically looked like something out of Steven King's The Stand.  At the same time, Fox News Channel was interviewing one of the retired military that have been getting so much air time lately.  He was explaining in great detail why it's not likely that a terrorist would survive the agents involved long enough to commit a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> successful or even marginally effective</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> biochem attack.<br>
<br>
Compare Peter Jennings' ratings to FNC, and the result is a lot more people checking themselves for lesions every day  and sterilizing their mail than people remaining rational and thinking about the logistics involved before they panic.<br>
<br>
People complain that the news is being censored, yet do you think the networks would actually hesitate to reveal troop locations and mission objectives in real time if it meant they'd get higher ratings and nobody was there to stop them?  The Taliban gets CNN too. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>
