That the instances of &quot;I WANT so I'LL TAKE, and screw whoever is there&quot; are increasing?<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm getting old and my memory is painting a rosy picture of the &quot;good old days&quot; of EQ, but it just seems to me that there used to be alot less conflicts that couldn't be solved by &quot;willing&quot; parties, as well as people who were more willing to help, or think of others in the process of doing whatever they were doing.<br>
<br>
Nowadays it just seems that whatever someone wants, whether it be a camp, a named mob, a zone, they simply walk in, ignore every single other person that is there, and proceed on taking what they wanted - even if this entails taking over someone else's camp, training a group that's where you want to be on purpose so they die and you can take the camp, or simply shouting &quot;Pulling Named Mob to X spot, leave the zone or die&quot;  (no matter if people were in that particular zone hunting peacefuly until SoandSo Guild moved in to kill Named Mob.<br>
<br>
Barge in, walk on toes, ignore others seems to be the new EQ rules and it's sad.  Common courtesy is out the window and it's a free for all.<br>
<br>
Guild A goes to Chardok to kill the Queen.  30 others are in zone.  The majority of the time Guild A will simply proceed on down to the Queen, killing mobs that others were camping, uncaring that in doing so Guild A just took some poor saps experience, because hey .....they gotta kill the Queen and that's way more important.<br>
<br>
Group B goes to Sebilis and asks for a camp check.  When told Discos are camped, ignore the fact that one group is there already, stomp their foot in anger and proceed to march down to the discos, cuz hey.....that's where they wanted to hunt and that's way more important.<br>
<br>
Group C is happily hunting in the Arena in Kael, when Guild D tells em to move it or die, cuz....that's way more important.<br>
<br>
Guess I'm an idealistic fool who actually believes in thinking of others around me, when it's obvious that only you and yours matter and fuck the rest.<br>

Or maybe it's just that people change.<br>
<br>
For example, even on my wussy paladin I used to run around Orc Hill helping whoever needed it.  Heal, (wimpy) buff, kill, whatever.  My paladin got to level 30, I started Kiradure and he's 53.  <br>
<br>
I get bugged all too often for ports, sows, buffs, chloro, DS, PL me plz, do you have any items for a lowbie druid, any pp, ect.  You get the picture.<br>
<br>
I may just be being an asshole but I concede to having become harder.  I dont have time for your port when I have a guild raid to attend.  My mana is needed for more important things than your slew of buffs that you request (Sow, ds, skin, chloro plz...).  I dont honestly have time to sit around orc hill to only end up with two groups who end up asking me for buffs every 10 seconds.  <br>
<br>
The sad truth is that now I only really have time to toss you an HP buff and wish thee well.  I honestly try not to be an ass when I get tells for ports/buffs/whatever.  The answer for ports is &quot;No, I'm busy, sorry&quot; and the answer for buffs is &quot;If you can find me&quot;, or &quot;No, I'm OOM, sorry&quot;.  All of these are legitimate reasons and the truth, I'll try to buff you unless oom and port you for your CR if I'm not tied up.<br>
<br>
I think most everyone is getting to the point where they are thinking that they do need loot because hell, I'm sick of having shitty resists, when I could be getting some real nice items.  That's my situation and I know a great deal of people who are ill equipped and content and who are well equipped and content.<br>
<br>
If you want my true opinion, it's that people have entered the game that are assholes... newbies, no respect for others, no self motivation, ect (These are all seperate categories, I'm not stereotyping here).  EQ used to be a lot of people in it for true Role-Play and since then people more interested in other things have entered the mainstream.  As a consequence, many people have ended up hardening themselves to guard against being suckered or dragged down by others of a different interest factor.  You dont have the time to heal, buff and help a newbie like you used to because you have to attend that big raid, people are counting on you.<br>
<br>
I think I may have digressed, but when you get down to it, the quality of the average persona has degraded and as a result a lot of people have had to change as well.  It's all well and good to &quot;Be a bigger person&quot; but a lot of the times you'll just learn that &quot;Nice guys finish last&quot;.<br>
<br>
Tho I do still try to make stops at Orc Hill when I'm not busy.. things have changed.  I try to be polite and at least give reasons if I can't help.  But things arent so simple anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/11/02 2:20:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=810.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perhaps, perhaps</span><hr size=1> /comfort<br>
Mmm, I know how you feel.<br>
But I think it's you who have changed, rather then the game.<br>
You have reached high levels, or been high level for a longer time.<br>
<br>
I have seen so much bullshit in the high levels during the last two years, it's not new. Of course there's a lot of bs among newbies as well, maybe worse. But that's other kinds of bs, not the cold wolfpack mentality that you are talking about.<br>
<br>
The bottom lins is that the high end game take a LOT of time, and you have to make priorities. Sometimes make their priorities a bit to cold and selfish, the line is blurry. But we all have to make the priorities. Me, I eventually decided that I could not make the game a priority. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

If a zone is full its full you cant camp everywhere at once and frankly I dont see why you think you should. Do u think other people owe it to you to let you get the exp of an open camp? It doesnt matter if you can hold a camp theres such a thing as a play nice policy and if a guide was there at that moment you would have been politely told to share spawns, which I may add you failed to do when the other grp moved into D2 while u were in D1...had it happen on Uulump camp. Sometimes you just cant be stingy. <br>
As for other guild walking over each other for spawns, it happens to us all, its up to the officers  to clear up the problem and act mature not for us to come bitch on the board where nothing will get done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukaerilabuffaholic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaerila Buffaholic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/11/02 6:51:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=810.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad Grumblings</span><hr size=1> Kiv!!!<br>

<br>
And Lor, who determines what a camp is?  By your mentality, D! should be segrated into 3 camps or 4, since what the majority of people consider the D1 camp consists of more than one room.  So, it would be Frenzied, Little room with 3 frogs on the side, Stage, and either the top hallway or the back hallway.  Same with D2.  That's be about 5 or 6 camps.<br>
<br>
A camp, in my view, and many others is basically a certain area that can be held by one group.  The D1 / D2 seperations were made when Sebilis was discovered at level 50's, ergo it was very diffcult to hold such a large area.  As people's characters grew, so did the lines of said camps.  <br>
<br>
As for the 40+ people in zone.....if I log on and go to Velks and find that there is more than 25 people in zone, I leave.  The zone can't handle much more and getting one spider per half hour is a pointless waste of time.  Same with Sebilis or any other zone.  Each zone can handle a certain amount of players before being congested.<br>
<br>
Rewritting history won't get the vile taste out of my mouth.  A group demanded to take over part of our camp, meanwhile there were several other choice spots available, such as King's, Illis Jail, NG was even opened at the time.  No effort was made by said group to go somewhere else.  It was a &quot;stomp my feet I want D2 and I'm gonna turn blue until I get my way&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for sharing, I certainly shared.  The group demanded D2, barged in and went into the room at the back with the stage (d2 by your own choice of words).  I didn't touch one single wee frog in that room, since you wanted it so badly.  Don't complain and dare to lecture me when you got EXACTLY what was demanded and threatened.  <br>
<br>
Gee, I treated your group with the exact same amount of respect you gave mine, actually ...with more :P~  Which was the point of this post - to survive among the twits we all begin to act like the twits (Gag!)<br>
<br>
If any of the tells, shouts and /ooc would have had a semblance of politeness and courtesy, as opposed to demands and threats, allowing your group to move to a spot we were camping would have been no problems.  But your group chose to be arrogant, nasty, pig headed and insulting.  Gee, what a surprise that you didn't get welcomed with open arms.<br>
<br>
You get what you reap.  Treat people like you'd like to be treated and you'd be surprised at how the game takes a new meaning of fun and relaxation. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukaerilabuffaholic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaerila Buffaholic</A> at: 1/11/02 7:40:51 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=810.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=810.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=810.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=810.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=810.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=810.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
