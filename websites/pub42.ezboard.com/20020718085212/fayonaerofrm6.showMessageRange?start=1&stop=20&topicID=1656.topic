For those of you that dont, sit back, relax, and enjoy as i rip america a new one.<br><br>Right now, America's nuclear weapons sit on a High-Alert status. What does that mean? It means that our nuclear weapons are on a hair-trigger, we push the proverbial button, and shit gets blowed up. Statistically, we have roughly 250,000 weapons ready to fire on a moment's notice.<br><br>Reliance on this &quot;hair-triggered&quot; response is bad...very...very bad. Here's an example. In the mid 90's, Russia, who also sits on a hair trigger, almost pushed the launch button. Why? Not because someone was shooting at them, but, because a norwegian weather balloon showed up on radar, and scared the living shit out of a vodka-striken silo commander. It gets worse, even our leader's are freaked.<br><br>Tony Blair and Sam Nunn wrote..<br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The deterrent practices that were once necessary during the Cold War now constitute a dangerous anachronism, for three fundamental reasons. First, Russia's severe budget crunch has strained its nuclear posture to the point that Russian generals can no longer be confident of reliable retaliation after absorbing a systematic U.S. first strike. Second, russia is moving to a quick-draw nuclear posture at a time when its ability to decide rationally whether to pull the nuclear trigger is diminishing....Third, the budget crunch facing the Russian military threatens to undermine the entire Russian system of command and control over its nuclear arsenal.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Lets say Commander Vladamir gets a phone call that we're all gonna die, and to push the little red button. Before he can be stopped, because Ivan made a bad interpretation of a smudge on the radar screen, we're all blown into oblivian. Get the picture?<br><br>Oh, im not done.<br><br>The United State's continued reliance on Nuclear Proliferation as a policy initiative will only push other nations such as India to further nuclear development. <br><br>Koch, 98<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> As the chief of non-proliferation advocate, the UNited States has a significant interest in halting proliferation. Yet, perversely, the United States continues to pursue a hypocritical nuclear policy that encourages others to proliferate...What particularly peeked India's ire was the fact that the nuclear powers have not adequately fulfilled their obligation to move toward nuclear disarmament as promised under that Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  Policymakers in new Delhi wonder why Washington, Beijing and Moscow should be allowed to retain enormous nuclear arsenals when India, the world's largest democracy, is denied that right.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>So, whats the solution?<br><br>Disarming all of our nuclear weapons.<br>Yes, we can keep the conventional ones little Timmy, and yes, you can go play at Brian's tonight. Why disarm dad? What about deterrence, wont we get the crap blown out of us? Dad? Dont make me give the nukes back! WAAAAAHHH!!!!<br><br>Well, I can rant about disarm being flawed later. First I'll give a little plan of action.<br><br>Disarm treaty. Ratified by all nations that have or are suspected of having nuclear weapons. IMF and UN perform inspections on all nations as designated in the treaty. Only nuclear weapons will be disarmed. All such facilities will be destroyed. Remember, the IMF and UN verifies all such destruction. Getting people to agree to such a treaty isnt a problem. Ive got cards to prove it, but im sleepy.

With Pakistan, India, China, and possibly North Korea all in the nuclear club, not to mention the current level of terrorism hysteria and concern about 'rogue states', I expect that if any change is actually made in America's nuclear policy, it will be only at whom our thousands of nukes are pointed, rather than any significant change in their actual numbers.  While I agree with the famous statement 'One cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war', this is a case where 'leading by example', especially given the perceived risks involved, is going to be a very hard sell... <br><br>And while Russia's predicament is frightening, at least Putin has a pretty good idea, and some semblance of control, over what goes on in the military, having been a former KGB man (and a strong leader) himself.

Unfortunately for the activists and those on the receiving end, rifles and man-portable machine guns are still the single most cost effective weapon available to anyone with a vested interest in applying lethal force. Unsurprisingly, every combat force in the world uses them. These weapons changed the cost of deploying previously effecient forces like cavalry such that they don't exist anymore.

Nobody wants to use them because they don't even make sense from a tactical stand point and only serve to induce terror. If you look back through history, most wars were fought in oder to gain control of land. Land is the single most precious commodity other than time, since there isn't exactly any more real estate being maunfactured. Land contains all the resources to support nations. Denotation of thermo nuclear fusion weapons over land renders the land uninhabital for decades as well as allowing radiation to get into the atmosphere and in return return into earth as radioactive rain and fallout that gets into the water table. Thus the land is no long habital nor aerable and the population that would have tended it either by farming, mining or residing upon it as a work force would have been either vaporized, rendered sickly and cancerous, or fled the attack.<br>      Thus after all your effort in building a vast arsonal of these weapons, if you ever actually dared to launch a couple, you have everything to lose and nothing to gain. You in turn destroy the land that you either wanted to defend or occupy and thats the whole concept behind MAD. We as Americans know it. The Chinese know it. The Russians know it. Those who may not know it are rogue states that believe that killing others while making a martar out of themselves is a free ride to the grace of Allah and perhaps India and Pakistan who spent billions on a nuclear program while their nation's people live in squaller. <p><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/~bielawat/pictures/sigF.bmp usemap=#sig border=0><map name=sig><area shape=rect coords=0,0,185,150  alt="Summul's Stuff" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=165316><area shape=rect coords=265,0,450,150 alt="Lummus's Stuff"href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=165129><area shape=rect coords=185,0,265,150 alt="Final Destiny"href=http://www.final-destiny.org></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Illusion: Justin Timberlake</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 12:46:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1656.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In light of Blearchie's lack of flames..here goes.</span><hr size=1> 'Nukes are mainly just a deterant.

Guess it's that Black Rage kicking in.<br><br>Anyways, Here's my take.  I think world, no one is totally honest.  A husband will tell his wife there were no women on a guys' night out, even though they were flirting with 18 year old girls the whole time.  A child will tell him mom that he didn't break the vase, that the cat did it.  In even small situations, with small consequences, no one is totally honest.  Take a much larger situation like.... oh I don't know, nuclear war.  We tell Russia, China, India, crazy ass Middle Eastern countries and most importantly, Canada, that we'll get rid of all ours, if they do.<br><br>Great plan, so we sign a treaty called &quot;Down with Nukes, Let's get drunk and Puke&quot;.  Hypothetically, let's say we just screwed one of those countries on an international trade deal.  Something sort of minor, like we forgot to send Canada their monthly supply of......marijuana.  Canada says, &quot;Yes, all of our nukes are gone, as well as all of your, China, Russia and Kerblakistan's&quot;.  The world is in rejoice.<br><br>What you don't know is those sneaky Bloodthirsty neighbors to the north didn't really get rid of &quot;all&quot; their nukes.  They forgot about those 5 silos or so in the complete bareassed wilderness.  Who has the upperhand now?<br><br>My point is this.  Nuclear warfare has been a topic of discussion, non-stop since we started it all in 1945.  It will never stop being a topic until we blow each other up in a massive collision.  No one is trustworthy in politics.  If you Russia says they have 200,000 nukes, they have 500,000 and some stashed away at their mom's house from back in highschool.  If China says they disarmed 100,000, they just made 200,000 in a factory.  If we say we're going to disarm all of our nukes, we've already launched 10 at key positions in Mongolia, damn Mongols.<br><br>To trust a man that is a politician, is to trust a snake, when it says it won't bite.<br><br>Besides, what good does worrying about it do to us?

Russia. The people guarding them, are soldiers that havent been paid, and who's families are dying.

I do, however, think that this mentality, that &quot;we keep what works till we get something cheaper and better&quot; is a part of the problem. We will keep nuclear weapons until everyone realizes how stupid they are. Think about this: We have a freakin lot of nuclear weapons, right? Why? Why in the hell does the world need enough firepower to destroy the world (I think it was 20-30 times over, i forget the exact figure)? A ridiculous arms race landed us with an even more ludicrous number of weapons. We cant even launch one of the friggin missles, because if we do, someone else launches one...then someone else...then someone else....so why the hell do we have them? <br><br>Deterrence? Well.... I'll get to deterrence in a moment. But, to answer your argument Malse, nuclear weapons are already outdated. When we have a conflict, we always..always resort to conventional weapons, espically after the destruction we caused in Hiroshima. To me, a man with a gun in a paper bag is more effective and a nuclear weapon.

We've entered a &quot;I have more nuclear weapons than you do, so dont mess with me&quot; mentailty, and that mindset leaves us thinking &quot;My dad can beat up your dad&quot; without realizing that a swing from any country would devestate the earth. Instead, we're left with &quot;lets keep em, cause we need them to prevent other people from blowing us up! we need all 10500 nuclear weapons sitting in holes in the ground!&quot; Friggin why? 1 is enough to scare the shit out of every american, it all depends on who has it. Terrorists arent detered by nuclear weapons. If someone in the middle east gets one, we'll go fucking nuts, because we dont have a system to stop them, we dont have a way to deter them, they think they're fighting for god, they'll use it if they want to. So why not get rid of the nuclear weapons, and prevent them from getting the technology? Better yet, lets un-do our ABM treaty and star wars the hell out of America. Shit, sell the technology to anyone that wants it. We arent going to use nuclear weapons in the first place. If everyone can prevent against using it, then whats the point of having them? If we disarmed 10499 of our supossed 10500 nuclear weapons, and kept 1, we'd still deter other nations. If we disarmed that last one, and kept our army, and all of our conventional weapons, we would CONTINUE to deter those nations, because one launch of another's nuclear stockpile would result in a mass-scale attack from all of our allies and what conventional weapons we had kept. No one is going to cause armageddon, no self-respecting nation, that is. The only threat we seem to have is terrorism, and nuclear weapons do nothing to stop them. By keeping them around, we instead are giving them a backdoor to crawl into and take what they want.
