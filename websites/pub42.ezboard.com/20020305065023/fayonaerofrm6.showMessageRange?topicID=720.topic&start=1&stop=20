He gets a tell saying a fellow guildie was killing mobs from your camp (we dont even know if he was blatantly ks'ing or happened to kill some mobs near you, thats like saying someone pulled a mob on ledge in DL's and you were one of the groups near it), he asks him to leave.  The guilmate does.  Did you even ask the person killing to leave before you told palimax about a minor situation that could have been resolved?  Then he leaves and for some reason you drag little problems like that onto a nag board?  It's not like he kept camping your area and ks'ing rare mobs and stealing phat loot.  Then You reply to peoples posts with swearing and name calling and wonder why we take Palimax's side in a situation like this.  I son't mean to Flame you as i dont know you personally but if you want to rectify a situation like that why not just settle it between you instead of dragging it out into the public.

Someone complained about Orontes, so he left them alone."<br>No, that wasnt the synopsis of the situation. The synopsis was your statements made saying you will not respect any one elses camps if they dont meet your specific rules. It was your refusal to admit courtesy must be applied in order for things to run correctly. It was your condoning of Orontes' disruptive actions that pissed of people. You keep focusing on the green mob, you refuse to look at the ethical side that everyone else saw. Unfortunately most of the time its assholes like myself that post about situations like this. If the meek posted about it, people would post different tunes.<br><br>****<br><br>Actually Blearchie this wouldnt have happened if the roles were reversed. I dont push people out of camps. If someone is already there, I respect it and move on or wait my turn, even if its someone I dont like. In fact, when I showed up in Tenebrous early yesterday, there already was a person in the first mine. So I said Hi, and moved on to the 2nd mine. There was another person there. She was having a harder time and was killing under half of the small number of spawns in the mine. She told me I could kill what I wanted, and since she was so generous, I invited her into the party so she could get the xps for all of them and let her loot everything but the one piece of loot I desired. Other people showed up before and after Orontes, and each time they said Hi and gladly looted the stuff I didnt desire. When I show up to zones, I call camp checks. Why? So I dont barge in on peoples established camps. So saying if the roles were reversed that I would have done the same is false. I proved that point earlier that same day. Perhaps in the future if I run into Palimax and Orontes, the situation will be reversed as I no longer will extend the usual courtesy I give others in regards to camps.<br><br>I waited my turn like everyone else, Orontes didnt. He not only showed up to the mine I was in and started nuking shit, but he first did it in the other mine and then moved to where I was when they protested. He also stated he hates greenie farmers (like himself) and thats why he disrupted the camps. Sorry Orontes, perhaps you need to petition Verant to have them put all the items in the game on 45th level mobs so the 60ths can rightfully camp shit according to your views. When people in the zone finally got mad, Orontes and Palimax started spouting shit that they pay 10 dollars to play the game and Verant says that no one owns mobs. Then when the zone started talking about courtesy, they changed their tune and said everyone was farming green mobs, that no one owns green mobs and if there is no challenge to breaking the camp, then its not a camp. They also claimed you cant camp large areas. Hmm I didnt realize one tunnel and a room is a large area. He also explained how its ok to kill green mobs in others camps but not the harder ones like trakanon, etc because you have to set up to reach those... ohhh I see the light now. You can screw up camps that dont have any importance to Palimax and Orontes. Gotcha boss, understood 100%. :/<br><br>All of the arguements in the zone over that could have and would have been avoided if Orontes had simply asked for a camp check, like most people do, and respected the established camps. Happens all the time in the other hot spot zones, why not in the less frequented ones? It doesnt matter that the mobs were green or red cons. Its called common courtesy and most people in the game use it and it works well. In this case Oron and Palimax decided since it was green mobs (btw the first mine had a 39th enchanter in it getting xps, so it wasnt green to them when Orontes decided to f'up their camp), and they didnt want to wait for their turn, it was ok to kill mobs in established camps. If this had happened in Sebilis or on some uber mob, shit would be hitting the fan (Hey wait, it did, I read those Ragefire posts). <br><br>Yeah I know people are gonna say Ragefire isnt the same as some green mob in Tenebrous, but it is the same principle. Courtesy isnt something thats applied to uber mobs and red cons only, its applied to even fire beetles in the newbie areas. Anyone that thinks otherwise has a overinflated ego and has deluded themselves into thinking their self worth is more than others in the game. Some people like to jump to the front of the line in EQ, Orontes did just that. The fact that its me posting about it, is the only reason people arent waggling fingers about it. Just look at the Ragefire thing last month... a guild jumped to the front of the line and all hell broke loose. Wonder how that one would have come out if it was Yuegou's Ragefire. Yup.<br><br>People werent mad at Orontes for ganking green mobs, they were mad at him for his lack of courtesy, and mad at you Palimax for condoning his actions. Of course after argueing with the zone for 10 minutes, you still wouldnt see that, since you were spamming the zone in your childish attempt at driving home a point that the others already understood. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0"><map name="YIEsig.jpg"><area shape="rect" coords="143,53,327,80" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/home.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="8,14,187,46" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Yuegou.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="190,13,343,48" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Irin.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="346,14,450,49" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Ehchar.htm" target=""></map></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uyuegouwindwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yuegou Windwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 2:30:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Round two</span><hr size=1> Pemadil, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Please leave out the ad libbing next time.<br><br>"we dont even know if he was blatantly ks'ing or happened to kill some mobs near you, thats like saying someone pulled a mob on ledge in DL's and you were one of the groups near it"<br><br>He was casting on and got a kill on the mobs that were agro and meleeing me... yeah I would call that ksing, well attempting to, his spell was pretty slow casting. Actually mobs on the ledge in DL wander dont they? Also, these mines have one way in and the same way out. They are one tunnel and a room, thats it. Its not the whole ledge in DL. Its more like running into a room in Sebilis that has only one way in, and nuking the mobs while someone(s) is sitting there camping the room.<br><br>"Its not like he kept camping your area and ks'ing rare mobs and stealing phat loot."<br><br>So if I was camping something rare it would have been a different situation? Since he was only ksing common green mobs, it was ok? I dont agree. Pushing into camps is wrong no matter whats being camped. Courtesy is something that should be applied in every situation. Some players do actually use it, Ive seen it before, so I know it exists.<br><br>"It's almost like you were just waiting for a reason to bash him or his guild."<br><br>IF I wanted to bash him, I would do it without a situation like this. Ive never had a problem with him before and this situation and the way he handled it were out of character of what I have seen from him on these boards. Reading his posts around here, I expected someone that had more courtesy and respect for others camps. As for bashing his guild, wtf are you talking about??? When have I mentioned his guild? He tried bringing my guild into this, not once have I mentioned his guild. Where the hell did you come up with that? Please read my posts before you respond to them, it would make things alot easier.<br><br>****<br><br>Haloface: "Like I said, Yuegou is such a big spaz, 'n stuff."<br><br>And you are like dogcrap. Its always lurking, hiding in the grass. You step in it, bitch a lil, scrape it off on a curb and keep walking. /e scrape, scrape.<br><br>****<br>Spitzhor:<br><br>"Ok, I don't get it."<br><br>That becomes plainly obvious.<br><br>"Why would you post this on a board if he just killed 1 mob that was unenaged and he couldn't see any people there and you were not even involved in it at all?"<br><br>It wasnt just one mob, it was multiple mobs in two camps. But that wasnt the point. Look past that. It was the attitude and the lack of courtesy. Palimax told Orontes to leave according to what he said, but at the same time, he pretty much said we werent in legit camps, and they could take what they wanted since the mobs were unimportant greens TO THEM. How would you like it if I showed up in your camp and started killing mobs that are unimportant to me, but are the reason you are there? Futhermore, the mobs werent unengaged in the mine I was in, he nuked two of them that were agro on me and meleeing. As for not seeing any people there, thats tripe. I wasnt invis, neither were the other people in the other mine. I was standing right next to the mobs he nuked, how much more visible do I need to be??? I wasnt involved? What post did you read man? Did you even read the posts? Doesnt sound like it.<br><br>"Are you following Palimax everywhere to hurt his reputation or something ? Your post makes no sense at all, really. Especially since it rather hurts your reputation than his."<br><br>WTF are you talking about? Following him everywhere? Your post makes no sense at all, really... uh ok Major Tom, get back on the ship. I didnt post to ruin his rep, I posted to show that Palimax wont have any problems if you waltz into his camps and take his mobs based on the opinions he expressed in Tenebrous Mnts about how camps and killing mobs work.<br><br>Ill be back later on today or tommorrow morning to see what other lovely gems people have contrived, so dont get disheartened when I dont hover and hit the reply button every minute like some of the lifers around here.<br> <p><img src="http://members.home.net/moonie1/images/YIEsig.jpg" usemap="#YIEsig.jpg" border="0"><map name="YIEsig.jpg"><area shape="rect" coords="143,53,327,80" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/home.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="8,14,187,46" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Yuegou.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="190,13,343,48" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Irin.htm" target=""><area shape="rect" coords="346,14,450,49" href="http://members.home.net/moonie1/Ehchar.htm" target=""></map></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ukaaraathenya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaara Athenya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 2:57:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Round two</span><hr size=1> Man I have a headache now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Thanks Yuegou <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br>Its over done with let it be!<br><br>Kaara Athenya<br>Kara Lee <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulummusl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LummusL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 3:37:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Round two</span><hr size=1> Get over it. <br><br>damn.<br><br>Lummus <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uspitzohr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spitzohr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 4:07:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Round two</span><hr size=1> Who is Spitzhor ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27474" target="_blank"><img src=http://members01.chello.se/siv.lutz/Signatur.gif></a><br> Assassin</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 4:49:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Palimax gives back to the community!</span><hr size=1> *chants*<br>Spaz, Spaz, Spaz! <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>Sspeed 40th Monk<br>Halo 'who broke my mezz?'<br>Tank_001 says 'me'<br>Tank_001 has been slain by Haloface.<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upemadil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pemadil </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/16/01 5:12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=720.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Palimax gives back to the community!</span><hr size=1> Sorry if it sounded liek i was make presumptions about went on.  The way i stated it was the way it sounded to me from yours and palimax's post.  When you say you were talking to Palimax abotu a situation I assumed you would tell him what it was,hence my assumption you told him someone was ks'ing you.  Your response was fine,you didnt flip out and start swearing which I applaud you for and what the NAG board should really be about.  The way you responded to my post is the way you could have responded to palimax's instead of swearing and yelling.  State your case, refute whatever claims the other party has to make your point and so on and so on.  <br><br>   I thought it was stated both by you and Palimax that the mob was at full health and un-engaged, not &quot;attacking&quot; you and in melee with you like you just stated to me.  <br><br>**So if I was camping something rare it would have been a different situation? Since he was only ksing common green mobs, it was ok? I dont agree. Pushing into camps is wrong no matter whats being camped. Courtesy is something that should be applied in every situation. Some players do actually use it, Ive seen it before, so I know it exists.**<br><br>  What i was saying is, the way you handled the situation was a bit harsh.  Yes, it is wrong to ks any group not just a rare spawn, but flipping out and swearing over someone killing a green mob and bringing a minor situation like that to a NAG board and having the title bash a person who wasn't even the culprit in the case is just a tad over done if you ask me.<br><br>  Please flame ahead, just try to do it a little more civilized like and you'll find people will be more apt to listen to you and not automatically take the other parties side like what is happening in this case because he has a great reputation with myself and many others in game and a great one on these boards too.  I'm sorry that this happened to you and wish you could maybe talk it out with orontes/palimax/vision first instead of having an open argument here because you're gonig to get points of view you might not like and its just gonig to make you bitter and hostile towards them and others here when this topic could have been dead the minute after it happened if handled correctly.<br><br>
