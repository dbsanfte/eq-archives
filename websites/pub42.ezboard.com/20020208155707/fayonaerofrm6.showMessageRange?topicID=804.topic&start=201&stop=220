granted had the way you were looking at that line after sev was dead to do lotto,then it would have sounded arrogant.<br>
but you jumped to conclusions,when it was before we engauged sev, we worked out the looting of the scale.you had me scratching my head in confusion,trying to figure out what bad thing we did to warrent a flame on our reputation.<br>
in my mind i thought it was a good thing we did.if i had been in that warriors boots and say EW, let me help kill and have a shot on a rare as hell item that there guilds warriors needed just as bad, even though they could have killed said mob without my help.i would of been stunned to say the least.<br>
of course personally,i wouldnt have took it or rolled on it over one of there warriors.but thats just me and one of my habits, some say its a bad habit of mine.<br>

But it's not a fair comparision, because it's also the day I will stop playing EQ.  My guild, my online-friends, is the only reason I continue play.  I would have quit months ago otherwise.<br>

Plain and simple, your friend was mistaken. There was no planned meeting. Out of the 130+ on our roster, at least 60 are tight-knit RL friends/family. Men and Women who would put each other up for the night, lend each other money for rent, travel long distances to help each other in a crisis...<br>

Thats what we said to the guy, and we were glad to have him along. Strangely, we would have been happy if he had won.

I believe our loot system works great.  What i think some people have trouble understanding that with our loot system is that Vision is more of a family and friend type guild.  We know beforehand 99% of the time who deserves and should get the item/loot. We are all in agreement that the person awarded the item was the one who deserves it.  We also implement a type of &quot; what have you done for Vision , not what have you done for Vision lately attitude.&quot;  which i firmly believe in. Loot is not an issue most of the time for us, we all pass on items that we could use to go the the person most deserving. It is EXTREMELY rare that someone has issues with loot, and it is always decided as a whole what should happen in these situations.  Many times i have logged on to my character and see a new item or piece needed for my rogue, and at the same token i have passed on an item , so it could go to the more deserving rogue, even though they may not be there at that time.  That is the type of friendship and respect we have for our fellow guildmates.  <br>
<br>
Some of you may not like this type of loot arrangement.  Good!  Stay out of our guild so no headaches and agrovation can come from you. <br>
<br>
Ive been in Vision nearly a year now, and i can say that we have never came close to breaking up or spliting. I believe you can refer to palimax's list of officers and class leaders and send any of them a tell to find out if youre wondering.  <br>

I helped someone with a guild approvial process for a level 1 to 25  guild in exchange for an invite with that character, and that my no association between my twink and my main be made, so i don't recieve more tells on either character then i can handel at one time.  I did this so that i could meet people from low levels for my twink to play with.  Incidentily, I sold most of the gear on my twink to buy a red dragon shield for my main.  /shrug.

<br>
Shorty, I have seen the crap you pull numerous times. I was in guk the same time you were leveling up through there and did in fact group with you several times- although if you joined i didn't stick around.<br>
<br>
Group getting together, it gets down to campsite. Suddenly cleric (shorty) says &quot;oh i gotta go&quot; runs off. No waiting for replacement, no warning, just bailed.<br>
<br>
That was my first encounter with you. I saw you do it to more groups than mine. I saw you screw lists to hell down there in what was, at the time, one of the better pickup dungeons in the old world.<br>
<br>
I was content to let you know that you were on my shitlist, but if you want details...kinda like telling me to go back to my level 32. <br>
<br>
Open mouth insert foot please.<br>
<br>
As for not feeling the need to lord something over me, why even say:<br>
<br>
&quot;I probably saw Vox and Nagafen before you even started playing the game, BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll tell you why you did it, you wanted to let us all know how you were so much more uber than this newbie you were flaming. It was not misquoted, the important parts were repeated. If you didn't think it was important, you wouldn't have even put those two sentences down, would you?<br>
<br>
Incidently, why do you believe someone who does not resort to flaming but instead tries to reasonably argue his point is a moron..<br>
<br>
While people who you don't consider morons are the ones flaming, namecalling, and generally being totally juvenile towards someone not agreeing with them?<br>
<br>
I'm interested to know, explain.<br>
<br>
Ps. why are you worried about my guildmates opinions of me? Perhaps people who know me better than you(and you admit to not knowing me at all) should make that judgement for themselves?<br>
<br>

You obviously have me confused with someone else.  First of all, on this character I spent maybe two times getting experience in lower guk.  This character was in the lower to mid 40s in August of 2001...why the hell would I be going to exp in Lower Guk with Kunark and Velious available?  Second, I have never left a group with minimal warning unless it was a dire emergency (which has happened once that I remember).  If I have to leave, I always find replacements.  In fact, I'm usually one of the last few standing around when other people leaving causes the group to break up.  I'm sorry your memory has failed you, but you couldn't be more wrong on this issue.  <br>
<br>
I really don't have this attitude you think I have.  And if you think people are talking down to you like you are a newbie, maybe it's because of your love of the /random loot.  Ask anyone in EW, VV, CB, RiP, ToV, Landslide, Vision, IM, AG, FD, or any of the top 15-20 guilds on the server when the last time was that they randomed for something on a guild raid (unless it was for a twink).  You obviously have a lot to learn about the high end game son, and I'm sorry that you don't agree with Vision, but you have argued this point to death for no real reason.  <br>
<br>
The point has been made PAINFULLY obvious by Palimax and many others, I won't continue to respond here except maybe to straighten our your facts about me personally. <p><a target="Shortyrez Starfury" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45788">Shortyrez Starfury</a><BR>

Within an hour of your first post, all the times I listed above were in messages.<br>
<br>
2:40 he told us the dragon was up.<br>
2:43 he asked for a shot at the scale.<br>
3:54 Serv died.<br>

That was posted all by (1/14/02 9:32:04 am).<br>
Allamar doesn't post until 6 hours and 17 posts later.<br>

You knew damned well the timeframe of events within an hour of your first post, and you pretend you didn't.<br>
<br>
Confronted with it, you make two posts, and in each you contradict yourself with regard to when you knew.  If you're going to pretend to be ignorant, at least pick one story and go with it. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
You mentioned time you know of him, time he asked, time it died. <br>
<br>
You did in fact clarify that on the same page as all's post, however as i said he actually talked instead of jumping out with teeth bared. Your original post is page 5, his is most of the way down page 7. 2 1/2. There is no contradiction there.<br>
<br>
Let me show you something here(it might help you out someday, who knows):<br>
<br>
&quot;Crist0, you sir, are a moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those were your first words to me. <br>
<br>
Tell me why I should seriously take the time to read your posts fully and completely, and try to understand your point of view, when you open up our conversation like this. Yep, I did go back and reread later. But All's post was the first one from you or your guildies to clarify the timeframe with a lack of flames. <br>
<br>
So ya know what? I actually read that one. Insteada reading it. You know, it's like listening to music and hearing it. He was polite enough to actually engage the point i brought up without resorting to second grade  tactics like namecalling.<br>
<br>
Your general crudeness is what to me definately gave - and gives - the feeling of belittling of Mr X.<br>
<br>
Shorty, you've already received about the max amount of distaste i show for someone on a game. I don't get worked up over it. This is my last statement to you:<br>
<br>
I was leveling up june-sept of last year in lguk. It happened, you were there and you did it ) I never forget a group bailer, especially one who posts here so much to keep my memory refreshed concerning his name. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uwlitenarcanum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wliten Arcanum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/15/02 9:29:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=218>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Things you do after leaving a guild...</span><hr size=1> This always happens every few months, and my god I love it.<br>
