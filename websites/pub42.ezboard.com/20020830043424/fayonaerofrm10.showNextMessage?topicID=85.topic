In my opinion we had a good turnout and set the base for the upcomming events.<br><br>Here I will describe what has been discussed and which persons are gonna take over which task. <br>I will also post a summary of the current situation which will describe the whole background with as less details as possible (since its simply too much) and I would then also like to use that topic for further informations and discussions.<br><br>There have been around 20-30 persons present at the council.<br>We have assigned the following tasks.<br><br>- Army in Qeynos<br>- Army in High Keep<br>- Army in Greater Faydark<br>- Investigation Team Qeynos Catacoms<br>- Investigation Team Castle Mistmoore<br>- Investigation Team Karanas/Qeynos/Freeport/Fawdyer<br>- Investigation Team Neriak<br>- Protectors of Firiona Vie<br>- Teleport Organisation<br>- Binds / Buffs / Sow Organisation<br>- Food and Drink Supplier<br>- Spread the Word<br><br>Sir Sirrens of the Allied Giants will take the second command of the Army in Qeynos.<br>Sir Haloface of the Forgotten Spirits will take the lead of the Army placed in High Keep (including Kithicor, Commons, High Hold Pass).<br>Sir Arquinval will take the lead of the army in Greater Faydark.<br>Sir Wgurdar will lead the raid groups of Castle Mistmoore and Qeynos Catacombs.<br>Sir Arganon will lead the scouting team in Karanas/Qeynos/Freeport/Fawdyer.<br>Lady Loriel will lead the investigations in Neriak.<br>Lady Tyleet will lead the organisation of the Teleporters.<br>Every member of the council took over a certain responsibility to spread the word and inform their guilds and allies about the situation to gather more forces.<br><br>The other tasks have not been assigned so far.<br><br>Please note that those assignments are not fixed completely. At any time thereis the possibility to add more tasks, to delete tasks and to give certain tasks to other persons. These assignments have been made to get organised as fast as possible. Of course, the more fighters that will join us, the more complex this will become and the more tasks have to be assigned. <br><br>The Task leaders have to make sure that their task is fulfilled. They will have to:<br>- Gather their armies and teams on their own!<br>- Organise the teams, gather names, assign other tasks.<br>- Report their status.<br>- Make sure that their task can be also taken over during their absence. The attack will not wait for you in case you will not be here at that time. Still your army has to be informed and ready.<br>- For the organisation of Teleports and Sow/Bind/Buffs this means, you have to gather available persons and assign the persons to certain Druid Rings/Wizard Spires or assign the Binders and Buffers to a certain place where they have to be asap, once their support is needed.<br><br>I would ike to add that the Leaders of the armies and the tasks have been assigned, but that the armies itself and task forces have not been made so far.<br><br>This is why I would like to start another topic with <br>- Amount of people in your task group<br>- Names (or in case of armies, Guilds names e.g. Forgoten Spirits is positioned in HK)<br>- What you still need, amount of Teleporters, more GUilds in your army. <br>- Also tell us the status of your task.<br><br>These informations should be gathered on this board so that everyone has at all times an overview about the current status of our forces. This way we can see what we still need and who needs help. And we also will not assign one guild or person to two different places.<br><br>Please also report to me in game about recent news, if you have seen or found out anything, if you are about to raid Mistmoor or if you meet all the guild leaders within your task.<br><br>I hope you agree in this organisation. It is not fixed at all, its just made to have a certain organisation at the point present.<br><br>If I have forgotten something or mixed up names or tasks, please let me know asap.<br><br><br>Further Tasks, first feedback, new Guild Representatives and their tasks will be discussed at the next meeting on Sunday.<br><br>Next meeting will take place:<br>Sunday, 2pm PST, 5pm EST, 11pm PST in South Karana at the Bridge to North Karana. There we should not get interupted by beasts or guards.<br><br><br>/kneel<br><br>Edit: As i just checked my log I noticed that I missed many tells and many remarks. I would like to apologiye for this. It was simply too stressy and I had way too many tells and too much to explain. Please, if you have something important to say or ask, be persistent and reply your request several times if needed. I do not miss your comment or question on purpose. <br>Please excuse if I did not answer you.<br><br> <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br><font face="Arial"><font size=2><b><a href="http://pub52.ezboard.com/bjollyjokersfoundation">~ Legend of the Jokers ~</a>  <br>- JoKeR by Heart & Soul -<a href="http://www.jollyjokers.com">Jolly~JoKeRs</a></FONT></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usirtaino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirTainO</A> at: 5/15/01 3:56:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usirtaino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirTainO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/15/01 3:17:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/pally.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 2nd Gathering of the Council</span><hr size=1> On sunday night we met in South Karana.<br><br>It was a bigger gathering this time than before.

Almost everyone had new infos, almost everyone noticed new happenings and special events.<br><br>We again discussed the newest news. <br>The results of these you can read up at the discussion topic (I still am waiting for all those people with new infos to post them. We are missing MUCH there! Actually almost everything!!)<br>We assigned more tasks and more people to these tasks.<br>The result of this you can see on the *The Forces* Topic.<br><br>Furthermore we made again a call to arms and let everyone know that we DO NEED SUPPORT!<br>We still need to spread the word and let everyone know about the happenings. I may say this since months but the rather lousy amount of people turning up at the Gatherings tells me that we do need to convince people. More and more. Especially explain the evil persons that they wil not evade the dark forces either since they blindly attack EVERYONE!<br><br>Having updated the Forces, having posted about the news on the discussions topic and also having added the long log of the Meeting here, I htink its all said.<br>Reading the log is REALLY worth it. Many many good hints have been reported and I am sure I am not the only one that missed the one or the other point. <br>We have a very big knowledge all together. Please lets put it all together on this board and lets make a sense out of all our bits of knowledge we do have!!<br><br><br>Thanks Lady Tyleet very much for the log file (saved much time that I could use yours), you are a big help, not just with logs. /bow<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   The next meeting will be held on Friday, 18th May, 3pm PST, 6pm EST, Midnight CET.

You just need to inform your Guild and have the info from Tyleet of which Teleporter is at service (she will post as soon as she can)'<br>[Mon May 14 01:14:07 2001] Taino says, 'Then KILL will be there too.'<br>[Mon May 14 01:14:35 2001] Zanzokuken smiles gently.<br>[Mon May 14 01:14:49 2001] Taino says, 'Sir Arquinfall as it looks like, you will have to search on on your own for more people. We lack the support to form one Army. How would we ever be able to form three (with the biggest one in Qeynos) as we planned?'<br>[Mon May 14 01:15:16 2001] Arquinval says, 'It looks grim m'lord.'<br>[Mon May 14 01:15:26 2001] Arquinval says, 'I will do what I can'<br>[Mon May 14 01:15:29 2001] Umbraa says, 'Halo has a big mouth...if anyone can rally FS...he can!'<br>[Mon May 14 01:15:43 2001] Haloface says, '*is rallying atm*'<br>[Mon May 14 01:16:02 2001] Taino says, 'It does. We still need to spread the word. The really most people do not have to spend days in this, they just have to be willing to BE there at the time we need them. They have to be informed and ready. That is all, but we DO need 1000+ people.'<br>[Mon May 14 01:16:06 2001] Zanzokuken thinks we should be training at the moment!<br>[Mon May 14 01:16:56 2001] Umbraa says, 'Cause to many words flying by...now has just this important info only before her eyes:-)'<br>[Mon May 14 01:16:59 2001] Taino says, 'SO 1000+ people means around 20 Guilds.

Too many things have to be taken care of.<br><br>We have again been around 40 people attending the gathering. Unfortunately we were missing MANY people that had taken over important tasks, whose reports we were expecting as much as Army leaders. Please make sure you attend the gatherings in any way once you have taken over some tasks. <br><br>Summary:<br>- We made important tactical changes: The Armnies are now mostly placed in Qeynos and Greater Faydark. The Army of Sir Haloface remains in High Keep, but all other Forces have been assigned to Qeynos and Greater Faydark. Since we expect the next events to be in Gfay, we had to place more people there as well as full time scouts. <br>The exact assignments and armies will be posted in the *The Forces* Thread as soon as I got the exact informations from the Army Leaders<br><br>- The duties of the assigned Guilds in the aremis are:<br>* Bind at the specific places, either GFay or Qeynos so that the casters can gate at any time.<br>* Also Bind the Melees there and buy them Gate Potions.<br>* Once the call comes, the whole Guild, no matter how many are online, WILL immediately leave their group or raid and come to the assigned point.<br>* The Guild has to be informed about everything and must know what to do once the call comes!<br>* The groups will be made within the Guild. YOu know your members and abilities best.<br>* The Guilds Teleporters have to report at Lady Tyleet for assignments.<br>* The Group leaders report to their Guild leader - The Guild Leader reports to the Army Leaders (Sir Arquinval for Gfay - Sir Sirrens for Qeynos)<br><br>- The findings about new happenings and explorations are all posted on the discussion tread. No deatils to be posted here.<br><br>- Namyra will take over the Scouting Team. She has showed great efforts and will be a good leader. If you have scouts, if you are willing to investigate, report to her. She needs help!<br><br>- Lady Tyleet is as usualy doing a great job and is getting the teleports schedule running. Still we need more. If you can teleport, please report to her!<br><br>- Teleports MAY not work during the War. This is just a rumor, but in this case, EVERYONE should be bound at either Qeynos or Gfay and have a gate potion available. Therefore we are desperatyl looking for Shamans that can provide us with Gate potions (I am sure you will be rewarded good for it). Please speak up at the *The Forces* Thread if you are able to create gate potions.<br><br>- The Patch on may 30th will most likely prepare the lands for the upcomming war. We expect the Festivities and eventually, the War in Qeynos to take place a few days after this patch. We MUST all be ready by then.<br><br>- Before the patch we expect Firiona Vie to return with the Stones and Tunare to be summoned in Lesser Faydark! Keep your eyes open about it!!<br><br>- We expect this week to be our last for any preparations. Afterwards we must be ready, positioned and willing!<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The next gathering will take place in GREATER FAYDARK in front of Felwithe (far enough for Kos people)!

We expect this to happen before the patch. Not much time to go for this thou!<br><br>We assigned more people to the armies and we have sent people to the cities of Ak'Anon and Cabilis. Also our existant scouting team will still be active and we have many scouts placed in the Faydarks to be informed asap once something happens.<br><br>The next meeting is set up exactly during the time we expect the festivities to be so it is critical as many people join as possible.<br>Get your armies, guild and yourself in gear, get ready.
