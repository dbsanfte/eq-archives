A dwarf came storming in and began shouting at Vanlaan about a ring he had supposedly stolen.  Vanlaan stared at the dwarf, trying to remember if he had ever met him.  Dwarves pretty much all looked the same to him.  Even their women had hair on their faces.  The dwarf was so angry he was sputtering in Dwarven and Vanlaan really couldn't understand a word he was saying.  He really wished Aedare was here.  None of the patrons in the Inn were going to take Vanlaan's side.  He sighed.  This evening was not going as he had planned.<br>
<br>
He stepped towards the dwarf in an effort to calm him, and half the patrons in the Inn made threatening moves towards their weapons.  Okay, that wasn't going to work.  &quot;Friend dwarf,&quot; he said, &quot;please calm yourself so that we may discuss this matter rationally.&quot;  He continued racking his brain trying to remember any encounters with dwarves.  Suddenly, it came to him.  He and Aedare had met up with a young wood elf druid and this dwarf in the plague village.  For whatever reason that moves light-dwellers, they had given Vanlann and Aedare some armor and money at a time when they were desperately in need of assistance.  However, Vanlaan could not recall a ring.  He knew Aedare's honor would never allow her to stoop so low as to steal from anyone, even a paladin.  And what was Vanlaan going to do with a dwarven family crest?  The dwarf was still sputtering... he looked on the brink of apoplexy.  Vanlaan called softly to the Innkeep.  &quot;Could you perhaps serve the gentleman an ale?  Something to help him calm down?  I'm buying,&quot; and he threw a platinum on the bar.  The Innkeep, trying to avoid more mayhem in his bar, quickly drew an ale and walked it out to the dwarf.  Making no sudden moves, Vanlaan carefully returned to his seat.  &quot;Now then,&quot; he said, &quot;let's try for a more civilized tone, shall we.  I do remember the assistance that you and your druid companion offered Aedare and myself, for which we are most grateful, but I assure you, neither my companion or myself took any type of ring from you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan sat and waited to see what the dwarf would do.  The atmosphere in the Inn was charged and it was obvious no one was tired any longer.  He sighed again.  He had really been looking forward to finding his bed after the day he had had.  He turned back to the dwarf.  Although obviously still angry, the dwarf did seem somewhat calmer.  &quot;Now then, tell me your name and let's see if we can figure out what's what.  By the way, where is your companion?&quot; <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#800000"><b>Vanlaan</b></font>

<br>
"Dalmanth, is it REALLY you?" Casidy popped up from her chair, turning to Jzonn she spoke softly "if you will excuse me, I know this dwarven fellow. If you should get the chance before you retire for the evening would you look in on Scaly, he should be resting in the room upstairs." Without waiting for a reply to her request, Casidy turned her attentions back to the dwarf at hand.<br>
<br>
Casidy ran up to Dalmanth and threw her arms around him. "Let me get that drink for you friend," Motioning for one of the serving girls to bring over the mug of ale that Vanlaan had purchased. <br>
<br>
Turning back to Dalmanth, Casidy smiled and winked, "it is late and this tired fellow," indicating Vanlaan with her hands as she spoke "was on his way up stairs for rest."<br>
<br>
"Perhaps you can entertain a wee bard, and tell me the tale of how you managed to make your way here. I had heard you were killed in battle in the Karanas." Casidy's voice had that lyric quality of a bard, to calm and return order to an otherwise stressful situation. <br>
<br>
In one statement, she had both dismissed Vanlaan to return to his room, and smothered the fiery rage brewing in Dalmanth. Whatever his concern it would wait until the morning, there would be no more battles here this evening. The tension in the room began to dissipate.<br>

At first his mind raced, the nights events running quickly by, then slower, and thoughts coming into focus, senses aroused.  Pain.  He would heal, he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> heal himself, but didn't.  It was good to know one was alive, and that was sufficient for the moment.<br>
<br>
Silent for what seemed a long moment in time his thoughts were interrupted by shouting from below.  &quot;Marr, no more tonight, let me have just one night of peace.&quot;, Scaly prayed silently.  At that, Scaly began to rise, embracing the soreness travelling freely throughout his body, coming to a stop in seated position at the edge of the bed.<br>
<br>
Brief thoughts of just falling back, and letting sleep and rest take over, were quickly put asunder.  Scaly arose, and dragged himself to his armour, which was carryingly placed to the side.  Casidy and the monk friend of hers...what was his name?  Q something....Qwik, yes that was it.  They both brought him here.  <br>
<br>
The shouting below had quieted, and Scaly stopped, and listened, then waited to see if anything else transpired. <p>Scaly<BR>

Between the obvious peaceful intent of his chosen victim and the gentle touch of the bard around him, the anger that had raged up inside him for the last few days began to melt.  Desperately, he tried to cling to it for a few moments longer to save face, but found his efforts faltering horribly.  The best he could do is stammer stupidly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye don't understand,&quot; he finally managed to spit out, &quot;I know I still had my ring before I met up with those inky fiends.  I only travel with RukaDani, and there's no one else who could have...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sudden realisation darkened his features.  However, he made an effort to smile at the elf.  &quot;Perhaps I wronged you.  Keep yer money, I'll pay for myself.  Nothing worse than being in debt to a dark elf...&quot;<br>
<br>
He sat down heavily, his bronze clanking loudly.  &quot;Ah, Ruka's gonna have my hide for this... scampered off on my fool crusade while she wasn't looking.  And I probably overlooked what really happened.&quot;  The mug that had appeared was clenched tightly.  &quot;Lesson for you all... there's daydwellers out there with more mind for evil... well, not evil, perhaps... but you see my point.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing the confused look in the eyes upon him, he muttered one word, a name - &quot;Palladare.&quot;  And with that, he drained his mug, a far off look in his eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udahrkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahrkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/12/01 9:11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> Drakhnar watched as the dwarf sat down.  As the bronze of his armor clanked, the tall lizard let out a sigh of relief.  He was far too tired to be in a fight this evening.  He began to turn, intending to return to the warm spot against the wall so that rest might finaly come to him.  Then he saw something out of the corner of his eye.  A glint off a piece of armor reflecting the light from inside the inn.  Instantly he froze, not wanting to be seen, hoping that the shadows that he had hidden himself in had him concealed enough to be overlooked.  Carefully he watched, realizing the magnituted of his blunder.  Not only had he let one, but TWO soft-skins get the drop on him.  His heart raced as they approached.  He recognised them as partrons from ealier, but that did not calm his heart from it's efforts to beat it's way out of his chest.  If he could sweat, he would probably be soaked in it by now.  Quietly he gritted his teeth and hissed to himself in frustration....and waited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ufebreeza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Febreeza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/13/01 9:40:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/febreeza?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> It is very nice to meet you Master Qwik.

<br>
She falls into place beside Liandriana and Qwik as they head to the inn.  Catching up on things with Liandriana along the way.<br>
<br>
Out of the corner of her eye she notices the very tip of an Iksar tail peeking from the shadows but says nothing.  While seeming to trip over a root she casually kicks a well aimed rock to hit it so it pulls back into the shadows.  And thinks to herself. *they always seem to forget the tail*<br>
<br>
She bounces into the inn and sits down at an empty table while asking for a bottle of mead.  She glances around the inn to see if there is anyone she knows, but all are strangers.  Ahh well... she thinks to herself, strangers are just friends I haven't met yet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
