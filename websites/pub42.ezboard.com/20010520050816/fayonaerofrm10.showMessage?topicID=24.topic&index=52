Looking down form the hill she sees a small warrioress in blue shaking a rather beleagered woodsman. She blinks her small black eyes and makes out the familiar forms of those she knows well and those she has met only once before.<br>
<br>
Now what would those poor creatures from the summerlands be doing in this winterwasteland?  She move slowly not to be seen.  As yet she does not know if they need or want her aide as Febreeza is want to be very indepentant.  She starts to move on, but remembers Feb's knack for geting in over her head.  She decides to keep an eye on the travelers to see if they reach their destination without event or if her aid will be needed.  <br>

<br>
Taking her cousin by the hand and helping warm him up, she noticed a strong smell of honey mead lingering on his breath. <br>
<br>
"Awe cuz, I suppose you didn't save me a bit o the mead did ye?" Casidy mockingly chided Kristav.<br>
<br>
With a smile and a twinkle Kristav brought out a flask and presented it to Casidy. "A token from home," Kristav replied, knowing full well that nothing could bring the sort of smile that honey mead could to Casidy’s face.<br>
<br>
"I seem to recall there was a note that was to go along with your arrival, and hopefully you have the map for where this adventure will lead us" Casidy looked hopefully at the wide eyed bard.<br>
<br>
Why they had chosen Kristav to be the messenger, Casidy could only guess. His youth showed vividly about him, he was many seasons younger than Casidy. Truth be told, he had just begun to study the flute, and had many lessons ahead.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this was a test for her, she thought briefly, to ensure his safety throughout the passage. It wouldn't be the first time the guild had send her a young bard to tutor.<br>
<br>
Well, she would take this into consideration. Kristav was after all, an able-bodied swords man. He should be as capable to hold his weapons, and his mead as well as many within the party.<br>
<br>
Kristav turned and began to rummage through his pockets. "Yes, there was a note here... somewhere... " He continued looking, becoming more frantic with each passing moment.<br>
<br>
Jzonn, and Febreeza were just outside of the covering, speaking to the druid. She seemed familiar at this range, but Casidy could not be certain of whom she was at this distance, only that she was an elf, a wood elf, and the large staff gave her away as likely a druid.<br>
<br>
Taino looked on, pretending to busy himself with tending the fire, as Casidy began to help Kristav go through his satchel, looking for some document with the symbol of the Antonican Bard Guild seal upon it.<br>

How Cuthbert wanted to return to adventuring himself even though there just is not much left to see, Cuthbert had no intentions of being retired to head up some Bard guild somewhere and was a bit tired of planning defense strategies with King Tormax. <br>
<br>
Now here he was babysitting some a young bard and her friends. The mother had said that Casidy also had some information for him that he might find useful should he care to introduce himself to her. As a master of lore, Cuthbert was curious as to what this young bard could offer him in the way of information. His Bardic vanity was making it very tough for him to even consider this as a reality. Cuthbert felt he owed the mother after that night in Qeynos. The least Cuthbert could have done was to leave her a note or say good bye, but such is the life of a musician. <br>
<br>
Looking at his provisions, Cuthbert looked at the sky and sighed wishing that this group moved a bit faster through their journey. Although trying to be honest with himself, Cuthbert tried to determine if his judgement of the was harsh because he wanted to check out some rumors in Western Wastes or if they really were a tad slow moving. <br>
<br>
It was at that time Cuthbert decided to use and ancient song to lull the young group to sleep and went up behind Casidy under the guise of Selo's Song of Travel and said, Hello.....</font><P>Cuthbert Dirgewielder <BR>El Virtuoso and Uber Geek of F.U.<P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ujableakl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jableakl</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0> at: 4/30/01 5:17:15 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#383838><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucasidy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casidy</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Elder</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ff0000>5/8/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ff0000>9:13:01 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.honestevil.com/deleted_roster/hail_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Bard's Quest: A New Beginning</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Casidy heard the sounds as they whispered in her ear...<br>
<br>
She was listening intently to place the song... she had heard this before.... she did not notice her companions one by one fall off to a fitful sleep.<br>
<br>
She did however notice the melody change, to a more familiar sound.<br>
<br>
Selo's song of travel was a tune she had heard many times before.... but who was this bard, shrouding himself from her view....<br>
<br>
Just as Casidy was beginning to wonder, he said, hello...<br>
<br>
Casidy turned, and noticed her companions all asleep before her.<br>
<br>
Scowling softly back to the, still invisible bard, Casidy spoke over sharply "There might have been a better way to gather my attentions then to force my friends to slumber..."<br>
<br>
Realizing she had been a bit harsh, Casidy sighed "You have my attentions, perhaps we should step off a bit and talk?"<br>
<br>
The bard agreed, and the two of them headed down to the edge of the waterline a bit off from the camp.<br>
<br>
Her friends would awaken in a few moments, with a slight ringing to their heads, and find themselves missing one Casidy.<br>
<br>
The bard at her side, quickly shrouded Casidy within his song, and the two headed off to the waters edge.<br>
<br>
Now that the man was visible, Casidy smiled to herself. She well, recognized this bard. <br>
<br>
Casidy had been raised in Kelethin, by her mother, and the man that had adopted her as his daughter. Casidy had never before met her true father, but her mother had told her many tales, and managed to keep up on his travels throughout the land. This bard before her, was her father.<br>
<br>
Smiling smugly to herself, Casidy carefully considered whether to reveal this information to him. In her travels, she had heard many tales of her fathers outings, and many of the adventures he had were notorious. Through all these adventures and all his travels, little did he know that he had a daughter growing and learning with his gift for song.<br>
<br>
"So, Master Cuthbert, what brings you to this icy wasteland?" Casidy smiled in her overly charming way "And how may this wee bard assist you in your travels?"<br>

It has been a long time since I have taken the time pay attention to up and coming minstrels of this land, for that I am chastised regularly, so I thought I would take the time see how you were doing. I know of your quest and have a keen interest in seeing how you progress. Beware in this frozen tundra though, there are perils that still have not reached the ears of Hall masters tucked away safely in their confines.&quot; <br>
<br>
Unsure whether or not to tip his hand, but with curiousity getting the best of him and with dectectable conceit in his voice Cuthbert added, &quot;Also I was told that you had some information for me. I am curious, as to what such a young one has to offer me that I would find so important...&quot; <br>
