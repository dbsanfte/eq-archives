(long)</span><hr size=1> I spent about 3 hours in Blackburrow tonight, doing what I normally do in Blackburrow.  I run back and forth between two of the elite/commander room spawns and slaughter them all.  I do this for a few reasons:<br>
1. It's fun<br>
2. I need the faction<br>
3. I can plant the highest level BB loot on gnoll pups, fire beetles, moss snakes, etc and get a chuckle out of seeing newbies kill moss snakes and loot Runed Totem Staffs and such.<br>
<br>
Well, one thing I also always do in BB is listen for when someone shouts the inevitable &quot;TRAIN!&quot;  At this point, I usually kill what I'm fighting and run towards the zone to help kill off the train.  Tonight was different and quite a bit disturbing.  I saw a level 13 bard running around with her damage song on, and a few seconds later she shouted &quot;train to zone&quot;.  I followed her and killed a few gnolls on the way.  Then I get to zone, and see that the people there seem to have it under control.  So I plant a few heals on them and return to the elite room.  About 5 minutes later, the same bard shouts &quot;train to zone&quot; and I follow the train and help kill it off.  Then I ran to Surefall Glade to sell things.  While in Surefall Glade, a level 8 ranger popped into the zone while I was finishing up selling.  I ran back towards BB and got a tell from him.  He asked me why I was starting trains on purpose.  huh?  I told him that it wasn't me and he started to get belligerent - he said that there was no way that the gnolls were aggroing on me and that he was petitioning me.  I was confused, to say the least...  Meanwhile, the bard that started the trains logged off...  Shortly after that, this ranger tells me that he and his friend died several times in the trains, which sucks, but was not my fault since I did not start the trains.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So then I decided to give up on the elites and just stood at the Qeynos Hills zone line.  A level 7 paladin came into the zone entry with a couple of gnolls.  I healed and buffed him.  I always figure that helping someone kill their own train is better than killing the train for them - if I think that person can handle the train then I just help them so they get the xp for it.  Well, this paladin kept chasing down the gnolls that were running away and managed to aggro about ten gnolls on him.  I stood nearby and let most of the gnolls beat on me while the paladin worked on killing them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then the bard and ranger zoned in, and the bard started to use the shout channel.  Here, straight from the log file I took (I'll edit out names though, no sense in harming their reputations or anything):<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:25:55 2001] BARD shouts, 'Hey Albarath you want to quit causing those stupid trains while you're powergaming?'<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:26:09 2001] You shout, 'I'm not training or powerlevelling, I'm helping someone who started a train'<br>
<br>
... a few minutes later, after the paladin finished off the train and thanked me...<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:33:34 2001] You say out of character, 'well that's 3 trains that I helped clean up tonight, and so far I've been yelled at twice and petitioned at least once... for *helping*   =(   you should be yelling at the bard that started those first two trains, not the ranger that helped clean up'<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:34:08 2001] *BARD* says out of character, 'oh yeah that wasn't you alright next to green room causing those trains'<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:34:28 2001] You say out of character, 'it wasn't, was a bard named ********* or something that was running around with her damage song on'<br>
[Wed Feb 28 01:34:59 2001] You say out of character, 'I ran after her trying to stop the trains'<br>
<br>
<br>
I waited until 2 am EST for a guide to show up so I could have a chance to prove that I did not start the trains.  Apparently, it sounded like they both died in three trains, two of which I tried to help de-rail, and the third one happened while I was in Surefall Glade.  I've spent countless hours helping to save low-level characters from trains, and the ones who realize that I am helping are very thankful - I've even met a few of them who still remember me several real-time months after I went out of my way to help.  I'd estimate that at least half of my 43 days played were spent helping others - it's something I enjoy doing, and the reward is in picturing the smiles behind the monitors of the people I have helped.  Unfortunately, this single incident is depressing enough to make me give up my quest to make Norrath a better place.  If nothing else, I've learned one bit of knowledge that I will share with all higher level people who wish to hang out in low-level zones and help people:  If someone shouts &quot;train&quot;... hide, go invis, gate, do anything but run to the zone to help.  It's a sad, sad world, and I guess my days of helping people are numbered  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This almost makes me sad enough to retire my ranger again<br>

sorry to hear this, but remember, some people may realize what you do when you try to help, other tend to see YOU as the trainer/KSer/whatever. most people you ever helped are certainly very grateful for this and (as you said) even remember you after weeks because of what you've done for them. but others petition you.<br>
<br>
you should try to see it so: those who are too dump to see that you helped them are not even worth that you continue talking to them. btw, you shouldn't worry about the petition, i think a guide normally understands such a situation if you explain it exactly and polite.<br>

(long)</span><hr size=1> As I joned EQ around half a year ago, I was completely fescinated by seeing all those honorous and helpful and nice people. <br>
I spent 3 years playing the other Verant game which was based to be a test for EQ, called Tanarus where really 99% of all people are pure asses having no other joy in life than making yours messed up.<br>
<br>
So EQ was a great world for me. People do help sometimes (WHOA!!!), they do have honor, they are not JUST after heir own business and so on.<br>
<br>
Now, a few months later I found out that its the same here as everywhere, just not as bad. IMO you have around 50% asses logged on. People that sit next to you when you shout *looking for a bind* and ignore you. Or people that KS you, people that ignore your camp and just kill your mobs you been camping for hours just because they CAN since they are 10 lvls higher. People that join your group and then shout for a group during the fight since your group is not good enough for him. People that could rezz you a sec since they just sit there on your body but prefer asking 150pp and you just got 120pp. People that keep training you since they have no clue how to pull and always expect you to save em and even tell you what an ass you are since you didnt manage to heal em soon enough, kill the mobs and maybe even buff him. People that give you wrong PCs of items so that their friends can buy em very cheap. People that leave your group in the middle of a dungeon and you are left there without any chance to get out since you have no invisi or TP available. Players that are incredible greedy looting EVERYTHING up as soon as you say its FFA. Hardly anything makes me as sick as when people rightclick on the mob 5 secs before it dies to IMMEDIATELY loot before the body even falls to the ground, its such a commitment of a poor attitude. <br>
<br>
90% of the players is asking money for everything. Buff, Heal, SoW, Rezz, TP, whatever. Noone moves a finger without asking money. <br>
Many players are very agressive and start cussing and swearing very soon.<br>
<br>
No, honor is not very familiar with many of those players out there. <br>
<br>
I still met many, really very many people out there that are incredible helpful and very nice and that show an attitude that makes it so much fun to play, but also the opposide is the case.<br>
<br>
Especially Newbies are a pain sometimes since they do not know the rules yet or how things go. I am sure those newbies did not KNOW they were wrong or that you just was helping. For them it just LOOKED like you were training them. You honestly cant blame you for this. But you can blame em for being that agressive and for they reaction since they should know they do not know about the game that good yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh my. I found out that I need to pick my friends well. Greed and *just acting for someones own advantage* is very very popular out there. Just not move one finger if its not for your advantage - seems to be the attitude of many players.<br>
<br>
But I am happy that there are also many other players out there and I found many very great people! I hardly am able to cut my friends list down to 20. Actually I have around 50 but that damn list doesnt hold more than 20 =)<br>

Frankly, that actually speaks a lot for this server if you have spent since the split helping people and are only NOW getting depressed.  It usually only takes me two days before i'm ready to strangle the low level players.  (I refuse to call twinkers r us players newbs).<br>
