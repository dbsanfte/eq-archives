Nobody could find their guild trainers, 200 naked people running around by the freeport gates.  Our first trip to the east commonlands and thinking how are we ever gonna kill them orcs.  When banded armor was the most uber thing you could have, and bronze was unheard of.  Now, 3 years later, bronze is worth 2 copper, the orcs are killed by level 1's, and you dont have to get your corpse back till level 10.  Yes, this game has changed a lot, but there are some of us that still enjoy going through the lower levels and soaking it all in. <p>Drakkon Shadowrunner

<br>
Sorry about this epic I'm writing here, I just have a need to get this out and maybe answer some questions of my own :)<br>
<br>
This is my first post on the Ayonae Ro boards, as I just got back into the game after an 8 or 9 month break.  Originally I am from Tallon Zek (yes, a dreaded pvper :)), where I had a 56 paladin for a year and a half.  I've noticed a HUGE difference between the servers so far, which I will attempt to explain in this post.<br>
<br>
Originally I got into the game in July '00, when my RL manager (who had a then 46 druid on TZ) kept bugging and pestering me to play.  Finally I decided to try it, as I was really needing a new game to play, and EQ sounded fun.  She gave me a little bit of armor (nothing great, just some tailored stuff and maybe a somewhat decent sword) and off I went, learning as I went about the game.<br>
<br>
I found the game was much, much more difficult than anything I had played before (This was my first MMORPG as well), but it was also fun, as I had a goal to catch my RL manager's character, so I could join her on the raids.<br>
<br>
TZ wasn't the best place for a complete newbie to learn about the game, as the pvp was not conducive to a safe learning environment :)  Fortunately my RL manager's guild was very helpful and considerate of my newbieness, and I was able to learn quite a bit about the game. Being a high elf on TZ, I wasn't able to go to the best places (Oasis of Marr, North Ro, Guk, and the rest of Antonica were all war zones, fought over by the darks and lights and also the Human team 1 teamers wanting to go back to the original 4 teams aspect of the server).  TZ was good for one thing, teaching you how to play the class well.  In pvp you're either good, or you die, it's as simple as that.<br>
<br>
By the time I caught my manager in levels at lvl 56, I had learned much about the game.  I never got plvled much (I can't say I never got plvled, because I wouldn't mind getting some quick exp in order to get levels on a pvp server, levels and resists are everything there).  My guild had grown from a 30 person guild to a 150+ person guild, we were doing planes raids every week, epics, and other high level raids.  <br>
<br>
I fell in love with the high end game, because by then people knew how to play their class quite well, the mobs we fought dropped good items, I was able to explore almost everywhere (this is what I play the game for, the chance to see new zones, get new armor, and stuff like that), and I absolutely loved the challenge of killing stuff at high level.  When I got around to creating a twink, and went back to the grind of lvling again, I found it was boring, and I died way too much for my liking because of people not knowing what they know at high levels, so I went back to playing my pally again.<br>
<br>
Eventually around last October, I got tired of the server politics on TZ, and went to play DAoC for the past 8 or 9 months.  Then about a month ago, my RL manager said she was interested in going back to EQ, but on a blue server.  So we ended up here.<br>
<br>
We had to start off dirt poor, not a plat to our name.  (It might've also been a better idea to make another class besides a monk our main char, so we could actually loot and get money :)  But monks were rare on TZ, so we thought they'd also be rare here...  Oh well :))  Also we didn't know anyone on the server except for a lvl 49 shammy, who didn't have any twinks in the newbie range. We joined a guild, and I've really been surprised by the availability and willingness to plvl and twink out with better armor.<br>
<br>
Ayonae Ro is, as several people have mentioned, a mature server, formed from 3 of the oldest servers in the game.  I am still amazed by two things about the server.  Perhaps someone could answer my questions about these two points... heh<br>
<br>
The first is the fact that not everyone has at least planar armor.  There are people in my guild who are in lambent, or crafted, or some other quest stuff, at 50+, and that's really quite shocking to me...  On TZ, I guess I got spoiled by my guild doing Fear and Hate every week, and the fact that you needed good gear to compete in pvp.  Here, I don't see why people don't have at the minimum, this type of stuff.<br>
<br>
The second is the number of 50+ people that are unguilded.  I don't understand how they raid and enjoy the high end game.  Again, I guess my view is being colored by the fact that on TZ, you had to be in a guild, in order to survive anywhere.  If you went out alone, you were just begging to be pked.  But even here, if you go out alone, how do you explore places like deep Velious, or Luclin, or the planes?<br>
