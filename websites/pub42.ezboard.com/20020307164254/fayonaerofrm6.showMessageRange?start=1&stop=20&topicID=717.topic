(Netted kelp that is, looks the same as leather now.)<br><br>If this had been a stranger, I would have reported it to the GMs. If I ha been personally pissed at the person in question I would'nt have posrted about it, or mentioned her name. But it's not really her I am pissed at really, it's the general ideology. Seen WAY too much of that in my days. Former girlfriends and female friends bitching at each other and other females for looking too sexy or whatever.<br><br>Yeah, prostitutes do tend to try to look sexy in order to attract customers. That does NOT mean that every woman who dress up is a prostitute. Bleah.<br><br>By the way, male prostitutes dress up too. Yet other men who try to look sexy does not get called whores or giggolos. And when people talk about prostitution they usually pretend that all prostitutes are female anyway.<br><br>Oh well, at least these days a woman can walk on a street without people assuming she's a &quot;streetwalker&quot; and ask her how much she want for a handjob. Most of the time, anyway. A few female friends of mine have been harassed like that a few times. But only a few times. It's nothing like how so many if not all females continously gets looked down on by strangers and friends for looking too sexy/unsexy, cool/uncool, fat/thin, whatever/whatever. And it seems like most people who do this are females themselves, and don't think there's anything bad with their behaviour since they are only &quot;telling the truth&quot;.<br><br>In real life I sometimes have to deal with the fact that people I have never met seem to think I'm a rapist just because I'm a man. But at least I don't have to deal with friends and friends of friends snearing at me (openly or behind my back) that I'm a whore.

The suggestive means of displaying the attributes of a woman is one of the marketing schemes. What do you think you look like? Ever seen Everquest players project their reactions to a naked dark elf female being rezzed? What changes in the female body have you noticed emphasized since the new graphics have been added?<br><br>Not that I think it's ever ok to tell someone they look like a hooker, or a 50 dollar #$@%&quot;.  Never. There are just a lot of dirty people playing Everquest. <br><br>There are countless female players who use the attractiveness of their Everquest cartoon to role play the life of what it would be like to walk around and absorb the physical aspect of a man's adoration. Suddenly, they're youthful, with all the right curves.  Something many likely wouldn't have the opportunity to do in their real lives due to the hand that nature dealt them. Enter the most popular method of role playing in Everquest....<br><br>There are males who choose a female cartoon and do so because they're rather fond of how it appears to them. <br><br>How do female Everquest cartoons sit? It's almost pathetic. <br><br>In many cases, being sexy IS selling.  Your complaint should go to the company, for the means they choose to portray the female.  I agree that the player who spoke so crudely was in the wrong, but the amount of socially flawed, rude players in this game are infinite, and can only be stopped by personality screening. <br><br>The whole idea of portraying yourself as sexy, is showing off your physical attributes, or in some cases even your personality attributes (just how sensual you can be). <br><br>So, what really happened was an Everquest player (not known for having any manners or grasp of politeness whatsoever) said something rude to you about your appearance in game. <br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yeah, prostitutes do tend to try to look sexy in order to attract customers.

Bleah. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Correct, the image a female portrays depends on the extent of how she dresses up and what is emphasized. It is possible to emphasize the attributes of a female through clothing and not look like a prostitute. <br><br>If you took a non Everquest playing woman, and told her to critique a group of Everquest female cartoons. The result would be &quot;They are nasty&quot;. Not &quot;They are cute !&quot;. <br><br>The traditional fantasy world female is scantily clad. Red Sonja, Tika Wayland, Laura Croft......<br><br>It sells, it attracts. It's the purpose.  Many female players are very happy with the way their cartoons are depicted I'd bet, from the way many take advantage of the reaction in male players.  <br><br>What's funny is that there are likely many female Everquest players who become jealous if another cartoon appears more sexy, and react with spite. <br><br>Wear a robe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/15/01 1:12:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Is this a complaint about the way in which Verant portrays the female ?

And these people should just &quot;point out what they see&quot; without being ashamed of themselves, because they are only &quot;telling the truth&quot;?<br><br>Nope, didn't think so.<br><br>In the same line of thought, tall white men with shoty hair look like the nazi ideal. Still, it's not a really good thing to tell those men they look like nazis, eh?<br><br>Like i said, prostitutes do tend to dress up in a sexy way. This does NOT mean that all women who dress up in a sexy way are for sale or look as of they were.<br><br>Now, I'm quite sure that this person did not mean to hurt or offend me. But that's part of the problem. Spitting on sexy women is so commonplace in our culture that some people don't notice when they do it, or even think they do her a favor. After all, if she just get rid of that pesky selfesteem and put on some western culture equaliant of a burqua, then people will stop having dirty thoughts about her.<br><br>It is true that sexy clothes gives a hint that you might be aviable for sex, and for sadomasochistic games in the case of black leather and stuff. This does however NOT give anyone any right to behave dishonorably. Same thing with if someone is rumored to often have sex with strangers, or whatever.<br><br>Forcing oneself on another person is NEVER ok. <br>There are some really discusting ideas floating around in our culture that it's ok to sexually harass or even rape someone under certain conditions, like that she is dressed in a certain way, have a certain reputation, have made sexual advances or have agreed to have sex with the person.<br><br>YES, if two (or more) people are having sex and one of them say &quot;stop, I don't want to continue&quot; and the other(s) don't honor that wish but force the act to continue, then it is in fact a case of sexual molestation. Of course, the exact words &quot;no&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; doesn't have to be the stopwords, it depends on teh situation. For example, if people are tickling each other, the'll have to listen to the tone of voice rather then on the actual words. And in S/M-games people can sometimes beg for mercy and sound really sincere without meaning it. But then they always have a agreed upon safeword. Something that they wouldn''t say by misstake, and that REALLY count if they say it.<br><br>Finally, I don't have anything against prostitutes. What I *do* have a lot against is people who degrade people by implying that they are for sale. As it was shown in the movie Pretty Woman, it is NOT ok to treat someone &quot;like a prostitute&quot; even if she in fact happens to be a prostitute. Asking a stranger how much she takes for a blowjob is harassment. Walking up to a stranger and tell her that with her ugly face and clothes she's probably making her living from cleaning toilets, so how much does she want for coming along to his home and workplace and clean it up, that's also harassment.<br><br>Before I move on, I would just like to clarify that I am NOT attributing any of this to Wliten or to anyone else here.

Only on the condition that the female takes responsiblity for a few more things, rather than blaming it all on men. <br><br>Well, you somehow turned your incident into a &quot;it's not ok to rape people&quot; theme...which ...well, I don't see how anyone could argue that point or would for that matter. The world agrees with the premise that it's not ok to rape under any circumstances. <br><br>On the complaint about men labeling women who present themselves in a sleezy manner being deserving of a sleezy title......<br>If you behave like a slut. You're going to be found out, and your peers are going to label you a slut. A majority of girls I know have avoided that label, amazingly. So I am confident that it can be done.  If you are upset with your label, and you are a slut, odds are you know what you did wrong. <br><br><br>If you dress like a slut, emphasizing your sexuality, you are &quot;modeling&quot; your body. &quot;Advertising&quot; what you have to offer. The history of the relationship between the two sexes will indeed warrant a reaction from the opposite sex. If a male sees a woman dressed in a provocative manner, it will indeed provoke a manner deserving the woman in the fashion in which she was aiming to please. <br><br><br><br>Wliten's statement...is not bull shit. It's just not what you want to read. It's quite true. <br><br>Now Edeina, (you don't mind me calling you Edeina, do you Alexander?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you fail to embrace the fact that one of the most important things that is going to determine a woman's reputation is how he/she carries herself. If I wore a dress and high heels to a sports bar, how monstrous would it be for them to label me and treat me badly? Or...would I be asking for it by the means in which I chose to represent myself? Now, here in the United States (your evil Western Culture monster of which so many negative elements elements of modern societies are to blame) women arn't yanked by the hair and dragged off into caves where they're lain on their backs, and &quot;had&quot; at will. Regardless of what Julia Roberts has led you to believe .<br><br>Firstly, women know what reaction they have on men. Do all women hate how that works? No, because many....oh so many, aim to please. Those who succeed arn't posting on message boards of their distaste for Western Culture . <br><br>Secondly, the fact that a man can sleep with four women in a week and not be labeled a slut (well, a skanky slut), while a woman doing the same can be considered a slut, goes back to the roots of the man's adoration and fondness for the woman. We want to nurture and protect our beautiful princess. It is emotionally unsettling to catch our daughters in bed with a boy, ect.  Now, we can drop that if the females of the world wish, but I'm pretty sure that my girlfriend appreciates me adoring her as my precious princess.  Sexually, we'll not be looked upon equally, because our roles are different, and that's unconciously how we want it. <br><br>Yes, there are shovanists who abuse women in the world. <br><br>Thirdly, a woman's labeling is not irrationally given. Labeling is a normal happenstance of everyday life. One easy method of labeling someone is by their physical appearance. How do you wish to present yourself? Line up eight women. <br><br>&quot;Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok ?!!!<br><br>On the contrary, the entire deal with needing to go the extra mile to BE sexy is selling your sexuality. Advertising would be a better term. Marketing, even better.  It doesn't justify sexual harrassment, but it asks for it. If a woman wants to be respected in a manner excluding the attributes she bares physically...then she will go through the effort of not emphasizing those attributes. It's not a difficult task, I don't have a single female aquaintance who doesn't understand the fine line between &quot; sleezy sexually attractive&quot; and &quot;respectfully confident, and attractive&quot;. They never have had to deal with negative labeling. I suppose I'm lucky for having intelligent, responsible, confident friends who don't rely on their bodies to get them ahead in life.  Males do not emphasize their sexuality in the manner they dress, it's not part of our social code. Speedos often turn a woman off, regardless of the package within ! Spandex....*shudder*...no, they're not to be worn. They're just cheezy. A woman, however, exploits those curves, and her appearance is largely based on sexuality. <br><br>Finally....So, when you walk down the street, and see a woman in fishnet stalkings, a short black leather miniskirt and a bekini top covered by a shiny red jacket at belly length. You can live on saying &quot;she's just doing it for herself&quot;. Truth is, she's advertising her character by exploiting crude elements her sexuality. She is cheapening herself, and any woman willing to defy western culture by doing so, is beginning the long walk down the path that leads to the label of being sleezy. It's not for sale, but she's crossed the line of respectful social presentation , and wandered into &quot;this is how I wish to be seen, this is what I have to offer&quot;. <br><br>Never an excuse for walking up to a woman and calling her a whore. <br><br>Never an excuse for being a sexual aggressor against the will of any member of either sex. <br><br>But there is a line that a woman can cross where respect is thrown aside, and sleeziness is embraced. It's also easy to recognize, and comments will be made if it desgusts someone. <br><br>Edeina, your high elf female cartoon does look like a dominatrix. Her sexuality is displayed in a manner that says &quot;look at what I have to offer&quot; and the means is not positive. As a feminist, which you must be from your complaint about the label your recieved (which led to a firm &quot;women stand with me on this !&quot; statement generalizing all sexual labeling) you should be offended that you're displayed in such a way. <br><br>Your high elf female cartoon.....she looks nasty in leather, not like a proud woman at all. Verant wasn't thinking pride and respect when they thought of that cartoon. They were hoping for one thing. <br><br>Arousal. <br><br>Responsibility and prevention begins with the source of the label. I can't think a hog's a hog, until I see the hooves, the snout, and the tail. <br><br>And for the record, I respect women. I respect women who want to be respected. If I see a woman flaunting her body, I make no crass comments, but I do think to myself &quot;so...that's what she wants to be seen as, hmm?&quot;<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nydia>Nydia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/15/01 3:07:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> Wow.  I don't even know where to start with that one...<br><br>With all due respect, I think that you are bringing some biases to the discussion that don't even need to be here.  Edeina's *behavior* played no role in the incident that she related in this forum; the person made a remark judged solely on her avatar's appearance.  Then, the individual justified the ugly remark by blaming Verant for making the model look the way it did, ...<br><br>I personally *do* think that Verant made the female (and male) models look too blatantly sexual for my tastes, but this person, especially considering that they knew Edeina personally, should have had the courtesy and common sense not to make such a rude and cruel remark.  Now I know what irritated Edeina so much, and the crux of the argument you are currently having, has more to do with the *attitudes* behind the remark, but this is an argument that neither of you can win, because it is rooted in your personal beliefs.<br><br>I personally believe that everyone, male female and other/two-spirited, has the right to 'own' their sexuality, with all that implies, and that what is too blatantly sexual in a negative way is highly subjective.  In reference to the 'bhurka' statement that was made elsewhere, remember that in some cultures, showing ones hair or ankles is too blatantly sexual for the 'norm' of that culture (whether we agree with it or not).  You may think the High Elves in leather look like dominatrixes, but some people really like it in a positive way.  You can think as much 'Lucy Lawless *is* the warrior princess!' as 'where's my whip I'm the bondage mistress!' when looking at that outfit, and if the persona of my character were different I might wear the look myself.  <br><br>It's inevitable that people are going to judge and draw conclusions about other people based on their appearance.  But first off, lets remember that these are cartoons, and people have limited ability to customize how they look (pity the starting half-elf females - they are nearly naked!), and that second of all, when you *do* look, you are projecting your own biases onto the person you are observing... things that they might not have intended at all, due to cultural or perceptual differences.  (Or, they might be a child!  EQ is a 'family' game, and I have always felt a little sorry for the prepubescent children I have met while playing, stuck in adult avatars, and people holding them to that standard...).  So, *whatever* your personal biases might be, people would do well to remember that that person next to you whom you think is in hideously bad taste might really *like* the way he/she looks, and may see it completely differently...<br><br>And if what that person likes is really trashy to you (and they know it and *like* looking trashy), so what.  Unless you know the person well enough to know that they won't be hurt by the remark, don't say it, even in a teasing way...<br><br>For some people looking blatantly sexy is positive, and powerful, and makes them feel good.  For others, it is somewhat uncomfortable, and it makes them uneasy just looking at someone else who is dressed provocatively.  I've weighed in on both sides of the equation at different times.  For better or for worse, Verant gave us very provocative models, so we have to deal with this and remember that we are being manipulated by those images, and that what you see may not be what that person halfway around the world sees...<br><br>Sinderely,<br>Nydia Ywalmoriel 'It's what you *think* you see that matters' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>(from an article on gender perceptions in Anything That Moves magazine)<br>Autonomous Collective <p><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/01/11/26/flamingtext_com.22571862.jpg" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a><br>Image by <a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb2.html">FlamingText.com</a></BODY></HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udarusgrey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darus Grey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/15/01 4:11:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=717.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sexy does NOT equal &quot;for sale&quot;, ok?!!!</span><hr size=1> &quot;Officer, officer, help me.<br><br>I'm not a cop, I'm just dressed like one. &quot;<br><br>I think palimax summed it up pretty nicely, wether you like it or not..most people may consider your attire..&quot;slutish&quot;(refering to ediena on the horse =))though who makes the &quot;slut&quot;
