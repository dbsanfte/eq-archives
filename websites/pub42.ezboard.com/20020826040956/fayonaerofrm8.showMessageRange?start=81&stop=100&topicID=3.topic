I don't say that you should skip to report when you are going there or not, but don't book it for a week or something as it was on Sol ro. That sucked! If you wanted to go to planes, you had to wait at least 3 months before it was your turn! We don't want that on Ay Ro, do we?<br>

The KGC (the famed or infamous, depending on your point of view) scheduled week to week.  Some of the guilds leaving Karana hated it and took every opportunity they could to circumvent the 'rules'.  The jump from Karana was all about leaving and putting the KGC behind them.  Other guilds saw this as a chance to work on a lower population server and the KGC had no bearing on their decision to move.  The KGC allowed smaller guilds or alliances an opportunity to break a plane.  It was also a bit wasteful in terms of how much of a plane was 'done' at any given time.  And the big targets were put on a rotation.  Just prior to the split, it was estimated the Inny/CT rotation was at 3-4 months.<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I left Karana because I found it difficult (due to lag) to operate on Karana with constant 2000+ pop counts during my 'prime' time.  I didn't care to sign on at 8AM on Saturday morning (US Central) and find 1800+ people already going at it, with a pop count of 2600+ by 5PM.  I neither loved nor hated the KGC, despite it's flaws.  It was simply the system in place I worked with on behalf of my guild.  Since I left my guild to move, they are now trying to find their own way to work with the KGC.<br>
<br>
My point with this post is to say that while we (from Karana) understand your frustration at dealing with a reservation system booked months in advance, it's not somthing we had to deal with.  I wouldn't care for a system like that and I know those groups who hated the KGC would absolutely detest such an arrangement.  I've seen a number of proposals presented here to help everyone ease their transition to Ay Ro.  The reality of the matter is no one is going to set up any sort of sharing system until it is proven one is necessary.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> this happens it will only be after a couple months have gone by, as you have rightly pointed out Fandariella.

Allied Giants left Karana because of the over crowding and lag issues for the most part.  We did well working with the KGC.  Those in the Forged Alliance worked within the KGC and all went well.  To come from that type of environment into a FFA and somewhat worrisome look at certain guilds just jumping in and taking a plane that you are camping...its scary to say the least.  Some have balked at the thought of going to the planes for anything other then to take down the Gods.  That in and of itself amazes me...&lt;one who stands before you in only 50% planes gear&gt;.  I think that FFA could work.  I also have noticed the past few nites no one has been in Hate.  Which of course had me drooling...thinking of all those free range Kira's running around with MY BREASTPLATE!!!!!!!! &lt;regains control of herself&gt;.  <br>
<br>
There are many different views on the subject of rotation, scheduling and planning.  If we all take time and consider everyones views and concerns then I think we can all come to an equitable solution.  Hopefully any preconcieved ideas about **UBER GUILDS** and their good/bad reps can be overriden.  I, for the most part haven't seen anything too horrible yet on the boards or on the server.  I would hope that possibly those that had the bad reps might be looking for a bit of atonement here in Ayonae Ro.  &lt;weeps...Clerics bless us One and All!!!....passes tissues around&gt;<br>

<br>
<br>
Interesting question - and I'd been waiting for the chance to chime in.<br>
<br>
1st order of business - Hi to all my old friends (Jzonn, Halagar, Hoo?, Chia, Sapula, Monza, Katori, that dancing Gnecro etc...etc...I'm sure I left folks out)that left Karana for greener pastures on ARo.  I like what I've been seeing so far after studying your messages boards for the past few days.  It looks like [bold]for the most part[/bold] you've got a server with very mature and competent players that know precisely the situation they're in and the powder keg they're sitting on.  Rather than light the fuse - I see so many instances of folks _WANTING_ to work together and doing just that - absolutely warms the heart :)<br>
<br>
But you guys are sorely missed - and with the holidays upon us - there seems to be this calm stillness about the server - not much going on in the ways of activity.<br>
<br>
As far as the server's concerned:<br>
- Remf is organizing an Evil Only raid on the PoG and is getting amazing buy in.  I unfortunately will be the only paladin on duty to protect Tunare's plane from their invasion.  I just bought a shiny new STOP sign and plan on putting it to use during their raid, but I'm skeptical of its utility.<br>
<br>
- Vox is down to 4 guilds in the rotation - Nag's pretty much steady, VS and Cazic are still on decent rotations - but with everyone having left - there were a few raids that went kaput because there weren't enough folks on to take him at the time.  Everything seems a little sedate on Karana now - Lower Guk fluctuates from between 15 and 30 people but I have yet to see it over 35.  Cougars are being slaughtered by hundreds of thousands in the EW by PBAE groups harvesting them for their earrings.  <br>
<br>
There's some fancy shmansy new 8ac 8str 8mr +8DS quest ring that folks just started getting wind of (starts in Eastern Waste with a dorf I thunk).  Paladins are crying foul because our Runed Protector's armor has boobs instead of pecs, and the greaves look like some shiny leotard reject from a bad production of River Dance.<br>
<br>
The KCoG has gone into a little bit of a hibernation mode because of all the guilds that were affected - the medium sized guilds were affected the most.  Up and Coming guilds with 30 members, saw all of their high level folks leaving for ARo and it's thrown that scene into a little bit of an uproar.  Alliance have come apart because they're one third the size they were pre split.  There's some stabilization and consolidation that needs to happen with the mid to small size guilds and the smart ones are joining forces through mergers or alliances.  <br>
<br>
But that aside - Pippi is still conducting her Large Target Raid Symposium set for sometime in January - and I think she's still forging ahead with the Server Wide Chess Tournament.<br>
<br>
As for me and the daggers :)  Well we just got our first cleric to 39 (yay), got about 6 planes capable members, our mid level teams are learning how to run raids now (yay), I finally got my shrunken Goblin Earring and Bracer of the Hidden so I've been going around casting on everyone in sight, and I led my first successful raid (zero deaths, buffed and broke in in 43 minutes) against the Golden Efreeti (we're up to 5 boots for the alliance now :).<br>
<br>
(ps sorry for the zigging and zagging)<br>
<br>
Oh and as for FFA vs Rotation?<br>
<br>
You guys have an ENORMOUS concentration of high level players on your server.  BUT, it also seems like those players are all mature individuals who still remember their kindergarten teacher's lessons on sharing.  I like the way you guys are announcing your intentions and then falling back on diplomacy to work things out if 2 groups want to be up there.  I also think for that to be a success there is only ONE RULE you guys need to follow.<br>
<br>
Learn to Limit Yourselves.<br>
<br>
If the guild leaders can espouse that ideological paradigm, I can't possibly see how things can go wrong.  We have the KGC and KCoG so we don't HAVE to worry about trusting whether or not people will adhere to the rules - the system in place simply won't give them the opportunity.  Without it - there will eventually come that one group who believes wholeheartedly that might makes right and they can singlehandedly destroy the peace on a server.  I've read consistent accounts of some of the uber guilds on your server now and if they don't learn to limit themselves, things are going to get out of hand.<br>
<br>
Uber guilds are self perpetuating entities that grow and grow and the more they grow - the more they need to be fed, until the point where that desire outstrips the environment's ability to supply it without sacrificing everyone and everything else around it.<br>
<br>
but that's all speculation...  :)<br>
<br>
So good luck guys - pop in every now and again and let us know how you're doing - god knows our server has been stripped of some of its best qualities.<br>

<br>
I agree that that 6 month list on Sol Ro was horrible but FFA would be much worse.  The guild that can rally the most people to the planes will have contol of it.  As a member of a small guild this worries me.  We have proven that we can handle the planes, however it has also been shown to us that we can't compete with a larger guild in the plane should they decide to take over.<br>
<br>
My vote is to have scedualed raids.<br>

<br>
Maybe they will own the planes (the uberguilds). But, Landslide did hate a few days ago, we aint many but it worked very good, even with some other groups up there.. we got pretty nice loot too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
IF we are going to make a list, it will never end up like the Sol Ro list.. NEVER! IF a list is going to be created, we need much harder rules, a guild should only be allowed to post ONE booking(sp?) and have the plane for a maximum of 3 days. When they have done the days they first booked, they may book again. This suggestion was up on Sol Ro and I think it will work just great. At least you won't have to wait 6 months!<br>
<br>
EDIT: If one of the uberguilds, like Darkwind want to go there, they will.. no matter if we have a damn list or not! <p>//Fandariella, High Elf Enchantress

I'd like to reply by saying that Destiny just finished their posted stint in Hate and, having come from SolRo, experienced our first real FFA type run.<br>
<br>
We encountered two other guilds in the zone while we were there: Landslide and Undead Lords.  I'd like to comment on the FFA type system based on our experiences with these two other &quot;competing&quot; guilds.<br>
<br>
First, Landslide was courteous and receptive.  Ranina and I spoke early on and attempted to work out a means of sharing the zone; unfortunately the zone stayed very empty a lot.  We even discussed the possibility of jointly taking down Maestro, however, Landslide wanted to try, and we originally had no intention of trying, so wished them luck.  All in all, not a bad experience.<br>
<br>
Second, our experiences with Undead Lords were mixed.  The first day, we had a number of incidents of &quot;clashing heads&quot; in that the zone was pretty empty, so we ended up competing over any mob that spawned.  Words were exchanged and bad feelings started.  The second day, UL seemed more open to trying to share with us, and we even ended up sharing drops that neither group needed.<br>
<br>
My conclusion:  FFA will not work on this server.  I can imagine how it would have been if a third guild decided to join in on that last day.  Everyone would have been all over each other.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, I suggest from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AyRo experience</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> now that we need a method of, not necessarily scheduling, but of at least announcing intents.  And, other guilds need to realize that a posted intent has to be able to carry some weight.  If guilds are going to do as they wish with as many people capable of doing these types of situations as AyRo has, then we *NEED* a means of working ALL together, not against each other, or we'll all end up fighting constantly. <p><img src="http://www.concentric.net/~purgon/gilpaint.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usinadilye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinadilye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/1/01 6:07:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conesus--- FFA planes or schedule</span><hr size=1> What about the people who don't read these boards?<br>

This is the part you can't control, and this is the part that is going to cost you endless frustration as long as you want an announced intent to be the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> deciding factor</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in who gets a plane.  It won't work that way, if for nothing else, than for all the guilds that don't read the board, like Sin mentioned.

Point is, there are a LOT of people that don't frequent web boards for a game they play. You can't expect to force your rules on them, which is why in the end after all the bluster and fuss...the server will be FFA whether you like it or not. All it takes is ONE group of competent people to make the system not work. What are you gonna do to them? Boycott? <br>

There are about 5 large guilds who have said they will not support anything but a FFA system.  Due to this fact a calendar/rotation will not work.  Whether you like it or not it's a fact.  I suggest you get used to it and accept the FFA because without the support of EVERY guild a rotation system will not work.<br>

Just close this topic now and let it all stay FFA for a while. Maybe we can work out better solutions later, no bigger fights on the planes yet anyway.. that I know of.. <p>//Fandariella, High Elf Enchantress

<br>
A number of fairly large guilds (mine included) have stated that they want ~NO~ part of a schedule and reservation / rotation system for planes.  Without the full participation of every (and I mean ~EVERY~) last guild on the server, a schedule is pointless.<br>
<br>
Again, because like someone mentioned earlier, we all learned a few things in kindergarten our guild will be courteous and neighborly when it visits planes and epic mobs.<br>
<br>
If we want to go somewhere and it's too crowded, we'll leave.<br>
If we go and someone else is there, we'll share.<br>
If we go, we'll make our intentions known so other guilds can make plans accordingly.<br>
If a mob is up that we'd like to kill and we have the manpower to kill it, we'll attempt to kill it.<br>
<br>
It's common courtesy.<br>

The first day, we had a number of incidents of &quot;clashing heads&quot; in that the zone was pretty empty, so we ended up competing over any mob that spawned. Words were exchanged and bad feelings started. The second day, UL seemed more open to trying to share with us, and we even ended up sharing drops that neither group needed.<br>
<br>
My conclusion: FFA will not work on this server. I can imagine how it would have been if a third guild decided to join in on that last day. Everyone would have been all over each other. &quot; -- Gildhar<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, we will respect anyone else up in the planes with us.  We will hand out anything that drops that we don't need to the first person who sends a tell after the drop is announced to the zone.  All that we ask is you respect our right to be there as well.  That first night you had problems because your bard started charming some of our pulls and there were some mixed words and there will be.  Start shit with us we'll be happy to give it right back and drops can start rotting.  We're old hands at working planes with other guilds.  We can do it peaceably or we can do it the hard way. It's up to the other guilds present how they want their experience with us to be.  We're not going to bend over kissing ass trying to make sure everyone gets along nor are we going to bend over and take it in the ass.  Either show some respect for each other and we can all get stuff we need or we can all let it go downhill. Either way, it's up to other guilds present on which path they wish to take with us.<br>
<br>
Second, the entire reason why planes are crowded here are because of your calendar systems from the other servers.  CT once had a calendar as well... after that nonsense was gotten rid of the planes were packed for a couple months and then it subsided.  When one guild gets in there and monopolizes a plane for several days... drops rot.  Drops that could easily go to another guild of needy members if they were present reducing the total number of trips they would have to make to get their members geared.  After the calendar was dropped on CT the planes stayed cleared for a few months and it seemed very crowded, however, more guilds outfitted more of their members in less time than it would have taken had they had to wait for 6 months to get in there.  It truly does work out.  IF CT still had their calendar it would still be booked solid and guilds that already outfitted would still be waiting.  There are many nights now that those planes sit empty because people were able to get their gear a lot sooner under FFA. Would you rather have to share Fear or Hate with 3 or 4 other guilds and still get your people outfitted in 1-2 months with a little headache of dealing with other guilds or would you rather be 6 months down the road still waiting to get in there?<br>
<br>
Regardless, UDL's (yes UDL, not UL) stance is that no one is going to monopolize an entire plane for any length of time while we are needing gear ourselves. We're willing to share and give up any drop that we are not needing, provided you respect our right to be there as we will respect yours and we can all finish getting what we need a lot sooner.  Otherwise, words are going to be exchanged, trains started, a lot of tempers will flare, loot will rot, and we will all be forced to put up with each other longer than need be.<br>

PREFACE: This post isn't directed at Strike, but his post does serve as an excellent starting point for my comments and questions.<br>
<br>
I don't think people really have a problem when there isn't any contention.  The question becomes, what happens when two (or more) groups 'need' the same spawn in a plane which is in a farming mode (as will be the case in those few months you mentioned)?  Who is to say who's need is greater?  Is it based on the highest level there?  Is it based on the number of a particular class present who could use the drop (assuming a drop occurs)?<br>
<br>
As Palimax has rightly stated, we are in a state of FFA because some guilds wish it.  I don't have a problem with that at all.  I think most guilds either don't have a problem with it or recognize they will need to deal with the situation (make the best of it).  This doesn't just apply to the planes as a whole, but the individual mobs within the planes (taking the PNP into account, of course).  Unless you have specifically received a promise to leave all the spawns of a_plane_mob00 alone from the other group(s) up there with you, don't expect those mobs to be uncontested.<br>
<br>
If a group consistently pulls more (or all) of these (re)spawns, don't get mad.  Learn how they are doing it.  Pulling is an art and master pullers are true artisans.  It may take some time to gain an equal footing with them, but in the end you'll be able to hold your own.  This isn't a sprint or even a marathon.  It's a path you'll need to follow to reach a goal.  Recognize there will be obstacles and work to eliminate them. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#3A6EA5">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Unguilded&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

This really depends on what you're talking about... if you're talking about Inny well then whoever gets to him first.  That's not to say some jack ass guild will be keeping tabs through people in zone and be waiting until the zone is cleared then make a mad rush at him as I've seen happen in the past on CT.  Everyone can decide from that point on how they will treat the offending guild in their future dealings with them.  If you're talking about rare epic mobs such as the book of souls... again, whoever gets to him first. If the guild who gets to it first and makes the kill requires the item, then fine, someone who needed it was present and got it.  Not many guilds have more than 5 or 6 rogues if that many.  It may take a week to get that mob.  However, that's still better than being on a 6 month waiting list still trying to get in there. If the guild making the kill doesn't need it I expect they will let the zone know so someone can come over and loot the item.  Common courtesy.  Sometimes it requires your guild to do a few clearings to get what they need such as the book of lost souls. Be persistent and be present and eventually you will get it.  However you distribute loot within your own guild is up to you.  On regular mobs, say we're primarily out for warrior drops... I don't expect to lay claim to every mummy in the zone.  You get some... we get some... if stuff drops that you need then great we're not going to haggle or fight over them.  I'd much rather someone from any guild get something instead of letting it rot.  <br>
<br>
Another issue is going to be clearing ability.  Some guilds are capable of clearing the planes in 2-3 hours.  It's taken a lot of practice and a lot of deaths to be able to achieve that.  Any guild that's achieved that ability will almost certaintly have most of the gear they need already and most drops that occur will be up for grabs to other guilds present.  When a guild like that is present it can become a time saving device for all other guilds present.  I know most everyone hates staying up to 3am in the morning trying to get a plane cleared... you can't operate for shit in real life the next day especially when clearing on weekday evenings.  Anyway, the faster the plane is cleared the sooner we can all get a respawn and we can get a higher yeild of drops out of there each week.  It all balances out.    <br>
<br>
Gildhar, I'll have a talk with the manufacturer of my video card.  Apparently, there is a problem with it.  Somehow, a female bard in gold and green armor kept running across my screen every 5 minutes that evening while I was out pulling throughout the night. Must have been a glitch or one of the most persistent zone ghosts I have ever seen.  Regardless, occurences such as this will happen, it's inevitable.  1-2 times or even 5-6 times in an evening is really nothing with that many people trying to operate in there.  I'm sure you're familiar with the old safehall/lord/frenzy camps in guk all fighting for spawns.  It's going to happen, people. Sometimes accidents just happen and no one is really to blame.  There's nothing personal involved.  No one is out to purposely deprive you of every mob in the zone.  It's best to go in there with the attitude that everything is cool so long as someone in the zone gets what's dropped and nothing rots while people present are there needing.<br>
<br>
More drops in less time = more people getting what they need in less time.<br>
<br>
A calendar is highly inefficient as drops will rot and there will be solo guilds that take an entire evening and some of the next day to get a plane cleared.  The goal for everyone should be keeping that plane cleared in the least amount of time possible.<br>
