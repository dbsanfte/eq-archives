However, it would offend the roleplayers I think.  I have seen posts before about something similar and gripes to verant about the /shout /ooc and /auction channels.  I think it's a minority that wish to actually live in the game.  Having your character act as if he were in a real world environment, and not being able, as in true life, to hear someone shout across the zone.  Personally, I would think this would provide a more close knit server community or be the bane of EQ one.  Inevitably, someone would flame someone in serverwide chat.  Or someone would turn it off and not realize they were being told something of importance, then die horribly for not having seen it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usilvermaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvermaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/01 6:50:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> There is a straight roleplay sever.</span><hr size=1> If you want pure roleplay then head over to the Firiona Vie Role Playing Preferred server.<br><br>You always have the option though of turning off /ooc /shout /auction and achieve some of the same things.<br><br>The Firiona server however is designed specifically for Role players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umaniacles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maniacles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/21/01 8:29:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On a seperate note, an interesting idea from maniacles</span><hr size=1> The chat channels I want to see are not necessarily automaticly subscribed to by everyone.<br><br>I'd basicly like to see whats available on chat servers.<br><br>#create (chatchannelname) (chatchannelpassword)<br>#joinchatchannel (chatchannelname) (chatchannelpassword)<br><br>it's old technology.<br><br>The lack of it is an abysmal goof, in my opinion.

Your options are listen to their commands in shout or ooc, or turn off shout and ooc and possibly miss some helpful information (ya know little things like, hey we're about to train 15 mobs to the zone and you might wanna move).  Zones like planes often have multiple raids going at once, and even multiple multi-guild raids.  The advantage of a raid channel would help keep the raid organized and still let anyone else in the zone keep regular channels open without having to see Shaman_01's obnoxious slow message or Paladin_01's ridiculously long rp incoming msg spamming across the screen.<br><br>2)  Ever have a pickup group wipe out and one or more members either ld's or has to drop to go pick up or log in someone to summon/rez?  Rather than have people constantly relaying tells to keep everyone informed, create a raid channel, and all 6 can communicate, even though they aren't in the same zone as the group leader.  Same with getting someone outside your group to do the cr.  Form raid channel with the group and the monk/rogue doing the dragging, and the dragger can find out who they need to get without spending 5 minutes surrounded by mobs waiting for an answer.  (there is nothing more frustrating than standing in crypt hidden, waiting for player A to remember how to spell player B's name because they zone crashed when they died and nobody saw where they died) <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uullric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ullric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/25/01 9:31:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On a seperate note, an interesting idea from maniacles</span><hr size=1> I feel that any group that is attempting a multi guild raid should simply get their act together and do what it takes to get the same raid done with one guild.

Some of us in small guilds have our 'act together' just fine; but when we wish to raid areas that we are too small to break, hook up with another friendly guild in the same situation in order to hit these areas for our mutual benefit.  Some guilds have it in their guild rules that you are not *allowed* to detag in order to join another group/guild for a raid, and the members like it that way (while we have no hard rule against it, our members by and large would not detag) - being able to create a raid channel on the fly would save a lot of hassles.<br><br>Sure, a lot of the necessary communication can be done in say, or relayed between groups (which we do now), but especially in dicey situations the delay involved in relaying a message can literally be the difference between life and death.  <br><br>Besides, I'm willing to bet that even some of the 'large' guilds on the server have relied on help from other (I know they have - have seen the thank-yous posted numerous times) on raids whether due to wipeout, helping a guild with a particularly tough epic raid, etc.<br><br>I think that raid channels would be a great convenience for players, both for large raids and for pickup multi-groups, and I hope that this gets implemented.
