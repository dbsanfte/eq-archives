<br>
You don't fly on airlines very often do you?  Who has control of "all those innocent people up here with no escape route" when you are riding on that aircraft?  The flight crew does.  Yes, they already control your fate the second that plane leaves the ground.  Moot point.<br>
<br>
<i>Plus, this now would have to be a huge temptation for terrorists, or other not-quite sane persons, and give them the perfect opportunity to act out.</i><br>
<br>
Yes.  Not a day goes by that someone with a gun doesn't make me want to do something worse than purchase that copy of <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.  We all know that people in the proximity of guns will do things that are much worse than they normally would do.  It's all I can do to keep myself from lighting things on fire when I see an armed guard or police officer.  Given an unarmed octagenarian, on oxygen, in a wheel-chair and a United States Marine with an M-16, I'm sure any terrorist will go after the Marine nine times out of ten.  (out of sarcasm mode:  I think you meant to say something else, but worded it in a manner that I misconstrued, but I had to poke fun :)  What did you mean to say there? )<br>

As mentioned above.  What's to stop them from doing that now?  You do realize, that when you're happily cruising along reading <i>Sharper Image</i> and doing oragami with the puke-sack there's two or three people that are making decisions that will affect (or is it "effect", I can never get that right) the outcome of your life.

Do I worry about hijackers? Nope. If you worried about every way you could die on a plane, you'd go insane. As a passenger, you really can't do anything about it until it happens.<br>

Of course in our country of political correctness, we'd have to have &quot;armed and non armed flight crew flights&quot; because some folks would object <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You have two mothers, each with their child.  They are identical, except lady B has a pistol and knows how to use it.  You are tasked with walking up to them with a large knife and taking their kid away.  Which of the following do you think is true?<br>
<br>
a.) Child A will be easier to kidnap.<br>
b.) Child B will be easier to kidnap.<br>
c.) There will be no difference in the difficulty of kidnapping either of the children.<br>
<br>
You mean to tell me, that it's just as easy to victimize someone that is unarmed as someone that is armed?<br>
<br>
As far as strengthening cockpit doors, yes, that's a good first start, but what's the downside to having the flight crew with guns?  None of this, "Terrorists can still do *insert movie script/ Wile E. Coyote idea here* if there are guns or not" either.  What's the downside? <p>Faust<BR>

Putting guns on the planes could just mean that the terrorists dont have to bother trying to get some onto the plane.  They just have to plan out how to take them from the people who already have them.<br>
<br>
So maybe the flight crew shouldnt have guns in the cockpit.  Maybe there should be two sky-marshalls in civilian clothing on every flight.  Like I said before, I think someone should be armed up there, but figuring out who that should be is going to be a tough thing to do.<br>

Also determined terrorists have the time to plan, once again shown by the 11th sep hijackings. That wasn't something planned on a weekend.<br>

Marshalls might be a better idea, after all, if you know that the crew is armed, who would you shoot first? However 2 marshalls against 6 suicidal terrorists? Or 2 pilots...<br>

<br>
Not within the constraints placed on the scenario for the purpose of showing that someone resisting armed is probably going to be a bit more difficult than someone resisting unarmed.<br>
<br>
<i>Marshalls might be a better idea, after all, if you know that the crew is armed, who would you shoot first? However 2 marshalls against 6 suicidal terrorists? Or 2 pilots...</i><br>
<br>
I agree, but there are not enough marshalls to go one every flight.  If I've done my math right, there is at least one flight crew per aircraft.  Given the "impenetrable cockpit" idea, what's the harm of the crew having that final buffer of being able to stop a hijack before it ends up being a shoot down?  That's the original point.<br>

I am military and belive in the right to keep and bear amrs.  Its no the gun its the person.  You put a gun on the plane it gives more access to said weapon.  Air Force One the movie was a good example, i Secret service agent co-op with terrorists and you got a big problem, most of the movie was 100% beleiveable and able to be done.  If you train flight crew in basic hand to hand, and have them work out, you whould be better off.  Im sorry but if a few Barishnkof's or Arabs jump a plane with box cutters, they are in big troubble if im there. As the occurance with the flight in pennsylvania(sp).  Just train all flight members and crew on close quarters hand to hand combat.  They have a better shot at disarming or subdueing a Terrorist with hand to hand then some random gunfire.  You cant expect someone with 2 weeks firearm training and no militarty backgroupnd to perform anywhere as to be expected in a high stress situation.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulvydro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lvydro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/13/02 1:38:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=805.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cons for everyone</span><hr size=1> i read this artical about how they are thinking of putting autopilot on the planes so it would fly to the nearest airport and could not be turned off unless BOTH the pilot and the copilot put in 4 digit codes known only to them... just stick that in with a  very reinforced door into the cockpit and you have good enough protection for me.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umirajtheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miraj the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/13/02 6:20:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=805.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cons for everyone</span><hr size=1> Can the pilot/copilot be the actual terrorist...?<br>
<br>
(didn't realize there was a 2nd page)<br>
<br>
but, whose to say the pilot isn't a person who was trained for fly the plane and well...is a fundamentalist. One can hide many things about oneself. They can pull out that glock or Deagle and kill those who oppose and then proceed to crash the plane. If the person is willing to take their own life, I can see them training in real flight school, becoming a pilot, then doing it... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umirajtheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miraj the Enchanter</A> at: 1/13/02 6:27:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upsydex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Psydex </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/13/02 2:56:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=805.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cons for everyone</span><hr size=1> If the cockpit is made harder to get into than it is now, by the time any hijacker makes his way to the pilots, hes already taken control of the back of the plan.
