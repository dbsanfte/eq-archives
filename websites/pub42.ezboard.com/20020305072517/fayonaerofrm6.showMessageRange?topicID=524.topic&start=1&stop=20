Specially to my friends in the guild Vision. Don't hug me all at once!<br><br>Okay enough of joking, i got endless tells if I am playing again etc.<br>So yes, not as often as before but still enough. <br><br>Over two months have past now, noone of this " I hate Hoverrang Fanclub people " forgot me so i'm exited how much more enemies i can make until chrismas.<br><br>In case of anyone has any questions, feel free to post. This should be an interessting topic for a bunch of people cause i'm ready to answer a lot of shit about the rumors in past and about the creation of my bad reputation that i have by some people. Why now? Because the story has reached the full end with this awful sad situation of Seven Eyes now.<br><br>So if you are one of those people who say, He's an idiot and i will never have anything to do with him again no matter who he really is, better go, leave this topic and make your own enemies, what would the life be without any trouble huh? You can always find an idiot when you want.<br><br>If you think that people can be wrong, can be different or maybe you believe in missunderstandings you should stay.<br><br>First of all i have to agree im an jerk. I was always a looser in decept, lieing or use guilds for own reasons. I always tried to help friends, to give some people new way, new doors. What was the reward? <br>A kick in ass for training people even when it was an accident. Mistakes are not allowed in EQ!<br>A kick in ass for helping people to get epic weapons.<br>A kick in ass just because i was to friendly to some people.<br><br>But hey, always say the truth, here we go we saw what happens when we tell the truth we get answeres like, “ Fuck you Hoverrang. “<br><br>So the most people ( not all but sill a lot ) are clever, they are good liers can charm people better than me and w00t, there they go.<br><br>Since i have nothing more to loose because its just a game and im finally free here some 100% Infos from the 19 years old idiot. You can believe in that or not I give you my word that my statements are 100% true from my side.<br><br>- I disbanded Storm of Eternity because my school restartet and i was not longer able to play every day anyway. So I froze my Characteres.<br><br>- I disbanded Storm of Eternity because Hartmut and Schande are incompetent fools in beeing social to other guildmates, nice and helpful to people in the guild. Big power in knowledge about EverQuest yes but that's not everything. Also the split began with a few disbands and people who followed Hartmuts way. I did not have the power and time to build up again, what they destroyed.Kindergarden games are not my thing. Only 2 Choices, In or Out. Not both.<br><br>- I always loved Storm of Eternity and a lot but not all people. We got so many n00bs wich were able to get their dream loot and some left anyway.<br><br>- My dream was it to give people an alternative possibilty to join an uber guild. To the creation time only Darkwind, Eternal Wrath and Vea Victis / SoP were really strong and it was hard to get into these guilds i know this by myself. So i wanted to give everyone the chance if we work together in a team we can build up a new strong and powerful guild. I got all people from Sebilis, pick up groups we got a lot of invites a lot of idiots and very very nice players wich i will never forget. And so we got a guild wich could kill all epic mobs and some big nasty mobs on Velious. It worked and it was great. Over 25 people got their epics. A lot of ToV Armor, Trak BPs and much more. It was a good feeling specialy since i never leaded a guild before and i was just the, let me quote Hartmut, " 19 years old idiot. " Over 6 months was it at all.<br><br>- I made mistakes too, often i act a little bit fast before thinking over it. This is a bad thing of me and im working on it. This was a reason why we just took the Shissar on Fearplane from Vision. But they should anyway never forget: It was no Kill Steal. You weren't able to kill it with 20 people in time and we went up unprepared with 4 people and killed it. Why i looted this thing? Cause i would be an idiot if i hadn't. It was the plan to get the shissar and we got it. We never stealed mobs on purpose or anything we always were against stealing things. You cleared a part of Fearplane and I talked several times with GM Zhiem or whatever she was called. Those mobs like Ragefire are FFA. The fastest persons win thats why I got confirmed from her. <br>But hey that wasn't all, we trained Looking Glass and Landslide in Sebilis we said sorry hundred times no matter we ( i 'am ) idiot(s).<br><br>Once again and for all eternity, all the bad things from the old guild SoE were not plans of killing , annoy or wipe anyone out from our opponent guilds. I always tried to find solutions for problems and when we made mistakes i we tried to help.<br><br>What did we not? We haven't played like little girls. When we had a race for Trakanon we raced. When there were 5 guilds on way to Venril Sathir than we were a part of it. We worked hard for our Items!<br><br>We always tried to play fair but on a high level server like this we used all power to get what we were able to get. The slow turtles going home... sounds cruel but thats EQ reality. I don't think about sharing anything in a game were other people wouldn't do the same. I lived for SoE and so i was 100% behind this guild . I wanted to show my guildies that we can reach any goals we want. And we got almost everything we wanted and what was on schedule. <br><br><br>- I made another mistake when i not heard to friends about Hartmut Reaktor. Awesome player always open for action but for me a cold person wich don't know the word friendship. And a person who thinks that Age says everything about your knowledge. So i had no chance to tell Hartmut anything with my awful 18/19 years.<br><br><br>- I got some E-Mails with trojans viruses etc. That just showed once more how many psychos are playing this game.<br><br>- Those who send me tells and don't get replies please stop telling me. This has a reason for sure but it seems some people don’t get it in head. /points @ Darus for example.<br><br><br>- I protected Storm of Eternity together with my friend Soltanol until end. We did everything what was needed to give it the touch. And i think we didn't failed at all.<br>Our Speed during raids was just the problem we caused some troubble via trains not many i think 2 or 3 guilds were affcted but they cried loud enough to blame us down. I want to say again SORRY for this. I loved my guild and in my head was just one sentence. Protect the guild and make it more powerful. I learned a lot in this time, so again, sorry to all who got problems to that time with Storm of Eternity. <br><br><br>- To Darkwind. Really nice guild with a lot of the nicest persons of this server. Bad for me i hadn't the time to play when i joined you but i will never forget it big thanks again to you all i learned a lot from you and I wish you the best for your future plans.<br><br><br>- In the end i could make it easier, visit another online game, change my name, start new character or anything else. All the reputation would be on zero! But that would be crap. I made some things wrong but not so much and so big things that i will hide for all eternity. Its enough with all this bullshit. Get off this crap finally i im not the guy who likes to annoy anyone nor i want any trouble.<br><br>- Those people who know me better than the guys who posted this " Fuck you Hoverrang messages " can maybe tell you a bit other things about me.<br>And besides a lot of other people in EQ i don't slime and charm other people to get what i want. You can always be sure to hear 100% answeres and not any crap stories. Look at those people who change there guilds as often as i change my clothes and always have the big mouth. But thats maybe not important enough for some guilds.<br><br>All this in one sentence. I 'am always willed to help and spend time for friends, this often ends in competition with other players and this makes them to enemies cause i'm a rude opponent when I got a rude opponent too and I play hard and rough but STILL NOT unfair.<br><br>I maybe should change it and be more social in this point but it is hard. But im working on it to avoid such situations in future.<br><br>I can live with that some people don’t wanna group with me or teleport me or speak with me, but I don’t like it when people cry like babies “ There is Hoverrang, hes a jerk baddest player on Ayonae Ro don’t invite him in your guild! “ Stop this bs please. Let people make their own opinion about me. You don’t need to assist them with your point of view.<br><br><br>For those who still hate me and want to give me a second chance. Storm of Eternity is no more and a new chapter for me begins. You can talk with me and when i make mistakes i will try to do it better. Thats all what i can do. I don't owe anyone anything. But at least i want to tell you whats really going on. So I just want a second chance nothing more. <br><br>My head and soul is empty now finally i said what i wanted to say.<br><br>Amen<br><br>See you in EverQuest,<br> <p><p><u><b><font color="#0099FF" size="2" face="System">Hoverrang Leonheart - Phantasmist - Ayonae Ro</font></b></u></p><p><font color="#0099FF" size="2" face="Microstyle Bold Extended ATT">&quot; I don't know, what I will be... only what I'am now... &quot;</font></p><p><img border="0" src="http://www.soe-guild.f2s.com/hoverrang00.jpg" width="247" height="195"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 1:23:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=524.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back...</span><hr size=1> Wb bud <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>Sspeed 40th Monk<br>Halo 'who broke my mezz?'<br>Tank_001 says 'me'<br>Tank_001 has been slain by Haloface.<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usoltanol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soltanol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 1:31:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=524.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back...</span><hr size=1> Welcome back, Brother :-) <p><p><u><font face="Microstyle Bold Extended ATT" color="#FF9900" size="2">Soltanol Leonheart - Defiler - Ayonae Ro</font></u></p><p><img border="0" src="http://www.soe-guild.f2s.com/soltanol03.JPG" width="362" height="178"></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usoltanol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soltanol</A> at: 10/28/01 9:19:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhartmut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hartmut</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 2:59:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=524.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back...</span><hr size=1> seems you didnt learn anything .  you agreed with me to stop posting flames long long time ago . but you cannot  stop ...  very noble.<br><br>btw me semi-retired due my reallife activities at the moment.<br> <p>oracle hartmutayonae ro</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhartmut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hartmut</A> at: 10/28/01 3:04:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usoltanol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soltanol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(10/28/01 3:57:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=524.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back...</span><hr size=1> @Hartmut Since when is stating the truth considered flaming?<br><br>but since you understand it in this way...you should maybe read your own guildrules again:<br><br>2.

We made the mistake of not killing him sooner, expecting other people to not simply exercise greed as their primary motivating factor in every encounter.
