<br>
I remember you joining tides, you were what? 51 at the time along with many of us who were only 55 or close to it, so of course we werent going to kill vindi without  problems. and arent you the one who wasnt healing that raid, do you even know how to make a Cheal macro with a pause in it yet? <br>
<br>
Dont flame a guild because we couldnt take a mob with you in it. hop you realize you are only as good as your guild on raids.<br>

I was at a friends house watching the whole thing. The fatal flaw was my friend blocking me from bind rushing Caligula under VS. Sorry to give away tactics. The point of this was so I could chain cast unspoken word and nuke him the mob to holy high hell, while getting a few shots in with his epic. BAM SMACK POW. That would have been the end of it. <br>

If helgridd hadn't interfered they would have won the first round.

<br>
<b>I AM NOT AELANI</b>....2 seperate people...i can have aelani post what she thinks about ToV if u like? i promise u she will have much worse things to say than me.<br>

Kornutz, if u were smart u would get out of the guild ASAP...they will only bring u down bro.<br>
<br>
Ullric how about this, go suck a fat penis ok? first mistake ToV made was making u am officer. second, have U ever taken down vindicator? third after being in ToV ( and being an officer) u better hope ToV never breaks, u will have the hardest time finding a guild. lol my guild right now, has more strategy and skills that ToV can ever hope to have. and yes strategy is not taking 60 people to a raid to kill a mob. <b>U NEED TO HAVE SKILLS BEFORE U GET THERE!!!!!</b><br>
<br>
Mabey while u guys sit in temple veeshan for hours, u should try and develope some type of  guild structure and startegy and mabey u can one day  u can play with the big boys.<br>

<br>
Second, beware of those casters in there, they are dangerous, for u guys u may need even more than u had at the failed vindi raid.<br>
<br>
After u guys get down in there, u might be able to head to Befallen, but not b4 u perfect the art of assisting.<br>
Now, befallen is a bit tougher runneyeye, there are rats in there that "disese" u so beware...have the cure disease spells up, lvl 5-10 i believe....hey theres an assignment for you all, tell me what lvl spells are the "cure diease" spells. Its real easy to train in there so make sure u have an enchanter who know how to mez ( do u know what mezzes are? if u dont look it up)<br>
<br>
After u get dont in befallen i think u will be able to handle urself, ( im trying to have faith)<br>

<br>
When u guys get up enuff courage to try Runney eye...hers a tip to be able to get there all together, in one piece, and with no death<br>
<br>
U will have to port into misty thicket (do u know where that is? if not look  that up to) Be sure to invis b4 u port in, some of u may be KOS, oh i forgot who i was talking to, KOS means Kill on Sight. If u dont, *KOS* people will be attacked by the guards there, u guys are definetly NOT ready for Misty Thicket Guards. Follow the path and it will take u right there, be aware that there are 2 yes 2 guards at the entarnce and 3 ,omg i know its a lot but u guyys can deal, at a camp near by the entrance, fight thro and zone in, might be a good idea to invis b4 u enter there to.<br>
<br>
P.S. there will be low lvl character in there too, dont let them harrass and bother u, u guys are &quot;special people&quot;, always remember that )<br>

I'm not known for arguing or flaming, but I had to post something.  I'm guessing that the monk accidently pulled VS, while clerics and casters were low on mana and buffing, have you ever tried to pull some named mob of a zone while your not ready?  Probably not.  And the losing to Vindicator, I was at 3 attempts.  We had about 50 people there, and yes, it was our first experience and we are learning new things, heck, EW had to learn strategy's before they could take out AoW.  EW was killed and wiped out, but no flames came up.  Maybe it is because they are the most respected guild on the server? I dunno, but flames like this are coming up because you think ToV is an &quot;easy&quot; target.  Well we're not that easy anymore.  We are excelling at the higher end mobs now, and we are doing great.  I don't think you have any room to talk though, maybe you are just jealous? <p>Tassalhoff Buurfoot<br>
