There have already been petitions on the behalf of French players for a european time server, but Verant's answers have always been non-committant &quot;we'll see&quot;s.<br>
  I, for one, would like to participate more actively; unfortunately, my main's a 20 warrior, since I prefer to roleplay rather than camp a site for three straight hours... Of course, in everquest, that gets you nowhere...<br>
 I hope some changes will be made sometime soon so as players such as I can take part, or at least be there to watch the happenings...

It is my belief that the corruption is spreading faster on some worlds than on others. Unfortunately, it appears that our world will also suffer the fate of corruption.<br>
<br>
Late last night between the Earth Hours of 12 midnight and 12:30am Pacific time, a guildmate of mine was exploring through Lesser Faydark for signs of the corruption and sent word to me that he saw a single Frightling.<br>

Cazic Thule has corrupted the before beautiful into a less dangerous version of the Plane of Fear. The sky is blood red (i kinda like it, i hafta admit, hehe).<br>
<br>
The faeries have been turned into undead sprites, which look like the Scarelings on Fear or the Evil Little Imps on Hate, so far i have been able to locate 6 different types (i think they simply replaced every faerie type with a similar undead sprite type):<br>
an undead sprite<br>
an undead sprite horror (beware, those are shadowknights and harmtouch for 141 to 181 and attack EVERYONE no matter the lvl)<br>
an undead sprite guard<br>
an undead sprite guardian<br>
an undead sprite spook<br>
an undead sprite raider<br>
there also is a leader called Bloodboil (this replaces the Princess Joleena, i think, which means the Raincaller quest cannot be finished at the moment!)<br>
they are of the same lvl as the faeries have been before and still drop fairy dust and the other things the faeries dropped, but there also several new quest items (for quest i do not know of yet) dropped off them, all of which are magic lore no drop:<br>
An Undead Sprite's Severed Tongue<br>
A Bile Soaked Bandage<br>
A Pupiless Eye<br>
Power of Earth<br>
A Jagged Shard of Bone (very interesting apart from the quest aspect, since it's a) an all/all piercer... yes, druids, for example, can use it, altho they don't have a Piercing skill! and b) because it procs fear... VERY nice for melee classes that can't fear so they can fear kite nevertheless)<br>
<br>
Before they attack they say this:<br>
'Aaarrrg! Another soul to be delivered to The Faceless! How lovely indeed! I do not think he will mind so terribly much if I suck the marrow from your bones while you still twitch and squirm at Death's Door.'<br>
<br>
or this:<br>
'I will pry those pretty little eyes from your skull and feast like a king upon your every fleshy nerve!'<br>
<br>
After they die they say this:<br>
'You foolish, puny creature! You think this is the end? HA! I'll be back and next time, you won't be so lucky!'<br>
<br>
or this:<br>
'Oops! Back to The Faceless I go. I'll be back, and your eyes will be mine!'<br>
<br>
The pixies have been turned into Frightlings, which look like tiny skeletons, so far i've seen two types:<br>
A Frightling (the former Pixie Tricksters, i think)<br>
A Frightling Horror (the former Pixie Pranksters, i think)<br>
there also is supposed to be a leader called Bilewretch, but i cannot confirm that as of yet (probably the replacement for Whimsy Larktwitter)<br>
they are of the same level as the Pixies were before them and also have several quest items (all magic lore no drop), so far i have seen those:<br>
A Silver Vial of Blackened Fluid<br>
An Illegilbe Scroll of Flesh<br>
A Frightlings Skull<br>
<br>
other changes are:<br>
Equestrielle the Corrupted, the former unicorn of Tunare which has been corrupted by Cazic Thule roams the forest, killing everyone in sight (i haven't seen her yet because she was killed before i could reach her)... she drops Unicorn Horn Fragments (magic lore no drop with 2 charges of Purge)<br>
there is a tainted brownie (i'm not sure if this is new, tho) which drove even the mighty Immortalis to flee! other than that the brownies are untouched<br>
there is a blighted mare, which looks like the Nightmares on Fear and drops nothing (maybe has a rare drop tho)<br>
there are a few new NPCs:<br>
Talisyn Stormwing, a wood elf who stands at the ruined druid circle near the MM entrance, he gives out at least 2 quests related to the Frightlings and Undead Sprites<br>
the text he says is the following (thanks, Sortilege, for saying the right words to him when i was stuck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ):<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:18 2001] Sortilege says, 'Hail Talisyn Stormwing'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:18 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'Greetings, Sortilege . You must forgive my rather [inhospitable mood] this day, if of course it comes forth to you in what speech we have. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:33 2001] Sortilege says, 'what inhospitable mood'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:33 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says ' I am merely... troubled by the conditions of my change in stations. I once guarded Kelethin from the vile Crushbone Orcs, but it seems a new terror has arisen within our forests. It is the duty of a ranger, and I do not complain in the least, but the [mutilation and corruption] that slithers through the forest still brings a pain of anger to my heart. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:53 2001] Sortilege says, 'what mutilation and corruption'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:54 2001] Talisyn Stormwing furrows his troubled brow in confusion and surprise. 'You need ask such a question and receive answers in the form of words to understand what it is that surrounds you, Sortilege ? Have you neither heard nor seen the vile creatures that inhabit the putrid lands of Mistmoore to the south? Or have you not seen the creatures forged from the very shadows that lie not to far from our homelands? The Teir`Dal beasts that have made camp not too far from the entrance of Mistmoore's lair? These evils, some ancient beyond our pilgrimage from Tunaria, have torn and marred these precious, beautiful forests. Unfortunately, a [greater evil] has descended, and thus my presence here. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:58 2001] Sortilege says, 'what greater evil'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:58 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'Not too far in the recent past did Firiona Vie, the lovely and gracious Champion of Tunare, return to our homelands. In her return, she sought to bring forth the avatar of our sacred Mother to seek guidance on her path -- the path of Elven Kind. Little did the Champion know that The Faceless was close at bay, and through means unknown, his power was greater than that of our sacred Mother's. In a petty display of his new found power, the Lord of Fear [furthered the corruption] of these natural lands. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:25 2001] Sortilege says, 'how did he further the corruption'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:25 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'I cannot say for sure, and neither can our elders. None know for certain how or why this was done. All we know is that [the beings that were closest to Tunare's grace] were reaved from her grasp, and now roam as the undead or worse.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:37 2001] Sortilege says, 'what Tunare's grace'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:37 2001] Talisyn Stormwing closes his eyes and bows his head for a moment as if in mourning. 'The Faerie Folk that called this place their home have been changed into unnatural monsters of Cazic's will. They thirst for mortal blood and flesh, and have lost all innocent, grace, and reason that was once their existence. But they seem incomparable to [the greatest loss] to be turned in Cazic-Thule's favor. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:42 2001] Sortilege says, 'what greatest loss'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:42 2001] Talisyn Stormwing  raises his head, his features remaining solemn but stern. 'Equestrielle, the maiden unicorn, was corrupted by The Faceless himself and through vile trickery, he convinced the angered and frightened Firiona to remove her horn to cease the spreading of the disease. In honor and regret, the Champion did so, but now that once beautiful and sacred being roams as a blood thirsty, uncaring monster who kills any and all mortal beings. She is why I was sent, as The Heartwood Master knew that any other would end her life in mercy or the others she would harm and thus he entrusted to me [these tasks].' <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:47 2001] Sortilege says, 'what tasks'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:47 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'I am here to observe, warn the travelers that would pass through these infected lands, and to gather what evidence that I can to further the research of the council of magics at Felwithe. However, as I am the only one that has been charged with such tasks, it has been quite difficult. I do not know if I can withstand seeing such destruction and chaos before even I find mercy to be the proper route. If only they would send [assistance], if only for a day. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:52 2001] Sortilege says, 'I will assist'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:52 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'I would be eternally grateful for your company, Sortilege  and your pledge to this cause. However, I cannot expect anything of you. If [you are sure] that you would be willing to aid all of the Faydark, then I will be willing to give forward what knowledge I have gathered thus far. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:56 2001] Sortilege says, 'i am sure'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:00:56 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'Then I thank you, Sortilege , and the entire Faydark thanks you. I have been studying and gathering evidence of the [Frightlings], or the distorted Pixies. I have already given several specimens of these creatures to the researchers, but I have found a great use for them beyond research. If you can bring to me one of their every so tiny skulls, I will do all in my power to cleanse that object so that it may aid you further in the tasks of the forest. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:01:08 2001] Sortilege says, 'what frightling'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:01:08 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'The Frightlings are what the corrupted Pixies have been calling themselves. I have found through my extensive scouting of the area that one called Bilewretch who acts as their leader. I have dreamed for many days now of his destruction at my bow, but unfortunately that would cause me to abandon my post, and leave myself vulnerable to attacks from the [Undead Sprites.] However, as you have pledged yourself to the cause, if you would bring me proof of Bilewretch's destruction, I shall reward you greatly for your service. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:01:34 2001] Sortilege says, 'what undead sprites'<br>
[Wed Jun 06 13:01:34 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'They are the twisted monsters of what used to be the noble Faeries of the forest. Now, they are but fleshy beings that desire only to bring death for their dark amusements. As with the Frightlings, these unnatural beasts are lead by a fearsome creature that has named himself Bloodboil. Another despicable being that I wish to bring a swift death to, but cannot for fear of abandoning my post and failing my master. If you would be so brave and bring to me proof of this monster's demise, your efforts will not go without reward <br>
<br>
if you turn in A Frightlings Skull to him, you receive A Silver Gilded Tiny Skull Earring, magic lore no drop with the following stats: AC 5 HP/Mana 20 SvD 6 and 5 charges of Force (VERY nice for melee classes, especially when you consider that the highest lvl frightlings are around lvl 5 and thus this earring is attainable VERY easily with a little patience (since the skull is a pretty rare drop)<br>
this is what he says upon completion of this quest:<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Talisyn Stormwing says 'Excellent! Well done, indeed }! I trust that you are well from your endeavor with these foul beings? Here, please take this and use it well in your continuing endeavors to purge this foul corruption from these once beautiful forests. I can assure you that it should come of some use, at one time or another. <br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Your faction standing with FaydarksChampions got better.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Your faction standing with KingTearisthex got better.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Your faction standing with ClericsofTunare got better.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Your faction standing with SoldiersofTunare got better.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] Your faction standing with CrushboneOrcs got worse.<br>
[Wed Jun 06 12:59:49 2001] You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
there also is a new dark elf NPC (i didn't talk to her since she and her companions would have, of course, slaughtered me) called Zyrria I'Vanres<br>
there ALSO is a faerie called Lady Nidra the Escaped, i haven't been able to see her myself tho, since she was slaughtered before i could reach her<br>
<br>
i think this closes my report, thank you all for reading, i think this is a VERY interesting turn of events, if also a bad one... i wonder if the Lesser Faydark will stay like this or if there will be some way to revert this vile corruption... this would be even interesting for non-RPers, since there is no way to complete the Raincaller quest at the moment, since Princess Joleena doesn't spawn anymore... a great loss to all us rangers<br>
