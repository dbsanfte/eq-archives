I'm one of those British ppl that stutter a lot and drink tea and eat crumpets, and say 'Oh golly gosh!'<br>
So, Thanksgiving. Whats what?<br>
From my experience on the subject, you celebrate the fusing of two cultures, who share the land and unite to make the great place of America (tm). The cultures being, native americans, and bloody colonials? I mean, you guys.<br>
So, so, let me get it straight.<br>
You guys move in, pillage, kill, burn, put flags up and claim America, that had existed since forever, and then put up lots of equality rules and amendments and shit? Strike up the market of slavery, and then keep host to the most brutal crimes, racial revolutions, and opressive states ever to exist?<br>
Fill me in, I'm confused. <br>
This is something to celebrate, with turkey?<br>
Of course, I could be completely wrong.<br>
Just an outsider's opinion, of course. From that there crazy Europe where we drink tea, and aparantly eat 'crumpets'.<br>
Love ya :P<br>

<br>
Than of course there are the chronological events that took place to lead to our present day &quot;Thanksgiving Day.&quot;  Settlers offering a turkey to Indians as a symbol of peace and thanks.  I'm not familiar with the exact history behind it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally, it should be a worldwide event because the concept behind it is admirable.  Anytime you rejoice over living and at the same are mindful and give thanks to those who allowed life to continue you're doing a great thing to them and yourself. <br>

Thankwhating?</span><hr size=1> Thanksgiving, in it's original form as a holiday, had nothing whatsoever to do with the Indians.  It was originally intended as just what it sounds like, a day of giving thanks and praise to God for two seperate things: the bounty of the harvest (which is pretty much what we remember it for today), and for the several recent and very bloody victories won by Union soldiers against the Confederacy (Gettysburg and Missionary Ridge to be more specific).  The author was Abraham Lincoln, and it wasn't intended as a regular holiday, complete with Indians, Turkey, and Football.  I'm sure a quick search would find how and in what stages it became a conglomerate of stuffing our faces and paying lip service to the Indians, but I don't really have the heart for it.<br>

And during the time most of world felt that the colonial way of Spain, France and Britian was the way to go. Just pull up a ship stand on beach in your fancy outfits and say &quot;I claim this land in that name of the king&quot; and presto land became yours (further reading check out Australia, India, Twianland).  And these so called British and Spainish subjects were the ones to set up slavery trade and stuff, fools here just kept the silly tradition up for century after we broke from europe.<br>
<br>
More to point Thanksgiving celebrates the pilgrams (British settlers) surviving the winter and not becoming another Roanoke (sp?).  Silly holliday I admidt but there are stupid hollidays everywhere in world.  <br>

So God save the queen and all that.  Happy Thanksgiving<br>

Think before you speak. I am no fanatic fan of Americans, I am a Canadian ( hint: part of the slowly shrinking British Commonwealth ), therefore I sometimes resent my rather large neighbour to the south, but when I see outrageous remarks like that, I can't help but laugh.<br>

Thanksgiving has different meanings to different people, but just to enlighten you, here are some of the things people in the EVIL UNITED STATES are giving thanks for this year:<br>
<br>
Thank you that none of my loved ones were in the world trade center or the pentagon.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Thank you for the brief time I had to share with my loved one before a terrorist driven plane tore them away<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Thank you for thousands of postal workers who risk their lives just to do their jobs every day thanks to a little thing called Anthrax<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Thank you for the soldiers and sailors spending their holidays thousands of miles away in hopes they can find a crazed fanatic before he finds a nuclear weapon.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Thank you that I still have my life and my family, even though my employer went under like so many hundreds of others in the wake of the bombings and I'm not sure how I will feed them.<br>
<br>
Before you piss on something for your own entertainment, think about what you are saying.  I guess this year I'll say thank you for the hardships and feelings of others providing entertainment value for Halo since he has nothing better to do. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

Thankwhating?</span><hr size=1> Actually I think everyone is just thankful to eat a fat turkey, drink lots of beer and enjoy Football.<br>
But thats maybe just me...<br>
<br>
Be honest. What exactly did you do on Thanksgiving?<br>
I am ABSOLUTELY sure that 99% did JUST Look forward to eat, drink and watch Football (and to see their families maybe).<br>
<br>
Your words, Nena, were sure right and your idea is great and honorable. I just doubt that more then 1% of the people did that...<br>
<br>
Thanksgiving became the same as Christmas. <br>
A huge economical thing with billions of dollars being put in food or gifts and the people all over america doing nothing else then enjoy their money and fat food. And spend money in gifts (in case of X-Mas).<br>
There will be not more then 1% of the people REALLY thinking about Jesus Christ being born in Bethlehem on Christmas day and so on...<br>
<br>
Its all about Food, Money, big american Lifestyle.<br>
But just, if you're really honest.<br>
<br>
But as I said, there sure is 1% that does exactly what you pointed out Nena. You may be one of those 1%.<br>
<br>
I would personally LOVE to have Thanksgiving here with us in Europe. Eat Turkey, Drink beer, watch Football, there's nothing wrong with it.<br>
But its wrong to hide behind those explenations of 'being thankful', 'thinking of the poor' (yeah right, you just spent 100$ on a huge dinner), 'being thankful to the indians' (which you DID kill for decades, from which you DID take your great homeland, which you did murder without any rights on the lands)... those ARE simple excusions. At least nowadays.<br>
Those reasons for the tradition of Thanksgiving are right, they are the reaosn why Thanksgiving was invented. But it has absolutely nothing to do with what Thanksgiving is today.<br>
<br>
Food, Drink, TV, seeing the Family. Nothing else. <br>
As I said, there's nothing wrong with it. But please don't hide behind cheap excusions for.. Eating a fest meal, drinking beer and watching Football.<br>
<br>
I also don't think about Jesus when I celebrate Christmas. I just enjoy the atmosphere, enjoy buying and recieving gifts and I enjoy eating a great meal. But I am at least as honest to admit it. Christmas has NOTHING to do with Religion for me. And I don;t waste one second in thinking of Maria and Joseph being in that crappy donkey farm and having a baby.<br>
It simply changed. And I would lie to myself if I would pretend celebrating Christmas because of that...<br>
<br>
But then again. 1% of the people celebrating Christmas DO go to church then, do think of Jesus' Birth and do celebrate his Birth and not.. simply celebrate.<br>

Whatever Thanksgiving started out as, holiday-wise (and I think that the numerous childrens plays I've had to sit through depicting the Pilgrims and Indians are absolutely wretched, as well as disingenuous), I think that setting aside a national holiday for people to simply give thanks for the blessings that they have in their lives is a pretty nice one.  Despite the fact that we have football, the start of Christmas shopping season, etc hitched onto it, Thanksgiving is actually a relatively *non* commercial holiday, and I think that a lot of Americans are able to enjoy it more than Christmas in that regard.   I am separated from my families today, but have sent my warm wishes to them via phone, and over my dinner will be giving thanks for them, my friends, and the fact that I am able to have access to this computer in a warm house to be able to send this message....  How have you been blessed this year?  <br>
<br>
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!<br>

Thankwhating?</span><hr size=1> As someone said previously... Thanksgiving has come to mean many different things to many different people.  Yes to some it is a day for drinking beer, eating alot, and watching Football.  But the Superbowl is the same thing, if that is the only qualifications.<br>
<br>
But for the majority of Americans.  It boils down to a day when we do give thanks, for those things we have, for those people who are in our lives, for those things we have to be thankful for.  And again this can be many things to many different people.<br>
<br>
And Taino there is alot more than 1% of the Americans to whom Christmas is a religious holiday.  But I will not get into a religious discussion.<br>
<br>
As with most holidays all around the world.  No matter what holiday it is.  This is a time when our families gather together to celebrate whatever it is.<br>
<br>
In our case, with this holiday, it is a day that we have set aside as a day to give thanks for many things in our lives.<br>
<br>
And because it is such a simple thing, there is no reason other countries cannot adopt a day of Thanksgiving as well.  All it takes is someone to put the idea forth, and others to agree with it.<br>
<br>
As I said in my post in the general thread.  I wish everyone a safe weekend.  For us it is a holiday, for others just a normal weekend. <p><HTML><BODY>

Personally i see Thanksgiving as a time to be with your family and/or friends, have a good time with them. have dinner without having any other motivesorgiving out presents or non of that comecial crap we are so involved in.
