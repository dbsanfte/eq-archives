... That the US (or better said Bush) feels he is above the world?<br>
There is now an international court that has been instated to be able to capture and punish people who do awfull things against humanity.<br>
<br>
The US has declared that it will (or may) free their own citizens if brought to this court.<br>
<br>
Why can the US decide when to attack a country because they feel they are wrong .. but when people think the americans or an american has done something brutal he/she can not be brought to justice unless the US feels so.<br>
<br>
I ask this as a serious question and would like peoples opinions on this.<br>

<br>
Cavemen without a home died. Life was rough. They had to find shelter and food or die. No one came up to the Caveman and said &quot;here, ill work harder so you dont have to and you can eat the food I find for you... let me find a nice cave for you while im at it.&quot; I make sure I work to have food when its time to eat, what part of that concept is complicated? Why do the homeless deserve to make others work harder to provide for them when they wont provide for themselves?<br>
<br>
Does being civilized mean people can decide they dont want to work and have others provide shelter and food for them? If so, tell me where to sign up, I want to quit my job, you can provide shelter and food for me while I lay around and do nothing for society other than provide a means for bleeding hearts to act like they are civilized. You dont have to give me money directly, just work your ass off, make alot of money and pay more taxes, then make sure your government uses that tax money to help my lazy ass out. Thanks! Hell while im at it, I should become a homeless drug addict. Being a drug addict entitles you to collect Disability. I can take my Disability check and go buy more drugs. Nice circle.<br>
<br>
I think we need a Caveman running the world, so he can find those lazy bastards that contribute nothing to the genepool and bash them over the head with a big fucking rock. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uanterakayonaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnterakAyonaeRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 3:41:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1658.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://membres.lycos.fr/selmagor/hpbimg/banana1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is it .. good discussion topic</span><hr size=1> Interesting point of view Yuegou, but you take it from the wrond side of the spyglass.

Why this guy (the caveman) didn't come, and said "well, you aren't the strongest of the clan, but maybe if we hunt together, you will learn something, and help the whole group with your own means ?"<br>
Now replace my caveman with our societies, and you are welcome in the "civilised" 21st century!! <p><br>

<br>
I'm sorry but i just don't see how you can say that. Especially when many US citizens fund the IRA (Terrorists) who regularly bomb parts of London and other English Cities as well as those in Northern Island.  Americans funded and trained the Taliban to rise against the ex-USSR occupation of Afghanistan.  <br>
<br>
Basically you fix one problem.. you end up creating another.  I could sit here and list problems all day...that america created.  But then, i could do the same for pretty much every country in the world.  Everyone does what they feel is best at the time. Sometimes it works out for the best in the long run....sometimes it doesnt.  <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure the CIA when training the Taliban had no idea that a few years later they would be launching a terrorist attack on the West.<br>
<br>
Not a rant at you bud... just saying don't be so quick to throw the blame around. at least without knowing facts.<br>

Homeless people are people who have made a choice, those who arent mental. They chose to not rise up and make something of themselves. Fish, dont expect someone else to fish for you and hand you the rewards.<br>
<br>
What is a starving homeless person that works called? Nothing, because someone that works can pay for shelter and food. Its pretty simple actually, you want to eat, you work. There is always work out there, its just that some people would rather not work than &quot;lower themselves&quot; to the type of work that might be required to garner some food and shelter cash. Pride and laziness are the cause of starving homeless people, outside of mental illness and acts of nature.<br>
<br>
There was never homeless in the past, if you didnt bust your ass to gather food and make shelter, you died. No one had to hold your hand, you learned or you died. Its the way nature works. Only the strong shall survive. (strong as in those willing to work for what they need)<br>
<br>
In the animal kingdom, when something is no longer useful to the whole, its left to fend for itself and almost always results in being weeded (dying) out. Humans have stopped the age old process and are caring for the useless persons. We screw ourselves in the long run with that practice. The weak use resources and make others work harder to support them, while providing nothing in return. We are cutting short our existance by over extending ourselves. Death is a natural order on this planet, yet we thwart its process by protecting those that nature usually weeds out. The homeless are the useless part of human society, they should be left to fend for themselves and thereby becoming a useful part of society or fall behind and weeded out of the herd.<br>
<br>
I know the above isnt exactly all hugs and kisses and everything is peachy in the world talk, but we are seriously screwing ourselves in the longrun, by allowing the homeless to leech off of the other working people in our society. I have no sympathy for the homeless, when they have the power to rise up and make something of themselves. The first step to learning a new skill, is getting off your ass and doing whatever it takes to learn a skill. If someone wont make the effort to provide themselves with food and shelter, why should anyone else have to worked harder to provide it for them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uanterakayonaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnterakAyonaeRo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/9/02 5:16:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1658.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://membres.lycos.fr/selmagor/hpbimg/banana1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why is it .. good discussion topic</span><hr size=1> Hmm same again Yuegou, same spyglass side. <br>
Homeless people don't born homeless. They got fired because there weren't in the top 10 of their company, then debts they made thinking they will have a job for long catch them back, and it becomes a vicious circle, which end in the street begging.<br>
Our society created homeless people, and then wants to keep them out of the garden.<br>
Easy example, here in France : If you want a job, you need to bring some bills proving you have a house. But to own or rent a house, you need to provide at least 3 monthly incomes from any work... Something wrong here don't you think ? Even with skills, if you are homeless, it's really hard to get out of the trash.<br>
<br>
And about your theory about homeless people wasting Earth energy, what do you think waste more energy ? The homeless guy who takes the bus to go to the work agency (sp?), or the middle class man who takes his car every day to buy new papers 100 meters from his house ? <p><br>

<br>
Note there "Here in France" bit.<br>
<br>
In the US you can find a place to live without 3 months of employment.  But then again, France has always been kind of insane :P<br>
<br>
The world is welcome to come up with whatever "court" they wish to prosecute international criminals.  It is about time the pissant countries of the world got off their lazy asses and tried doing something involving cooperation instead of fighting over the same worthless land year after year.  But if they fuck with our people we will take care of it.  <br>
<br>
I am afraid Bush is right though, the court is simply a play by countries with no power to try and manufacture power by manufacturing authority.  Power is earned, not garnered overnight by saying "Neener, we made a world court, we rox."<br>

America is the only thing standing between you and people that will eat you for breakfast.  Give us a fucking break, ok? <p><img src = "http://www.concentric.net/~gandalfh/BixieSig.jpg" width = 199 height = 136>

<br>
I can only speak from my knowledge of England since it is where i live.  If you consider us a &quot;Pissant country&quot; then heres a few facts.<br>
<br>
Right now there are thousands of British troops in Afghanistan clearing the mountains... Is that the Behaviour of a pissant country?<br>
<br>
Right now there are around 60 members of the SAS (arguably the best special service in the world) behind enemy lines in Afghanistan (and have been there for months) Is that the behaviour of a Pissant country?<br>
<br>
The SAS and SBS trained originally and still to this day provide support with the training of all American Special forces. Pissant?<br>
<br>
A certain US Army General was qouted as saying recently that &quot;The only country i would be worried about being at war with is England&quot;  Do you think he considered us a Pissant country?<br>
<br>
and so on....<br>
<br>
Sorry if this sounded like a jab at you Abraham, your an intelligent person i can tell... and you may not have even meant England when you said Pissant countries.  But i just wanted to get the point accross that its not just America that pours resources into peace. We are allys, we help each other.  Please don't consider what england and others do as insignificant, just becuase its not all over your news.<br>

<br>
Now, I don't want to downplay the SAS (got to meet a few when I was over in the UK), they are impressive as all getout.  I would, however, like to see where you got that particular tidbit of information.  I also might have read it wrong.  The way I read it, it's saying that <u>all</u> American special forces are trained (rather, supported by) the SAS.<br>
<br>
If you could clarify, that would be cool. <p>Faust<BR>
