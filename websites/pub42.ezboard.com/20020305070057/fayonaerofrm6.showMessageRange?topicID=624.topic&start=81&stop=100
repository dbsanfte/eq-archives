You say that genetics accounts for human behaviour and you cite the very publicized alcoholism &quot;gene&quot;, but in reality that gene is just a physical predesposition, not a predetermination. Plus everyone can become an alcoholic even without that active gene.<br>
You talk aout all this evil in the world and say that it is not cused by the errors of men, and then you talk about killings and massacres. Well those and most of the pure evil in the world, not natural disasters or genetic diversity, and they are performed by men. Sometimes even in the name of God like I've seen in different threads, which is a strong transgression.<br>
<br>
About the organization of the universe over time, it is a theory i heard from a proffessor who said that about philosophers today. It made sense to me because the universe at some point was matter and energy, it arragned itself into elements, molecules, galaxies, solar systems, magnetic energy,polarity, solar systems, organisms, populations, civilzation, etc. Wouldnt you  agree to that?<br>
<br>
You say you know about the cosmological arguments but you didnt know wha ti was talking about when i said that at the fronies of the universe there is no space or time, or that they are out of space and time, which is a principle of causalit and the cosmological arguement.<br>
 <br>
Also i have a news flash for you too. I have also been incredibly excited about a movie coming out, or my birtthday and Christmas being with my family, or dating a really cute girl that i cannot believe is going out with me, and all the good feelings that you experience early in life. I didnt live in the dark ages before becoming a Mormon. The feelings you have when you get promptings of the spirit are like no other felt in worldly life, and i can understand if you jut cant understand that.<br>
As for the feelings that other churches and religions claim to feel, well maybe your arguement would be good for them, because most of them dont live by the full word of GOd, and a lot of them dont even keep the very basic commandments, so they cant feel a  very strong spirit.<br>
<br>
I have not heard of the Hoffman affair, ut i have read a lot of anti-mormon literature. I also know a lot of men and women who have been reading the Book for more than a few decades, and i know that if there was something fishy about the church at some point, they wouldnt be members today. They are not blind followers, but also question their feelings and leaders of the church at all times. But, i will look into info about that supposed scandal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thormir, could you please explain to me how matter and energy came bout through naturalistic means?  Why hasnt natural selection randomly chosen the telomerase gene to be permanently active,which would make for incredible evolutionary fitness? Why does the telomerase p53 gene even have a reason for existing in the order of natural selection causing us to ag and die and why is there an end replication problem? Why do we have a mind and where and how is it created in the brain? Why , through design theory, have we evolved to have rationale and behaviors unatural to every other species? I really want to know your opinions about this, because you are very knowledgable, and  I truely try to be a person with an open mind and learn from everyone even if and when i disagree.<br>

<br>
Not quite.  I showed problems with belief in free will and reasons why determinism cannot be ruled out.  My belief is largely visceral and due to not spending much time worrying about it.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You say that genetics accounts for human behaviour and you cite the very publicized alcoholism &quot;gene&quot;, but in reality that gene is just a physical predesposition, not a predetermination. Plus everyone can become an alcoholic even without that active gene.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Do try to restate my position correctly.  I state that genetics has a powerful influence on human behavior and development; this has been repeatedly demonstrated by studies of separated twins.  My example does not predetermine but I think such a potent predisposition &quot;placed&quot; within the human body counts against the notion that we were all given free will.  But let's use a stronger example.  An individual with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease will, without fail, lose cognitive and physical capabilities during middle age.  This is a genetic condition that (like many such conditions) will profoundly affect one's behavior for a significant portion of life.  And in acting upon the mind, it affects one's will as well.  By all accounts, it's a devastating condition for the afflicted and those close to him or her.  This is but one of *many* conditions that abrogates free will.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You talk aout all this evil in the world and say that it is not cused by the errors of men, and  then you talk about killings and massacres. Well those and most of the pure evil in the  world, not natural disasters or genetic diversity, and they are performed by men.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, no, no!  How many times must I say this?  I'm not talking about MANMADE evils.  I know they exist, but they aren't part of my argument (except for certain examples where these evils are perpetrated because &quot;the word of the lord&quot; commanded them to be).  You keep mentioning &quot;genetic diversity&quot; as a cause of natural evil. Just what do you mean by this?  At what point did the human genome become &quot;diverse&quot; and in what respect?  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes even in the name of God like I've seen in different threads, which is a strong transgression.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
How about when it's *ordered* by god?  As in the chapters I cite?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; About the organization of the universe over time,... Wouldnt you agree to that?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The formations of galaxies, etc, are one way of measuring order, so yes, I would agree.  However, scientists have recently concluded (well, as much as they ever conclude anything) that the universe is set to expand indefinitely.  This could lead to a universe becomes infinitely diffuse.  Now, is this an ordered state or a disordered one?  I think it's better to refer to entropy and moving toward or away from states of equilibrium when discussing cosmic &quot;order.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; You say you know about the cosmological arguments but you didnt know wha ti was talking about when i said that at the fronies of the universe there is no space or time, or  that they are out of space and time, which is a principle of causalit and the cosmological arguement.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I must have missed the chapter on fronies and where they exist.  The time/out of time argument is, as I have said before, a *problem* for causation and the cosmological argument.  If time does not exist then actions cannot be taken.  There can be no &quot;a moment ago there was 'nothing,' now there is a universe&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; The feelings you  have when you get promptings of the spirit are like no other felt in worldly life, and i can  understand if you jut cant understand that.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Let's hear it for endorphins, kids.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As for the feelings that other churches and religions claim to feel, well maybe your arguement would be good for them, because most of them dont live by the full word of  GOd, and a lot of them dont even keep the very basic commandments, so they cant feel a  very strong spirit.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I'm sure they feel quite comfortable living by the full word of God, as they see it.  Certainly they are not confused and led astray by false books claiming to be the &quot;true word of God; companion edition.&quot;  And how can you *possibly* compare the religious experiences you feel with what those of other faiths feel.  Or with what I used to feel after a 10 mile run, for that matter.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I have not heard of the Hoffman affair, ut i have read a lot of anti-mormon literature.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Basic rundown.  A fellow named Mark Hoffman discovered a number of old writings that pertained to early Mormonism.  The church elders, naturally, were very excited by all this and purchased them for the Mormon library at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars (this was in 1986 I believe).  To make a long story short, it was discovered that Hoffman was an expert forger, and that despite the alleged satellite hookup between Jesus and the elder of the Mormon church (I forget his title) the LDS had been completely fooled into buying bogus manuscripts.  So much for divine guidance.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I also know a lot of men and women who have been reading the Book for more than a few decades, and i know that if there was something fishy about the church at some point,  they wouldnt be members today.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I think you underestimate the power of belief, not to mention the incredible social pressures involved.  Check out some writings by people who *have* left the church and the incredible ostracism and loss of family and friends they experienced.  And some of Smith's original followers left the church (or were excommunicated by it).  With the true revelation at hand, you'd have to wonder why.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; But, i will look into info about that supposed scandal.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Thormir, could you please explain to me how matter and energy came bout through naturalistic means? &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
If I had the answer I'd be a wealthy man.  Science isn't in a great position to tell us with certainty how the universe formed, but we are at a point where we can put together theories that fit with what we observe in the universe (e.g., quantum tunneling).  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Why hasnt natural selection randomly chosen the telomerase gene to  be permanently active,which would make for incredible evolutionary fitness?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Err, no, it would lead to evolutionary stagnation.  Immortality gets us nowhere.  You talk like &quot;natural selection&quot; is somehow supposed to care for us.  Nope, just like floodwaters on the Bangladeshi plains that can wipe out a million humans in a matter of days (something which you would have to ascribe to god), nature isn't really concerned with us.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Why do we have a  mind and where and how is it created in the brain? &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
That's another million dollars in my pocket.  Believe me, theists who pretend to know all the answers make a much better living than scientists doing the dirty work. &quot; Why do we have a mind?&quot;  What's a mind?  As for the rest I think you answered your own question.  Some scientists refer to &quot;emergent properties,&quot; a sort of &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot; theory of how conscious thought relates to physical brain matter.  Others, like Crick I think, believe that *everything* regarding cognition is hardwired somewhere in the brain.  Time and the scientific method are still at work.<br>
<br>
One way we learn so much is from those who've had brain injuries that affect cognition.  There's a woman out there who cannot perceive motion.  Unless she blinks rapidly her glass will overflow with the tea she is pouring.  She cannot cross streets without aid.  Can you *imagine* that?  A few unlucky folks with extreme epilepsy have their corpus calossum severed (that's the bit that ties the brain's two hemispheres together).  All sorts of perceptual oddities crop  up when one eye can't see what the other sees.  And then there is Phineas Gage and his lack of emotional control.  Lastly, when the brain stops working, you stop working.  I don't see much room in the above (and much more) for any kind of 'spirit.'  It's really tied to the brain.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Why , through design theory, have we evolved to have rationale and behaviors unatural to every other species?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Design theory?  Not sure what you mean by that.  Evolution is a result of natural selection and genetic drift and stuff.  And if you think about it, most of our behaviors are similar to those of other species.  I view it as something of an accident, a rather poor form of adaption that got lucky.  Yes, poor.  All that brain power takes up so much energy and results in such a long period where human infants are essentially helpless that it can't be considered a great adaption.  However, all that brain power gradually allowed proto-humanity to channel their instincts into behaviors we generally don't associate with other animals (like creation of art).  Check out <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">www.talkorigins.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for all sorts of other info.  They explain it better than I do, really.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I really want to  know your opinions about this, because you are very knowledgable, and I truely try to be a person with an open mind and learn from everyone even if and when i disagree.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well that's good.  It takes a lot of time, but I think knowledge is its own reward, whatever you end up believing.  I like knowing stuff and have spent quite a few years satisfying the addiction.  And while there are always questions left unanswered and still a great deal to discover, never have I found something that compels me to believe in gods, demons, angels, UFOs, ghosts, psychic power or respawns being prevented due to unlooted corpses.  And I've been looking.<br>

You fool people into trusting you then you betray them for your personal gain.  Friends, Loved ones, whoever.. whatever.<br>

I gonna tell you.. I didnt grow up with lots of money..  I was pretty damn blue collar.. grew up drinking, fighting, running wild a bit and doing some stupid shit.   But that was one thing you dont get away with on the streets you sheltered pampered and tucked away from the real world cock sucker.<br>
You dont betray your friends..  sometimes they are all you have in this world.. and you advocate fucking them for the advancement of your own pleasure.   Its a good goddamn thing you arent from America..   if you were on the streets that attitude would help you find your ass in a fucking ditch face down.  Is all of Europe this morally ambivilant?<br>

I dont think I have the capacity right now to explain the concepts of Egoism... and that is what we're talking about here, not Satanism.  Briefly, Egoism is a philosphy in which self-interest is its own morality.  <br>

Satanism or egoism aren't about betraying your friends, both are focused on yourself I agree to that, but that doesn't mean that you betray your friends in anyway. It means that you use people, people do not need to get hurt because of this - You use your guild don't you? Through your guild you become stronger, through your guilds efforts you become better. You are using them, they are using you - no one gets hurt.<br>

couples married or not manipulate eachother all the time.. and this isnt a bad thing.. since part 1 wants part 2 to enjoys what she/he enjoys and therefore he/she tend to manipulate the events to lead to this certain thing.<br>
<br>
stock market.. you know the american way you talk so much about is very much about manipulation.. you do this to get more of that for YOU.<br>
im pretty sure you manipulate people every day in your life but as i said you see manipulation as "gettin this 13yearold drunk to have sex with her" or helping mr oldguy with this and that just to be in his testament.(wiLL)<br>
<br>
science can not yet prove anything about how the world came to be but neither can religion.. the story about GOD is as vague as if you say the world came to be because of the negatron (which is more likely anyway)<br>

Used some prety big words. But I looked in the dictionary at some meanings, and I think I'm ready to reply.<br>
You, sir, do not know the meaning of wrong. We're all wrong, in one way or another. Sometimes we're right, sometimes we're wrong. You try, and try, and try as hard as you can to tell everyone, post after post, how right you are. <br>
You class our theories, put down our posts, insult our beliefs, and I'm sorry, how did you put it.. 'own' us.<br>
Quite frankly, I don't possess the time to argue with someone who says that they're going to 'shuve their keyboard up my ass'. Because - don't get me wrong - as much as I love a good keyboard shuved up my ass, I think you, sir, possess the mentality of the people who sit in EC, day after day, typing abreviated sentences until all that's left is 'r u nubi kkthx lfg orc2 wts or tf obo'.<br>
Fact is, I read these posts, and it just desperately seems to be everyone saying 'wait a second', and then your posts seem to say 'Yes, yes.. the universe evolves around my points of view.'<br>
Fact of the matter is, Satanists could contribute the most thoughtful theories since Marx, that explain the way of life to a tee. They could also.. not.<br>
But who are you to say either? Please, contribute your opinions, post your ideas, get along in the thread, residing and agreeing with points.<br>
Don't come here and trash us. We're not here to be taught, we're here to be us. You aren't better than me, than Stymp, than Treistaania, your views of life aren't anymore true, anymore correct.<br>

your post was very good and they explained the main reason why i started this post.. <br>
i started it to show why christians and other religions based on the bible constantly think that everything is about the bible and that its the supreme truth and that satanism is the biblical devil worshipping.. when in reality satanism has little to no connection to the bible whatsoever..<br>
<br>
the idea was and still is to enlighten people about how we see things with diffrent eyes depending on our background and how we interpret some things.. meaning for LL satanism is about sacrifice of children and horned demons and for me its a belief not based on the bible at all.<br>

<br>
I dont believe in Hell or Satan...  I dont believe in demons..  so thats a moot point.   <br>
<br>
There is a huge difference between religion and Moral Imperatives.   The two are not related.  Its a shame that you use religion to justify a immoral behavior.  Im not speaking to a faith based morality either..    <br>
<br>
Main Entry: ego·ism <br>
Pronunciation: 'E-g&amp;-&quot;wi-z&amp;m also 'e-<br>
Function: noun<br>
Date: 1785<br>
1 a : a doctrine that individual self-interest is the actual motive of all conscious action b : a doctrine that individual self-interest is the valid end of all actions<br>
2 : excessive concern for oneself with or without exaggerated feelings of self-importance -- compare EGOTISM 2 <br>
<br>
Arent you able to follow the ends of that pattern of thought?  Its not about god or the devil or hell or heaven.  Its about the basic structure of society.   The belief that any action you take is ok is fine in the name of Self interest.  Its a lack of morality.<br>
<br>
If you DONT reject Egoism out of hand, for what it basically is, a mental disorder. (consult your psych books).  Then your a moron.  To call Satanism a religion is a ridiclous as calling Schitzophenia a religion.  <br>
<br>
There is no positive spin to put on manipulation of another human being.  It is a act of betrayal.. pure and simple, there is no way around that.  To manipulate the stock market as you used as a example is illegal.  To put your best face foward in a job interview isnt manipulation.  To produce fake credentials or somehow trick someone into hiring you for a job your not qualified for is.<br>
<br>
But degrees dont matter..  your philosophy as stated has no boundries.  You set your own morality as it suits you.  move your lines, whatever works for the moment.<br>
<br>
Honor, Loyalty, integrity...   these things have no place in there..  they are have no meaning and cannot exist.<br>
<br>
Joe Stalin was a Satanist too I think..  he is famous for the quote &quot;loyalty is a disease of the Dogs&quot;<br>
That seems like something you people must agree with.  Hell.. maybe your Stalinists instead of Satanists<br>
