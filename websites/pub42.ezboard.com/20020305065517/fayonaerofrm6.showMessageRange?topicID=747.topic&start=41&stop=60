I could just imagine how you would be in real life trying to buy a car.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It's the newest model we have, we are offering $20,000.00 more over the MSRP and 25% APR.  If you don't get this car now you will never get another chance at it, and we will tell everyone that you backed out of a good deal so no one will sell a car to you ever again.&quot;<br>
<br>
No one pointed a gun at you!<br>
No one is gonna come out of that little monitor to beat you up!<br>

You won it FAIR AND SQUARE and that should've been the end of it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uballinnferrick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ballinnferrick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/26/01 7:29:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Uber guild Bullies</span><hr size=1> i spell fine btw..... theres only a couple words messed up and plus i failed english so do expect me to be a good typer =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=relkienn>RelkienN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/27/01 4:49:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber guild Bullies</span><hr size=1> I am disgusted. I cant put it any other way than that. I am sick in my stomache that people would make such lies about me and ruin my name, and on top of that, you people believe them with no other proof than words. How about I tell you what really happened? I had been grouped with Heart of the Immortal Soul in Karnors for about 4 or 5 hours, we had a good group, but our enchanter left, and a bard named Tristel joined. Things were going well, and after a few minutes we killed a skeleton and a Tranquil staff dropped, someone in the group grabbed it and said lets roll. A few people in the group said to wait for the monk, and I simply said that since he had already won a noctivigant blade earlier, maybe it was a bit more fair that he was out on the roll to give others a chance to win. I wasnt exactly sure what a tranquil staff was at the time I said this. We did wait for the monk in the end and rolled, and Tristel won the staff. The monk asked what the stats were And he told the group what they were. I was shocked at how good the staff was, I thought it was just another ok loot, but it really was nice. Then I noticed that Tristel did have really nice stuff, he has awesome weapons armour, and he had a singing steel breastplate! From what I heard, thats worth like 50k +. I sent him a tell saying exactly this &quot;Hey bud, I know you did win the staff fair and square, but you know, it would really be a nice gesture to give the staff to the monk, his stuff really isnt too good after all, and from the looks of it it doesnt look like you need the staff all too much.&quot; Thats all I had sent him. 1 tell. I didnt harrass him for hours like whoever made this post said I did. After that we hunted a bit longer, and the group fell apart. I guess before everyone left the bard found it in his heart to give the staff to our monk. I sent him another tell saying &quot;You did the right thing bro. I am really proud of you.&quot; he told me &quot;Shut the fuc* up and get your people from CB to stop harrassing me&quot; I told him I didnt know anyone from CB and that I had no idea what he was talking about, but I guess he didnt believe me. Oh well, it was late, so I camped. The next day when I was in karnors, I sent someone a tell asking to join their group and they replied &quot;No thanks, we dont want scum like you, Tristel told us all about you.&quot; I honestly didnt know what to think, but I was hurt. I went to Tristels guild leader and talked to him about it telling him the whole story,and how I have worked hard for my good name and that I didnt want it to be ruined now. He told me that Tristel was harrassed about the staff for a few hours, so I went to Heart of the Immortal soul and I found the monk who got the staff. I told him that Tristel was harrassed about the staff by someone from CB, and he told me that he had a friend over his house when he got the staff and that it must have been that friend, since his friend is in CB. I told the guild leader this and he said he would work it out and promised me that Tristel would stop making lies about me and stop ruining my name. Its been a few days since this happened, and my friend told me about all you people wanting to kill me over something like this. He knows I am not like this and he doesnt believe any of it. I am hoping none of you believe this Shi* about me either, because its just stupid. I could go to any website and make lies about any of you, and I bet theres not much you could do to make the lies seem false. Whoever started this post is either a fu**ing as*hole or just gets his info from the wrong people. Either way, its not true, and I am nothing of what you people say I am. If you actually did take all the time to read this, thanks, because now you know the truth.<br>

Bully is a harsh term here.<br>
<br>
It's pretty simple really, decide the loot, do the roll if there is one.<br>
<br>
Loot is one of those taboo topics. It's usually best not to send people direct tells that you aren't very familiar with regarding loot.<br>
<br>
Personally, If i were the group leader, i would suggest that IF the monk wanted the staff, he give up the noc blade for random and he can have the staff if he intended on using it.<br>
<br>
That is fair to the group. He gets something he can use, where the group gets a cash item to sell if nobody can use it.<br>
<br>
Personally, If we are randoming items in a group that I'm in, and i see someone is in the group that can use it, friend or not, If *I* win the lotto, i typically just give it to the person that can actually use it.<br>
<br>
This is why i wish that VI put more nodrop items in the game. So the people that can use it get it and the farmers are detered.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, if nobody can use it, i'm all for keeping it for an alt or selling it (usually goes to my alts tho). But if I see someone in group that actually will use an item, i see no reason not to give it to them.<br>
<br>
I say ok staff dropped, monk only, does monk need? yes/no<br>
<br>
if yes, does anyone object to giving to monk? yes/no<br>
<br>
if yes, then we all roll and if i win i typically give to monk.<br>
<br>
if i lose i appologize to monk and say , well i tried :(<br>
<br>
now i realize not everyone plays this way, and i'm not condemning those that don't. <br>
<br>
But i also don't consider it harassment if someone was urging a player that can't use an item to give it to someone in the group that could use it, reguardless of if they were wearing a SS BP or plate.<br>
<br>
All he has to say is, no, i want to keep it thanks.<br>
<br>
I've met serveral people from CB and found them to be quite pleasant. Of course, that doesn't account for everyone in the guild.<br>
<br>
But frankly, nobody was a bully here. This is not grade school and nobody forced you to give up anything. <br>
<br>
bully  n : a cruel and brutal fellow.<br>
 v : discourage or frighten with threats or a domineering manner; intimidate.<br>
<br>
Now are you saying that he threatened you? Because i fail to see a threat. Did he say give the monk the staff or I'll (insert threat here)?<br>
<br>
Or are you calling him cruel and brutal because he asked you to be generous and donate an item to someone that needed it?<br>
<br>
I fail to see the application of the term.<br>
<br>

The fact is, Deevault did &quot;threaten&quot; me or whatever you'd like to call it, and the fact is the ranger seemed to be pretty dang pissed at me for winning the roll (yes it was decided everyone would roll) especially knowing i had a SS bp (which is not paid for btw).  Now the details of how Deevault got involved are a bit muddled, and i cant find the truth. But it's somewhere between the monk and ranger.  If it would be possible i'd like to see this thread drop to the bottom of the message board, and be forgotten, people will judge the people involved at their own will, I don't want be known as the sucker who gave up soemthing he should have, or whatever i'm being considered right now, and the others involved...will develop their reps upon how they act.

Sorry, your equipment has NOTHING to do with rolls in pick up groups.  If the rules before hand was everyone rolls on everything and no NBG, that's how it is.  If you guys think people with crappy equipment should be defaulted items, then I'm going to strip a char and go join your groups in Karnor's and get pity loot.<br>

Nothing like changing the loot rule for a group AFTER the fact.<br>
<br>
Just the simple fact that ANY tells were sent to the winner of the roll by Relkien and the CB member is enough.  They don't even deny that tells were sent. Just what was the content of the tells is the only thing in question.  But NO tells of ANY nature should have been sent!  Once the roll is over it is OVER!<br>
<br>
The bard wasn't even there when the kill was made? And still got to roll on it? And the babies STILL cried. <br>
Amazing what children will do when they don't get their way.<br>
<br>
I have next to nothing on any of my chars but I still don't like the loot rule where in a pick-up group you give an item to someone based on what they have already.  But if that is the groups looting rule going in, I live with it.  And  I  DON'T send whining or threatening tells after it doesn't turn out the way I like it.<br>
<br>
GeeZZ!  Let it go now and don't be surprised if you don't get into a couple of groups. You will find another somewhere.  I would not group with you just based on what you have ADMITTED to!<br>

Tristel appologized that he automatically assumed it was me that got CB to threaten him, and that his sister said things about me that were not true. I am not the type of person who threatens people, especially about stupid things like this. He won the roll fair and square, we congrat'd him, and I just told him it would be a generous thing to do to give the staff to the monk, since he is much more needy than you.

By the way, Xeck, thats not how things happened, you werent there, and you have no right to make comments about things you dont even know are true or not. that goes for whoever called me a liar.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ubiggins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biggins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/27/01 8:02:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=55>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber guild Bullies</span><hr size=1> So, did anyone actually get tells from Deevault?

<br>
In all honesty, threatening someone in tells isn't something I can imagine Deevault doing. However, I can see some gimpy pickup group loot whore trying to throw Deevault's name around to get his/her way. Someone tried to use my name to get a free resurrection once, and I gave them an earful for pulling that shit. <p><FONT SIZE=+1><a href=http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=13102><B>Biggins Black: Assassin</B></a></FONT><BR>

<br>
Am I missing something here?<br>
<br>
You tell me that that's not what happened but yet ALL of what I said were from your OWN posts!<br>
<br>
1. The monk wasn't there when the kill was made.<br>
2. The group decided to roll on the item.<br>
3. You sent him a tell saying he should give up the stick based on what items he had.<br>
<br>
What did I get wrong because I wasn't there?<br>

It will be brought up in guild and we'll get the full story of how Dee got involved.....it is still a mystery to me how he got into the picture.<br>

On a side note, don't mind our Wizards, sometimes they get their muzzles off and get loose.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><BR>
