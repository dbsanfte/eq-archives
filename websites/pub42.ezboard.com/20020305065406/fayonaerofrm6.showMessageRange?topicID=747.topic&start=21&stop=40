and for the record, my bard friend was in Karnors again yesterday and Relkien tried to join the group he was in.. my friend told the group that if the Ranger joined, he would leave. The group asked why, he told the story, they agreed to not allow him intot he group, they relayed this to the Ranger, who then started sending tells to my friend's guild to try to get him in trouble, which isn't going to happen since my Bard friend did nothing wrong other than refuse to group with an idiot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/24/01 10:18:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber guild Bullies</span><hr size=1> Oh right, when I ask people to post names, I get flamed. <br>

However, I think perhaps CB is being portrayed poorly here, when the guild has done nothing wrong.  Of course they will defend their members unless proof is given. It's a sign of a cohesive guild, not uber bullies.  Just my two cents. Give them the proof and they will take care of their own. <br>

It was a situation definately worth some bitching.  the thing is, how can you expect them to not get a little frustrated when someone is flaming their members and not saying who.  It also doesnt accomplish anything for the person nagging because nothnig is gonig to be done to the people if you dont say who it is.  I just dont see the point of warning people or telling people what happened when they remain invisable.  CB handled what was be accused of them fine, and we'll see how they handle it now that they know who it is.  I don't think its anything to get excited about as I don't think it warrents getting a full member booted from the guild.  People, please though, if you want anyone here to believe what you say and have your back you need to give us the whole truth, and that includes names.  You can't go to court and only mention the bad things someone else did and not mention what you did or their names and expect any retribution. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Board Mistress</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(12/25/01 12:44:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=28>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.one.se/users/chribesk/edeina.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber guild Bullies</span><hr size=1> Aye.<br>
And I would guess that some people make up their minds and decide that this thread is guildbashing before they even open the thread, just because of teh title. And some people can be very thinkheaded once they made up their minds.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would suspect that the guy from CB didn't do anything wrong at all, beyond trusting his ranger friend a bit too much. The ranger had probably told him a very tilted version of the events, so the CB guy believed the bard to be a real asshole. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Deevault has always been a very awesome person and I don't see him doing something stupid.  Chances are, the ranger told Deevault that your friend had ninja looted, or the rules were NBG and your friend looted anyway or some crap like that.  I know a lot of guilds encourage their members not to respond to bashing threads, but I sincerely hope that they tell us whether or not the ranger guy is a recruit or member or whatever.  Thank you for naming names and not turning this into a guild bashing thread.

However, CB does not condone harrassment of other players by one of our members. I don't believe that was the case in this incident based on the lack of factual information. It sounds like a simple misunderstanding with Deevault or whichever CB member backing up a friends position. Unfortunately, it sounds like the friend in question should have kept his/her big mouth shut and minded their own business.<br>

Also, I was told that Deevault was standing right behind the Ranger (this was from the ranger's mouth) so he too saw what happened. As far as Deevault &quot;not doing it cuz you don't think he would&quot;.. that's really just a crack up. He did, what would I have to gain by making up a story about someone? LOL. And my Bard friend is highly respected and doesn't wanna risk tarnishing his rep over some loot item.. and he is in no way in any kind of uber guild (even though he's good enough to be). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=747.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=747.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=747.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=747.topic&start=81&stop=81>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=747.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=747.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=747.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=747.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=747.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=747.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=747.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
