It's only gonna get better.<br><br>Unless Opteron is more than they've let out to the public so far, AMD is going to miss the boat on speed for this next gen of chips. I don't really care about the brands, would rather the AMD's be faster because they're less expensive and I don't care that they run hot. Just isn't that way atm.<br><br>Take a look at Alienware right now. Their hotrod is based off a 533mhz FSB P4 machine. That should tell you which is faster in a very simple way.<br><br>If you have the cash to go all out on a top end P4, that's the faster &quot;better&quot; bet atm. If you can't go hog wild with money, build an AMD. A &quot;middle of the road&quot; P4 is not going to be any faster than a comparable AMD. Intel has leap-frogged AMD atm in technology, it's that simple.

Since AMD seems to be getting to a head with their current manufacturing processes, their high end clock speeds have fallen compared to Intel's, hence the gay marketing names they have now.<br><br>I could be wrong here since it's been a while since I've looked at AMD systems (using Intel myself), but the disparity in clock speed between the top end AMD and Intel CPUs is in the neighbourhood of 600 MHz. That's probably why your P4 performs better than an Athlon right now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udalteneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaltenEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/12/02 5:27:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2765.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intel or AMD buying a new comp  &lt;&gt; want to hear mo</span><hr size=1> Intel worked with Sony/Verant to optimize EQ for the Pentium 4, SSE and shit...   <br><br>That said, if your looking for the best computer to play EQ on, high end P4 System is what you want.  <br><br>Overall, P4's currently are worth buying over an AMD IMO, if you can afford it.  <br><br>AMD's are a great value and not much slower in most things, although video editing, Intel finishes job's by the time an athlon know's the race as even begun..  I'm sort of biased towards intel for some reason, but 6 months ago when I needed an upgrade, it was sheer stupidity to buy an Intel anything over an AMD, so i built me an athlon 1.4ghz and love it, no problems other than its slow compared to my new rig.  <br><br>My new rig I put together a P4 1.6a Ghz and overclocked it to 2.4Ghz.  It does 2.4Ghz with just the standard intel heatsink and fan, but I slapped on a better one just to lower the temp so its "in spec".  <br><br>All in all, Right now I think Intel is the way to go, but a year ago, they were garbage and are slowly rebuilding their reputation.    <p><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000"><pre><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">                                                               </font><font color="#993300" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5273">Sensei Sinshiu</a></font> 				   -Ayonae Ro-</pre></body></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udalteneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaltenEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/12/02 5:34:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2765.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intel or AMD buying a new comp  &lt;&gt; want to hear mo</span><hr size=1> Btw if you do get a P4, make sure the description of the CPU says it has 512kb of Cache, Northwood, or the speed of the chip says X.XA or B.
