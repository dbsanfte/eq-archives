We are told not too as it generally serve no purpose. Only gets worse.<br>2. Those who are intrested in both sides of the story could talk to our GL and thus end the rumors and lies.<br><br>I heard from several members in Landslide now that people havent been intrested enough to do that and have been told by thier leaders not to group with us and so on. <br><br>Some of those flames are direct lies and that is why I feel I need to post this.<br><br>So, now I will give my side of the story on what happend.<br>believe me or not but atleast give me a chance.<br>I will try to make you see we are no monsters, and no KS'ers either.<br><br>1. I will start with Lodizal<br>Most about this kill has already been said in an earlier post, but still what happened was.<br>We had a tracker there, when lodi spawned guild moved and hurried over there.<br>When we had enough people to kill him in Iceclad a ranger with tracking set after him. When he saw Lodizal lodi aggroed on him and he pulled it to Landslide and we killed him.<br>Another guild claimed they were kiting him with a bard until more people showed up.<br>We sure as hell didnt train anyone in Iceclad.<br><br>I consider this a Race since both guilds noticed him and both wanted him, we were faster though. Maybe I am wrong about this, but this is how I see it.<br><br>2. Venril Sathir<br>The claim that we ks'd and TRAINED people on VS is preposterous.<br>I was in preproom all alone, waiting for my fellow guildies when I heard a shout saying VS camped. Landslide at that point had 28 people in zone and competetive guild had 6ppl and a total of 11 online.<br>Because of the quarrel over Lodizal (the same guild) we decided to give the other guild a chance at killing him before we did. We gave them 15 minutes to find enough people to kill him. The other guild then declined, this is truth of this, I swear to god and all I believe in.<br>I was actually frustrated at this because I had been there first long before the person shouted he was camped. I dont consider myself to have camped him, I couldnt kill him alone (although /con seem to think that).<br><br>3. Ragefire<br>This is the most serious one, and this is actually the only one that we feel sorry for in some ways.<br>I really feel with Fionna who had to sit there for so long, to get booted out.<br>But it could have gone TOTALLY diffrent.<br>The same thing happened with another guild (SoT) we got angry at each other for both wanting to have that epic and they had been promised by some Guide that next RF was theirs.<br>Uini the Azure came after a while and said then loud and clear that no GM could do this. The first one to hand in pearl gets the mob this is a fact. No one can make you leave the lair, not even a GM but ruining for another guild by Ksing and so on will be severly punished.<br>So what happened is that SoT and Landslide both camped, SoT is Canadian based and we are EU.<br>Zordak spawned at a better time for them then us, they got him.<br><br>I dont think it is right that because you cant kill Naggy you shouldnt be able to get a Cleric Epic.<br>Someone even said something like...<br>-Landslide all went to sleep even.<br><br>Is there something wrong with not being able to camp a mob 24/7?<br>Do you really have to say no to working, skip school, dont be with your loved ones and so on to get a cleric epic?<br><br>Cant people do like with SoT just sit there, sleep when we need and jump in and hope that he will spawn during your raid hours, when people has set aside time for EQ.<br><br>Yes this leaves more to chance, I mean another guild COULD get the epic before you. But on the other hand the camping wouldnt be even close to as boring as before.<br><br>What happend here was that the GM got really pushy and wanted a quick solution to the problem. He asked both our guild leader and Fionna how they wanted to do this. We agreed to any proposal the GM gave, one where he said we camp it 12h and and IM camp 12h.<br>Roll was chosen and it was, who came closest to the GMs roll won.<br><br>The rest of the story you have heard.<br><br>And about us putting pets and so on at spawnpoint of Zordak I have a really hard time believing, I wasent there at that time, but considering that SoT did that too us and we asked GM then if it would make any diffrence she plainly laughed at us and said that mobs spawn even if you stand exactly where they pop.<br><br>So I am not sure, but I cant see why we would do that, since we know it dont make any diffrence.<br>I will not however swear to that it didnt happen.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So for the honor and respect so much talked about by a certain person who has now flamed us twice. I would want to ask if lying isnt disrespectful and dishonorable.<br><br>We didnt train anybody in Iceclad or KS Lodizal, we were just faster with enough people to take him on.<br>We didnt train you in Venril Sathir either, we gave you the opportunity to gather for him although it wasent needed.<br>Ragefire, well you have my story of what happend, think of us as you wish. That is atleast what happend from my point of view.<br><br>For Fionna's sake, I am truly sorry that things went the way it did. But I dont regret us coming to camp him.<br><br>A piece of advice for future RF campers, if problems arise, dont call for GMs, but try to work it out yourselves, that way no one has to leave the lair and then the guild who is fastest/awake gets the spawn.<br><br>Thank you those who take your time to read this.<br><br>I hope that atleast some doubts have been made into whether we are fully fledged monsters/ksers and whatever else we have been flamed for before. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=varulvthewarrior>Varulv the Warrior</A> at: 11/4/01 12:25:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uhalochanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HaloChanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 4:37:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> I know both sides of the people involved very well.

As for &quot;Honor and Respect&quot; many of your members have none.  What I witnesed at the RF camp was a prime example of your guilds lack there of.  Your Sugar Coated post above left out a tiny  however very important fact.  The visit from the first GM.  Your guild was told to hit the road but instead you whinned moaned and cried like a bunch of toddlers until you got a decision that was in your favor.  Landslide needs to stop hiding behind the so called rules and play with honor and respect towards the Ayonae Ro community.  When your guild  shows some sort of class maybe then Honor and Respect will show itself within your guild.  You stole The Rf camp!! Now take your lumps like a man and learn form them.  The Landslide guild has much to thnk about because they pretty much are  the worst guild when it comes to charcater on this server.   <br><br>EQ is a fun game, unfortunatly most of the servers are well populated as a result.  This means many needed mobs will be camped.  RF was camped and you just wouldnt accept it.  Now you have to take  the results of your thnkless, and heartless  action as a guild.  I sure hope you guys will one day come to your sinces and start to play with Honor and Respect!!! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uwirestrom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wirestrom</A> at: 11/4/01 2:02:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=varulvthewarrior>Varulv the Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 2:10:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hm</span><hr size=1> First guy was not a GM, but a Guide.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uspitzohr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spitzohr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New to the block</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 2:17:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> Ok mister &quot;I am Honor and Respect&quot; Wirestrom.<br><br>You call it honor and respect to have your guildmates visist many zones in norrath and have them spam the people there with landslide sucks, they stole the RF camp and stuff like that ?

Tired and sleepy.  She would heal us when we pulled FG's, King Tormax and hell even the occasional Sonic Bat.  At all other times she would be facing that little wall where her epic mob pops, all in hopes of seeing him appear and getting her epic peice.  When landslide came in, and actually had more then a FD monk stay in the lair, they piled in front of where she was sitting and blocked her view of the spawn.  They also spawned pets and parked them in front of her as yet another tactic to keep her blocked.  You say your guild knew that this would not keep the mob from spawning.  That is correct. We all know that this is not an anti-camp spawn.  However, the actions mentioned above were to IMPEDE Fionna from actually being able to *turn in the pearl first*.  That was the sole reason for those actions.  I was there, I saw it with my own eyes.  Believe me, it happened.  <br><br>I do also understand that tempers run high in a competion for a spawn.  Especially when one goes over 24 hours.  I also understand that *there is no camping a mob* is the official stance with Verant.  But what I find sad is the fact that Landslide came in and claimed a spot when there was already a force sitting there.  When we had a force there more then 2 days prior to your enterance to the Lair.  And when asked to leave you refused and became rude and abusive.  Those in the lair tried to be civil at first.  Yet when faced with rudeness...and after 48 hours of sitting in a spot with nothing more then GEMS as a diversion, tempers started to flair.<br> <br>Desilous was the first to answer the petition.  Whether he is a guide or a gm is beside the fact that he made a decision and told *all those that are not in the Lair to help Fionna* to leave. That request should have been followed.  It is a sad state of affairs when another gm comes in and makes a bad situation worse. And who actually agrees he made it worse.  Only Fenrik,  Fionna and the gm will know what was actually said in the &quot;conference&quot;.  However, Fionna states it was Fenrik that said they should roll for the mob.  Not the gm.  And given the fact that he could win a desired camp with 50/50 odds and not have to put work into it nor lose sleep over it...I'd say thats probably a fair take on it.<br><br>Fionna is a very sweet, non-confrontational person.  She would rather take problems onto herself and just suck it up and be on the losing end then create problems for others.  Whether they are in the wrong or not.  She had been at that camp for 4 days, with little to no sleep and wasn't in the best place to make a decision.  I will again say that had I known that *rolling* was even presented I would have advised her not to do it.  <br><br>As for Fionna not posting about this fiasco.  She has had problems creating an account and up until 2 days ago had never even been to our guild forums.  Im sure in time she will make it to this board.  <br><br>I understand your wanting to clear the air about accusations made about your guild.  Unfortunatly, Fionna's Rage Fire situation can not be cleared.  I feel you wrongly took over a camp that was not yours, tried to impede Fionna from doing the very thing that allows her the chance to *claim* the spawn and therefore, can not claim you did anything regarding this situation with honor or respect.  As for the other situations, I was not there and therefore can not and will not comment. <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~<BR>60 WarGoddess<BR>Immortal Mercy<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR>~*~*~*<BR> "Lean back, relax and get ready for the RIDE of a LIFETIME ~ The Lap Dancing Warrior Goddess!!!"<BR><BR><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/01/09/21/flamingtext_com.141516343.jpg" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a><br>Image by <a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb2.html">FlamingText.com</a></BODY></HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/utremainbladesinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TremainBladesinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 7:39:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theunholytrinity.org/cracks_smileys/cwm/big/firemad.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> Your guild has no honor and has lost any respect it might have had. <p>Tremain Bladesinger 52 Champion                                                                       </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usiaamsupafreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siaam Supafreak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 8:05:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> Man im glad i quit playing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvibesjoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ViBeSJoKeR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Matahari GM</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/4/01 9:34:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.eqmatahari.com/images/vibes1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> I am done with the LS issue ..<br><br>Just one little rhyme...<br><br>When hurt get's touched it turns around, to maybe once be found, in the company of a friend ....<br>Devious Poet 1996.<br><br>Greets hope ur guild does well.<br><br><br> <p><center><EMBED src="http://www.eqmatahari.com/sigs/sig2.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000 WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=100 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulivtinth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livtinth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bored at work?
