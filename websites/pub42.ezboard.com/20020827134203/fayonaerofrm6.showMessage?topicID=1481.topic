Being the nice person that I am, I gave them to the officer/60 monk/puller of our guild, Sejah.<br><br>2 weeks later, I come back from my trip from Wildwood, New Jersey, and see this post made by Sejah.<br><br>Best wishes friends<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> After quite a bit of deliberation and wavering, I've decided to leave IM, if not for good then at least for the time being. Over the last several weeks(months) I've been enjoying myself less and less and getting upset and discouraged more and more often. I dont need to remind any of you that we play this game as a release, and that if you start carrying game stress over into real life then its time to step back and re-assess the situation.<br><br>I havent made any decisions as to where I'm going from here, and I'll probably still be playing at times, so if you are ever in need of a guildless monk dont hesitate to look me up online. I'd like to thank Sorcha and Kayler and so many others for giving me a wealth of wonderful memories to take away from the game with me. <br><br>Take care and I'll miss seeing you all in the green text.<br><br>Sejah<br><br><br>Now, I understand what he has said, and decided not to say anything or reply to anything. I thought he was a great monk and a fair player, until tonight.<br><br>I was curious and did a /who all sejah..and saw him in SoT. I say to myself..&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;<br><br>Then I think..&quot;He has all these problems in real life, and I felt for him, but..I can't believe he did this!&quot;<br><br>So, I ask you Sejah, are you experiencing real life problems, or the only problem your experiencing is not getting enough loot to please you. Was your plan to get full ToV armor, and then leave the guild with a peice of shit reason like you posted on the boards? Well if so, it worked, and I hope you feel like the peice of shit that you are.<br><br>Thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>(Btw- this is not to flame anyone IN SoT.

Sometimes smaller guilds do not progress at the rate they would like to be at.  When that happens, what do you suggest they do?  They have a few options.  (1) Motivate the other players to &quot;pick up the pace&quot; and help move the guild up to the level they are playing at.  (2) Stay in the guild and either cut back their playing time (yeah right) or end up quitting the game over frustration.  (3) Move on to another guild.  <br><br>I don't know what the facts are and I don't know what the situation with IM is.  I do know that 99% of the time when I see a smaller guild get upset when they lose their main players, it's because those players were frustrated with the guild's pace.  That does not directly mean they want more loot.  <br><br>Running a non top tier guild is hard.  On one end of the spectrum you have incredible players pushing you to the limits.  On the other end you have casual players who aren't interested in becoming much more than what they are.

With that in mind, I'm not sure how he could have been more honest about his reason for leaving the guild.  He said it might be for a short period or it might be for good.  He never said that RL problems were the reason he was leaving the game, or that he was leaving the game at all, only that he was leaving the guild because the fun was waning and he needed to find a way to enjoy the game again.<br><br>Again, for all I know, he might have ninja looted some great item and detagged immediately afterward, but I DOUBT it.  Trying to keep someone who doesn't want to stay is not fair.  Maybe you are angry that he left and that you gave up loot to him a few months back, but that's the way things go sometimes.

You know why I say this.  ;)<br><br>Well, all guilds have had the experience of having someone join, seem enthusiastic, get themselves geared up, and then quit.  I know I've seen two egregious examples of that in Rest In Peace -- and I mean *absolutely* outrageous examples.<br><br>RiP doesn't allow posts on such examples, nor on examples of the times we've been on the bad end of certain *seemingly* poor behavior by other guilds competing for the same spawn.  So as a result of not communicating these sorts of things, people can just find out for themselves how others are.  <br><br>Plus, no situation is ever that simple.  There are a billion extenuating factors and you can't capture them all in, what is it, 255 characters of /tell?  Written in some bulletin board?  Better just not to mention such things and move on.  You could spend all your time fretting about when so-and-so trained your guild when you had Uber_mob_01 down to 5% or thus-and-so quitting your guild the second they were awarded a Trak Tooth to complete their VP key -- but might as well stick to playing the game and just let it be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrystanarose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CrystanaRose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/14/02 2:46:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1481.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All about Sejah</span><hr size=1> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Your skill in muffins has increased!(233)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>your  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uillusior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Illusior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(6/14/02 7:39:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1481.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lobo.net/~randy/ill.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All about Sejah</span><hr size=1> Death to all STAMP LICKERS !!!!!<br><br>Anyway Sejah, Rock on bro and have fun.
