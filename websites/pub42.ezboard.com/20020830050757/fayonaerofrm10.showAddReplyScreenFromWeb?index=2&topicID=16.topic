He was in a thickly wooded area. Occasionally, a long thorn would manage to pierce his cloak and stick him in the arm. He wouldn't nervously jump, but rather, in an incredibly quick fluid motion swivel away and break the branch off, like an assailant's arm. <br>
<br>
He walked very silently through the woods. Mindful of even small twigs. He was not akin to the woods, but he had been on the run before, and knew how to survive. He crept quietly onward through the timber. The pine shrubs, and willow trees made eerie haunting figures in the little moonlight that managed to creep through the dense leaves. Occasionally, a small figure would rustle around in the distance, and disappear into the trees.<br>
<br>
He crept on and on, all the while contemplating his next move. <br>
<br>
He glanced around and muttered to himself, &quot;This must be, hmm, Jaggedpine forest, yes. That means probably headed north? Yes nor-&quot;, a twig snapped subtly behind him. He froze. He could not move, perhaps whoever or whatever was behind him had not spotted him. All of his will was put into his listening. The forest was silent. There was no dull sound of animals scurrying, or an occasional owl hooting. Dead silence.<br>
<br>
He jumped to hide behind a nearby tree, but as he jumped an arrow caught him dead center in the calf. It drove through his leather leggings and momentarily crippled his right leg.<br>
<br>
He did not yelp, he did not scream. He merely grit his teeth, and tumbled behind the tree. He leaned against the tree and grabbed the arrow shaft. He prodded with his thumb into the wound, feeling the back edge of the arrowhead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not barbed.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grasped the arrow shaft as close to his leg as he could. Blood ran onto his hand and trickled down his arm. He quickly yanked it out of his leg. <br>
<br>
He glanced around the tree to see if he could see his assailant. No trace. He turned back and there in front of him was a wiry rugged man holding a bow. Arrow fitted, drawn back ready to fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you, what do you disturb the wood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a traveler, and that's what I do, I travel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not tolerate insolence, tell me who you are and why you have disgraced the wood with your presence.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Zan, I was once an adventurer of sorts, but have since retired. I know spend my time traveling Norrath, taking in the sights that I so thoughtlessly passed over. Who, may I ask, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Fenn Greenwind, I am ranger and guardian of the wood. I am sorry I shot you so hastily Zan, I have seen a good lot of dishonorable people try to seek refuge in Jaggedpine. I feel it is my duty to keep such evil out of the wood. Come with me, we can heal that leg of yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek tried to stand. He pushed himself up with his left leg bracing himself against the tree, but when he set his right leg down he toppled. He knew that he could walk if he must, but he did not want to be taken to Surefall, almost for sure where the ranger intended to go.<br>
<br>
Fenn looked down at him. &quot;Well perhaps I can do something for you.&quot; <br>
<br>
An aura of blue light began to envelop him. He turned his gaze to the stars, and his hands pulsed with soft blue light. The light then began to envelop Seetek. It made him uncomfortable at first, but his wound began to heal, the bleeding stopped, and it partially closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazing friend, thank you.&quot; Seetek reached into a belt pouch and pulled out a strip of cloth. He wound it tightly around the wound.<br>
<br>
Fenn looked at him wearily, &quot;Come with me, we can seek shelter here tonight, then tomorrow we can go on to Surefall Glade, my beautiful home.&quot;<br>
<br>
They walked miles through the wood. Seetek noted how Fenn seemed to feel so at home in the forest. He was not anxious, he was confident. <br>
<br>
They came to a patch of dense underbrush. Fenn looked back at Seetek; &quot;This is it.&quot; Fenn crouched and climbed through the underbrush. Seetek followed. <br>
<br>
A few logs were stacked for a fire and some whittling tools and bow cams were strewn about. A small leaf bed lay a few feet from the fire.<br>
<br>
Fenn walked over to a rack, holding a few skinned rodents. He took one down and put it into a nearby pot. He prodded the fire a bit, and threw on some kindling. &quot;Could you tend to the fire for a minute?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek nodded.<br>
<br>
Fenn disappeared out of the underbrush. Minutes later he returned with a shotty wooden bucket full of water. He poured some into the pot, then set the pot over the fire. <br>
<br>
Both sat in deep thought staring at the fire. Seetek never took his eyes off the fire, but he was taking very careful notice of his surroundings. Time crept by slowly. The sound of the boiling water consumed the night, and the heat from the fire made his skin feel as if it were shrinking.<br>
<br>
Finally Fenn stood, &quot;Yes, it should be done now.&quot; He turned to Seetek, &quot;Care for any?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek nodded.<br>
<br>
Fenn dipped a bowl in and handed it to Seetek. &quot;No elegant silverware here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek and Fenn sat sipping the broth.<br>
<br>
Fenn turned to Seetek, &quot;Well, I believe I need rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I haven't slept in a while either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seetek lay down on his bed of leaves, &quot;At least they’re softer than dirt,&quot; he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
He rolled onto his back and closed his eyes. A few minutes later he sat up. He glanced over at Fenn, who was lying on his back, eyes closed. Seetek rose slowly and quietly.<br>
<br>
He glanced back, and was startled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Fenn's eyes were now open looking at Seetek inquiringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nature's business.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fenn nodded and closed his eyes, drawing his cap down over his eyes. Seetek crept out of the underbrush.<br>
<br>
Fenn lay quietly next to the fire. He was drifting in and out of consciousness. Suddenly a sharp pain pierced his throat. His eyes opened wide, and he was face to face with Seetek, his hand on a dagger hilt, which lead straight into Fenn's throat. He tried to shout for a split second, but the dagger prevented air from escaping his lungs.<br>
<br>
Seetek hovered over him for a second, and when Fenn tried to struggle, he ran his dagger thoroughly through Fenn's neck, and into his spine. Fenn's eye's bulged, and body tensed, then went limp. Seetek withdrew his knife, and wiped it clean on Fenn's sleeve.<br>
<br>
He picked up Fenn's corpse and carried it out of the camp and down a small path to a stream and dumped it in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think I want to go to Surefall friend, but thanks for the camp.&quot;<br>
