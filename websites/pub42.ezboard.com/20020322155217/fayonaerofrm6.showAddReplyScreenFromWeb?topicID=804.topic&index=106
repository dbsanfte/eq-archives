<br>
a guild is a guild and its like a family  but to have 1officer or perhaps class officers decide who gets what will always lead to problems.. and its not very fair to say "this ranger deserve it more because he has been to 3 more raids then you" or to the extreme but very very happening the officer of the given class awards the one he likes best and makes up a suitable reason for this..  <br>
<br>
if you go the deck out the maintank and key classes routine with ToV items you will soon learn how fun it is when they change guilds or stop playing eq.. <br>
<br>
people who are there should have an equal chance and no one is worth more then the other... if you think so then dont bring them to the raids..<br>
<br>
its like having people work for your family and then refuse payment because your fave son needs money..<br>
<br>

<br>
It doesn't always lead to problems, it just doesn't work for every guild.  A pure award loot system requires trust on both ends, the awarding party trusting the recipient to view that item as a means to help the guild, and the guild members to trust that even if they didn't get the drop that time, it will likely come to them in time.<br>
<br>
It falls apart when the guild is so large that &quot;in time&quot; could conceivably mean a year rather than a few weeks or a month or two simply because there are so many people waiting for an item, especially for multi-class items.  Or it falls apart when too much of the guild is too new or too loot obssessed to honestly trust their guild.<br>
<br>
If you look at it by numbers, randoming won't get your guild outfitted any faster than awarding it.  If you have 10 warriors who want a ToV bp, no matter how you work it, someone has to be the 10th one.  Loot issues have a lot more to do with commitment than they do with how it's handed out.  The award system is just a good scapegood, no matter which one a guild uses. <p><img src=http://www.kaseyspace.com/EQ/nenasig.jpg align=center>

Hurrah!  You've managed to point out what I already said.  What isn't true, however, is that we were EVER on the verge of collapse, which is what the unguilded guy keeps trying to say.<br>
<br>
Of course people shop guilds all the time.  Unless you're a GL or recruitment officer for a guild you have NO IDEA how many people are constantly shopping guilds.  Some of them are trying to find the right fit.  Some of them are trying to get more stuff for themselves.  What guild has the policies that give me the most stuff...  ....hrm....<br>
<br>
Any person who's ever done staffing would be proud of our turn-over rate, and many people who leave Vision ask to come back (and some of them even mature enough that we TAKE them back - heh).<br>
<br>
Also, you make a HUGE mistake in assuming they want to leave because of MY view of loot.  For starters, I don't make the policies at Vision.  I'm part of the process, but I'm only one of a handful of officers with that power.  Second, most items are given out by people other than me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and its not very fair to say &quot;this ranger deserve it more because he has been to 3 more raids then you&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree.  In some cases it's VERY fair to say exactly that.  <br>
<br>
Of course, the best part is, in Vision, we're pretty up-front about it.  You know what you're in for.  If you don't like the policies, it's not like we shoved 'em down your throat.  You OPTED to have them.  In fact, if it was your class' loot, you got to work with your CL to set that policy.  Every Ranger, for example, gets to talk to Cheeta and decide how their policy is going to work.  The rule is that they all have to agree that they like them -- or at least agree that they're fair and they can live with 'em.  So, if someone's complaining about the way *I* distribute loot, they need to understand either they disagree with our philosphy entirely, or that they simply didn't do a good job of working with their class and their officers to find a better solution*.<br>
<br>
....the best part is, that if anyone ever left Vision over loot, they're a liar; as they've always given another reason.<br>

There will occasionally be, in any organization, people who don't like the compensation, the atmosphere, an individual or subgroup of the organization or the goals of the organization.<br>
<br>
On the whole, we have one of the largest (not most uber, just large) memberships at over 130 members. We have open discussions on our message boards about any subject someone wants to bring up (unless it's totally inflammatory like some of the posts on NAG) and we generally work towards a loot system and goals that meet the needs of the majority of our members.<br>
<br>
If you've chosen to speak with a couple disgruntled people out of our 130+ roster, then you have gotten a skewed view of the situation.<br>
<br>

<br>
We take the long view of things in the guild. We do what's best for the guild overall. Maybe this month it's outfit all the warriors in ToV, and maybe next it's take out epic mobs for wizard and shaman epics.<br>
<br>
The majority of our membership take the long view and have little if any problem with how loot is distributed. It's going to benefit the guild and benefit ~them~ as a part of it. When they do have a problem, there are people in the officer ranks who deal with their concerns genuinely.<br>
<br>
As an officer and founding member, I can assure you that we've have no secret-squirrel meetings about how to oust Palimax or dissolve the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of us are father-son, mother-daughter, sister-brother and best friend combinations. We talk on the phone, meet for beers and bowling or dinner on a regular basis, and have an annual get-together in Vegas.<br>
<br>
We've maintained a nice solid base of people since the beginning and I expect we'll be around and together when Verant shuts down these servers. <p><font face=arial>Membrayne VolcanoEyes<br>Arch Mage of <a href="http://www.guildvision.org">Vision</a><br> Master of Elements</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umembrayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Membrayne</A> at: 1/14/02 9:20:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrist0.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crist0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 9:19:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't hate you Blizz</span><hr size=1> Hehe I can tell you this much Palimax:<br>

You'd NEVER get another tip from me about anything again.<br>

Pardon me friend, i know of a dragon that's up that both i and several of your friends need. I'll gather some friends if you gather friends and we'll take him down. Oh, what's that? You say you have &quot;decided&quot; that it's &quot;ok&quot; for me to get to roll for what we both want, since i a) helped you fight for it and b) was nice enough to  give you a heads up that it was even there?<br>

It was one respected friend asking our entire guild to "take sev down" with him. What he requested was a "fair shot" and that's what he got. We didn't hand-down terms, we negotiated them.<br>

We were done with Shissar 20 minutes after we were notified about Sev being up, and our druids had repeatedly exclaimed in guildchat how they were going to check Sev right afterwards (as we had been doing all day). <p><font face=arial>Membrayne VolcanoEyes<br>Arch Mage of <a href="http://www.guildvision.org">Vision</a><br> Master of Elements</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umembrayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Membrayne</A> at: 1/14/02 9:25:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uvaxumgax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vaxumgax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 9:28:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't hate you Blizz</span><hr size=1> Dam, and I was sure Nanikbi was going to join Vision.
