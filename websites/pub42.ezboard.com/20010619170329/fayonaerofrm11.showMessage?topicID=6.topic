I hope this is clear enough. I left out MANY details and so the story may seem a bit different than it really is. But you want to know all the details with all the story, you would have to read between 40-50 pages.<br>
Here are the hard facts:<br>
<br>
<br>
Once upon a time (i like this start)<br>
There has been the shiny Paladin of Light, Banegrivm, contacted by a Bard on the world of Sol Ro.<br>
He has been informed that many dark forces are gathering to make an invasion in Kithicor and all over anotnica<br>
So Banegrivm gathered his forces by himself, got in contact with Firiona Vie, Daughter of Tunare and fought the Evil Armies,<br>
Unfortunately they have been overrun by them.<br>
Many thousand of honorous Soldiers died.<br>
Innoruuk, Cazic Thule, Lanys and Dark Elfes were attacking his forces not just in Kithicor<br>
Unfortunately his army was not strong enough. Firiona Vie had to flee and the forces of the good were broought down<br>
the war has been fought all over between Neriak and High Hold.<br>
Since then, Kithicor Forrest is not what it used to be. We all are aware of the undead that keep haunting in this forrest at nighttimes.<br>
This opened the doors to the home of Innoruuk, the Plane of Hate.<br>
The Tower in Oasis, guarded by Spectres is still a witness of this, it was the place of the opening of this horrible plane.<br>
Lanys, which actually wanted to kill Firiona Vie has failed. Since then she wants revenge and kill Firiona. <br>
She is a Sabretooth and kept planning to kill Firiona once she reappears.<br>
Many years we had peace and as long as you avoid Kithicor during the night, you had the feeling that the evil forces were gone.<br>
This was NOT the case.<br>
Lanys gathered her forces, the Sabretooths in Qeynos.<br>
They are currently in the Catacombs.<br>
The leader of them has been hung by the guards of Qeynos, since Benagrivm, our shiney Paladin has informed them.<br>
Lanys wanted revenge and she came here to North Karana and summoned Bertoxxulous.<br>
She asked him for a favor to weaken Qeynos. Bertoxxulous has the same plan and supported her.<br>
The other part is, as we know, Antonius Bayle is the leader of Qeynos<br>
but his brither, Kane, wants to take over this place.<br>
He is the commander of many guards in Qeynos and also a Sabretooth.<br>
So Kane and Lanys are gathering and planning to take over the lead in Qeynos.<br>
Since we have the plague here, the food is going rare.<br>
People are unhappy<br>
Taxes go up<br>
Qeynos is weakened.<br>
Best opportunity to attack it.<br>
but...<br>
There is also Firiona Vie<br>
Lanys wants her dead.<br>
As we all know, Firiona returend to Felwithe lately, to meet her father.<br>
She told her father, that she would like to summon her mother, Tunare, to help her to get back the Lifeguide, her mighty weapon she lost in Kithicor.<br>
Her father told her to get 3 enchanted Stones.<br>
Firiona went away to obtain them.<br>
Now, there will be a big party for the return of Firiona Vie in Greater Faydark.<br>
Firiona is supposed to be there.<br>
We however know that Lanys may use this opportunity to kill Firiona<br>
And also, to obtain the enchanted Stones<br>
To then summon Bertoxxulous<br>
So we have 3 things. The Plague, The Festival wtih Firiona and Lanys, and Kane Bayle.<br>
Those are the most important Facts<br>
At this time we do expect to have to fight the following persons, citizens, gods...<br>
Lanys<br>
Sabretooths<br>
Kane<br>
Corrupt GUards of Qeynos<br>
Lucan DLere<br>
bertoxxulous<br>
Neriak<br>
Mayong Mistmoore (long story too)<br>
Besides those we are expecting:<br>
Lord Nagafen<br>
Lady Vox<br>
Now who will support US?<br>
This will be (hopefully)<br>
Firiona Vie<br>
Her Father<br>
Tunare, if she gets summoned<br>
The Ring of Scale<br>
Antonius Bayle<br>
High Keep Soldiers<br>
Knights of Truth<br>
Temple of Life<br>
Thats about it.<br>
You see, we are much weaker than our Enemy. This is wwhy we need to gather up, to be prepared, to simply be, MANY/<br>
Karana has so far not been involved. but I could imagine very well to get assistance from the good gods like Karana, Erollisi, Mithaniel.<br>
It is clear, as soon as Qeynos is weakened enough and as soon as the evil forces are ready, they will come.<br>
I expect it to be between 2 days and 2 weeks. but I could also be very wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
/ooc: Explenation out of character.<br>
This will be an event similar to Kithicor War. The mobs will attack, there will be huge armies of mobs of lvl20 up to lvl65. The mobs WILL ZONE. So you CANNOT avoid them by zoning out. <br>
This will be a huge GM event. All the small GM events that happen at the moment all over are part of this background story.<br>
There is one Player, Bangrivm, that has been contacted by GMs and mostly LIVES this story. He is the main person in all this. He is on Druzzil Ro server so we mostly just see the result of all his actions and reactions to the GMs plans.<br>
Once he will be at the point of War, we will have the war too. But this can be at any time and any day.<br>
It will most likely be the opening of the new plane, the Plane of Decay. Bertoxxulous home. but this has never been confirmed.<br>
<br>
Expect to die, expect to lose lvls expect to fall in a death loop. Expect the wildest event you have ever seen in EQ, expect mobs you have never seen before and what unfortunately most of you will convince.. expect loot that you have never seen!<br>
<br>
Even if you just want the loot, help us. Gather with us, get prepared, get organised, WE NEED YOU!<br>
<br>
<br>
Please all your ideas, your thoughts, your experiences, your additions and your new information here. We will have this topic as our discussion topic.<br>
Remember this is a roleplay topic. Same as the whole fight. Same as whole EQ should be. Its roleplay. <br>

<br>
Qeynos Catacombs<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
So far our investigation has been somewhat limited in the Catacombs. A couple of our members who have chosen a darker path, and therefore have a little easier time getting around down there, have been poking around intermitantly. We have also placed a mole in the midst of the Bertoxxulous Shrine. (ooc: this is a level 1 Bertoxx Necro we created on our guild account. Our officers will log her in from time to time and keep our eyes and ears open.) Should anyone be in the neighborhood at any given time, look for Toxxgal to be hanging around the Shrine.<br>
<br>
As many of you know, towards the end of our last Council meeting, I recieved word that Kane Bayle had appeared in the Shrine. We quickly mobilized to confront him, but were beaten back near the entrance of the Shrine. While the rest of the group followed up on a lead involving Gharin delivering a message to SureFall for Antonius, I turned to Toxxgal to pursue the more direct approach with Kane. She received a Bottle of Blackburrow Stout and was instructed to deliver it to Barn Bloodstone in High Hold. After completing this we found our selves in Freeport and our lead ran dry at Opal Darkbrier. (ooc: apon further investigation both of these quests existed previously and the bottle of stout is a variation of the Balye List quest that results in the Rage War Hammer.) We will continue to watch the catacombs vigilantly and hopefully muster a few folks to scour the place clean in the next few days. I'll keep you posted.<br>

I will keep coying information for their Board to make sure we have the full info.<br>

Thoughts and Comments<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Dark Elf Courier may have something to do with things. It has something to do ultimately I am told with Tunare religion specific jewlely of a sort. We know there is also an Orc Runner quest as well. This all makes sense considering what we know as it relates to Donk Crushbone, the Butcherblock Hammer, Bloody Kithicor and recent events. Consider this Dark Elf Courier as theres a dark elf camp inside Lesser Faydark and the role of Mayong Mistmoore in all of these affairs.<br>
<br>
As to the comment about Firiona Vie being on Luclin, I am not sure she has ever actually been there...yet. She is the trademark so to speak of EverQuest. Of course she will show there and I am sure in time make an appearance there as well.<br>
<br>
The gnome with Edril's amulet IS in the Hole. He has actually and physically been seen. His name is Nortlav the Scalekeeper.<br>
<br>
Scribe of Dal, I am more inclined to agree on the dragon theory. But I am noticing there ARE those in Neriak that do not follow Neriak. The scribe of Dal is one of those.<br>
<br>
Yes I think its a pretty safe bet that Carson is definitely after that hammer. We already know he is after the gift of course. It all makes perfect sense. <br>
<br>
Mayong Mistmoore and the Claw of Veeshan, I think that is correct about Mayong wanting it to became perhaps a god. That totally would not surprise me. Perhaps simply also to lift his curse as well.<br>
<br>
That amulet from the ice comet quest would be invaluable. Would LOVE to get my hands on one.<br>
<br>
I have to agree on the theory of the Translocation spells from the tomes that Al'Kabor has discovered.<br>
<br>
We finally got a copy of the news from Ak Anon (Halas has no news by the way). It mentions all of the things we already know but in addition makes it seem suggestive as if their could be an impending conflict between the gnomes and the ogres and trolls.<br>
<br>
I am also wondering about Neriak. It seems as if theres a division of sorts amidst royalty. The Queen doesn't approve of how the King hunts Lanys. Teir'Dal civil war in the making perhaps? We do know that the King and the Queen seemingly are opposing each other now. <br>
<br>
Heres a surmising theory to the aforementioned. What if the King wants to dispose his wife? What if Lanys is secretly his lover and to become the new king? How else would she keep &quot;getting away&quot; all the time? Anyone notice the heavy influence of Bertoxxulous thats slowly appearing in Neriak starting with the X'lottl household and the other items of note? Lanys also captured Ashteth, the seer of Innoruuk who is gifted with visions of Innoruuk's will.<br>
<br>
On that note when I rode with the heroes in Castle Mistmoore we found that letter mentioning Khasra served ANOTHER dark elf and it also Mentioned that Mayong had a &quot;proverbial army&quot; that was amassed and not even Tsserina knew. So if Tsserina isn't the other dark elf then why is it Lanys? Bloody Kithicor. In the days JUST before the battle Mayong Mistmoore launched an attack against Felwithe AND Kelethin both. <br>
<br>
So Mayong Mistmoore was allied with her then. Do we really think that he would care if she was disgraced? Mayong Mistmoore himself is disgraced, also keep in mind his megalomaniac personality.<br>
<br>
Tayla Ironforge and the Dervish Cutthroats. Remember we know that Tayla was heading to Kelethin to be with those of &quot;her own kind&quot; says her sister. Enter the Nybright sisters. We all know about the Drunken paladin whose daughters left Faydwere and went to Antonica to return and become Bloodthirsty brigands.<br>
<br>
Interesting one is named Tayla and they are on Dervish Cutthroat faction. Note those are the ONLY Dervish Cutthroats in all of Faydwere. The enchanter now standing outside Qeynos that puts together the two books from Nagafen and Vox is also known to drop a dagger that identifies as a Cutthroat Dagger. <br>
<br>
Also at one point in time (I think Azibelle Spavin but dont quote me), I remember someone telling me that they were in North Ro when out of one of the Dervish Cutthroat camps came a &quot;Dark Cutthroat&quot; which was described as being in its 30's and gave the individual in question a thrashing. At first when I heard it I didn't think much of it until this more recent thoughts of the correlated facts.<br>
<br>
Now I think its pretty sure that the woman in Cabalis IS in fact Tayla Ironforge. We know she IS a Bloodsabre. Now it was said that Ton Firepride sold her into slavery. Not at all. Ton Firepride is a Bloodsabre and does what? Makes weapons. Carson McCabe is a weapons dealer and a Bloodsabre ally. <br>
<br>
Ton helped Tayla move, or more to the point introduced her to Carson who in fact did the move. Again note all the smugglers and Carson's dark elf contact to them outside the gates. Carson moved her to Neriak where she ended up in the maidens fancy where she was picked up by a &quot;powerful merchant&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here is our link. Mare X'lottl. SHE was in the Maidens Fancy where Tayla was. The inkeep THREW the game of Kings Court on purpose. Why? Think about what we know about House X'lottl. The &quot;powerfull merchant&quot; was none other then the Haggle Baron of Cabalis. Tayla Ironforge is STILL there now.<br>
<br>
Now why is Tayla still there? Carson knows about weapons right and is a collector of them right? Tayla is a Bloodsabre. The Haggle Baron is the successor to Haggle Baron Dalnir. Dalnir's crypt holds a powerfull dagger forged by a heretic wizard that was cursed by the gods, yet never completed with its enchantments.<br>
<br>
I believe the Bloodsabres and company want the dagger, but why? Secondly as to the Nybright sisters. I believe I have heard it said their are others walking within Kelethin and/or Felwithe with the surname of Nybright. Perhaps they can provide further information. Thoughts? <br>

The king wants to sacrifice Lany to release her power back to Innoruk. The queen has made it known she does not like his methods. Enter the blood moon. Is it not the practice of the king to take a lover and have her sacrificed to Innoruk? Maybe the queen is not too keen on the idea as her and her husband do not get along well as it is? Maybe she is disgruntled just to be disgruntled in the first place. After all, they have a history of problems between em. <br>
<br>
I also want to [point something else out. there is a new patch message letting us know that the patch on the 30th will remove most/some corpses from the game. Any loses of equipment will be investigated, and any fraudulant claims will be punnished by lost accounts. Does anyone remember the last time this message was posted to us?

My comrade Thurkon and I had a brief encounter with a GM at the entrance to Befallen. I did not realize that he was a GM at first, because his name was in purple, although I found his title strange. I have included a screenshot and an edited log of the conversation that took place.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.starpower.net/gravesrh/gm.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
[Sun May 13 22:38:33 2001] You say, 'Accursed one, what do ye here?'<br>
[Sun May 13 22:38:50 2001] Thurkon says, 'Mighty swords and armor he baers.'<br>
[Sun May 13 22:38:51 2001] Vargnaard says, 'Nothing hehe'<br>
<br>
(At this point, his title changed momentarily from purple to green, and then back to purple, letting us know that he was a GM.)<br>

<br>
Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee morning hours here on the West Coast. The important part of the message is not that, though. It's this: <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning. <br>
<br>
So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing. <br>
<br>
Thanks. <br>

The are, interestingly, no rent, which hints to them getting updated now and then... maybe with the next patch?<br>
We thought it would be a good idea to post the full text of the newspapers in here... personally i bought the Voice of Rivervale and the Freeport Observer and made screenshots of their content and extracted the text out of the screens which i will post right at the end of this post (so people who don't want to read the newspapers don't have to scroll all the way down to read my other news)<br>
My other news aren't that important anyway, but might be interesting... i scouted Skyshrine and the Plane of Growth yesterday... i'm afraid i couldn't find anything of interest so far, i didn't reach the upper lvls of Skyshrine yet tho and will look into that right after i log on, i think there is where could be some information... in Plane of Growth i couldn't find a great many interesting npcs... Tunare doesn't talk at all (not even to Aolil, a wood elven druid of Tunare who scouted PoG with me, he's amiably while i'm only indifferent, due to my worshipping of Karana and my being human, i suppose), the only NPC we could find who talked was the prince of the tunarean court, i forgot his name, he said something akin to &quot;Greeting, stranger, I'm the Prince of the Tunarean Court. What leads you to this most holy of places?&quot;, but we didn't know what to tell him to get more information out of him... as a side note, PoG is BEAUTIFUL! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
following now are the newspapers:<br>
<br>
-= The Freeport Observer =-<br>
<br>
&quot;The Forsaken Child's search&quot;<br>
<br>
It has been brought to the attention of the entire world that Lanys T'Vyl has been forsaken and cast aside by her father and the entirety of the intelligent, loyal, and worthy Teir'Dal nation. The specific reasons for this expected and delayed turn of favor toward the once revered child is simple -- failure. However, unlike the graceful and deathly charming ways that she was once spoken of and feared, she has thrown something of a child's fit in defiance of her father's divine rule.<br>
<br>
In the pitch of a fussing cat, Lanys proclaimed that she will be seeking Malevolence, Guardian of the Wicked -- an ancient artifact once revered and eventually destroyed by her own people. Much of the world remains ignorant to the power that this artifact holds, twisted and corrupted from its former glory, but as governors and keepers of our own city's lore, we know the truth of Marr's curse and hold our own concerns for Lanys's seeking of its restoration.<br>
<br>
Although the child's actions and proclamations of revenge against her father bring us no true concern, the people of Freeport patiently await Neriak's champions to bring down this youthful nuisance and failed would-be champion.<br>
<br>
<br>
-= The Rivervale Voice =-<br>
<br>
&quot;Blight Upon the Plains&quot;<br>
<br>
The plains of Karana still buckle under the terrible plague that is effecting the region. A terrible green mist, swarms of insects and wide spread disease are wreaking havoc on the area.<br>
<br>
Farmers report withered crops that are nearly unfit for consumption. We are thankful that the terrors unleashed upon the plains of Karana have left us, for the most part, unaffected. Druids are asked to spread the word to travelers heading for the Plains as many of the animals have become infected with rabies, from the mild and majestic wolf to the fearsome and respectable griffon. Priests of all kinds are asked to lend their efforts and cure those that become infected to keep the disease from spreading.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lanys T'Yyl Searchs for Artifact&quot;<br>
<br>
Lanys T'Vyl, foul Dark Elf and former chosen of Innoruuk, maintains a small but loyal following in the Teir'Dal community. It has been reported that she has been seeking to gather the pieces of an artifact, once considered cursed by the Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
It is uncertain what she hopes to gain by piecing together this cursed device. We at the Voice believe that this bodes ill not only for we citizens of Rivervale but perhaps for the Dark Elven people as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;High Elven Princess Free&quot;<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie, High Elven princess and daugter of King Tearis Thex of the elves, was returned dafely after an extended period of captivity at the hands of the Iksar Danak Dhorentath and his minions. Danak is said to be the leader of a cult and is said to have ties with the powerful hell spawned creature known as Danak Dhorentath.<br>
<br>
We join the people of Faydwer in celebrating this happy occasion.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately we were not able to find anything remarkable, but the fact that is ia very special feeling to simply walk down to the deepest point of Norrath. <br>
<br>
We spent several hours there. <br>
Unfortunately we lack the Key to enter the very last door!<br>
So, if anyone knows how we could enter this or if anyone even got the key, please let us know. <br>
<br>
However there was something special.<br>
As we were down there, there was also a Raid of the Circle of dark Heroes and the Storm of Eternity.<br>
They have spotted a gnome.<br>
This gnome was actualy one of the signs we were looking for. Sir Banegrivm has reported the same. Unfortunately we had not been able to find this gnome.<br>
<br>
The gnomes have started to appear at very special places.<br>
The Hole, Plane of Hate and other places. Till now, noone mentioned Gnomes as one of the Clans being really involved deeply in all this, but now I more and more think we should send someone to Ak'Anon and especially down inthe Necromancer guild to find out more.<br>

Two questions: One isnt Kane Bayle the nephew of Antonius Bale and not his brother?  Kane is secretly a ShadowKnight and not a paladin like his uncle correct??<br>
<br>
Two: There is a lady in Qeynos...Nerissa Clothspinner...her sister left her in the care of Kane Bayle.  Has anyone talked to her or seen her recently??  I dont remember seeing her my last trip to Qeynos which is odd because she is usually everywhere.  Perhaps she has something to say....perhaps not.  But it does seem odd that her sister is located in the Karanas and also she is a ward of Kane Bayle yet knows nothing of his evil nature.<br>

Having recently purchased a copy of Felwithe’s news: The Royal Herald, after it being recommended to me by Lord Derfel (Thanks Derfel!) I thought I’d add my three cents. The Royal Herald is of interest mainly because it mentions the creators of the Karana plague by name.<br>
Also, I have a small suggestion. Since there are so many people (npc’s) involved in this war, all the different names become a bit confusing. Perhaps it would be a good idea to start a new thread with a list of all the npc’s involved and their role in the unwinding events?<br>
Now without further delay, the news from Felwithe:<br>
<br>
The Royal Herald<br>
<br>
Fironia Vie’s return<br>
We are greatly pleased to announce the safe return of our princess and Tunare’s faithful champion Fironia Vie. For nearly a year she’s been an unwilling captive of the savage Iksar in the lands of Kunark and only recently did Galeth Veredeth find the strength through the guidance of the Mother of All to bring her from the gruesome Iksar chains that bound her.<br>
It has been reported that she is physically well, although her great treasure, The Lifeguide, is no longer within her possession. Rumored to be corrupted by the power of the Faceless himself, the staff is lost upon the vast face of Norrath and is said to be within the possession of Danak Dhorentath, the leader of the Cult of the Arisen and one of Venril Sathir’s chief advisors.<br>
The Koada’Dal and the Fier’Dal nations give their collective prayers to Tunare in Faith that The lifeguide will shortly be returned to our Champion and Princess’s hands.<br>
<br>
Curse on the Karanas<br>
The plaguebringer’s touch has reached every corner of Qeynos and its surrounding lands. The Farmland grows stale and the food produced is useless and bitter. Such is the foul work of Azibelle Spavin, a chief knight of Bertoxxulous. With the aid of Meldrath, a gnome necromancer who has plagued the lands of Faydwer for several years, Azabelle brought forth a disease that would spoil crops and destroy the once fertile soil of the Karana Plains. <br>
We lend our prayers to the people of Qeynos and give hope that the blight that has begun to infest the citizens with famine and disease will be cast into nothingness by the light of Tunare’s good grace.<br>

Here goes:<br>
-The Child of Hate-<br>
Despite the wishes of our father, Lanys T'Vyl continues to act as the child of Hate. It was prophesized that Lanys T'Vyl, daughter of Hate, was to be sacrificed so that the borrowed powers could be returned to Innoruuk, to clear the way for the new chosen, Valizrae D'Tora.<br>
Lanys T'Vyl has recently obtained one of the three pieces of the Malevolence, Governor of the Wicked. She seeks to gain this artifact to further her influence upon Norrath. Once the remaining two pieces are found, Lanys may hold the power to seal Innoruuk's presence from Norrath as revenge against us and the divine animosity that has been shown toward her.<br>
The archpriest of our hateful father, Dorvias N'Keth, has been preparing for the sacrificial ceremony as the King's armies prepare to engage for the capture. The Queen has not voiced her opinions on the situation, but rumors have it that while she believes the sacrifice must take place, she is not pleased with the manner in which Innoruuk's divine Rule is being approached by his majesty.<br>
<br>
-Plague in Karana-<br>
With the recent plague affecting the farmsteads of the Karanas, food prices have increased in the Qeynos area. &quot;Not having to rely on foolish farm products, this should not affect the Teir'Dal nation&quot; says king Naythox Thex.<br>
&quot;However, we need to capitalize on the market and take this opportunity to increase our forces.&quot; The King went on to say that food prices will be increased in Neriak and its outposts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=505050><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/usirtaino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SirTainO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elite Poster</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(5/16/01 7:58:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Story         ( and News &amp; Discussion)</span><hr size=1> From Lady Loriel:<br>

Hostile Tier'Dal deployment in Kithicor<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Sir Banegrivm already feared in a few posts back, civil war seems to have broken out in Neriak at last. The disagreement between the king and queen of the Tier'Dal about how to deal with Lanys has seen its first troop deployment.<br>
Investigating rumours, Sir Noah and myself entered Kithicor Forest and found a strong force of Tier'Dal stationed inside. This force is stationed inside a ruined building near the coordinates +695 +2416 and consist of several seasoned spellcasters and the accompanying undead and pets. They are active during both day and night, but seem to stay stationary for the moment.<br>
Confirmed members of this force are:<br>
Tasi V'Ghera with pet<br>
Brigadier G'Tau<br>
Advisor C'Zatl<br>
Loltos V'Ghera with pet<br>
Coercer Q'Ioul<br>
Adjudant D'Kan<br>
War Priestess T'Zau<br>
4 ghouls and a handful of skeletons<br>
almost all are seasoned warriors and so this has to be seen as a considerable force. Whether they are the spearpoint for a stronger force to come, or will stay alone is unknown at this point. But if they are left unchecked they can easily make Kithicor forest a very dangerous place to travel to, even for fellow Tier'Dal (they conned KoS to me, a Tier'Dal necro) effectively cutting Norrath in half.<br>
Neriak itself seems to be quiet under this all, perhaps even too quiet.<br>

Greetings-<br>
<br>
As I was doing my Karana scouting tonight, I happened upon some strange events in South Karana. Am not sure what this has to do with war, if anything, but figured you would like to know anything amiss. Three named undead gnolls, Triza the Dead, Gezra the Dead, and Braza the Dead up and started wandering around. The strange thing about this is that high-level characters could not kill them, and it was up to a few 20ish PCs to wipe them out. My partner Yarlin and I were attacked a bit south of Infected Paw, as Triza said,&quot;Join us in DEATH. Join us in eternal PAIN.&quot; 2 Were confirmed dead, leaving the leader Triza at large. I asked if any notes or scrolls were found, but no clear answer was recieving. Anyhow, I'd hate to think that the gnolls are involved in the great War to come, but coincidence seems too unlikely in these final days of peace.<br>

<br>
I wish more poeple that do know somethng (oh and I know its MANY of us all) would finally make a step forward to let us know about their findings on this thread. I am sure with the knowledge of us all put together, we would already have found the answer to very most questions.<br>
<br>
Maybe most interesting and most concerning investigations were made by my younger brother and spy Tainomule. He entered the Qeynos Catacombs pretending being a Necromancer serving Bertoxxulous. He was aimiably to all members of the shrine. His findings are very concerning.<br>
<br>
The shrine of Bertoxxulous is not just very big, it is also filled up with many dozens of very strong followers of Bertoxxulous. Down there you find the Necromancer Guild, the Shadowknight Guild, the Enchanter Guild as well as numerous people that seem to be high priests of Bertoxxulous that seem not to directly belong to one of the Guilds. <br>
<br>
Tainomule had several talks with the evil inhabitants of this shrine of disease. They have many plans, many quests to offer and are truly evil. <br>
<br>
I also found a sing on the floor. This sign that we have found all over Neriak, in the Spectre Tower in Oasis, in Cabilis, on the rock with the named Treant in North Karana, in Crushbone, in Castle Mistmoore and other places. In this sign lies the truth. we must really try to find out what it means. Other people have tried to do so, but didn't find the real truth yet.<br>
<br>
Here you see this sign. It concerned me much.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/bretoxxshrine.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Now I would like to let you know what talks I had with the people down there.<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:39:34 2001] a skeleton judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
[Tue May 15 23:39:42 2001] You say, 'Hail Kurne Rextula'<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:39:42 2001] Kurne Rextula says 'Welcome to the new order of life, the life of service to our diseased Lord, Bertoxxulous.  Did you encounter any of my [pets] on the way here?  I hope not. <br>
[Tue May 15 23:39:59 2001] You say, 'What pets?'<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:40:00 2001] Kurne Rextula says 'My pets are the skeleton guardians of these catacombs.  Some have been behaving erratically since the arrival of [Drosco]. <br>
[Tue May 15 23:40:11 2001] You say, 'Who is Drosco?'<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:40:12 2001] Kurne Rextula says 'Drosco used to be a loyal member of our shrine, until we learned the truth.  The truth was that he was a mole from the Knights of Thunder.  It appears they are assisting the Temple of Life in their pursuit of our eradication.  Drosco was apprehended and boiled alive.  I turned his boiled body into a zombie to march these halls.  Now he must be stopped.  He has begun to [compromise the shrine's location]. <br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:42:24 2001] a sepsis rat judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:48:06 2001] You say, 'Hail Zaen Kalystir'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:48:06 2001] Zaen Kalystir says 'Welcome to the Shrine of the Diseased! You will be repaid for your service when your soul crosses the void into Bertoxxulous' waiting arms. Are you available to do His bidding? <br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:48:30 2001] You say, 'Yes I am available to do his bidding'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:48:31 2001] Zaen Kalystir says 'That is good. We need you to go and speak with Commander Kane Bayle of the Qeynos Militia. You will find him at the gatehouse. Tell him that the disease is spreading. Now go. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:53:43 2001] You say, 'Hail Rihtur Fullome'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:53:43 2001] Rihtur Fullome says 'Hail, Tainomule ! I hope the trek into our shrine has not scarred you in any way. Our defenses have been increased lately. Many of the citizens have heard rumors about our shrine. I say it is all due to that [soldier]. <br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:54:19 2001] You say, 'What Nerissa?'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:54:20 2001] Rihtur Fullome says 'Nerissa Clothspinner. Her sister was a good friend of Kane's. When she left Qeynos to venture into the world, she asked Kane to watch over the girl. Now Kane tries to hide from this child the fact that he is allied with our church. I do not think he has hidden it well. I have told the others, but they do not believe me. I do not care. I have my own [plans]. <br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:54:45 2001] You say, 'What plans?'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:54:45 2001] Rihtur Fullome says 'Nerissa is well protected by Kane. She will no doubt attempt to inform someone of her suspicions, most likely her sister, Milea. You must find Milea Clothspinner and kill her. No word of our operations must leak out. Return with proof of Milea's death and we shall see to a reward. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:57:37 2001] You say, 'Hail Teydar'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:57:38 2001] Teydar says 'Oh look..a talking lump of refuse..how novel!'<br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:58:53 2001] You say, 'Hail Nomaria Doseniar'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:58:54 2001] Nomaria Doseniar says 'Welcome! It is good to see our disciples can still outsmart the guards of Qeynos and make it to the Shrine of Bertoxxulous. Our ranks are best filled with disciples such as yourself. We have need of you. Do you wish to serve the Lord of Disease or not? <br>
<br>
<br>
[Tue May 15 23:59:29 2001] You say, 'I wish to serve the Lord of Disease.'<br>
[Tue May 15 23:59:29 2001] Nomaria Doseniar says 'Aye! That is good. Of late, we have heard news of a message that will be sent to the Treefolk of the Jaggedpine. Antonius Bayle will send word to the Jaggedpine that certain requests will be met. We must intercept this message. That is all you need to know. Go and find Antonius Bayle's messenger, Gharin. He should have the message. Get it by any means necessary and return it to me. Go now! <br>
<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:01:51 2001] You say, 'Hail Garuc Anehm'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:01:52 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'Welcome to the Shrine of Bertoxxulous!  You appear to be [new to the shrine].  I do not remember seeing you around. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:01 2001] You say, 'I am new to the shrine.'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:02 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'New blood to spread Bertoxxulous' disease?   We presently need the help of a [young shadowknight].   There are certain deeds which must be carried out. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:17 2001] You say, 'I am a young shadowknight'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:17 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'Then let your supreme task be the extermination of the Priests of Life.  Know that they threaten the will of our Lord Bertoxxulous.   For every fallen paladin and cleric of the Temple of Life, you shall rise within our ranks.  So... do you [loathe paladins]? <br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:37 2001] You say, 'I will loathe Paladins'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:02:37 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'As do we all.  The paladins of Qeynos come from either the Hall of Thunder or the Temple of Life.  We have put a bounty upon their heads.  Destroy these knights and return either the Order of Thunder or the prayer beads of these inferior men.  There has even been a report from [Commander Kane]. <br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:03:00 2001] You say, 'What COmmander Kane?'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:03:01 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'Kane Bayle is the Commander of the Qeynos Guard.  He has found it advantageous to befriend the Bloodsabers.  We share a [common goal].  He assists us in many ways.  He has some new information to reveal.  Go and tell him you are a Bloodsaber. Do not speak with him while he is on duty!! <br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:04:13 2001] You say, 'What common goal?'<br>
[Wed May 16 00:04:13 2001] Garuc Anehm says 'Kane Bayle and the leaders of this shrine all wish to overthrow the rule of Antonius Bayle.  He, for power, and we for the glory of Bertoxxulous.  From this city, our diseased lord shall appear and tread across the land spitting death from his mouth and deforming the land.  His glory shall be eternal! <br>
<br>
<br>
They are all very loyal towards Kane Bayle. Still they seem also to have plans behind Kanes back (like to murder a good friend of Kane). but also these just serve the purpose to a) make Kane the most powerful Person in Qeynos and area and to b) let Bertoxxulous power increase rapidly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Further more:<br>
There have been spotted several very powerful Tier'Dals in Kithicor Forrest during the day time and also during the night. They have been reported during day, but actually they do stay there constantly. This is a very very bad sign. Obviously they are making plans. The question is just, what are they doing? Are they waiting for Lanys to gather against the festivities in Felwithe? Are they the first Generals of the Dark Army? Are they on the Kings or Queens side? Or are they even Soldiers of Mayong Mistmoore?<br>
We NEED to investigate this furthermore. Maybe even send an army there to simply slain them to see what they have on them. They are Tier'Dals, so whatever they have in mind, it is no good. <br>
<br>
Lady Loriel and Sir Kamasu (Noah) have observed them for a longer time. I will get screenshots of them soon. Lady Loriel has posted their names. <br>
<br>
Another thing we completely ignored so far is the fact that many hints point towards... Kunark. Obviously the Chardokian Royal Family as well as the City of Cabilis is well involved in all this. Rumors say that in fact Firiona Vie has been kidnapped by Iksars. We need to send an investigation team over to Kunark to check the city of Cabilis, the Field of BOne as well as Trakanons Teeth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actual real hints about the Plane of Disease has been found in a talk with a Paladin in Qeynos:<br>
[Mon May 14 21:49:32 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Grumble.. If only I could find it.. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:49:39 2001] Roesager Thusten looks your way apprehensively -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:49:44 2001] You say, 'Hail Roesager Thusten'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:49:44 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Hail, Wizion ! My name is Roesager Thusten, Paladin of Life. I am a loyal servant of the Prime Healer and I seek to destroy all who wish to bring death and disease to the land of Norrath. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:50:58 2001] You say, 'Who is the prime healer?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:50:58 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Rodcet Nife is the Prime Healer. It is He who gives us the power to resist the decay and death that Bertoxxulous has released upon Norrath. The Temple of Life is dedicated to His honor. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] You say, 'What has bertoxxulous released on Norrath?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:51:34 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Bertoxxulous is a vile creature who rules the Plane of Disease. His filthy followers are spreading their stain across all of Norrath. We fear they are already here in Qeynos. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:12 2001] You say, 'You speak of the Plane of Disease?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:13 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'The Plaguebringers are followers of the disease lord, Bertoxxulous. We believe a sect of them now operates in Qeynos, but we need proof before we can act. <br>
<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] You say, 'What proof do you require?'<br>
[Mon May 14 21:54:25 2001] Roesager Thusten says 'Someone reported seeing a Plaguebringer roaming about in the hills near Qeynos. We have long suspected that their dark influence was spreading. I am searching for proof that they are now here in Qeynos. If you find anything, please bring it to me at the Temple of Life. <br>
<br>
The Patch message which will be implemented on May 30th saying that we all need to clean our corpses lead me to one idea. This Message was also released just before Bloody Kithicor. having to recover our corpses means most likely that they will overwrite the existing zones with major updates. I think all we do now is getting prepared for those HUGE changes then. And at the end, we expect the first big war to be then. I can't say yet whether this will be the festivities in Greater Faydark, or whether this will already be the big war with Bertoxxulous and his Plane of Disease. We need to be COMPLETELY ready by this time. 2 weeks to go!<br>
<br>
On a sidenote mentioned, the Tier'Dals in LFay are stronger now and I noticed a priestess there together with Dragoons and Elites. They were really strong and I had flee immediately from them. Eventually I made it with very low on life.<br>
<br>
Several informants have mentioned the meaning fo the Hammer of Butcherblock which holds mighty powers. I am not sure how this exactly has to do with it, but it was mentioned and it does have an impcat. If anyone knows about it, please let us know.<br>
<br>
I noticed (for the second time) a Barbarian in front of the temple of Marr in Freeport. This barbarian was threatingly towards me. The simple fact that he was way weaker than my humble self held him from attacking me. I have slain the villain and got nothing out of it at all. I lost faction with The Freeport Militia, The Qualition of Tradefolks I and III and with the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos!!<br>
Any further information about him would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sir Haloface has noticed an informant of the Bloodsabre leader: Here comes the VERY important info!<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:14:42 2001] Haloface tells you, 'As reported, Tovax hasnt been taking his usual path, so i followed him just now'<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:15:45 2001] Haloface tells you, 'Anyway he dropped a letter saying S'ragg will have my head for loosing that letter. guess what the letter says?'<br>
<br>
[Wed May 16 00:20:16 2001] Haloface tells you, 'Opal - Things are moving ahead on schedule. the sewer is complete and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  we have begun to gather the armies.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We are concerned with the Lifers interference, your assistance is needed in this matter, From S'ragg'<br>
<br>
<br>
So far the latest findings. I need your help. We are around 10 persons investigation and trying to find out more and think about the findings and find an explenation. This is NOT enough. We need more people think about this, more people find out things, POST things and help us with all this! <p><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/sign.jpg"></a><br>

The other is in the ars magica. If you enter this building, there are 4 doors, one in each direction and 3 corner rooms. The fourth corner is a secret wall.

Note (for Conaddor):<br>
Those Dark Elfes are there permanently. The Dark Elfes for the Rogue Epic are a) not all Kos and b) not there during day (as far as I know).<br>
Sir Banegrivm has mentioned those Dark Elfes too as new thing which concerns him. SInce he knows still way more than we do, I believe that they really are new and not the same as the ones you refer to.<br>
Still thanks for the input, its important to question things!<br>

You may all be aware of the lvl 12 necromancer NPC who wonders Qeynos Hills at night, Tovax Vamar.<br>
I got a report from a scout that Tovax was seen wondering far FAR from his usual path.<br>
Well, after following up reports of green mist in Felwith (which turned up to be false), i decided to make Qhills my next stop. Upon arival, it was dead on 12pm, which is when Tovax spawns by the guard tower. I announced that he was my camp, and keeping my distance so he wouldnt attack, I followed him. <br>
Sure enough, he strayed a long way from his usual route. Almost to the ruins, Tovax stopped, dropped a note, and ran. I grabbed the note and took off after him. He then shouted &quot;Oh No! S'garr will have my head for loosing that note!&quot;<br>
S'garr, as we know, is the leader of the Bloodsabres, an important faction in this War.<br>
The note read rougly as follows, although I'll have to take a SS of it and report word for word.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear Opal, we have ready our forces within the Sewers of Qeynos, waiting on the command to attack. We suffer from the interference of the Temple of Life (i think thats what it said) and greatly need your assistance in this matter. From S'ragg.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prety damn juicy Huh?!?<br>
So I checked Opal out on the web, and guess what. There are two. Both very powerful, one is the leader of the necromancer guild in NFP, and the other is the leader of the enchanter guild in WFP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Now let me ask you...which Opal from the letter was being reffered to? <br>

Haloface Soulchanter<br>
