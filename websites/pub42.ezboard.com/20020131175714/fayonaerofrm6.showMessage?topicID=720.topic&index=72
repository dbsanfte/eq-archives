If you agree with any of the community dubbed trolls (me), you will subsequently be ridiculed and flamed by the peanut gallery whether right or wrong. I am very happy to see that someone actually sees where I am coming from and post it, even tho it will most likely earn ire from the holier than thou's. But you must become one of them if you wish to have any chance at having a valid point around here and you must agree with what they post. Any disagreements with them and you become a troll and are always wrong even if you say white is white.<br>
<br>
Nydia: "I have a question then: Yuegou, in ONE paragraph, what would you have *liked* to have happened? Would *any* of the actual or possible remedies have resolved the issue to your satisfacton? If not, then what is the actual nature of the problem?"<br>
<br>
Hehe funny how someone gets to the heart of the matter in a simple straightforward way. Thanks Nydia, here is my ONE paragraph to you :)<br>
<br>
I would have liked Palimax and Orontes to simply have acknowledged that courtesy is something that all players deserve no matter if the mob is red, green or uber and that Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation. I would like to know that in the future they will respect others camps no matter what mob is being camped.<br>
<br>
There ya go Nydia :)<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Palimax:<br>
<br>
"You understand that when asked, Orontes left?"<br>
<br>
When asked by whom? Certainly not me, he continued after I informed him I was camping the area. Perhaps you mean the first mine?<br>
<br>
"You understand that Asterisko is killing green mobs too?"<br>
<br>
There was a 39th level enchanter getting xps in Asterisco's group. He was getting xps. That nullified your position of it was ok for Orontes to do what he did because 60ths were farming greens.<br>
<br>
"This isn't about us stomping over noobs or stealing XP camps. Nothing got stolen, for god's sake."<br>
<br>
You imply that since there were no newbies or xp camps involved, pushing your way into established camps is ok? I just want to make sure that is what you mean.<br>
<br>
You are correct, nothing was "stolen" since we never owned anything in the first place. If someone rushed Ragefire after you spawned him and killed him, nothing was stolen since no one owns mobs. While its 100% true according to Verants rules, we as players live by rules we set for ourselves. Those rules are based on things like courtesy. The lack of courtesy is what I and the others were ticked off about. You keep pointing out the loot, the mobs, and the camps, but you refuse to mention one thing about the lack of courtesy in the situation... why is that Palimax?<br>
<br>
"Nobody KS'd anyone. (With the possible exception of Yeugou attempting to KS Orontes by jumping in on mobs he was casting on.) Every mob Orontes STARTED cast on was standing alone and unengaged."<br>
<br>
Hold up there Palimax. You and Orontes decided it was ok to kill any mob you chose because of Verants rules stating no one owns mobs. If you are going to stand by Verants rules, then stand by all of them. Dont start adding your extra guidelines to them. Verants rules state flat out that mobs have to be agro on a person to "belong" to that person. Orontes was casting on mobs that were not agro on him. They would not be agro until his spell hit them, and you stated his spells killed them in one shot... so how could the mobs be agro on him? The mobs were agro and meleeing me when his spells landed. If you want to be technical pricks and say no one owns mobs, I can fight fire with fire and point out you were KSing according to Verants rules. Started casting on doesnt mean jack shit... I run for mobs all the time and lose them... does that mean since I started moving towards them that they are mine now? Am I supposed to use the assist command now to see if a caster has a mob targeted before I engage it? How was I supposed to know he wasnt gating out or buffing? Yeah I thought so.<br>
<br>
"What Yeugou leaves out is Orontes describing himself as an object of his dislike as well. Verant makes tradeskill players farm greens. I hate it. Orontes hates it.<br>
<br>
I didnt leave that out, I mentioned it several times including it being in the screenshots... where did you come up with me leaving it out?<br>
<br>
Since he hates himself its ok to push into camps then?<br>
<br>
"Orontes encounters an unengaged mob and kills it.<br>
Yeugou complains.<br>
Orontes leaves.<br>
~THEN~ The situation is discussed in OOC.<br>
Yeugou still not happy, brings the topic here."<br>
<br>
Wrong again. It was going on in the ooc while he was still there. As for me bringing it here, I can post the screenshots of you saying twice it would be ok to post it here, and once of Orontes saying the same thing... now you are changing your minds?<br>
<br>
"ORONTES LEFT THE GODDAMNED CAVES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS."<br>
<br>
And that means it was ok? Lets say we forget this ever happened... do you still believe in the future that its ok if he walks into those mines and start nuking whatever mobs he wants when there are people(s) already in there camping those mobs? What you need to get thru YOUR thick skull is I am not argueing about his actions, I am argueing about his lack of courtesy towards others in the game. There must be courtesy in these situations or you get what we had that day. Once again you are dodging the courtesy point.<br>
<br>
"Why is Yeugou taking screenshots of EVERYTHING? He starts taking screenshots before he's even talked to me."<br>
<br>
Why? To prove you are lying out your ass when the situation arises. I have already caught both you and Orontes in lies by having the screenshots. People like to say where are the logs or the screenshots around here... well I got them this time and now you are pissed? Hahahaha too funny. I actually started taking the screenshots after you stated you didnt care, its very easy to scroll back and screenshot.<br>
<br>
"Does he need proof that Burnine isn't going to lie to him? What the hell is this all about?"<br>
<br>
I was taking screenshots of the arguement that was going on in ooc mostly between Orontes and the others in the zone... does that bother you for some reason? Why would Burnine lie to me? Why would you imply that? Does it hurt your ego to know that I didnt know offhand that you were the one that had some sway over Orontes actions? Im sorry I dont memorize the leaders of every guild, Ill try and make a point of it next time so you dont get bruised.<br>
<br>
"He got everything he wanted except for us to see eye to eye. I see his point. I simply disagree. Nonetheless, we STILL backed off and gave him what he wanted. What more do you want?"<br>
<br>
What do I want? I want you and yours to extend courtesy to everyone else. People dont barge in on your camps, dont do it to them. Saying you didnt know we were camping them is no crutch to lean on since he could have shouted a camp check, or even stopped at me and the others and asked what are we camping. You say you see my point, but that doesnt mean this shit isnt gonna happen again in the future.<br>
<br>
"I, for one, pray those camps stop dropping gems so that people who want to work tradeskills can actually get what they need without dealing with the greedy people on the server."<br>
<br>
Huh? First of all, none of us where there for the gems. One or two were there for the xps, the others were there for the same reason as Orontes. The Ore. I had no idea any of the loot had any value to it until the next day when one of the others in the zone told me that two of the gems sold for 75 and 100pp. Even knowing that, I still didnt loot them, I let others loot them as I was there solely for the small pieces of acrylia. When I got my 94 pieces, I left. I havent been back since, tho I am still in the zone for other reasons now. Implying that I was there for the gems or that those gems are what led to this problem is lame, I can get coin much faster from farming frogs or guards in guk or neriak or even the huge grimling camps in hollowshade.<br>
<br>
"The situation was stupid, I asked Orontes to leave, he left."<br>
<br>
Is that what people complained about? No, they complained about your statements saying courtesy didnt need to be applied since no one owned mobs according to verant. Until you acknowledge that courtesy must be applied, the problem will still exist. Up to this point and most likely hereafter, I would never have barged in on a camp of yours, yet you seem to think you have the right to do it to me. That is the problem.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
XodaPara: "Where did you buy that lvl 60 char? 13s castingtime? On a green mob? Do wuzzards even GET a 13s casting time spell? 6-7.5 are the HUGE nukes in my experience  the 1200, 1875(?) and 2k."<br>
<br>
What does me being level 60 have to do with a wizards casting time? Your reasoning is amazingly stupid. I know almost nil about a wizard, so I looked up the spell he claimed he was using "Ice Spear of the Soloist" on EQCasters. It listed the casting time as 13 seconds and it seemed right since he did take a long time to cast each spell. So unless the casting time is shorter and EQCasters is wrong, please shut your fucking mouth and stop implying I bought my character from Ebay. I have been around since beta and if you care to dispute that, feel free to contact Verant and inform them of your wrong opinions on the matter.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Jexmann: "you should have stuck to the topic rather than sling personal insults"<br>
<br>
Actually I did stick to the topic, you decided to deviate from the topic in your 2nd post and compared me to a child. Until you decided to start slinging insults, I had no problem with you. Dont waggle your finger in my direction when you have only yourself to blame. Its ok tho, since I showed you to be wrong, your only recourse was for the insults, I understand, keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
----- <br>
<br>
And finally back to Grimveld. A small suggestion, dont bother. You would have more luck talking to a wall. These guys will never see the point of the people that dont agree with them. I just like to argue, so I continue. I am 100% self sufficient in the game so their threats make no difference to my posting style. I would feel better if ya didnt get yourself into trouble with these tards if you dont have to, since you never know when you may need their assistance. If however you do get into a bind and one of these pricks refuses to help you out because of agreeing with me, feel free to contact myself or any of my guildmates for the help you need.

<br>
As I read it this is what palimax actually said...correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
A camp that he would respect would be empty, as in you killed all the mobs &amp; are waiting for the next one to pop.  If your camp is full of mobs then you can't handle them all &amp; can afford to share.<br>
<br>
Personally I think this makes sense...I needed to kill kunark goblins the other week for faction &amp; went to the goblin fort in WW.  About half the goblins were dead &amp; the killer was nowhere to be found.  So I killed a few &amp; finally found thier killer medding.  Since he couldn't kill all the goblins before they started repopping it was no problem &amp; we shared.  When he left I took over the area &amp; got all the mobs popping in sequence so there was only one up at a time and I was constantly killing goblins.  If someone had wanted to enter the camp they would have nothing to kill.  THAT is camped.  If multiple mobs are up, you aren't killing em...unless this is a special camp where everything pops at the same time...that is not camped IMHO.<br>
<br>
Regardless, he left, who cares?<br>

<br>
You got courtesy Yeugou.  When confronted about your &quot;camp&quot;; when presented with you saying that you were camping them, Orontes left.  He had a large number of options available to him.  He chose the one that afforded you the most courtesy - he left you alone.  We've already demonstrated we respect people's camps, by leaving them alone when asked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Orontes killed mobs in the Grimling caves because you wern't killing anything when he showed up.  You were either unable to kill everything, or not active in doing so.  You keep trying to paint this like Orontes came into the zone, saw you killing mobs and then started nuking on your mobs to take them away from you.  HE KILLED A MOB THAT YOU WERN'T KILLING, AND WERN'T TRYING TO KILL.<br>
<br>
There's nothing to spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Orontes left the CAVES and remained in the zone for a while.  I've been pretty clear about that.  When I say Orontes left, I mean he left the caves.  Everytime that anyone says anything that isn't 100% with what you IMAGINE it means you start shouting LAIR! at the top of your lungs.  I made the mistake of thinking Asterisco was in your guild...  LIAR!   I say Orontes left, and you think I mean he ported away...  LAIR!  For god's sake, I haven't come to this board and told lies before; why would I start doing so now?<br>
<br>

Vision honored your camp.<br>
<br>
Let me say that again, with greater illustration this time, cause you're obviously too dense to get ANYTHING the first time.<br>
<br>
You didn't appear to be killing mobs in the Grimling caves in Tenebrous mountains -- evidenced by the fact that they were just standing there, at full heath, not attacking anything, so Orontes started killing them; then you complained, at which point Orontes went to a different part of the zone and discussed the issue in /ooc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Orontes did not extend any courtesy in this situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once you made claim to your camp, Orontes left.  Vision honored your camp.<br>
<br>
What great inconvenience did Orontes cause you?  What terrible lie are we perpetuating?  For the love of god, what did we do to you more than leave you alone when you asked us to?<br>
<br>
It's nearly comical.  You got your way, and then you came here to complain that you got your way.  We can't do anything more than comply with ALL of your requests.<br>
<br>
Pur your tin-foil hat back on and stay clear of the mind control lasers; they're obviously causing you to have some trouble with reality.<br>
<br>
...and let me drop the guildleader facade for a minute and say something on a personal level:<br>
<br>
QUIT WHINING THAT YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY.  YOU GOT YOUR WAY AND YOU'RE STILL CRYING LIKE MY ONE-YEAR OLD.  THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH KLEENEX IN THE WORLD FOR THE TEARS YOU'D HAVE IF ORONTES STAYED AT YOUR OH-SO-PRECIOUS GRIMLING GOLDMINE.<br>
<br>
Yeugou, in the future, please find another Vision officer to escalate your issues to, as you'll be the SECOND person in all of Everquest to join my permanant /ignore list.  Please direct your in-game requests to a more friendly officer... ...like Orontes. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

<br>
I agree.<br>
<br>
I'd also wager if Orontes was a level 50 Wizard in some no-name guild, as opposed to a 60 Wizard and a Vision officer, this thread would have never been started.<br>
<br>
The rebellious Gladiator-esque RAEG AGAINST TEH MACHIEN FUCK THE SYSTEM act really, really got old.  No, Vision isn't some sort of corrupted, evil guild, in which you need to inform the public of the 'real truth'.<br>
<br>
This is about farming greens.  Period.  What I see from this thread, Orontes walked into a green zone, sees another level 60 whacking greens, begins to kill and Yuegou's temper shot out through his mouth.  So, in turn, Orontes wasn't as courteous as to his demands.  Did you take screenshots of you first mentioning to Orontes that you were 'camping' that area?  I'll bet it wasn't filled with sunshine smiley faces, judging on previous .. disagreements I've seen concerning you and another player.<br>
<br>
Palimax, you're a pretty well-respected guildleader.  And, Yuegou, well, you have .. quite a mouth, but, I think you generally have your head on straight and you can be an okay guy.  I think you both really need to agree to disagree, and stop posting to such a damned pointless argument.  I'm sure neither parties intended to be malicious KSing assholes, and regardless, he left anyway. <p><table>
