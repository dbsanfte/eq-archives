I've been in the guild 3 months now, and when I joined, I told myself that if I felt that my rep was going to go down because of things we were doing as a guild, I would leave.  I havn't yet seen anything that people claim that ToV does (and yes, I am on alot).  <br><br>What I am seeing here is people have personal grudges against some ToV members, mainly a couple of officers, and so they hate the whole guild.  Then they inflict other people with their ideas, and sooner or later, people hate the guild who have absolutly no reason to.<br><br>Many times in guild chat we've been planning to take out a mob, but then another guild was gathering first and we're gone and done something else.<br><br>Personally, I try to keep my reputation good.  Now theres some who will say, if you want to keep your rep good, get out of ToV, but until I see something that convinces me of that, I'm happy where I am.  I joined ToV because I had always been in smaller guilds.  Kunark's Elite, Sanguine Crusaders, and The Imperial Order where the last three I was in.  In IO, the last raid I had been in before joining ToV had been 2 months earlier.  I wanted to be able to raid more, and have the chance to get better loot (I was arguably the worst equiped 58+ druid on the server when I joined ToV, and what good armor I did have, I earned myself).  And mainly, I wanted to see the higher level game.<br><br>I looked into some other guilds, but the only upper level one that I had realistic chances in getting into was ToV.<br><br>Anyway... my main point here is, if you don't have a justified reason for hateing ToV, why hate us?  If you hate a couple of the members, fine, whatever, good for you.  But what I hate seeing is when some of my guildmates can't get a group / rez / port because of their guild tag.  That just makes me sick people.  Why don't we just get right back into raceism.  If you've never had a bad expierence with THAT member, why hate them?  If they had been /anon you would have treated them just the same as everyone else, unless you're enough of a jerk to do a /guildstatus on someone you don't even know just to make sure they arn't in a certain guild that has a couple members that you don't like.<br><br>I've only ever hated 1 person in this game, and that was a bard named Cask.  But that was justified from my expierence with him.  I, however, didn't go on to hate his guild because of it, I only hated him.  I'm almost certain that no one on this server dislikes me, because, as I've said before, I try to stay on everyone's good side.<br><br> <p><center><b>Akom</b><br>60 Heirophant of Ayonae Ro<br>Member of Tides of Valor<br>Master Smith 177 -- Master Brewer 165<br>Master Fisherman 182 -- Master Tailor 168<br>Master Potter 165 -- Master Baker 135<br>Master Fletcher 176 -- Master Jeweler 165<br><IMG SRC="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~peq/ayonaero/ubb/uploads/Des.JPG"><br><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uothen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Othen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/28/02 1:17:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: never have i seen such foolishness</span><hr size=1> The few times ive grouped with ToV (being Kadainn, Vent, Ullric, Malone usually) they've all been nice to me, ullric was a jackass but I was LMAO.
