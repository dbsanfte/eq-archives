I thought you'd said he was well respected, not a loot hungry fella like you're implying now. From your log he  doesn't seem like the &quot;L3wtz plzkkthx&quot; type of person. <br>
<br>
Now even if someone's after loot -which in the end most are- i find it funny that you'd possibly deny someone a chance to roll on x loot after they had a hand in procuring it.<br>
<br>
You even say you didn't owe him any chance at the scale. Hell you didn't NEED him to kill it after all.<br>
<br>
I'm not complaining about how you distribute loot, i really don't give a damn. I just find it amusing that you value loot so highly as to say all that about not owing and not needing then preach about loot distribution )<br>
<br>
Mighty White, yessir.<br>
<br>
That'd be my response after seeing how thankful i should be for getting to roll on it- after all you don't owe me that much, and you didn't need lil ol me to kill him anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/upalimaxsceleris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palimax Sceleris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local Resident</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/14/02 10:13:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't hate you Blizz</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I thought you'd said he was well respected, not a loot hungry fella like you're implying now. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I said, &quot;respected-by-us,&quot; also, not &quot;well,&quot; although I won't split hairs.  I just dislike being misquoted.

...and I'm telling you that if someone in Vision is complaining about loot, then it's becuase they haven't taken an active role in working out their classes loot policies.  The MEMBERS of Vision make the loot policy, not me.  The officers arbitrate when people can't agree, but the MEMBERS make the policy.  Similarly, if they're complaining to you, they're NOT doing it to us.  Nobody in Vision has anybody to complain to about the quality of items that they're getting than THEMSELVES.<br>
<br>
I don't deny that some of Vision's members might be shopping for other gulids; and that it might be because of loot.  I'm just telling you that if they are, it's because they aren't trying to work with their class and with their guild to make the system better. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

You agree with this?<br>
<br>
Again, belittling someone's help, if they were 1 person in 3 or 1 in 100 is pretty screwy. <br>
<br>
What's worse is doing it again and again. Then you wonder how moronic i have to be to not understand that you didn't need someone's help and didn't owe that someone(who helped you) a chance at the reward for the endeavor(because of how little their help actually was).<br>

If I were that person, I would be alot less likely to help you in the future.<br>

<br>
As we saw it, we had three options.  (a)Tell him we didn't need his help, and kill it without him, thus ensuring that if he dropped a scale it would go to a warrior in Vision. (b)Tell him thanks for the info, you're welcome to assist us and in return you'll be given a MORE THAN FAIR chance at the scale, or (c)Tell him he can help, but he's not getting a shot at the scale.<br>
<br>
We choose (b) because Allamar agreed with me that it was the right thing to do.  How many other guilds would have chosen (a) or (c)?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *edit* fixed my (a/b) thing because Membryane pointed out I'm sleepy.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A question for every guildleader here:  If your guild had the power to kill Severlous without the assistance of one warrior from Vision, would they have given one warrior in Vision an 11% chance at the scale for telling you something you already knew, and helping you do something you could do without him?<br>
<br>
What you don't seem to understand is that we ~LET~ him help.  His guild wasn't in a position to do it, and ours was.  We did him a favor, not the other way around.<br>
<br>
28 members of Vision (or so my last /who showed), roughly one group of assorted friends, and one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;somewhat well-equipped bard&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from EW killed the Dragon.  When it died, it dropped one of the most valuable traded items in the game (ask Arbok what the current offer for his Green Dragonscale is), and we gave him a better chance at it than most warriors on this server will EVER see.<br>
<br>
Since Arbok's consideres the Green Scale a trade item, there must be at least one guild on the server that would have assumed a FAIR shot at it would have been 30-to-1, not 9-1.  (I'm not picking on Arbok, I'm just demonstrating that the scale is worth 200k to a monk, just as much as it is to a warrior.)<br>
<br>
You're right.  We're bad bad men and we did a terrible thing for a terrible reason. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

I will be the first to tell you loot is my one of my favorite and one of my least favorite aspects of this game. I love getting a new shiny trinket. I hate it when as a guild we have decide who is deserving of said shiny trinket. My dream is that we all will get the shiny trinket one day.  I go to the Halls of Testing every Wed (and sometimes on spur of the moment raids) in hopes of getting my fellow clerics closer to completing a set of armor. I will not truly enjoy my armor until I can share that joy with the rest of them.<br>
<br>
Vision has never come close to disbanding, tempers have flared. People have left. People have come back and left again. Some people have left, asked to come back and we tell them no. The thing that binds us the most is we respect each other.  <p><HTML><BODY>

Problem with this enlies in situations like this:<br>
<br>
Guild raids uhh, some random dragon.<br>
<br>
RBG drops.  WarriorA, who has been a longtime member of the guild, who has attended many, many dragon raids and has lost all of the rolls, is still in an FBSS.  WarriorB, who is wearing Some_No_Drop_Uber_Haste_Item_1%_less_haste_than_RBG, has only been in the guild one week, and rarely attends raids.  They both roll.  WarriorA loses to WarriorB.<br>
<br>
A few days later, WarriorB has quit the guild and is seen auctioning the RBG in EC.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story:  Open roll sucks.  The only thing you are achieving by advocating this way of deciding loot is making yourself look like a loot whore.<br>
<br>
However, I am a skeptic of the system Vision uses.  I do think there are better ways to handle loot than to have it decided between one person or a group of people.  Just too many issues such as favoritism, or a certain class officer not being online at the time, and there's no possible way these people are going to know every single member of the guild well.  But, it is still a much better system than others, and the majority of the members of Vision feel that it works for them just fine.  I imagine most members of Vision trust their officers with this power, and feel that they will make good decisions.<br>
<br>
This system, as well as the 'point system' benefit the guild much as a whole.  The point system especially, makes sure that items go to a person who is definitely going to put it to use the most.  If you're often going to raids, you're going to get a lot of points towards loot.  It's not very good handing a Paladin a CoF who only logs in once a month, as he's not going to put it to much use.  Additionally, it encourages members to attend raids in which they have no shot at loot, such as a Wizard at a guild raid for the first floor of PoH:  nothing drops for them there (I think).  However, rather than possibly being bored, they know they can get points for attending this raid.<br>
<br>
However, bottom line:  If you don't like the loot rules, you don't have to join Vision.  It seems to work for Vision just fine.<br>
<br>
Oh, and bottom line#2:<br>

<br>
We've tested a point system for the guild as a whole, and we've found, overall, that it didn't work for us.  From time to a time a member suggets it, and when presented with the reasons it didn't work for us last time, they're generally unable to make it work for us.<br>
<br>
OTOH, there are some individual spawns that drop multi-class loot that we are experimenting with specific &quot;scorekeeping&quot; systems.  We use a by class point total for Scout Charisa, and thusfar, it works well.  Every time a member of your class attends a kill, that class scores a point, and when your class it on top of the list, your class loots it and loses a group's worth of points.  We still think it's fairer than individual point keeping for the spawn, and it's settled all discussion about who's turn it was to hand the item in or loot the reward.  [The wizards are, of course, secretly plotting to take the next four or five loots and make robes out of spite...]  We've never yet had a problem where the clerics (or any other class) in attendance couldn't decide which one of them should get the item, or disgruntled clerics getting upset that their points get &quot;spent&quot; while they're offline.<br>
<br>
Every system has flaws.<br>

(Ok, others are pointing out that our policies aren't working out for us, but again, I submit, if there is an upset minority shopping new guilds because our loot policy stinks, then it's because they're not working to make it a better system; probably because they're too busy looking for new guilds.) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4868>Palimax Sceleris</a>,

Almost as stupid, to me, as having to stop to think about whether or not someone deserves a chance at something they helped to get. <br>

Of course he deserved a chance....  ...once we decided to let him help.  Considering Serv being up wasn't exactly news, and we didn't exactly need him*, why do you think he deserved to be included in the raid?<br>
<br>
Allamar and my decision was, in short, if we should allow him to help us or not, because if we did, we'd feel obligated to give him a shot at the scale...  ...which we did.  I'm sorry that I didn't make it crystal f'n clear for you before; but at the time I was trying to demonstrate that &quot;winning a roll&quot; on a multi-guild raid, often didn't mean YOU were getting an item.<br>

<br>
First off, on that said example of the ranger at the VS raid.  You never mentioned that his person was on probation in our guild.  Our probation loot rules are very strict.  The said ranger was told he might have to give up the legs because of this.  After the ranger class leader and the officers were consulted (yes ALL of us), we also termined it was a pick up group, not a full guild raid, and that is why this ranger wears them.<br>
<br>
Next, how did the Sev killing thing get started?  If the warrior who provided the information to us, asked to help, and asked for a fair shot at the scale didnt like the situation, then its between him and us.  Oh and he almost got the thing too.<br>
<br>
Ullric.  Thank you for leaving my name out of your post of being kicked out of Vision.  I am the bitch behind the men of this guild, and sometimes it shows too well.  We, Ullric and I, have put the incident aside and do converse from time to time.  The evidence of mature adults.<br>
<br>
As for Vision ever breaking up?  You will never see me in another guild.  I'm sure you all have nice guilds, but I will quit the game and delete my character.  Vision is my home, my family, my friends.  People will come and go, most likely those who didnt quite fit in the family, or those who just dont grasp the family atmosphere.
