This includes tanking in multicamps where we took Disco 1, Disco 2 and Brogg's Lab. I've tanked for Necro/Guard camps where Gang was open, so I started pulling from there too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yet in a recent group, the group didn't want to do anything besides sit at the zone just because the only melee in the group was a ranger. It didn't matter that the ranger in question did it before.<br>
<br>
It got annoying to the point that I was willing to contact some guildies that had a L54 warrior and see about doing a trade. Guidies would have rather have had me, and I'm sure the uber doodz I was grouped with would have prefered a L54 warrior in crafted mostly wielding inferior weaponry. Didn't get any response out of the group - they probably didn't think I was serious on it.<br>
<br>
Even after Necro/Guard opened and we took it, the group was freakish about me pulling anything out of some paranoia of rangers tanking.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just for the uber kewl uber doodz out there, it is ok to let the ranger tank at times. Especially if they've tanked that camp before. It definately beats sitting on your ass waiting for a warrior, paladin or shadow knight to show up.<br>

Don't you know that every group must Must MUST have a warrior, a cleric and a enchanter?! Always always ALWAYS.<br>
<br>
Seriously, this whole &quot;must have this and must have that&quot; mentality really pisses me off. One of my best groups in Sebilis was when the whiney enchanter had gated out and we replaved him with a level 55 necro. Hell, I have been in good groups with no warrior/sk/paladin, no cleric AND no enchanter. I have even been in good dungeon groups where my PET was main tank. Yes, dungeon groups. You heard me.<br>
<br>
It might be so that a &quot;real&quot; tank is needed for the fungi king camp, but I wouldn't bet on it. The only camp in Sebilis I know need a warrior is trakanon himself...<br>
<br>
Oups, never mind. People (includning me) have been killing Trak since before Velious was released, surely he can be killed without main tank tactics. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

Ok, there are always exceptions to the rule in that if you only have a level 52 cleric down there and ranger maintanking, your cleric could start having mana issues, but there is no reason why any hybrid cant tank most, if not all the camps in seb.<br>
<br>
Recently i have been having some of the most fun i have ever had in EQ seeing what just me and a good Shaman friend can do. As a duo we have done lower kobolds in Velks, Most of the seb camps (made it to chef with just us two and an extra ranger) and a load of other psycho stuff. Once people cant rely on &quot;safe&quot; xping, the fun of dungeon crawling really begins. <br>
<br>
My suggestion is try to find someone who is on at roughly the same times as you who you get along well with or even a group - dont worry about the group makeup (so long as you have some healing ability) and go and have fun - after all that is what this game is about, not sitting on your arse for 3 hours while you wait for random_enchanter_00 / random_cleric_01 / Random_warrior_13 to come along.<br>

<br>
In uberquest you only need one of each buff/utility class, and a ton of wars, rogues and clerics. Banespells and trueshot gave lvl 60 wizards and 55+ rangers a useful role, but that didn´t change much. As long as the game is focused on uberquest, rangers are not supposed to tank. Necros are manafeeders and DMF. Magicians are CoTH, preferably on opposite faction. And so on.<br>
Perhaps a ranger or even Edeinas pet can tank frogs in Sebilis, but people will still want a warrior. He does the job better, and everyone knows the Big Guild has warriors tanking everything.<br>
<br>
Trakanon is outdated just like the rest of Sebilis. On 32k mobs who needs a main tank? It´s just a matter of killing the mofo before the second AoE. Velious -&gt; increased HP -&gt; more power to the three key classes.<br>
Maybe, if Verant decided to create let´s say 20k mobs with some insane spells, there would become a shift in the balance between classes in uberquest. But 20k mobs could be zerged, if you had enough of...the three key classes. So that won´t happend.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, the prejudice about classes is based on the high end game. That´s where people are aiming. Therefor they want a warrior, even in Sebilis. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uzangal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zangal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/6/01 6:39:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=563.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More Grouping W/ Weirdos Fun</span><hr size=1> Look for me...<br>

Lots in CB know of my penchant for forming &quot;gimp&quot; groups in seb.<br>
<br>
The point is I hate sitting at zone, so I just start spam inviting everyone I see. Once I have 6 its time to move down and we crawl till we find a camp.<br>
<br>
Last group was 2 nights ago...had a 57 necro and 59 chanter with me and we zoned in. First thing we see is 52 druid and 52 shaman looking for more so I gank them, we figure a melee is needed so I see someone with knives and we get a high rogue.<br>
<br>
Time elapsed since zoning in: 2 mins<br>
<br>
Head to first bridge, we'll go check Gang...we're breaking into it when a group calling Bar slowly moves by us, cleric, chanter, warrior, wiz, rogue, monk.<br>
<br>
We get into gang and clear it within 15 mins I think, move out to look for more to pull and ack!, the bar group is just one hallway down so far. After a while they take the long way to bar so we head to pre-chef just to pull stuff.<br>
I peer into chef and get 3, we dispatch em...hmm, we can move into chef, woot!<br>
<br>
Which we do and stayed there for like 2 hours with me pulling and clericing. I'm a druid tho.<br>
<br>
It was a blast and everyone was in disbelief that we were doing what we did (having a chanter helped hehe, but coulda managed with necro mez)<br>

<br>
That said.  I would rather group with people I know are good at their class.  No matter what class that is.  Some of the best groups I have ever been in have been made up of supposedly impossible combinations.  I dont believe there is such a thing.  Let's take what we can get and go.<br>
<br>
I really do prefer not to be the sole tank in any group, cause the casters get nuke happy (from being bored dont ya know) and start pulling the mob all over.  Which then makes me have to run all over (it is nearly impossible to taunt when none of your hits are hitting cause your chasing the farging mob all over the floor you diptwit casters), and then listen to them bitch cause they are taking damage.  And whining that &quot;the tank is supposed to taunt DAMN IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Its just like Noah told the rabbits on the ark... Only two, Only two.  Cause 3 nukes REALLY pisses off the mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And if I have to give lessons in &quot;Agro Management 101&quot; to one more set of casters, cause they get bored, I am going to scream.<br>
<br>
We have come up with the 10 second rule lately.  This is a last resort to Febby telling Thistle &quot;we are leaving NOW&quot;, and to heck with the group.  The ten second rule goes like this.  If you refuse to manage your agro, you have to count to 10 SLOWLY, before you can cast ANYTHING, or Feb is out of here.  *sigh*  God I HATE being a warrior sometimes. <p><i><h6>Febreeza Tinytank - Level  56  Myrmidon<BR>

Most ppl want a WAR because tanking is what we do best, what we are made to do (to bad we cant taunt like a ranger can). One well balanced group can do just about anything in Seb. So hence the want for a real tank. Rangers add a bunch to the group makeup, and work great as a secondary tank if things go bad. Yet they are just not as effective as a war, and throw in /defen dis and there is no comparison. Yet if i had to chose from sitting around to haveing a rng tank, I would take the ranger hands down. Thank god i play a war though, ranger tank = /shiv.<br>

there was a shortage of tanks that day and people were filtering in and out. we were up at CE and i was astounded at how well that rogue was tanking. I was slowing and regenning the rogue, healing when need be. the mage had her rogue pet up so it was dishing out some hurt from behind. the chanter was almost chain stunning so the rogue could go behind and toss in a backstab every once in a while.<br>

we killed almost non stop for a while. and of course we had fun :) <br>

I havent had the chance to test the new damage + to 2hs weapons but hope that area has been improved. (to bad i will have to max 2h skills) At the moment I use frostbringer in main, and defiance in off. Some tell me that i would be better off with faster weapon in main, but i find that the proc off the frostbringer allows for taunt to be more effective, even when resited.<br>

<br>
Im sure that´s true. However, the normal group situation is just a small step on the way to lvl 60 and uberquest, where the tanks are warriors, and nothing but warriors. I´ve enjoyed many raids where a hybrid stood at the front, but if there´s a choice between two equally good players applying for the guild, one being a key class and one that is not...<br>
Same applies when the ranger and warrior at zone both have LFG tags. Who will be grouped first?<br>
<br>
It´s relevant to talk about all the great hybrids we know, or the fun we had in that group with less-then-perfect setup. But that &quot;perfect&quot; group still exist, and determin how classes are being treated and looked upon.<br>

<br>
And that would really depend on what the groups that are looking for people want - a tank or a damage dealer, if they want a tank of course the Warrior will get a group faster, if they want a damage dealer they'd be stupid if they picked the warrior.<br>
<br>
Passed 55 and with epics it's easy as hell to get a group as a ranger. <p><IMG SRC="http://user.tninet.se/~mhf993y/anna/sig.jpg">
