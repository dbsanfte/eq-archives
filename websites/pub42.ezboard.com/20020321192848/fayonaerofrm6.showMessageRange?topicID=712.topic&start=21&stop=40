You guys are replacing one dictatorship with another. <br>
It's conveniant how everyone forgets that the masacres and civil wars a while ago were DUE to the northern alliance not being able to decide how to distribute the land and so fighting and killing a lot and lot of innocent people.&quot;<br>
<br>
And that is why we arent replacing the Taliban with the NA.  In fact, we arent replacing the Taliban with anyone.  The Afghans are doing that.  Thats why all those religious leaders are trying to hash out a way for them to set up a representitive government that would be more fair to the various factions.  <br>
<br>
Halo, you brought up the IRA, I think that opened the field for responses about Britain... And no, I dont think the US will start attacking the IRA because they havent attacked the United States... its pretty much Britains job to resolve that issue.  But it DOES bring up an interesting point... If private US citizens send funds to the IRA, should the British government be able to prosecute them for assisting the terrorists?<br>
<br>
You know... i just kinda realized that whenever we start discussing things like this, I almost always end up disputing something Halo writes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I dont want you to take that personally, Halo... its just that you usually make fairly direct statements and you write well... which makes it easier for me to argue against what you are saying. Its hard for me to debate with Taino, on the other hand, because he uses run-on sentences like no one I have ever seen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And I will not do this. We talked the topic dead a long time ago.<br>
Taliban has been defeated, Al Qaida is fleeing, that IS a good part of it. <br>
All other things I will not judge nor comment. As said, it been talked to the end and back.<br>

All I say is IF you do all what you do, IF you say every terrorist deserves dead, IF you kill them all and rid the world of them, then ALSO kill this man immediately, else you los ethe last bit of trust you had form all other countries about your word.<br>

P.S. With YOU I once again mean Bush and his actions. Not the common US guy /hint hint Grevenil. And also /hint hint Grevenil. I did never judge the US in my post, nor say (lol I would NEVER do that) that my country is better or superior to yours, we just don't talk about Switzerland here atm, do we?

There is no chance in hell he can be convicted of Treason.  The standards are REALLY high.  Sedition maybe, but a good defense lawyer could get him out of that.<br>
<br>
Milk him for information and then extradite him to the newly formed goverment of afghanistan for trial.  I'm sure they are going to be jailing/hanging any number of foreign taliban soldiers as terrorists, war criminals, etc.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think he can be convicted of breaking any US laws.  I'm sure he did, but I don't think he can be convicted unless he confesses to something.  He can't be tried in the military tribunals President Jr. created because he's a citizen so 'we know damn well he did it even if the proof isn't there' isn't good enough.  The defense is simple, &quot;Once I heard about the the US forces moving in on the Taliban I couldn't leave.  I had a gun in prison to defend my life from Northern Alliance troops.  I never took any action against US troops or the US government.&quot;  So if we can't get him here I'm hoping that there are some nice, established processes that the new Govt. of Afghanistan has to prosecute foreign soldiers.<br>

As said by you your holyness:<br>
<br>
<br>
The only reason why you think the whole world is surrounded by America (and its products and so on), is because you are too ignorants to see anything else.<br>
<br>
Just because you wear a T-Shirt that you bought in an american store doesn't mean that T-Shirts are an American thingie.<br>
<br>
You simply have a BIG country. and the casual american is too ignorant to even accept that there's anything else then your own holy ocuntry. <br>
BUt this does not mean that the rest of the world is either<br>
a) crap<br>
b) not existant<br>
c) not worthy<br>
d) copying your stuff<br>
e) supposed to be thankful because you deliver Coca-Cola to them.<br>

i might to add that the leader and most of the officers of the Northern alliance are known for years to raise money from drugtrades , all their weapons financed by heroin and opium.afghanistan is the biggest producer of opium and heroin worldwide.so i guess the united states will have a couple junkies coming home from afghanistan soon(remember vietnam?).  the funny thing is now is junior bush fighting together with his former &quot;War-on-drugs&quot;-opponents of his father.  btw do you remember the outcome of the &quot;war-on-drugs&quot;, looks pretty much to me like that &quot;war-against-terror&quot; campaign , fight an invisble opponent and enlarge the influence of the United states to protect their buissnessinterestest.<br>
<br>
the whole area around afghanistan is very rich of natural resources  like oil,gas,coal. and the taliban regime was installed around 5 years ago by the pakistan  secret service with help from the cia too.  their maingoal was to setup an oilpipeline in 1998  from the middelasian republics to pakistan.<br>
2  big oilcompanys tried to work out a contract with the former taleban leader mullah omar. one of the companys was the us-company carcoil (?sp)  and a venezulan-argentinian company. since taleban wanted more than just money for their country, they wanted new schools,streets, new infrastructure , the deal never happened.<br>

With America's new tight and strict policy on war against terrorism (No, Stymp, the policy wasn't war against terrorist's who've attacked American), would America then find it acceptable if we attack you guys for harboring people who fund the IRA?<br>
Please leave out the 12yr old comments like 'But we have nukes kkthx and we will kick yer ass!'<br>
Serious question to all those in favour of American's waging war on terrorism. <br>
It's logical. You harbour people who fund the IRA, the IRA attack us constantly. The IRA are terrorists.<br>

This means that in my post I did today, I did not judge the US.<br>
Which, mind you, is true.<br>
<br>
I kept pointing out to WHO I point this post at and that I do not judge your whole country with it.<br>
<br>
I do not know why you feel the need to dig out 2 months old posts now to bring up completely unrelated quotes and use them to your favor. However, the post you quoted was a direct answer to Lleauaric where, yes, we indeed talked about the US in general, but mostly about his opinion. <br>
<br>
However, the topic THERE was the US in general, and I added my opinion about MANY (but, mind you, not all) US citizens. <br>
If you wish not to read about my humble opinion, please refrain to read it. If you wish to talk about my country and comment on it, feel free to do so. <br>
This is a forum where people share opinions. If you can't handle the fact that I am not as delighted about your country then you are, please refrain from reading it. <br>
<br>
But most important is, the post and discussion you digged out there has been discussed to the end and back. I see no need nor motivation to continue it. <br>
The post I made was pointed at the related topic and it is my opinion about it. Unfortunately the topic is the US Government and their action concerning a US person fighting for the Taliban. I have an opinion about it and posted it as all others did. <br>
I never judged the US in general nor insulted your country. I only stated how I would expect the US (mainly Mr Bush) handle this case so it is in any way acceptable and not in contradiction to what Mr Bush has been preaching so far. <br>
<br>
Please point out where in my todays post I have been talking bad about your country in general. If you can't do so, please refrain from attacking me on the base of 2 month old posts with a completely unrelated topic. <br>
<br>
And again, if you wish not to read and know about my opinion, refrain from reading this forum - as this forum is here for people to shre their opinions.  <p><center><A href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/taino.jpg" border=0 alt="Send me a Mail"></a><br><FONT color=#ffffff

Halo... morally, you might be correct.  Citizens of the United States who financially support the IRA could be considered terrorists supporters and therefore you might have a reason to attack them.  The difference is the US asked (or told, however you want to read it) the Taliban to turn over bin Laden so he could be tried... and as far as i know, Great Britain has never asked for US support in finding US citizens who support the IRA.  Also, we have the ability to successfully attack the Taliban, whereas Great Britain does not have the capability to successfully attack the US. <br>

<br>
I hope the Bristish government DOES make this request.  If President Jr. gets it right then the IRA loses money &amp; that's a good thing.  If he bungles it then we have a better shot of someone competent in charge &amp; that's also a good thing IMHO.<br>

And Stympt, I knew that you would say exactly that 'and could if the british had the power to take over the usa, which american does to the taliban' (or to that affect).<br>
That completely negates the logical excuse America is giving for attacking afganistan.<br>
So you're saying only countries with the power to attack other countries can stand up to terrorism?? Not, all terrorism should be dealt with. Just, whoever has the nukes can get away with it. <p>Halo 56th Beguiler<br>

<br>
1. They need evidence of him fighting to try him for treason. If they had it *which they really don't* he would most likely get prison time/life. He didn't kill anyone after all (no deaths by the time he was captured I believe *shrug*). BUT since they have no evidence they cant do shit for him and he already has a lawyer<br>
<br>
2. Americans are dumb (I live in America, yes, but I am not American born). They should grill him and get as much info as possible and he &quot;will escape&quot; and get &quot;captured&quot; by the Northern Alliance who kill him on the spot.<br>
<br>
3. Dont flame me on the dumb Americans, its true. They &quot;fought longside the Afghans&quot; during the 1970s up to the 1980. All they really did was arm people like O(U?)sama bin Laden and his goons against the Russians who wanted to stop the Fundamentalists and get rid of religion there. The Russians weren't great people of course but they had the right idea. Oppression is the only way to stop crap like this. Either way, as soon as Russia said &quot;lets be Democratic&quot; and leave Afghans alone (Gorbachov), America left too. Now look at America, they are fighting the people they supplied. They even payed millions to the Taliban in MARCH of 2001 to get rid of Opium (which the Taliban did very well, no sarcasism intended). I'm not saying all Americans are dumb, but it's a pretty easy generalization. A lot of countries consider American education weak and substandard. I am a hybrid of real education and American education. I can tell you from personal experience, American school is a joke.<br>
<br>
4. I wan't to hear what you all think (that is, after my post because I am a product of an American education and am too lazy to read all your posts)<br>
<br>

The SOB was captured in an enemy armor under Arms.<br>
<br>
If you had ever served a day in a Military you would know that that makes him a traitor.  You would never soil yourself in fighting or protecting freedom you are the type that will just freeload on the blood of the American People who have.  Every male in our family from the time we arrived (1824) has served our country.  The only reason that you can spout your bullshit now in freedom, because people like my Grandfather and Great Grandfather fought and died for what is right ( WWI and WWII ).  Our family thru the years has 7 Medal of Honor Holders.  I have a pretty good Idea what honor means and this SOB is a traitor to be stood up against a wall and shot!  <br>
<br>
If you consider Americans dumb and Live here, YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT and go back to what ever rock you crawled out from under.<br>
<br>
You are one of the reasons I am begining to feel we need to close our borders and no longer allow people to come here and goto school.  Yeah our system is so weak that the best minds from most nations come here for advanced degrees.<br>
<br>
Americans are tired of this crap from everyone.  If you don't like us DON'T CASH THAT AID CHECK! THAT COMES OUT OF MY WALLET!<br>
<br>
If you are a citizen of the USA and pay taxes you have a right to bitch, if you aren't STFU and bitch on a BB that is in your country. <p>Conaddor Trueheart<BR>
