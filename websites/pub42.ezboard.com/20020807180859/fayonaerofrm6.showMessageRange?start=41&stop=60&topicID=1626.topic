Since I'm not a God in this universe(I'm a lowly board poster instead. Some vacation, fucking nth dimensional travel agents...), I'm interested in which program you are in Ralph. I think I can handle the math and concepts well enough, I just write at the third grade level.<br>
<br>
Since there is little to no writing involved in most PhD programs(especially yours, notice my interest), your school sounds perfect for me.<br>
<br>
You probably prefer to write in binary like I do, correct? What else are you going to do with all that brain power and pointy hair? Feel free to go ahead and do that, we'd understand it better than these failed attempts at The Common English.<br>

Way to go dumb ass you refer to my previous posts as third grade level writing, then in the same post go on to say they are failed attempts at communication. You knock my writing on an everquest messageboard while in your posts you flagrantly display lack of knowledge of which letters should be capitalized.<br>
<br>
Since that is a subjective term ( communication) , I'll assume that you are to fucking stupid to comprehend anything above a second grade level,in which case I would like to take this time to express my fondest wish that a homeless man beats you silly, shits in your mouth, and forces you to be the cum dumpster for whatever pet he is residing with. <br>
<br>
I'd like you to see you apply to ANY high energy physics graduate program in the country or in the world ; the thing is, I know it's not just a lack of a highschool diploma thats keeping you from academic or any real success. However before I go down that road let me just point out, that I said I am getting a degree in Physics. More specifically high energy physics ( conformal field theory ) No doubt you interpreted this to my saying &quot; I am getting my PhD in understanding binary code &quot; why again the third grade complexity of my writing must have confused you. <br>
<br>
Your binary instruction does not really make sense anyway. The MSB's ( do you know what the fuck that is ) are conflicting on a few lines ( if you are using assembly if you are not then you just cut and pasted it.)<br>
<br>
You want to know which PhD program I am at fag? Here's a clue that someone like you with SUCH a big brain and SUCH vast knowledge of mathematics should be able to figure out in no time. <br>
<br>
Based on a conformal group that is the subgroup of coordinate transformations that leave the metric invariant up to a scale change:<br>
<br>
<br>
gmv(x)-&gt; g'mv(x')=Щ(x)gmv(x)<br>
<br>
these are consequently the coordinate transformations that presever over angle v*w/V^2/w^2)1/2<br>
<br>
so therefore<br>
<br>
gmdx^Mmx^v= ds^2-&gt;ds^2 2мех )dx^м dx^v under x^м + Е [(this is the symbolf for epsilon not the unsigned integral)} x^ + Ем<br>
<br>
<br>
Figure the rest of the formula out, and it gives the first three letters of my school. <br>
<br>
Handling the math and concepts well so far shit for brains? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now obtain a Minkowski plane by first making the conformal transformation from the z plane ( of course )<br>
<br>
and obtain an equation of conformal invariance in d-dй ,<br>
d=p+q<br>
<br>
jacobian |2x^1| = 1<br>
------ ---<br>
2x sqrt деф g^1mv(x^1)= Щ (x)gmv(x) <br>
<br>
The constant coordinate transformations, between two vectors should give out the rest.Grasping the <br>
<br>
Here are some tips, no, this is not algebra you are beyond stupid if you try and use any algebraic rules to solve this , yes those funny letters mean something,putting this in mathmatica ( you do know what that is don't you ? ) won't help you except to solve the integrals which you will need to come up with beforehand. Next time you think of flaunting whatever mundane esoteric knowledge you might try and trick us into believing you have, to those of us who futhered our education past a GED you are one dumb motherfucker. <br>

Great, so you can't even make your own emulator? You have to rip pictures from a site with such great thinkers as Ariak ? How much did you pay for or should I say did your parents pay for  Caligulla, not including the name change? Don't tell me to get a life when you have two e-bayed toons running around norrath. Fucking loser you payed money for pixels. <br>
<br>
Would you like to buy a piece of the Brooklyn bridge too dumbass? <br>
<br>
Also is tunak your lifepartner ? Why do you post for it? Is it because you are the same person ? Are you Ariak by the way? If so fuck off and die.<br>
<br>
<br>
Khoree- <br>
You're  jealous. Reread everything that was posted here so as to get a fucking clue. With such an ignorant reply I'll just assume you go through life hating people that are better off than you. I feel sad for you. <br>
<br>
Now,The next time your Ks'd or someone is spamming the zone with racists obscenities or some such....try training them. I remember a long time ago this toon named Ghallunt kept refering to another player as a "jigaboo" at the sarnak fort. I don't take kindly to racism, and I sure as fuck don't pay 12 and change a month to listen to the same idiots that an AOL chatroom could have provided me with. <br>
<br>
So, I brought over 10 sarnaks and they beat the crap out of him it was hilarious to see him get whacked run around in a circle and then try and fight them and then walk away as they killed him. Then on his CR I brought the Gobbys. They mowed him down as he was looting it was quite funny. Funnier still was when he threatned to murder me in a tell and I repsonded with an air of abject fear that I would give him 1000pp ( a fair amount at the time) if he would spare my life. He agreed and I told him to meet me in front of cabalis. <br>
<br>
Seeing people run around like a chicken without a head, and then  dropping one by one is funny. Especially if you feel wronged by them, it provides a huge feeling of vindication. Remember this is a video game, how else do you expect to get revenge on someone, and why should it be malacious?<br>

Nice reply, exactly the kind of response I would have expected from someone who wrote a check with their mouth that their ass couldn't cash. Go back to cybering Greater Kolbolds in Sol B and studying communications at whatever correspondence college you go to. Remember kid A witty saying proves nothing.<br>

No, it's not off of any website, I created the equation myself so it would spell out something. EZboard interpreted C&P symbols from mathmatica as the unicode you see ( save the lines they refused to be pasted ). I am sure if you put them in mathmatica which you would need to solve this problem, everything should be fine.<br>

Glad Palarran helped you out, but let me point out something in addition to that glaring error. By using the function to point out me + math gets the value of gay, you would also be gay having used mathematics to prove and write this. So either your trying to be clever in coming out, or your propositioning me, in which case the answer is no. Being a Paladin though, I ain't mad at ya, it's the best class in EQ.<br>

Great, so you can't even make your own emulator? You have to rip pictures from a site with such great thinkers as Ariak ? How much did you pay for or should I say did your parents pay for  Caligulla, not including the name change? Don't tell me to get a life when you have two e-bayed toons running around norrath. Fucking loser you payed money for pixels. <br>
<br>
Would you like to buy a piece of the Brooklyn bridge too dumbass? <br>
<br>
Also is tunak your lifepartner ? Why do you post for it? Is it because you are the same person ? Are you Ariak by the way? If so fuck off and die.<br>
<br>
<br>

You're  jealous. Reread everything that was posted here so as to get a fucking clue. With such an ignorant reply I'll just assume you go through life hating people that are better off than you. I feel sad for you. <br>
<br>
Now,The next time your Ks'd or someone is spamming the zone with racists obscenities or some such....try training them. I remember a long time ago this toon named Ghallunt kept refering to another player as a "jigaboo" at the sarnak fort. I don't take kindly to racism, and I sure as fuck don't pay 12 and change a month to listen to the same idiots that an AOL chatroom could have provided me with. <br>
<br>
So, I brought over 10 sarnaks and they beat the crap out of him it was hilarious to see him get whacked run around in a circle and then try and fight them and then walk away as they killed him. Then on his CR I brought the Gobbys. They mowed him down as he was looting it was quite funny. Funnier still was when he threatned to murder me in a tell and I repsonded with an air of abject fear that I would give him 1000pp ( a fair amount at the time) if he would spare my life.

Whether I sold my chars &amp; retired or if I bought them and am playing them new, or if my brother and his friends are playing them, or if have played them from day one and continue to now, or if I run an emulator server, or if I just log in and play on one, or if I just read the emulator forums  is really none of your business and is speculation on your part, and certainly something I will not comment on a public forum.<br>
<br>
Why don't you say who you are?  Or even better give us your home address so we can come beat the crap out of you.    Never mind naturally all we would find is some shriveled up angry little nerd freak, jacking off and muttering little hate chants from the latest rip off heavy metal band.    It is hard to believe someone who writes as childishly, and has as much time to spam message boards, and play EQ as you do is working on a PHD,  then again a PHD can be just about anything, and take years if the student wants to use it as a life excuse.  I have an MBA from Boston University School of Management and have never met someone as mentally crippled as you in the academic world so I doubt you are telling the truth on that score either.   Luckly I am not a mathematician or I would show that your little formulas were just crap babble that you cut and pasted from somewhere.<br>
<br>
Funny how you mention how much you hate racism but then attack gays, not that I have very much sympathy for them but a least I am not a lying, anonymous, hypocrite like yourself.<br>
<br>
You are someone with no life and no future, hated and abused by everyone he comes in contact with.   Pushed to the internet as his last corner of refuge.   The last place you can get attention, do you have a single friend in EQ or anywhere for that matter?  Ask yourself this.<br>
<br>
Is it your Mom? or Dad that has created this sad state in you physiological makeup or both?  or maybe they did their best and are ok but yet you just kind of well never worked quite right...   Where you shit instead of born?  Did they think of flushing you from day one?  or do they wish they had now?<br>
<br>
You really should seek deep physiological counseling and seek help.  We cannot provide you with the support you need here.  This is just a little EQ forum, a place to yak about a computer game.<br>
<br>
Hate filled little excuse for a life,  get out of the shadows little dork and deal with it.  Step away from the PC your not welcome here either.  Its a shame you failed at EQ too but we can't help that here.<br>
