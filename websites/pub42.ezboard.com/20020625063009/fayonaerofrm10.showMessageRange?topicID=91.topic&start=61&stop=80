One question:<br>
I have heared rumors other servers had fights already, I also have heared other servers had Tunare being summoned and everything.<br>
<br>
If you have info please do post them here since they are absolutely critical info for us!<br>
I have not been able to find out anything so far (ooc: and I am honestly absolutely stressed in RL which means I can't spend hours and hours in research at this very moment).<br>

<br>
<br>
Hail citizens of Norrath!<br>
<br>
Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<br>
<br>
Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands <br>
of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and <br>
a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the <br>
spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<br>
<br>
As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect <br>
and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that <br>
they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<br>
<br>
We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with <br>
compassion, and filled with joy.<br>
<br>
If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, <br>
or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly <br>
the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could <br>
bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned <br>
acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and <br>
helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br>
<br>
If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be <br>
difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...  <br>
and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens <br>
of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the <br>
lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<br>
<br>
If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite <br>
you to point your browser to: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com">guideapp.everquest.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to <br>
Norrath are grand.<br>
<br>
A few things to remember:<br>
1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<br>
2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>
3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>
4) You will need good communication skills.<br>
5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>
6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<br>
<br>
<br>
Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better <br>
than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide <br>
Program!<br>

<br>
*** Important Reminder ***<br>
<br>
Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small <br>
chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will <br>
have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that <br>
they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also <br>
important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost <br>
corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<br>
<br>
** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM <br>
ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br>
<br>
We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time.  <br>
In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a <br>
problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were <br>
unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it <br>
right away after the patch.<br>
<br>
So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned <br>
up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of <br>
corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of <br>
them disappearing.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

*** Patch Message ***<br>
<br>
<br>
** Zone Changes **<br>
<br>
- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<br>
<br>
<br>
** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br>
<br>
- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most <br>
part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to <br>
stack that were never intended to stack.<br>
<br>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of <br>
Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br>
<br>
- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been <br>
changed to be more appropriate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Features and Interface Changes **<br>
<br>
- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t <br>
if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist <br>
without the %t.<br>
<br>
- %r returns &quot;corpse&quot; for corpses and &quot;NPC&quot; for targeted NPCs.<br>
<br>
- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to <br>
user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message <br>
was already set to user color 15.<br>
<br>
- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does.  <br>
It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new <br>
ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <br>
(_.ini).  The first time a character is created or <br>
loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old <br>
ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show <br>
item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the <br>
local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>
names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player <br>
positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>
window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade <br>
item names.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse <br>
items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when <br>
held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they <br>
don't show up otherwise).<br>
<br>
- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any <br>
player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this <br>
to annoy players that had ignored them.<br>
<br>
- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are <br>
on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to <br>
annoy people that had ignored them).<br>
<br>
- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the <br>
members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, <br>
such as /who &quot;Irontoe Brigade&quot;.<br>
<br>
- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface <br>
(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash <br>
commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use <br>
this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the <br>
interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <br>
you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.  <br>
REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to <br>
reboot your machine.<br>
<br>
<br>
** Item Changes **<br>
<br>
- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now <br>
also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br>
<br>
- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br>
<br>
- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of <br>
your waist.<br>
<br>
- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.  <br>
They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br>
<br>
- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  <br>
There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so <br>
we had to disable that for these items.<br>
<br>
- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this <br>
patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.  <br>
Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 <br>
slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br>
<br>
- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty <br>
blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br>
<br>
<br>
**  Other Stuff **<br>
<br>
- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level <br>
bard title.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with <br>
that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing <br>
that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that <br>
nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're <br>
announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team<br>
<br>
_______________________________________________<br>
<br>
In my opinion nothing really new in it. Nothing exciting, nothing huge.<br>
At least not out of Roleplay view.<br>
<br>
The changes are nice I think, but have nothing to do with our cause.<br>
<br>
I will try to check runnny eye thou.<br>
<br>
I am also sure there are many things they did not tell us in the message.<br>
<br>

Kill me now. I was typing a HUGE post, and as i got over excited when catching a glimps of the upcoming Buffy finale, I swung my leg which kicked away the power cable to my computer *cries*!!<br>
Now I'm annoyed. Ok, ill try and summarize what I was saying, again!<br>
<br>
Sorry I've been away for a while, had a lot of RL stuff. Things always happen at the worst time. Anyways, I'm back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *hears the cries of panic*<br>
<br>
With the patch, similar to the one JUST before bloody kithicor, in progress, I feel these last hours are the only ones we'll have before the hundreds of events conclude in an explosion. From here on, we need to be prepared. In light of this, I wanted to summarize some stuff after reading much more on what happened at Bloody Kithicor.<br>
<br>
- BIND! It is essential that we get the non-binding players bound at the nearest places available. With the Karanas being a hot spot, please be aware of the new NK Gypsy binding point.<br>
<br>
- TP'ers! When the war kicks off, have the names of the TP'rs in mind. But remember, they will be swarmed with /tells. Send yours, and try to be patient. <br>
<br>
- TOUGH! The mobs zone. However, it is known from bloody kithicor that if you zone the mob aggro is wiped. However, dont zone and expect to be safe. The mobs are zoning ones, and the battle is being fought in to a direction at all times. If you want to rest, move from the zone lines and the battle tracks, just because your not on their aggro list after you zone, dont think they want bash your head in when THEY zone.<br>
<br>
- OUCH! The lvl range of the mobs was said to be very different in bloody kithicor. With the lack of knowledge of what specific mobs we are expecting, use common sense. Don't attack a mob with the title Avatar of Fear or Innoruk if you're lvl 12. You'll be 10 times more useful if you take on mobs around your lvl area. Every enemy death counts.<br>
<br>
- NAMED! We are expecting a number of named mobs. An outline of what ones are as follows;<br>
Avatar of Fear: Cazic's very own puppet. Identicle to CT himself, the Avatar is weaker.<br>
Cazic Thule: Dont get your expectations of this guy showing up too high, with his Avatar, I feel there won't be a need for the God himself to show. Why get your hands dirty if you have someone to do it for you?<br>
Lanys: trust me, she will show :P Daughter of Innoruk, yet now a follower of Bertouxx, she will be there to kill Fironie Vie, seen as FV was the reason Lanys fled from Bloody kithicor.<br>
Innoruk: this guy wants his daughter dead. Happy family eh? If he shows, he will not be in alliance with the evil forces, and nor will he help the light forces so dont expect to beable to hug this guy without getting your head ripped off. He'll just be there for Lanys, and thats it.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore: A favourite amongst GM's to bring to events, this guy is tough, mean, and if you see him, run.<br>
Bertouxxulous: Aparant god of the upcoming zone Plane of Decay, this guy is the Plague Bringer, he is the one working the mojo on the Karanas. He is in allegience with Lanys and is the center of all of this evil.<br>
Trak: Not sure if this guy should fall under good or evil, and its very unlikely he won't show. But there have been a number of events which hint to Trakanon being involved with all of this. Such as the stones in the north of NK being covered in signs of Trak.<br>
Fironie Vie: As sure as Lanys will appear, then so shall FV. She is cute, she packs a mighty punch, and she wants her Lifeguide back to retrieve her memories which were taken by the Ring of Scale. She will also summon...<br>
Tunare: There only to assist Fironie in her duties, and probably to kick Bertouxx's head in. Gooo tunare!<br>
Anotnious Bayle: ruler of Qeynos, the continent Antonica was named after him. Me thinks he isn't gonna let his city go down without a fight, certainly not to...<br>
Kane Bayle: Anotnious' evil brother who owns the necros, corrupt guards, and most of the catacombs. He is definately gonna try and overthrow Qeynos, and is in allegience with the Bloodsabres, a very influencial faction which covers all the way to Opal Darkbringer in Freeport.<br>
<br>
They are the main ones I can think of for now. If I've left some out, feel free to tell me and laugh in my face.<br>
<br>
(I know its a long post, ill end it soon)<br>
<br>
- CORPSE! You're gonna die. You're gonna die a lot. You'll weap at the exp gone, and perhaps the level. But it'll be worth it, and there are a large number of high lvl clerics who have offered their service in rezzing people so the damage will be minimized. However, MAKE SURE, and I cant stress this enough, that you pick up a coin after you die so your next corpse will not rot quickly. Try and drop copper where ever possible. <br>
<br>
- GROUP! No matter of the level or class, group with those nearest to you. 6 grouped ppl are more affective than 6 individuals. Communication is essential.<br>
<br>
- LISTEN! Make sure you have access to all channels, its important that everyone knows whats going on at all times. And if you see a hored of brooding dark elves coming your way, LET ppl know :P<br>
<br>
Okies, thats most of all I can think of at the moment. Good luck to you all, and let Quellious watch over ya!<br>

I guess they wanna clean up as much as they can to make way for the huge amount that will litter Norrath when the war happens.<br>

When I offered to help him, he became very friendly, calling me &quot;m'boy&quot;, and asked that I go to a certain merchant to buy a replacement for him. At that point I thought it odd that a gnome enchanter would have trouble buying in Kelethin, but I was happy to help. When I was going to the merchant, I overheard a brother ranger speaking to a druid about the same gnome. I should mention that the gnome, who's name I don't remember, said that the wand was actually his Master's, and he would be in danger of his life if he didn't replace it. Later he said he needed it to &quot;bring his Master back&quot;. So I stopped and asked this ranger if he had received the same quest. He hed, and already had purchased the wand, a small, amethyst-tipped bone for finding corpses. It was then that I realized he was a necromancer, and perhaps up to no good. I didn't know who his master was, but it might bode ill for the wood elves should he become active in our part of the world. We agreed to go back and ask more closely of his intent before giving the wand back to him. He immediately stopped the &quot;sonny boy&quot; talk and became threatening. Finally, after refusing to relenquish the wand, he became enraged, and suddenly, floating in the air above us was a dark elf wizard! Fire exploded all about, before he disappeared in a crackle of electricity, screaming that he would come back to slay us all when his Master had returned.<br>
Later I saw him talking to some young elves, again trying to enlist aid in his foul quest. I ran over and told them of his true form, at which they all spurned him and left. Later still, he found me alone in the woods in his true form, and swore he was trying to help Norrath to come to a new level of enlightenment and peace. I said no word from a dark elf's lips could be trusted to fly far from falsehood, and he again became enraged, howling he would string my guts in the trees when he returned, and again in explosions of fire, he disappeared. It chills my blood to remember the friendly, grandfatherly gnome whose form he took. I fear for Faydark, friends.<br>
<br>
(ooc/ I looked on the Who list and he was listed as a GM, but this was when I knew nothing of the plague war, who Firiona Vie was, much less the other players in this story. I wish I could remember his name, but I don't think the gnome's name was &quot;the accursed&quot; although the dark elf looked very like the screenshot above, although with a twisted dark green staff, not double-weilding blades.) <br>
<br>
Now I fear for my life, and want to run as far from Faydark as I can...but I know I must stand, fight and die a hundred deaths if that will help even a little. For Faydark, Freedom, and Tunare!<br>

-You are not quite sure what a moldmaster is, but you are sure that you don't want to meet it alone, and in the dark. <br>
-Thoughts of great treasures and fame spur you on.  Thoughts of certain and painful death do not deter you. <br>
-a pile of mold erupts in a cloud of spores! <br>
-An unbelievable stench fills the air. <br>

The main themes from them were as follows:<br>
<br>
Food - a lot talked about the even greater shortage of food due to the plague corrupting crops in Karanas. This has even spread to affect Freeport. Interestingly, I was told that the DE merchants in Neriak talk about their stocks being affected, and have upped their prices. DE's trading with Karana farmers? hmmm.. <br>
Also, in the Riverale newspaper it said of a baker that was killed searching for an alternative food supply. He didn't die in vain however, as they were able to retain a recipe of food which would be plague-free.<br>
<br>
Runnyeye - Some talk about the miniwar in Runnyeye. Not important at first glance, yet keep in mind the aid the Goblins of Runnyeye gave to the Darkside during Bloody Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Fironie Vie - The updates mention a lot about lady Vie's high priest finally finishing the four stones needed to summon fourth the Champion of Tunare. This event has happened on a lot of servers, and is expected on ours soon. Lady Vie walks from Felwithe to the Brownie outpost in Lfay, where she hands stones out for PC's to hold and then summons Tunare's Champion, only to be attacked by the Avatar of Fear! I heared it was awsome, and will be coming to us soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Qeynos - Only one talks about Anotnious Bayle's struggle to keep his people of Qeynos calm and under control as the possibility of war approaches. He is reported to say that he will do all in his power while on the throne to see no war happens. But what if, when the time comes, he isn't on the throne? Yet rather, his evil brother Kane is..<br>
<br>
That's all I can remember off the top of my head. Namyra collected more than me, so maybe she can fill in my blanks.<br>

<br>
I went to Runnyeye this evening to check out the haps there, so here's my take on the matter. <br>
<br>
I came in from EK thru the Gorge and immediately noticed that the pathing in the Gorge has changed substantially. In the past the mobs would never run up towards EK without being trained, now they're everywhere along that path. Also seems that the mob population there has increased. I saw a LOT of minos running around, far more than usual. Also saw one of the EE Lords out where he shouldn't be. I didn't see any indication that he had been trained as he was wandering around like he belonged out there. <br>
<br>
Upon entering Runnyeye, the thing that caught my eye immediately was that the name of the zone had changed to the Liberated Citadel of Runnyeye. Made me pause and think for a minute. I couldn't find any evileyes anywhere in the zone. When killing a goblin there you will receive a POSITIVE faction hit for King Xorbb now. Seems that the little runts were finally able to throw off his oppresive yoke and run him out. I doubt they did this without some sort of outside aid. Question is who helped them? <br>
<br>
Yes, a great many of the gobs carry new names now and some fungi men are to be seen as well. The Goblin King is now called Lord Pickclaw, if that has any meaning to all this.<br>
<br>
I'll be making frequent stops in Runnyeye to see what I can uncover.<br>

<br>
All these things about Runny Eye kinda confuse me. RUnny Eye must have been the least frequented and most uninteresting zone in whole Norrath.<br>
However, maybe exactly this could be the reason why the evil was able to spread there without being noticed.<br>
<br>
We all know which mines are closest to the ones of Runny Eye. Yes, High Keep.<br>
<br>
I will now tell you about some things Lord Banegrivm and his friends have found out.<br>
As to Runnyeye, where else are there Picklaw goblins? High Keep. What do we know about High Keep's involvment thus far? They are in the alliance. Keep in mind the elemental stones are believed to be from High Keeps mines as well as the stone used by General Laarthik at the battle of Bloody Kithicor...they came from the mines in High Keep, inhabited by what? Picklaw Goblins.<br>
<br>
Interesting, why did they decide to move into Runnyeye? Whats the reason and whats going on? Nothing happens without a reason. <br>
<br>
Something else picked up by Emerald Kin guild, they spotted word of a &quot;Lieutenant&quot; that would be making their way to Qeynos, this &quot;message&quot; was from the Freeport Militia, and they spoke of it openly, not when hailed. <br>
<br>
______________________________<br>
<br>
I honestly do not have any more info than you have posted so far.<br>
I am getting dozens of tells every few minutes with all kind of information which are very helpful and very good but they don't end up in a picture.<br>
<br>
What I see is thast the stones have been found for Tunares summoning (supposedly from High Keep) so I expect Firiona Vie to summon her monther actually any minute.<br>
<br>
Other than this we have many many hot spots at the moment.<br>
As if Qeynos (WAY too calm there lately), Neriak (whats going on there? I thougth we had a civila war to come up?), Gfay, Lfay, and Ak'Anon wouldn't be enouhg, we also have now High Keep and Runny Eye in the middle of attention.<br>
<br>
We need dozens of scouts and we also need people raiding Runny Eye (let me tag along with you, or I will try to set up something on my own).<br>
<br>
But still, the assigned places stay. <br>
We will really discuss strategic details tomorrow at the Gathering.<br>
PLEASE DO COME to the Gathering tomorrow. Lately I have missed many many vlounteers on the gathering and this ended up in not being able to assign tasks properly and in us not having finished armies, finished schedule on TPs, not having MASH Forces yet and such.<br>
We NEED to change this tomorrow. Actually we can be happy this all didnt really start yet!<br>
<br>
People keep asking me when the war starts.<br>
Let me tell you 2 things about it.<br>
<br>
1. I have no clue. The war starts once the evil forces (whichever these will be) invade us! We just can find out details, see the signs and combine them to a picture.<br>
2. This is not THE War anymore, since a long time. its the warS. There are so many hot spots and so many people and parties involved. We will not have ONE fight, we will have several.<br>
<br>
So far from me. Now out to find out more!<br>
