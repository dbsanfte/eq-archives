<br>
First off, where did I state my opinion on the legalization of drugs? I just said that they were not victimless crimes. You can make arguments for the legalization of drugs, many of them very valid - however, drugs kill people. That is a fact, not an opinion.<br>
<br>
Wayfarer, you seem to think that drugs are a symbol of freedom, and that they only affect the people that use them. That is entirely incorrect.<br>
<br>
Fact: Some drug users steal money to pay for their addiction.<br>
<br>
Fact: Most rapes occur when the rapist is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.<br>
<br>
Fact: Most unmeditated murders occur when the murderer is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.<br>
<br>
Fact: People are killed every day as a result of drivers under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Some of those people were intoxicated at the time, others were not.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but I don't feel so &quot;free&quot; when someone has stolen my money or raped me, and I feel especially burdened when dead. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

Prohibition = Occassional deaths related to alcohol useage <b>PLUS</b> deaths related to the criminal enterprise of alcohol production, distribution, competition, and lack of government quality control.<br>
<br>

<br>
1. Drugs kill people, but not nearly as many people as the <b>War on Drugs</b> kills.<br>
<br>
2. Source Check: Please provide your source for the rape/murder statistic. <br>
<br>
3. We have no greater freedom then the freedom to live our lives as we see fit. You cannot take away freedoms from the innocent because the guilty will not play by societies rules.<br>
<br>
If someone commits rape or murder - you punish them for it. <br>
Drugs are not the cause, or there would be no sober rapes. <br>
If drugs aren't the cause, what does it matter that they used them before the crime?<br>
I am sure many of them watched televison prior to the rape also, does this mean televison causes rape and murder?<br>
<br>
Yes, some people steal to support drugs. Some people also steal to feed their families. Who the hell cares why they steal?<br>
This is as stupid as "Hate Crime" legizlation. What does it matter what motivates someone to hurt someone else - hurting people is already illegal! Punish them for it - and forget about why they did it.<br>
<br>
It is clear from your earlier posts that you have no understanding of freedom whatsoever - as you believe it acceptable for you to make all of your friends choices for them.<br>
<br>
Simply put - people should be 100% free to do whatever they want - as long as it doesn't interfere with anyone else's right to do the same.<br>
<br>
If they infringe on someone elses rights by raping, murdering, stealing, etc. - you punish them for it. <br>
If they don't you butt the hell out of there life and mind your own damned business!<br>
<br>
You sure as shit don't go to their home and destroy their property, like you do with your friend's cigarettes.<br>
<br>
I can go further on this, and will, but first - I am still awaiting your response to my last question. I want you to address this - because quite frankly, I find your last three posts hands-down the most offensive thing I have ever read on this board:<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"If I thought that someone I cared about was doing something that endangered their life, I would do what I could to make them stop.<br>
<br>
I have thrown away about a hundred dollars worth of my best friend's cigarettes. It took her about a year, but she no longer smokes - whether or not my constant perstering helped, I'm very glad I did it.<br>
<br>
Cartons of cigarettes fly if you put your wrist into it. I think I could toss them about sixty yards or so."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
<br>
How would you feel if a friend of yours became a devote christian and then decided that things you were doing were endangering your immortal soul.<br>
<br>
One day they come over to your house and destroy all your CD's ("devil music"), burn "questionable books", delete all your EQ characters ("likenesses of demons"), etc.<br>
<br>
Would you think that as cute as your destruction of your friends cigarettes? After all - they are doing it with the best of intentions. They honestly believe you are going to go to Hell.<br>

<br>
To really simplify my statemnt, let me do this...<br>
<br>
In every one of your examples - drugs remains a victimless crime.<br>
<br>
Person steals to support habit<br>
Drugs/Alcohol = victimless crime<br>
Theft = victimed crime<br>
<br>
Person rapes while under the influence<br>
Drugs/Alcohol = victimless crime<br>
Rape = victimed crime<br>
<br>
Person murders while under the influence<br>
Drugs/Alcohol = victimless crime<br>
Murder = victimed crime<br>

I did not have a right to do what I did with regards to the cigarettes, though I probably did help her out. I'd be pretty pissed if I had a friend preaching to me all the time as well.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't really see a need for you to make personal attacks on me. I have no control issues, and if I need help, it's because I spend way too much damn time on a computer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I feel like I should say this, yet again: I never said anything about whether or not drugs should be legal, just that they are not victimless. Believe it or not, I agree with you more than you think - I'm well aware that sending people to jail for marijuana consumption is generally a very bad decision. I think that most of the people that use marijuana use it casually, and do not hurt anyone else. By putting them in jail, you simply ruin their future, therefore making them more likely to commit crimes because they cannot support themselves financially.<br>
<br>
I'm aware that there would be less gang violence and drug wars if police did not need to enforce drug laws. The legalization of drugs would obviously reduce the deaths in that area of law enforcement.<br>
<br>
Point Number Two: I have an understanding of freedom. I realize that I am free to say what I'm saying on this board. The open discussion of ideas is, I feel, the key point of freedom. <br>
<br>
And finally, regarding the freedom issue, it's not a black and white subject. If I was free to do what I wanted to do, that may mean that I would impede on other's freedoms. If other people were free to do whatever they wanted to do, I would probably suffer some encumbrance to do what I wanted to do. I think this topic goes deeper than the human brain is capable of delving through, and has so many tangents that it's really impossible to discuss in one, coherent thread.<br>
<br>
I like to think that what differs man from animals is our free will, and our ability to logically think things through. However, I've also seen studies saying that love might be nothing more than a chemical reaction.<br>
<br>
On one hand, there is complete and total self control and free will; the proactive, romantic ideology that defines what a lot of people feel is freedom, and on the other, there's the reactive, naturalist point of view, where man is really no more than an animal, and simply responds to what it is presented with, without individual thought. There are also thousands of degrees in opinion inbetween the two.<br>
<br>
I have no clue which one I hold on to, but I know this: there is nothing a person could do that will not affect others in some way. It may be very subtle and minute, it may be catostrophic. I feel that as a society, it is our responsibility to look out for one another, while not trampling upon natural freedoms. It's all a compromise. I don't want someone running my life, however I don't really feel like I'd make it very far if I didn't have some help from time to time. I'm done with this discussion, and quite frankly, I had fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
If you want to continue it further, send me a tell in-game Wayfarer. I'd be more than happy to discuss it with you further. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.tiannathomas.com/images/roliel3.gif>

Interesting discussion. One comment that Taino made I thought worthy of rebuttal however. He wrote-<br>
<br>
&quot;Cigarets and alcohol are highly addictive.<br>
Marihuana isn't.<br>
Cigarets and alcohol are a high danger for your body.<br>
Marihuana is in fact healthy.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought these were highly dangerous statements. It was almost an endorsement to &quot;go out and smoke pot now! It's good for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing your body takes in that causes any sort of high is healthy. Pot is addictive, just not anywhere near the order of nicotine. I distinctly remember my roomate going through all sorts of gyrations for several days, even missing work, in order to score some weed when supplies dried up. He was a heavy user, taking frequent breaks at work to slip outside and smoke a bowl in his car. It was very reminiscent of someone smoking a couple packs of cigarettes a day, then trying to quit cold turkey. Some people can do it, others can't. <br>
<br>
Just because I was able to quit drinking easily does not mean alcohol isn't addictive. Likewise just because you were able to easily lay off the pot does not mean it isn't also addictive. Hell, caffeine in coffee, tea or soda is addictive to a certain degree.<br>
<br>
As far as pot being healthy....that depends. It has some medicinal value in chronic cases when used in moderation. It has no benefit to the casual recreational user beyond making them feel good from the high and causes long term lung damage and fertility problems to heavy smokers. Like any drug taken in excessive amount it will cause more health problems than it will solve. Moderation is the key. <p>Gulor Gularin

Our mainstream media?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hell yah! </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> We all know how unbiased and non-corruptible the media is.  Wait...maybe NORML would underwrite such a publication.  Only if it said what they wanted, is my guess.  Oh...I know...our government would publish the results of the studies no matter what the results, right?  <br>
<br>
I don't consider myself a cynic by any means, but I honestly don't believe that such things as non-biased studies about drug use exist.  In the absence of them, I use human experience to base my opinions on.  I try to always use the best available data.<br>
<br>
Oh..and by the way Wayfarer.  A few years ago I would have argued exactly the same points that you are.  Since then I've become considerably more educated and exposed to a larger portion of the world.  It makes me sad a little bit.<br>

As for your point - <br>
<br>
I agree the media, NORML, and the government have biases...that is why The Scientific Method (tm) calls for publication in scientific journals to be followed by open peer review. That means everyone (pro and con) gets to evaluate the experiment before the findings are approved.<br>
<br>
Kind of hard to jury-rig that system. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101924 target="_blank"><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/doc_black/doc-black/Sig2.bmp border=0></a></center><br>

As to your snide evaluation of my experience and education...<br>
<br>
~ Retired Police Officer - actually fought in the Drug War. That was a medical retirement, I am now disabled. You could say that I am an actual victim of the War on Drugs.<br>
On a side note - I do not use drugs (other than alcohol) myself. I am just a devote libertarian that believes in personal liberty.<br>
<br>
~ Returned to school, following my retirement, and obtained my PHD. For the record my field of study was Biopsychology - I am an Animal Behaviorist.<br>
<br>
~ I have been around a few more decades than the average EQ player. I won't give my age - as I already have to take crap about it from pups like Halo.<br>
<br>
Now to be fair - the education thing really doesn't matter to me. I know people with decades of higher education that haven't the sense to come in out of the rain – and people that dropped out of High School who possess the wisdom of the ancients.<br>
I would be curious to know, however, more about this mysterious world experience that qualifies you to speak down to my own experience on this topic.<br>
<br>

Yes, “sad” is exactly the word that comes to my mind.<br>

for this reason many drugs are illegal in most country of the world. <br>
from my knowledge there are not many country where canabis-consume is legal or tolerated. most of you know mainly the Netherlands and since a couple of years  also Switzerland joined the small circle. beside these countrys you can buy marihuana legal in and in a small part of denmark , in its capital  kopenhagen in a quarter called &quot;christania&quot; which is police free area and drugsale is tolerated there . in kamboscha are also no laws agains drug traffic and consume and also in poland and portugal.<br>
the western societys are very  tolerant towards some addictions , which makes many people wondering why other addiction are not acepted in their societys .<br>
I.e.  TV,gambling,everquest, cirgarettes, alcohol ,all kinds of downers and uppers, prozac and other psycho-prescription drugs are wide accepted.<br>
but others not .<br>
i think marihuan should be legalized , no doubt. as many of you mentionend , there is a lot more legal substances out there which are much more dangerous and harmful. just think about all the people that die from alcohol every day (car crashs, voilent acts, diseases caused by alcohol) and about all those that die from marihuana .<br>
in fact marihuana isnt toxic at all , well smoking might cause cancer , but not more or less than smoking tobacco.anyways , i like to point out that i really missing one important point. most of these legal substance are tolerated in our society because their use is integrated in this society and its not an asocial act to consume for instance tobacco , but smoking weed or cocaine base is ...<br>
<br>
due the continuesly prohibition and desinformation many 1st time user of illegal substances have mostly ZERO knowledge about what they doing and what can happen with their body and soul . i think this is the biggest danger of socalled &quot;illegal&quot; substances. many of these 'uneducated' users have no longterm experience and havent learned how to consume.<br>
the best example on the opposite is alcohol , its a more or less widely accept substance , well america is a little different , iam now mainly talking about my european standpoint.<br>
you learn very early that nobody drinks alcohol during the days , you dont drink and work or drive. you learn that from the earliest age. because the people around you have the knowledge how to deal with the sideeffects of alcohol consume and there is mostly some kind of pressure that you dont consume in the wrong situation. <br>
but for most illegal substances which are beeing consumed anyways no matter if legal or illegal are not affected by such social control mechanism , people just fuck themself up in worst case and have to find out the hard way what is good for them and what not.<br>
and this is the problem. not sure how it can be solved , but with more and better knowledge about the use of illegal substances the bad and harmful side effects could be a lot more decreased and would also lead to more acceptance for some substances , not all of them of course. some substance are just total crap i.e. crack,crank(crystal meth). <br>
<br>
btw i consumed almost any popular chemical drug  including mdma,speed,lsd,ketamine,crystal meth,2cb,mda,mdea,dom,dob,ghb etc ...and also most natural drugs  including weed ,shrooms,peyote,several nightshade plants like crimson weed(very dangerous!!!),opium,cocaine,yohimbe,galanga etc ...  <br>
which doesnt mean that natural or chemical is an indicator how &quot;healthy&quot; a substance.<br>
<br>
i stopped with all these experiments around 5 years ago , when i came to a point when i asked myself for the reasons of the consume of all this crap ..  well i found no answer and stopped and stombled directly to my everquest addictions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  which iam stopped also now. i play very rarely.<br>
<br>
the best substance is dutch weed(skunk) i think , if you realy want to know which is best. but that my personal standpoint , other people like other crap like alcohol or whatever.<br>
anyways if you ever going to try any substance you should  obtain as much information as possible BEFORE the consume , its easy with GOOGLE  you find plenty infos about anything that is important like setting ,dosis,sideeffect , do's and donts etc . The 1st time take the half dosis ! and never consume anything because others told you and your really dont want it actually but think about taking it because you dont wanna stay behind  and look uncool or something.<br>
people with psychological problems like any kinds of psychosys , schizophrenia should stay away from any drugs imho , otherwise you will be permanent guest in your closest lunatic asylum. especially stay away from halluzinogenic stuff like weed,shrooms,lsd,ketamine etc.<br>
