Landslide came into a camped RF.  Hell Fionna had enough peeps there but still LS stayed and bullied the camp away for her.  Wow!!! Landslides lack of honor and respect are shown here  by their pathetic  posts which are defending their classless action.  The camp was stolen from Fionna by Landslide.  The first decsion by a Guide was not accepted by Landslide.  They were told to leave but instead they cried moaned and acted like toddlers  until they got a secound visit, this time by a GM.  The LS rep suggested that they random for the camp wow!!!!   Fionna prolly being exhausted from her 100+ hours agreed.

So it boils down to this.  RF was camped  when LS came in .  They say oh well we will hang and  bully  our way until we get camp.  They were told to pack up and leave they  decided  screw that  lets get another GM here  and lets  lotto the camp. Hell it will give us a 50/50 shot at it and who cares how  long or if  Fionna was here before us with all these other peeps.  Fionna looses lotto sigh<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Wht landslide did was piss a bunch of other players off and now they are getting wht they deserve.  So why dont you guys take your lumps and learn from them.  To regain some honor and respect why not have your guild leader post an apology to Fionna here on this board.  Of course that would mean you were in the wrong and that takes guts.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardfellow</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(11/8/01 4:08:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Honor and respect [Long]</span><hr size=1> To recap:<br>
<br>
It wasn't one bad member of a guild that bullied their way into Fionna's camp, it was a significant portion of a guild.<br>
<br>
By virtue of wearing the Landslide guildtag, you give tacit approval of the actions of the camp stealers.<br>
<br>
Lodizal and VS have nothing to do with this.<br>
<br>
The GM is not at fault for Landslide's lack of consideration and honor.<br>
<br>
Verant may have created a shitty camp, but it doesn't excuse bullying and camp stealing.<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with not grouping or aiding Landslide members over this incident, just as there is nothing wrong with refusing to hire a pedophiliac as your babysitter.  In fact, given Landslide's actions and the &quot;it's just a game&quot; attitude the guild's members have presented here, I think anyone would be within their rights to take over a camp inhabited by LS members and to expect no complaints.  But I think most of us regard personal and guild honor too highly to do such things.<br>
<br>
If it's just a game then there was no reason for you to trample over other players in such a manner.  Of course, one could say that the Olympiad is just a bunch of games or that World Cup soccer is just a game, but it seems a bit simplistic to me to describe them that way.  Same with EQ (though perhaps not on such a grand scale as the examples).<br>
<br>
Landslide has made its bed, now they must lie in it.<br>

Treating people badly in a multiplayer game does - it's real people behind those other toons. <br>
<br>
If someone steal your mob in EverQuest or steal your money in monopoly or cheat you in poker. Yeah, he's a asshole.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, comparing these actions to real life genocide and child-molestation, well then it's time to get a grip and realize that it after all IS just a game.<br>
<br>
Stealing someone's orcpawn is not nearly as bad as stealing someone's ragefire, and stealing somone's reagefire is not anywhere nearly as bad as stealing someone's RL car.<br>
<br>
And stealing someone's car is not anywhere near as bad as murder or sexual molestation.<br>
<br>
So get a grip people.<br>
<br>
It really make me want to puke when I hear victims of petty fraud or pickpocketing whine that their wallets have been raped. Comparing bullying to get your way with a EverQuest camp with bullying to get your way sexually with a child is worse. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I used to be engaged to Lady Ssapriina, a member of Clan Der Vampire. Our relationship never really ended, in spite of all the Paladins who tried to &quot;save&quot; me and all the people whining that highelves and undead darkelf shadowknights was not meant for each other. If only they could have seen that she is really a nice person who had the misfortune to be born in teh wrong city! To my great sadness, she dissapeared and none of my efforts to find her brought any result. She resurfaced many decades later, but seem to have grown shy and are rarely seen these days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
ooc: Ssapriina's player was gone from EverQuest for many months, and doesn't play very often now after he came back. Got a job and all that. I had outgrown her (the character) in level range, so we wasn't hunting together either. We mostly talk over ICQ these days, and since it's our characters who are in love and not our RL selves, that &quot;Romea and Juliet&quot; story seem to have ebbed out from lack of material. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

I think Palimax sums it up very nicely with this statement: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> By virtue of wearing the Landslide guildtag, you give tacit approval of the actions of the camp stealers.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So even though you know your guild wrong, you continue to associate with this guild and wear its tag. Are you trying to justify Landslide's actions to the rest of us or to yourself?<br>

'twas Mandari, but he sumarized the point I made much more elegantly (and I thought I'd have to explain 'tacit' to people).<br>

Me too.  At least when we shat on people, they'd go...  ...well, I guess we had to see that one coming.  They are the Guild of Unspeakable Evil after all.<br>
