    Thought about your post, and your own past with DW and of course about the different things your own guild has accomplished.  Decided that while in the past you hammered out a pact with DW that you didn't realize we attempted that when DW was in a position to dominate spawns.  Their response was an unequivicol screw you EW.  Each time this has been attempted they blew us off.  I had to laugh about your insinuation that we'd end up on the short side of the stick on this.  DW has been attempting to blow us out of the water since day one and witness the results.  So, do not compare the servers of past glory with our present situation.  EW will maintain the high road and hunt the mobs we target without clearing through another guild first.  Rotations stink to high heaven and I'll disent against any attempt to rotate with DW now that we have the upper hand.  <br>
<br>
One additional snippet from your post gave me food for thought.<br>
<br>
 &quot;or you are selling Blood of the Spider's intellect far too short to think we have not already scoured Sleeper's, Skyshrine, VP, WW and all other zones searching for these purported 'something interesting' things that Gordon alluded to in his post. Simple fact is the script is not finished yet. Thus,&quot;<br>
<br>
Adversley you are selling EW's intellect short by this statement.  Aren't two guilds working on a problem better than one?  Perhaps we bring a whole different set of resources and past experiences to the table that'll help.  There are quite a few of us that revel in the challenge of working this out.  Also of note that you failed to post, either by way of purposely admitting it so you could further build DW's plea bargin or just plain lack of knowledge.  Script for the sleeper has been underwork on Test since ya'll bravely awakened him.  What's that been, 30 days about?  <br>
<br>
Regardless, I salute BOTS for accomplishing what we now attempt.  But I must say pooh for discouraging anyone from attempting it themselves.  We'd like to be able to say we've Awakened the Sleeper and taken out Vulak, can you blame us?<br>

When BotS awoke the Sleeper BotS had not yet satiated itself with primals, and my guess is BotS would not have done it had BotS been armed with the knowledge you now possess.  Further, folks need to distinguish two 'scripts' here, which seem to be getting confused.  One script involves how the Sleeper awakens and terrorizes Norrath after the four warders are slain.  That is the one that was tested recently on test server.  That is swell that they are working on that and all, but honestly WHO CARES??  If you ask me all that matters from my vantage point is the other half of the script, which is implementing a way to recapture the Sleeper.  Sorry, but like I said, unless Gordon has floated some secret info your way, I am telling you that that script is not done.<br>
<br>
Anyway I still think it is stupid to do it, but then again, if DW is playing hard ball like you said, then while I can't encourage doing it, I certainly can't discourage it either because it is probably what I would do as well.  However, you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;I had to laugh about your insinuation that we'd end up on the short side of the stick on this. DW has been attempting to blow us out of the water since day one and witness the results.&quot;<br>
<br>
To me it sounds like you are saying that DW isn't causing you much stress at all, but are a minor hindrance.  If that is in fact the case, then are you really justified in doing this to not only them, but the rest of the server?   Your call.  <p>Seminal Monk<br>

  I personally want to awaken the sleeper cause a) people say we cant and b) it hasnt  been done on this server.I do not want to take away the primal supply from DW (or anything away from them for that matter).I hold no ill will towards DW or any other guild for that matter. I just want to play the game and have fun.<br>
   DW doesnt cause me any stress at all.Life is too short and there is too many good mobs to concur in the game to get into flame wars and that kind of thing.Its unfortunate that EW and DW cant sit and talk tactics openly and with respect.<br>
    We will take down the 4th warder.NOt to hurt anyone or for glory but becuse its the toughest chalenge in the game at the moment.And when its done I will not stand and thump my chest and say &quot;look at me&quot; but I will be damn proud and damn proud of my guildmates.<br>

Alot of things are said between DW and EW members and quite frankly NO ONE knows all the things that are said.  Our members have logged and Screenshotted and posted on OUR internal board what has been said.  This is what makes me so mad when i read these posts &quot;that it has nothing to do with DW&quot; because It does.  And its not just DW that has been difficult.  Offers of &quot;negotiations&quot; from EW have amounted to simple blackmail.  The true issue here is respect.  Frankly neither guild respects each other the way PD and DW did.<br>
The guild leaders dont talk, they didnt grow up together on the same server, they have no respect or relationship with each other.<br>
<br>
all the different &quot;reasons&quot;<br>
<br>
use critical thinking<br>
<br>
The only reason that makes sense even remotely is If you TRULY believe that DW will hit warders at server up and every time they spawn and you will NEVER get another one.<br>
From this perspective, you have nothing to lose by waking the sleeper because you believe you wont be getting any more primals anyway.  Since Warder respawns are random, that is not a for sure thing. <br>
<br>
This makes perfect sense to me.  This is a basis for negotiation.  EW refusing to admit this is part of the problem we have on this server with being able to negotiate.<br>
<br>
Waking the sleeper changes the games normal pattern of advancement.  I measure EQ in months by accomplishment.<br>
EW is about Two Months ahead of DW because of ST quest.<br>
Behind us is VV and CB, just starting to get keys.<br>
<br>
The key quest makes three targets viable, Kland, Sonta, and Zland.  These dragons drop shit for loot other than the key.<br>
<br>
So DW would finish with ST in a month at the rate we are going and move to North TOV.  VV and CB would move in to <br>
get the three other targets as they worked on their keys.<br>
VV and CB are three to six months behind DW.  <br>
<br>
Taking this out of the game removes six targets, not three.<br>
It leaves no Endgame to play EXCEPT north TOV. <br>
EW counters this arguement by saying that if you can kill Aayonar you can do North TOV.  Fine, how long before CB, SOT, VV ally to do this?  Three weeks after the Warders are gone?  I know DW can do Aayonar and &quot;earn&quot; the right to North TOV as confidently as I know EW can wake the sleeper.<br>
<br>
So what is the net effect of Waking the Sleeper now?<br>
Pushing the server progress up Three months, removing a whole thread, and forceing anyone on the server that wants high end mobs into North TOV, which is EXACTLY where you dont want them.  /boggle<br>
<br>
So here is what I dont understand.  Finally there is a Power <br>
issue that really would be something to negotiate.     <br>
