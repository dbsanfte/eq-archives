At first I was simply laughing so much, amazing comments there. But then I took another look at it, and I have to be honest...Gandien scares me.<br>
I cant understand how someone can so fixed in a game like that, in a way he actually threatened my life, simply for being a member of a guild in a game...Now, Im from Sweden, and this might be some internal American jokie that I just dont get, but still...I studied psychology for some time as part of my future job, and...this is not healthy.<br>
I could comment on a lot of other posts in this thread, and others as well...but I wont. People have opinions and sometimes express them a little harsh. I have to be honest with my own guildmembers too, there are some things you just dont say to other people...its somewhat rude...<br>
The idea that struck me thu was a very simple difference between Eternal Wrath and Casus Belli.<br>
Both guilds have good quiet people, who want only to get things done and not fight. We have seen that in posts here and more important, actions in the game itself.<br>
We also both have the people I was talking about earlier, who lose their tempers a little bit too fast.<br>
The difference however is that we do not have those people doing the actual talking when it comes to negotiations and discussions. The most important people for our guild when it comes to conflicts would be Aeno and Drizzen...you never see them lose their tempers completely, or yell at other people in /tells or any other media. <br>
CB has Leezord and Gandien, among others of course...Now, I dont really know what to say about them, but...as long as you guys let them speak for you there will never be any kind of peace between us.<br>
It is one thing when members go off on eachother, it is bad enough and it does reflect on the guild they represent, but the leadership should stay out of it and keep a cool head or it becomes an official problem.<br>
Competition is good, but it should be in a way to let us evolve, not degrade ourselves. A leadership that hates our guts, well...how can we possibly come to any conclusion like this?<br>
I dont think I ever did anything to personally insult or hurt Gandien in any way, Im not that kind of person really...yet he hates me, for a guildtag...he tells me I would need to hide if I met him in real life, because I should fear he would twist my head off...joke or not, I dont recall doing anything to deserve that...<br>
I have very little respect left for Casus Belli as a guild now. The members in themselves are mostly good people, but you are letting your leadership do things you should not be proud of.<br>
I could never hate an entire guild, or the people in it, but right now even I am ready to put everything aside to give you the kind of competition you are asking for.<br>
Are you actually asking for a fair competition or something else however? Please ask yourselves this first...<br>

I guess the point here is that EW wanted 2 hours to get enough peeps online to do AoW.  We wanted to kill statue and take a stab at AoW.  We were ready to try and EW wasn't.  We don't have 40 vulak kills under our belt and our members can still use statue loot.  <br>
<br>
Assume for the sake of argument that prior to last night CB had 30 peeps in position to do vulak (just for example) and EW had a full killing force, you're telling me EW would have given us two hours to get more peeps to take a shot?  For some reason I find that hard to believe.<br>
<br>
And let's say we sat in your pull path after you told us you were pulling, and we called you trainers, what would you say?<br>
<br>
My guess is you'd say get the heck out of the way, you have no intention of killing this mob within a reasonable time, etc. <p>Zhubok Kobuhz <BR>

However it seems that my name is being dragged around as a &quot;Threatener of guilds/leaders&quot;  What a comedy, no really I nearly wet myself when I read that.  Hell I even emailed Aeno and asked him when I threatened him because I was truly at a loss.  Now hearing the &quot;twisting off heads&quot; remark I understand where this comes from.  Taking a single sentance out of context conjurs up many meanings.  Since I didnt bother to log Aeno's threats or comments about CB in tells I cant post that.  However, I can tell you the context.  <br>
<br>
Aeno told me that CB has just lost all respect from EW and many other guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
I tell Aeno, &quot;What respect?  The respect you showed in that stinking turd of an offer you layed at our feet expecting us to take a big bite in to?&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I say &quot;I don't really care about what EW thinks, I don't know any of you people so why should it matter?  Hell, if any of you were to meet me IRL you would probably run the other way for fear that I might twist your head off.&quot;<br>
<br>
Death threat?  Why yes it was and I twist heads off on a regular basis.  In fact I play EQ from my jail cell.  Durrr.<br>
<br>
Translation for the graduates of the EW school for the mentaly gifted:<br>
<br>
Gandien is a BIG mother fucker.  He is the guy whom friends want standing beside them when some asshole talks shit to them regularly to see if they will when he is there.  Hell I have to turn sideways to walk through a few doorframes in my house because my shoulders are so broad.  What does this mean to you?  This means that those who shit talk me on the phone, or email cower in my presence because I am one INTIMIDATING mother fucker.  Hence &quot;I look like I would twist their heads off.&quot;  I have also been known to say &quot;I shit bigger than you&quot;.  I guess I will have to refrain from that as well now for fear someone will interperit that to mean they are bout to be fecaly attacked resulting in their demise.<br>
<br>
Wow, what a breath of fresh air that was.<br>
<br>
And to whomever the total IDIOT was that brought up the lady Nev. failures on our part.... All I can say is BOO - HOO.  We CoH'd your stupid asses to be in place to do Vulak that night in the damned first place.  Looking back I guess we shouldnt have bothered and we wouldnt have inconvenienced you that evening by &quot;making&quot; the spoiled brats in EW wait to do something so now you wouldnt have anything to complain about.  Heaven forbid we interfere with your schedules.  Go out and buy the new &quot;Guild Sized&quot; Huggies and put some on for God's sakes and STFU until you have a clue.<br>
<br>
As has been pointed out, MORE THAN ONCE, EW has told CB to bite it when we were in contention for mobs because it &quot;Did not fit in to EW's schedule to wait for CB.&quot;  Yet EW expects CB to sit hands folded waiting on you.  My God how narrow minded and selfish you are.  Isn't it really funny when the shoe is on the other foot?<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should just post the proposed rotation offer for North Wing that EW put forth to VV and CB and let the rest of the server see what total Egomaniacs you truly are.  <br>
<br>
All is fare until your loot supply is cut isnt it?  Then its no holds bared.<br>
<br>
CB planned on KT and or maybe an AoW shot that night. We discussed it that afternoon when it was found out that Kd was repopped.  Man we are sinister bastards for planning ahead arent we?<br>
<br>
We show up in FORCE to do the job and EW sits in the pull path to intentionaly block any other guild from pulling until they had sufficient numbers to do AoW.  We wanted to test our steal against the mob to look at the mechanics of the fight and see what we needed to do to win.  What were we thinking?    I guess EW just rolls in and whips out their magic 8 ball of strats to come up with the right one on the first attempt.  Some times we have successfull first attempts, some times we loose and we adjust and try again.  &lt;--- Uber l33t strat for those taking notes.  <br>
<br>
I also find humour in EW's ability to point to others failure then fail to mention their own failings.  Such as their &quot;AoW force&quot; failing on Vindi.  I looked back at the logs of my discussion with Sami and the GM.  Sami told me that if we failed to statue we shouldnt even get a shot at AoW.   I guess I missed the opportunity for my cheap shot there by referancing the Vindi failure.  Everyone succeeds at times, everyone fails at times.  Competition makes us stronger, right Aeno?   Well that is unless its competition with EW. <p><a href="http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=7518"><img src="http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/images/me.gif"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ugandien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gandien</A> at: 1/31/02 8:42:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ultrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LTrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Been around a while</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(1/31/02 6:56:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=859.topic&index=148>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 70 ish? 95% lol</span><hr size=1> I'm spent.

We will continue to avoid confrontation with other guilds as much as humanly possible. CB is willing to pursue diplomacy first. We have proven this on many occasions, aside from a couple of unfortunate situations. Nobody is perfect. <p>---<br>

Hatred is an unending loop, it has caused war and suffering ever since the beginning of man.<br>
<br>
Foolish creatures we are, squabbling, wasting time on a game. A game which earns us nothing, drains us of time and money. <br>
<br>
One of you I am, a sheep, a mindless zombie controlled by Verant to pay them monthly to play in their play ground... no wait their prison.<br>
<br>
Verant... what is Verant? Have we ever seen pictures of the president of Verant? I havn't... maybe its an AI... an Artificial Intelligence. This is the beginning? This is the Matrix that was foretold in a brilliant special effects movie?<br>
<br>
Is a game controlling our emotions? What we think? What we do? How we act to one another? Is this what we come down to? A species of warring beasts with relentless hate for one another!?!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
In one server... in one community of roughly 2000 persons there are now two guilds warring and squabbling with each other. Can this small community of 2000 people also represent the world!?<br>
<br>
What if the whole world was just this small community we call the server of Ayonae Ro? Does this mean that there will always be war in the world? Peace will never prevail? Will we all be warring forever to satisfy our greed and sense of pride?<br>
<br>
Is it right that we all war against each other? Is it right to be devious and unmerciful just so that we can loot a peice of digital information off of some fake existence?<br>
<br>
Out of the 2000+ people on this server only about 200 are warring against each other. Only 200 of the 2000 people are causing pain and suffering to the server. Because of these 200 people the rest of the 2000 people will look at high end gaming and say "Why am i even playing this game if thats how its going to be?!"<br>
<br>
The same holds true for reality. The world is big. Yet there are only few countries that disturb the peace. Countries that want power, pride, and greed. Countries that want to stay on the top.<br>
<br>
Life is also a game. A game which we all play. A game where we don't know the meaning and where we don't know the end. A game where we don't know what happens afterwards. A game of blind faith and religion.<br>
<br>
Hear my thoughts! I am the child of the game you all refer to! I am the young 16 year old player that you all say will flame to no end. I am the player that is said to be immature and unskilled. I am what you stereotype! Why is it that adults must feel the need to defend their thoughts, opinions, and emotions through such hate! Why is it that many must suffer for the benefit of few! Why won't it stop!<br>

This isnt a server subject.  This is between two guilds and it should have never been brought here.  I dont publicly post logs.  <br>
<br>
I shared my log with my guild in our restricted forum with instructions not to post it to show them why I will not be conversing with Gandien anymore.  I sent the log to Arbok.  If he wants to say why he thinks I sent it to him, thats fine.  Whole thing just really disgusts me.  <br>
<br>
I encourage CB to continue to achieve their goals, as well as all other guilds on the server.  I may not respect the manner in which someone goes about doing something but I wont fly off the handle or be intimidated.  EW is going to continue to achieve our goals as well.  If a GM will have to be continually called in, then that is something we'll have to deal with.  I've been playing this game for a long time with the attitude of &quot;You get there first in force you win.&quot;  But if this has to change, we will adjust and continue to try to achieve what we set out to.  <br>
<br>
To call a guild greedy because they look out for themselves is ridiculous imho.  Name one guild that doesnt make themselves their first priority.  In my experience and observations, whenever there is a dispute between two guilds there's a lot of rehashing of &quot;You did this&quot;  and &quot;Well you did that.&quot;  EW has done favors for CB in the past.  CB has done favors for EW in the past.  EW has felt disrespected by CB recently and CB has felt disrespected by EW recently.  <br>
<br>
I am done with the arguing in tells and emails.  Im not a confrontational person.  I feel I am and have been reasonable on a personal level (and speaking for myself I feel I've always treated CB in general with courtesy and respect as I try to do with all people).   <br>
<br>
If you want to post the offer it wont bother me.  Im sure people are dying to know.  <br>

And Aeno, to answer your rhetorical question, the first priority of the Drunkards of Norrath, as i have come to understand it, is to have fun and create an enjoyable atmosphere for others.  by no means have we ever, to my knowledge, put forward out "wants" to the extent of not having fun. you asked, I have answered, and i am SURE there are other guilds out there with, if not the same, very similar goals.<br>
