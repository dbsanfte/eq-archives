The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Largo, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him, but because if he can give us all a succinct and infallible argument proving that all it takes to solve our social woes are shotgun marriages, heavy-handed divorce laws, and a return to some mythical 1950s Shangri-la, I will personally deliver his Nobel Prize for Pigheaded Rhetoric. In the meantime, I can guarantee the readers of this letter that Largo and his helots are disingenuous vagrants. This is not set down in complaint against them, but merely as analysis. To Largo's mind, all minorities are poor, stupid ghetto trash. So that means that his zingers are Right with a capital R, right? No, not right. The truth is that Largo is talking out of his posterior. He vehemently denies that, of course. But he obviously would, because if, five years ago, I had described a person like Largo to you and told you that in five years, he'd spawn a society in which those with the most deviant lifestyle, ethically bankrupt behavior, or personal failures are given the most by the government, you'd have thought me demented. You'd have laughed at me and told me it couldn't happen. So it is useful now to note that, first, it has happened and, second, to try to understand how it happened and how I, not being one of the many stinking knuckleheads of this world, do not propose a supernatural solution to the problems we're having with him. Instead, I propose a practical, realistic, down-to-earth approach that requires only that I deal with the relevant facts. Discrediting ideas by labeling them as negligent is an old tradition among Largo's secret agents. For proof of this fact, I must point out that Largo thinks that a richly evocative description of a problem automatically implies the correct solution to that problem. Of course, thinking so doesn't make it so. You've never heard that his intention is to diminish society's inducements to good behavior? That's because his loyalists have been staging a massive cover-up for quite some time now. But if you keep your eyes open, you'll notice that I have never been in favor of being gratuitously impolitic. I have also never been in favor of sticking my head in the sand or of refusing to report as best as possible the facts and circumstances surrounding his acrimonious policies. <br><br>You can sum up Largo's positions in one word: flighty. For what it's worth, Largo wants to infiltrate the media with the express purpose of disseminating repugnant information. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis. I feel no more personal hatred for him than I might feel for a herd of wild animals or a cluster of poisonous reptiles. One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth; one pities them. Largo intends to create a new social class. Clumsy card sharks, petty stool pigeons, and hideous dorks will be given aristocratic status. The rest of us will be forced into serving as their habitués. <br><br>Seeing him leave us in the lurch is a nauseating and disgusting spectacle. People have commented that there may be a gap in my logic there. I, not being one of the many perfidious brigands of this world, don't think there is, and I've gone to great pains to explain why. His ventures all stem from one, simple, faulty premise -- that individual worth is defined by race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. There are rumors circulating that it's because of Largo's willingness to prevaricate and equivocate that his shills seem to be caught up in their need for enemies, so let me just clarify something: He just reported that the most valuable skill one can have is to be able to lie convincingly. Do you think that that's merely sloppy reporting on Largo's part? I don't. I, for one, think that it's a deliberate attempt to siphon off scarce international capital intended for underdeveloped countries. Largo plans to revile everything in the most obscene terms and drag it into the filth of the basest possible outlook. He has instructed his allies not to discuss this or even admit to his plan's existence. Obviously, Largo knows he has something to hide. <br><br>I am not trying to save the world -- I gave up that pursuit a long time ago. But I am trying to make efforts directed towards broad, long-term social change. If there's an untold story here, it's that if we contradict Largo, we are labelled sinful asinine-types. If we capitulate, however, we forfeit our freedoms. I can't predict the future, but I do know this: I want to make this clear, so that those who do not understand deeper messages embedded within sarcastic irony -- and you know who I'm referring to -- can process my point. <br><br>Largo insists that the laws of nature don't apply to him. This fraud, this lie, is just one among the thousands he perpetrates. Credentialism can be deadly, but Largo's ballyhoos are much worse. The notion that he can be reformed into an upright and honorable person may be a pleasant and attractive thought. But people who believe that this can happen should ask it of Santa Claus, in whom they doubtless also believe. If we intend to defend democracy, we had best learn to recognize its primary enemy and not be afraid to stand up and call him by name. That name is Largo.<br><br><br> <p>Gilthianis Kanan<BR>Pathfinder of the 54th season<BR>The self proclaimed Tissue Paper tank<BR>Officer of Ebon Legion<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82733">My stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/umirajtheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miraj the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(7/2/02 4:29:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1619.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freakygamers.com/smilies/s2/contrib/edoom/Wizard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pic of sollin admitting hes Gekob... need hosting for it</span><hr size=1> seems someone used a random insult generator =/<br><br>ill host the pic.<br><br><I>Edit: For the N:th time...</I> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/uedeina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edeina</A> at: 7/2/02 5:09:51 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1619.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1619.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1619.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1619.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=1619.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1619.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1619.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm14">Guilds<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm13">NWN & Morrowind<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Trash Bin<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Staff Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
