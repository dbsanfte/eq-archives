<br>
"Prohibitions?" speaking as if it were a foreign word in her mind "Oh yes, I am not to seek teleportation to the new world. I may recruit whatever other assistance is necessary, but I am to travel by boat and then traverse the land."<br>
<br>
Noticing the day well underway, Casidy looks around the table. "We should be getting underway as quickly as possible. I have had the innkeep prepare some provisions, more may be needed."<br>
<br>
At that moment, the barmaid tapped Casidy on the shoulder to get her attention and indicated that she was needed in the back room.<br>
<br>
"If you'll excuse me, they are requesting my presence in the back. The provisions are over in the corner, if you find materials lacking please let me know" Casidy pointed to a pile of warm weather gear and items stacked neatly on the table and floor of the corner table.<br>
<br>
Casidy rose and headed to the back of the bar to attend to some business matters with the innkeep.<br>

When gently reminded that a tavern often contained many bards, he dropped the note onto a table and fled.<br>
<br>
The note was extremely short and unsealed:<br>

In the course of our little discussion, I was reminded of certain things which I had left unfullfilled.  Although you may not have done anything directly to this end, your presence was useful to me.  Know that my hate does not fall upon you, and that my blade will be used in your defense if needed.  Do not let distances confuse you.  You will know how to call on me if the time comes.&quot;<br>

Crydee notices the man wearing the Freeport Millitia insignia walk in and ducks under the table to hide.

There is no other possible reason why he suddenly started to walk faster; and now that he reached the Inn, didn't even look the Bard up before he dropped the letter.<br>
This Militia Messenger is not who he pretends to be. But who is he?"<br>
<br>
Taino tries to cover the flames of his sword which always reveal his personality at first sight. He should really have bought a sheath for it. The Commonlands are not as comfortable as they used to be. Since Sir Lucan D'Lere had to be stroke down for the good of the Temple of Truth, the Militia was on one hand been weakened, but on the other hand for sure willing to pay a good amount of money for his head. And Sergeant Slate seems never to sleep, dozens of times he had interrupted Taino's tries to weaken the Militias Infulence, at least in the Commons. <br>
<br>
Hidden behind a tree he peers through the Inns window and sees that must-be fake of a Militia Messenger losing his pokerface, starting to make mistakes.<br>
Never has he seen before a member of the Militia hiding in West Freeport. And the fact he came directly from the Temple of Truth just gives one explenation. The spy is not dead. Valeron was right, just as Gygus persumed, the spy that had to die was not the only one, maybe not even the right one. <br>
Thanks Erollisi, our fight will be successful.<br>
<br>
"Hail Sir"<br>
Taino was terrified for a second, turns around, wields his sword and shouts "For the Love of Erollisi and the Faith of the Kinghts of Truth, I protect the weaker ones and I will die with Honor!"<br>
<br>
Two shadows are looking at him, four eyes he feels on his face, body, sword. He will die but he will take them with him. He will not let them survive for the love of Erolli..<br>
<br>
"Nice sword there, you should think twice before you use it. Come in and have a drink..."<br>
<br>
Once again his eager almost cost him his life. He should finally stop doing everything alone and too fast. He will free the world, but not alone. Maybe. And for sure not today...<br>
Silent he follows the Ranger and the Warrioress in the Inn.<br>

<br>
After 20 minutes, the innkeeper returns and hands a bundle to Jzonn.  The bundle is placed in a pack set aside for him.  &quot;That does it for me.

They had heard her making the preparations and they were sad to see her go. The innkeep had brought out a special cloak to protect her from the cold, a family heirloom.<br>
<br>
Casidy broke down into tears, the innkeeper and his wife had been so kind to her. Letting her play in their inn and basically letting her act as manager in the place. The barmaids were all crying over her leaving as well.<br>
<br>
"Chin up guys, I will be back" Casidy tried to say in her most reassuring voice. Even if internally she had reservations about her safety, there was no reason to worry these kind people. Casidy wiped away the tears, and passed out hugs all around.<br>
<br>
With a smile on her face, and wiping the tears from her face, she turned to walk back into the main part of the inn.<br>
<br>
"Well, friends... "Casidy surveyed the inn one last time as she spoke and fought to keep back further tears, "... if everything is in order, I think we should be underway."<br>
<br>
And with that she grabbed her packs, and headed out the door, drum in hand.<br>
<br>
Who would follow her, Casidy was unsure, but she needed to put a bit of distance between herself and this inn that was her former home. A bard should be like a gypsy, she thought and reassured herself, able to pick up and move at will.<br>

Crydee invisibly taps Jzonn on the shoulder, then melts into view. Crydee grins, but appears a bit uneasy at the same time.<br>

Crydee finishes up what business he had elsewhere and stops by the Shopping District in East Commons several days later. He notices that Casidy, Febreeza and Jzonn are still there. Crydee wanders by and waves hellp.<br>

He feels honored and enjoys the taste of the salty air in his nose as they move to the dock in the Northern Desert of Ro.<br>
<br>
It was not hard to find since this Gnome Pirate is shouting and advertising his ship over to the cold side like a new shampoo product line or the Freeport Militia on the search of new Soldiers. <br>
<br>
The all sit down and wait for the Boat to come. <br>
He looks at Febreeza and nods with a smile playing around his lips. He feels much respect for this little gnome warrioress. She showed very strict but good leadership in other battles with him already. Certainly a great partner for this trip. He feels good and safe.<br>
The young Bard is exactly the way he expected her to be. Young, wild and always flirting around. She never can stand still. She has still much to learn and to get her wild temper under control if the situation asks for it. But she performs well and got the best teacher of all. After all we all are happy to have some entertainment and music. The other members Taino has never seen before. <br>
There is no way to judge them yet, but they seem to make up a nice group all together. <br>
The bard keeps peeking over to the Ranger. The also seem to know eachother well. The Bard is always peeking over to all Rangers, so Taino is not sure about it. But its not his business anyways. <br>
<br>
"The ship comes, the ship comes"<br>
The bard jumps up and points over to the horizon.<br>
Its not really what a Paladin would call a ship. Some old pieces of wood nailed to something that swims. <br>
Taino takes Febreezas hand and guides her on the ship, letting her get aboard first. Not that a warrioress would need this "help" but thats the little gestures that are asked and appropriate from a Paladin. <br>
<br>
As he wanted to help the Bard he saw her already standing on the boat singing a happy seafarer's Tune.<br>
<br>
We sit down and the pieces of wood find their way over to colder water and weather. Having the Bard to sing and play and to share a few Eleven Wines turns the journey on this wreck into a welcome ride where everyone is in a good mood and gets to know eachother a little better.<br>
<br>

<br>
Casidy wrapped her arms deep into her cloak and breathed out a note on the air.<br>
<br>
The note turned to popsicles before her. Turning in her song book, she found just the right tune.<br>
<br>
Casidy began to sing a song of warmth to warm the air around her friends.<br>
<br>
She was already feeling a bit warmer.<br>
<br>
Yes this wouldn't be so bad, true this boat was tiny... alot smaller than she had expected, but she was in good company.<br>
<br>
As she finished the first verse of her song, she leaned over to Jzonn "Might I have a bit of the wine to warm my inside as the song has warmed my hands?"<br>
<br>
Surveying her companions she smiled, this would be a long journey but a fun one indeed.<br>

Watching the little boat of boards and barrels come upon an island, the Gnome Pirate standing on the beach yells for everyone to hop off before the boat takes off again.  She leaps into the water and swims to shore.<br>
<br>
Jzonn leads the group across the island to a large dock that sticks out into the water.  And the group once again waits as Jzonn explains that there is a larger boat that will complete the trip.<br>
<br>
She listens closely as he begins telling the group some of the things that they might expect to see on this trip.  Warning of dangers to watch out for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10>Roleplaying & GM Events</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
