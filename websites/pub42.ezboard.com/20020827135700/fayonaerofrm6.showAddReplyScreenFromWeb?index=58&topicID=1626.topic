Whether I sold my chars &amp; retired or if I bought them and am playing them new, or if my brother and his friends are playing them, or if have played them from day one and continue to now, or if I run an emulator server, or if I just log in and play on one, or if I just read the emulator forums  is really none of your business and is speculation on your part, and certainly something I will not comment on a public forum.<br>
<br>
Why don't you say who you are?  Or even better give us your home address so we can come beat the crap out of you.    Never mind naturally all we would find is some shriveled up angry little nerd freak, jacking off and muttering little hate chants from the latest rip off heavy metal band.    It is hard to believe someone who writes as childishly, and has as much time to spam message boards, and play EQ as you do is working on a PHD,  then again a PHD can be just about anything, and take years if the student wants to use it as a life excuse.  I have an MBA from Boston University School of Management and have never met someone as mentally crippled as you in the academic world so I doubt you are telling the truth on that score either.   Luckly I am not a mathematician or I would show that your little formulas were just crap babble that you cut and pasted from somewhere.<br>
<br>
Funny how you mention how much you hate racism but then attack gays, not that I have very much sympathy for them but a least I am not a lying, anonymous, hypocrite like yourself.<br>
<br>
You are someone with no life and no future, hated and abused by everyone he comes in contact with.   Pushed to the internet as his last corner of refuge.   The last place you can get attention, do you have a single friend in EQ or anywhere for that matter?  Ask yourself this.<br>
<br>
Is it your Mom? or Dad that has created this sad state in you physiological makeup or both?  or maybe they did their best and are ok but yet you just kind of well never worked quite right...   Where you shit instead of born?  Did they think of flushing you from day one?  or do they wish they had now?<br>
<br>
You really should seek deep physiological counseling and seek help.  We cannot provide you with the support you need here.  This is just a little EQ forum, a place to yak about a computer game.<br>
<br>
Hate filled little excuse for a life,  get out of the shadows little dork and deal with it.  Step away from the PC your not welcome here either.  Its a shame you failed at EQ too but we can't help that here.<br>

You sir, are a  moron. If anonymous people writing things on message boards gets you this angry, I'd hate to see what a pathetic spazz you are in real life.<br>

<br>
No, you don't  need to, you fucking idiot. Sony posts a list of people who have undergone name changes. So much for being furtive, ass clown.<br>
<br>
People have posted this list many times on this board.  Now, either  you didn't want to affiliate yourself with the name of someone who was notorious in history for his incestuous relationship and changed names after e-baying or the character was initially yours. <br>
<br>
Researching the archives of this board I realize that the characters in your sig are yours so:<br>
<br>
I don't know what about the name " Caligula" appealed to you in the first place. I guess in whatever trailer you were raised in your  parents taught you that incest was okay, from your writing It’s obvious that skull fucking was the favored method of this “instruction”. As a heads up it isn’t normal, it's gross, seek help. You won't get cured living out your perverted fantasies through an EQ toon. <br>
<br>
You have a 60 warrior and a 60 cleric. Therefore, don't ever, ever comment on someone’s lack of life, as you have only been playing this game for a year ( as per your EZboard account). Leveling two characters up to 60 in ~ a year means you spent the majority of your time playing EQ. Don't pretend like you are any better than the shriveled nerd in front of the computer, because you and him are the same person, the exception being, he is not in denial of who he is.<br>

I thought it was TunakTun doing that? The  person who you said was not you,remember?  I thought he was responsible for all the emulator stuff. Funny how the pictures from this " other person " are linked to the same page as your avatar and sig. You really covered your tracks there. I guess I’ll have to wait until you log in under that name to get all the facts.<br>

You dare to comment on my writing when you cannot even spell the word <b>Luckily?</b> Look at the ridiculous logic of your post and how you contradict yourself every other paragraph. You take stupidity to an art form. Just about every point you make can be proven wrong by virtue of your own post.... it's one of the stupidest things I have ever read on these boards. . As for spamming the message boards.... can you not read a time stamp stupid ass, it's hard to believe you ever were a student, you seem to be unable to research facts right in front of your face.<br>

<br>
 A PhD requires you to do work in a specified field, it cannot mean anything. Do some fucking research instead of talking with your ass. I already stated A. it's in physics and B. It's in conformal field theory ( high energy physics). <br>
<br>
Also, you have a timeframe like any degree. It's obvious from that and the preceding statements how familiar you are with the academic world. Sometimes it takes longer when you choose to pursue a degree in something other than adding and subtracting money.<br>
<br>
I am beginning to wonder if your degree was mail-in, or if you picked up your degree at a garage sale and just crossed someone’s name out and wrote your own on top of it. <br>

Wow I didn't know you were the Gangsta-ass accountant! Bitch,  you are as hardcore as the cops from square one, on PBS.<br>
<br>
You call me mentally crippled when supposedly you have a degree in finance, yet are not good at math?<br>
<br>
What the fuck did you learn, how to operate a calculator? You are a disgrace to the American education system and especially Boston University. As for the equations here is a lesson in using the internet, jack ass.<br>
<br>
As I stated earlier I created them. Your inability to read most have prompted you to skip over that part. However if you had half a brain you would use what we call a <b>Search engine </b> and look for the formula that way. You are a dumb fuck for not knowing that.<br>

<br>
Gays are a race? Where did they come from lesbos ( haha, I know you don't get it )  Where in my post do I attack gays? I don't. In reality this is  just more of your displaced anger. Probably resulting from the fact that your life partner tunak tun refused to toss your salad that night.<br>

You e-bayed your characters and use an emulator to no doubt go and see places you couldn't in the real game; you failed at everquest. You want to attempt to kick my ass; you are the hate filled one. As for the shadows, here you go, UCSD department of Physics 5 th floor ask for Jason. I am 6'3 180 pounds. In my office I probably have more pictures of a "life" than you will ever live. So come down, oh and don't try to be friendly or any other bullshit like that. I have no respect for you. Don't post with the "I can't afford to fly down" or whatever, put up or shutup.<br>
