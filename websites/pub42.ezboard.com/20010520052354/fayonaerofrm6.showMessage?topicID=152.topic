Cobalt Boots dropped in Karnors, Live Capt.  Why is this interesting?<br>
<br>
It brought up the issue of Need Before Greed (class loot rules).  Appearently, the group was following NB4G, but had not told the new members (me and a ranger).  Thus, the warrior in the group looted them and took possesion, assuming they were hers.<br>
<br>
Which gave me reason to pause.  This was a normal pickup group, in which I participated in killing that mob as much as the warrior did.  She told me to &quot;shush&quot;, because she could use them and she deserved them.  At which point I went off on her, since I dont appreciate being treated like a child when I bring up valid points over looting rules.  The result was she disbanded the group and left.<br>
<br>
I considered that to be akin to ninja looting, since she left with the boots before the looting issues were resolved, but I digress.  The argument continued in tells for a while, since she wouldnt let up on it, and continued to call me names for no appearent reason, which had no base at all.  (I still dont see how my bringing up loot rules makes me a, and I quote, &quot;fagget&quot;.)  She claimed she had been in that group all day, she deserved the boots more than anyone..but I pointed out she got the boots solely based on her class, not the time there, since there were people in the group there longer than her.<br>
<br>
Eventually she called me a sore loser and camped, after telling me she already had a pair of cobalt boots on an alt so she could sell these.  I wondered how I could be a sore loser when I never made a roll to lose on.<br>
<br>
She thought it was all about fairness.  In reality, class looting is the farthest thing from fair, and just about the most biased form of loot distribution there is.  Am I being greedy?  Not really, I've been rolling on rogue only loot since I was in my 30s in Cazic Thule, on Ravenscale, the only dropped mid level class armor.  Now there is high end class only gear, and suddenly a new concept, need before greed, appears, and I am called greedy for being against it.<br>
<br>
/shrug.  I could be wrong, maybe I am just greedy.</font><P><center>Ullric Littleblade<BR>

<br>
If you go hunting with your guild I consider NB4G the appropriate thing to do. If you sell some cobalt boots for a few kpp, it serves the guild way less cause your guild will have to go there againand again loot some boots for the warrior.<br>
<br>
but if you are in a pickup group there is no reason in the world why anyone deserves something more than others. Unless you point it out to everyone. <br>
Once I as camping the AC lately. I could not hold the camp myself and shouted ofr more to help me with the intention to give ME the first ring and then as reward be able to take over the camp. But I think thats a special situation.<br>
<br>
Guess what would happen if you tell your Enchanter and Cleric to piss off and that they have no right on the FBSS that just dropped... That would be a very happy party.<br>
<br>
And the very best thing is that she already has some boots!!! LOL<br>
Well thats really really sad. I mean, thats not even NB4G, she doesn't even need em. This is as if she would stick on having the right on every and each pair of CObalt boots that drops on the server. <br>
Even if you are around with your guild. As we were in CCs and the Crystalline Robe dropped a few times, then those that have one and &quot;could&quot; wear it, but already DO wear one will IN NO WAY roll on the item...<br>
<br>
But well, maybe I am just greedy. lol.<br>
<br>
By the way,  I don't even think that there should be any discussion about this Warrior. I can hardly believe that anyone would agree in her behaviour.</font><P><center><a href="mailto:taino@jollyjokers.com"><img src="http://www.jollyjokers.com/images/Taino.jpg"></a><br>

If you are going to play by class lotto it has to be mentioned beforehand and each time a new party member joins the group. Otherwise people are going to assume it's NB4G.<br>
<br>
I've had to roll on Cobalt gaunts and boots, and both times I lost out to a wizard. It's just extremely painstaking to have to roll on an item such as that when you're wearing Crafted boots and to lose out to someone who is just going to sell it or put it on a twink. Since then I've garnered Cobalty Guants and Indico Boots, but it's just the principle of the thing I guess. Goes to show you how many greedy people there are in this game. I don't blame you for being upset though Ullric.<br>

This is such a prime example. This warrior said she already have a pair of the boots, yes she demanded the second pair to sell just because she is a warrior. Another such story is a shaman I know a bit, who bragged that she had no choise but to go and camp the fungi king again. You see, she had only been defaulted two fungi tunics so far, and one was on a twink and the other she had sold. Thus she really badly needed a fungi tunic for herself again, and fully expected to be given the first that dropped without lotto.</font><P>Love, Edeina<br>

It's always about loot. I want that, I want that and so on. I will write a bit about Sebilis in this..part..even if it's a bit out of topic.<br>
<br>
Right now, I am grouping a lot in Sebilis. Almost every night to be true. In my groups, we do lotto. Why? Well, it's very simple. If it would be need before greed in the groups, I wouldn't be there.<br>
<br>
Maybe you think that is greedy but hey, I need new equipment too! Then you say, camp the places where your equipment drop then!<br>
<br>
The problem with Need before greed in sebilis is that I would NEVER get any loot at all. I don't need anything in Sebilis at all. I already got Hiero cloak.<br>
<br>
Enchanters(bards can be ok too) are needed in such places but I don't think that many of the chanters in zone would stay if you ran need before greed. People want a chance to get loot, so do I. I don't win things very often (sigh, lost Cobalt Bracer the other day) but when I do, I get happy and play better. If I can never roll, I won't be happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What I always tell people is that if they feel that someone in the group deserves an item THEY can give it to that person IF they win the roll.<br>
<br>
I have exercised this option before when I personally felt that someone needed the equipment.<br>
<br>
It is a game, if the item is important enough for you to say that YOU should get it, then maybe it isn't a game to you anymore.<br>
<br>
I have not always felt this way, at one time I thought need before greed was alright.  Then I realized that people were taking advantage of the concept and I got disinterested.<br>

I have been in quite a few pickup groups and have not had any problem where people let those that need the item lotto for it or have the item.

I would name those nice people I grouped with but I cant remember all their names! Sorry! But anyways if you are in a pickup group, just make sure to explain loot rules to all people and also before looting anything that is of worth ask to make sure everyone understands before looting the item.

I usually am not one to post on the NAG's but after tonight I am so extremely pissed....what can you do. Many people in this post have said some very intelligent things, unfortunatley the majority of people gradute from Frenzy to Karnors and Seb and look foward to &quot;new loot&quot;, everyone wants a chance,everyone wants to upgrade, but only in YOUR class drop fighting area can you earn anything? With class based lotto its tough shit, go fight where your loot drops...or how would you like it if I rolled on a JBB?? The class based loot system is so very lame EXCEPT when that person is going to use it, I belive this and I think many do, HOWEVER a huge problem is created when the person from that class ALWAYS needs that item. This selfish asshole is the gammer that pisses me off, and the people in any group that support this behavior is almost an equal. This is the asshole that has been in Live capt for 3 levels, or hell, lots of &quot;camps&quot;...it is the same asshole in EC selling that loot. My question is why does the EQ community allow this bullshit NB4G policy when EVERYONE knows that most of these fools are taking everyone for a ride, that selling the item over and over is what got them that dragon scale, or sweet BP, or whatever the case. Majority of specific camps do not drop loot for all classes yet you usually find all classes fighting in that camp over a period of time benifiting ONE class. Tonight in KC some fool looted and TOLD everyone in the group he was keeping it. What do you do, do you question if he will use it, and then when he says of course do you belive him? Obviously loot rules should be discussed before hand, tonight this was not the case, 2 of us had just joined and the 3rd mob was the scryer he droped a trident and the warrior looted it. So well it a warrior item its his? HEY WAIT I AM NOT HERE FOR MY HEALTH, if you can use it ok, and OF COURSE everyone who loots CAN USE IT, so WHY THE FUCK are you even questioning anything? With this system is a disadvantage to even suggest that self benifit is a reason to play this game, I mean shit OF COURSE I JOINED THIS PICK UP GROUP SO YOU CAN LOOT EVERYTHING!! Although I think that the warrior is a prick especially since he quickly logged out, I am equally pissed at another group member for supporting the warrior without letting 2 things happen.<br>
<br>
 1) at least STATE the loot rules when someone joins a group, do not expect everyone to either automaticlly understand, or agree for that matter, to the groups looting policy, they should be clearly stated.<br>
<br>
2)At least allow the rest of the group an opportunity to be heard,(in this case the warrior first stated he would do what the group wanted to do) I was not the only one with oppisition, yet FUCKO #2 the right hand man of punk ass #1 starts out like hey THIS IS HOW IT IS!! let me tell you something, not only do people who dictate THEIR rules to everyone look like asses, but you have no place DECIDING for anyone, FUCK OFF, at least the group should be heard, everyone should have that option.<br>
Anyway I stongly feel like this battle is going no where, people can post, and post , and post, but there will still be that fuck nut in that one camp somewhere in Norrrath who &quot;still needs&quot; that item, and 2 hours later its for sale in EC.<br>

And, althou you state it VERY clear, I kinda agree with you. <br>
<br>
If an item dropps that I particulairy camped there, I would really like to have it. But IF I want that Item, I do either propose that I don't loot ANYTHING else than this, or I will arrange it that I will buy or trade it off the person that won the roll. I think all in all every person should have the same rights in every camp.<br>
<br>
If there is ANY rerason not to roll on ANY item that is worthy enough to be rolled, then it MUST be stated at the beginning and must be ok for everyone. Else you run into troubles. <br>
<br>
The 3 Looters that I like most:<br>
- The one that keeps looting IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT when we are all spammed with chatinfos and he assumes we &quot;miss&quot; that line that says who looted what and then whistles an innocent tune and hopes noone saw it.<br>
- The one, and there I agree with you, that can use EVERYTHING! Whatever you loot or ask, he can use everything. &quot;Hey, I can use that 1HB, I just have a 2HB, a 1HS and a 2HS&quot;. Geeez! I have ONE 1HS and ONE 2HS and thas more than U used to have =)<br>
- The ones that stay exactly as long as it takes until they won their loot they wanted. NOTHING makes me more sick than people winning a Robe (e.g.) and then say: Ok guys I need to go. Was fun, thank you! This shows so much arrogance and I personally feel abused since I fought hard  (same as the whole group) to survive and get loots and then we got something and the group splits up and we have to find a new chanter, cleric, whatever. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And Kaoru. This is a very nice post and I am happy for you that this works out for you. Thats the way I would love it to be. It was a very nice post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Unfortunately there is no camp all over norrath where valuable loots drop for every class. So you will always have people not getting as much as others. Thats the problem. <br>
But yes, if there is a Deepwater bracer dropping, then I will try to arrange whatever it takes to GET that bracer. But then, as I stated, I would agree in not looting at all anymore or then make an offer for a trade or whatever. But I would never ever in my life just state that something just &quot;is mine cause its Pally only&quot;. <br>

<br>
Take for example a Shaman camping King in sebilis. I know they want Fungi Tunic too, it's good for them as being shaman and well, they can use.<br>
<br>
With need before greed, they would get one at this camp but what they do with it afterwards, yes, that's really up to them. They can go straight out to the market and sell it, or why nto give it to a twink so you can get one the next time you camp King too?<br>
<br>
I am not saying that all people is using this method if any does but if we always ran need before greed I am sure that quite a few with do it. To get an item (as they are playing the right class, they will get it) and then just sell it to come back another day would be a very simple and fast way to get money and good exp at the same time.<br>

As for camping something for days and days and refusing to join a group in another part of the same zone....well I dont do that.

<br>
That's what needs to get hashed out.<br>
<br>
In a pickup group, default is everyone lottoes on everything, only people who ARE ABLE to use the item lotto on no drop items.<br>
<br>
You know how you can tell if you are with a group that you should be doing need before greed with?  If you trust them enough to &quot;lend&quot; the item you just won while they are grouped with you.<br>
<br>
Because...that there kills need before greed.  If the person insisting on need before greed doesn't trust you enough to hold an item they won and use it for his betterment because you're in his group, then it's a full lotto group.<br>
<br>
Outside my guild there are a VERY VERY VERY few people i'd trust like that.  And that is why need before greed should be axed out.  Yeah, it's a slap in the face to say you don't trust someone in your group.  But until we've got positive history, yer out of line insisting on need before greed.<br>
