I am a relative of John Brown and had relatives who fought and died on the side of the Union. Does that make me exempt from any possible legal action? What about the other side of the family tree that arrived in the USA in the 1920's? Should they pay for slavery that was abolished 60 years before they even arrived?<br>
<br>
Can I sue an african tribe that sold black slaves to the companies mentioned in the suite for selling inferior merchandise? (JUST KIDDING).<br>

I dont think that slavery was a good thing by any means but I agree with what Blearchie wrote so will leave it at that. <br>

<br>
Well, the Rape-a-Nation…er, I mean Reparations crowd is way ahead of you… <br>
On March 14, 1996; Lord Gifford rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make appropriate reparation to African nations and to the descendants of Africans for the damage caused by the slave trade and the practice of slavery. <br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"A vast proportion of sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal right round to Angola and on the other side from Mozambique into Malaiwi and Tanzania was depopulated. Its young men and women were taken away. Population estimates show that Africa's population remained static at around 100 million between 1650 and 1850 while in the same period the populations of Europe and Asia increased between twofold and threefold. It is small wonder that the great kingdoms of Africa such as Mali, Songhai and Ghana fell into decline while the slave-trading nations prospered mightily. Whole cities such as Liverpool and Bristol grew wealthy on the triangular trade of manufactured goods going to Africa, slaves going from Africa to the colonies, and sugar coming back from the colonies to Britain. No calculations can measure the loss suffered by the African continent from that massive depopulation of its young people, for which no compensation was ever paid."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>Secondly, there would be the cancellation of the intolerable burden of debt, which has overloaded the economies of Africa and the Caribbean. There are powerful economic and social arguments for debt cancellation which were most recently deployed by former President Kaunda of Zambia during a visit to Scotland in February 1996. He said of the present state of Africa: <br>
<br>
"It is a human tragedy. People are dying by their thousands every day, children are dying. These things bring social disorder to countries".<hr></blockquote></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>Thirdly, there would be the return of treasures and works of art which come from the African continent, many of which are to be found in Britain's museums as a result of acts of theft and robbery. I refer, for instance, to the Benin Bronzes in the Museum of Mankind."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>Fourthly,, there would be measures to facilitate the repatriation and resettlement of those who wish to return to Africa. The word "repatriation" has an ugly ring in the mouth of racists who want to drive black people out of Britain. However, it expresses, too, a yearning among many descendants of Africans which is as powerful as was the yearning of the Jewish people for the Promised Land."<hr></blockquote></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>Fifthly, there would be a reparations settlement which would involve programmes of development, without strings attached, in Africa, the Caribbean, Brazil and elsewhere, including programmes to promote equal rights and justice within the countries of the West."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>

Correct me I am wrong here but I beleive this law to basicly state that you can not be punished for something that was made illegal after you have already commited the crime.<br>
<br>
This would go right along with this whole issue. Not that I agree slavery was ever right, but it was not illegal to own slaves at one point in the U.S. I think someone said 1860? Now, under this law how could you sue someone for something that wasn't illegal at the time they did it?<br>
<br>
Maybe I am way off on how this whole deal works. If someone else knows more please fill me in. Really interested about this. <p><center><HTML><BODY>

Hehehe. It’s fun to watch people try to discuss topics like this rationally - while all the while tip-toeing ever so gently for fear of being smacked with the “bigot stick”.<br>
<br>
I don’t think it’s racist to discuss things honestly. In fact, if you are afraid to broach a subject with someone of a different race - <I>that</I> is a form of racism. It implies that you believe the other race incapable of your own level of reasoning.<br>
<br>
Now having said that – let me preface my response to your quote with the obligatory disclaimer:<br>
<br>
I am not a racist.<br>
<br>
Slavery = very, very, very, very, very, very bad. It’s evil and inexcuseable.<br>
<br>
Okay, now to your question:<br>

<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"If their Family hadn't been brought to the US as a slave, would they be better off than they are now? "<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
Rather than reinvent the wheel, I will risk being labeled a “Quote Machine” by lesser minds and use another's work on this very subject:<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>The Horowitz Report:<br>
<br>
"American blacks on average enjoy per capita incomes in the range of 20 to 50 times [2000% to 5000%] those of blacks living in any of the African nations from which they were kidnapped."<br>
<br>
"West Indian blacks in America are also descended from slaves, but their average incomes are equivalent to the average incomes of whites (and nearly 25 percent higher than the average incomes of American-born blacks of all classes). How is it that slavery adversely affected one large group of descendants but not the other? And how can government be expected to decide an issue that is so subjective—yet so critical—to the case? The fact is that nobody has demonstrated any clearly defined causal connection between slavery or discrimination and the "disparities" that are alleged to require restitution."<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>

so in fact america had/has? its very own NAzi/rascist culture , which happened to end 100 years earlier than the 3rd Reich.<br>
these german companies are now forced to pay back around 2 or 3 billions Euros to all the surviors , which arent that many , because the average age is something around 70 and 100  of these people which will receive the money.<br>
most of them live in  eastern europe  , i.e russia,ukraine,poland,czech etc .<br>
so an lawsuit for reparations for slavery seems not that wrong from my standpoint , but its seems pretty difficult to prove that the 2nd or 3rd generation after the slavery was removed is still suffering from slavery theirs grandparents where forced into and have the right to receive any money from their former <br>
tormentors.<br>
i think these american companies should pay without any lawsuit as an act of goodwill and they should be generous  , anything else will lead to many bad blood and many discussions if these companies are still racist or not ...  it wont be good press for them in any way ...<br>

If the jury sees this issue anything like this board population - it's all a moot point.<br>
<br>
I am kind of surprised that nobody took a "Pro" side on this issue. When you read the newspapers they seem to make it out to be almost evenly divided. Funny.<br>
<br>
I considered taking a "Pro" stance this morning - just to make it interesting, but really couldn't find any arguments to support it that would get past some of the serious debate afficionados who haunt this board.<br>
<br>
The closest thing to a pro argument I could find was along the lines of a "past practices" claim, i.e. - <br>
<br>
In 1988 the American government made a formal apology, and paid $20,000.00 to each Japanese-American who was taken from his/her home and held in internment camps during World War II.<br>
<br>
The problem is that these reparations were made to the actual people harmed, and not persons generations removed.<br>
<br>
All in all - I cannot find one sound pro-reparations argument. Can anyone else? Am I missing something? <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101924 target="_blank"><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/doc_black/doc-black/Sig2.bmp border=0></a></center><br>

Seriously, Collective guilt is a sick idea. None is responsible for the &quot;sins of the father&quot;. Yes, slavery was evil. Fighting against racism and discrimination is important. But two wrongs does not make one right. <p>Love, Edeina<br>

<br>
And so of course a "Pro" argument posts while I am posting that...great timing.<br>
<br>
<br>
In response to Hartmut:<br>
<br>
1. Germany paid the actual survivors - not people generations removed.<br>
<br>
2. The way the reparations are being discussed right now we could end up paying the descendants of actual slave holders and people who directly profited from slavery - while at the same time charging people who actually had ancestors die to end slavery.<br>
This would be completely unfair and unacceptable.<br>
<br>
3. The business at the heart of this suit is not privately owned. They have stock-holders to who they would have to answer.<br>
The money you are suggesting that they hand out is not theirs to give freely.<br>
I would be extremely upset if a company I had stock in gave money to the descendants of slave holders and punished the descendants of people who died, in America's bloodiest war, to bring about an end to slavery.<br>
<br>
4. As you point out - there were very few persons left for whom the German government had to make payments.<br>
In this case - we are talking about paying almost every person of African American descent in the whole country. This would bankrupt every single American business and bring about world-wide economic chaos.<br>
Do you think that the collapse of the American market will not effect you in Germany?<br>
<br>
5. As for it being good for business. See above. Bringing on the second great depression will not be a great Public Relations move. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucrydeeossiriand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crydee Ossiriand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Post-o-holic</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/29/02 1:00:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=40>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://questing-ranger.com/images/archer-2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> i think these american companies should pay without any lawsuit as an act of goodwill and they should be generous , anything else will lead to many bad blood and many discussions if these companies are still racist or not ... it wont be good press for them in any way ...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
What about the US government itself then? If you think it would be reasonable to make the corporations pay up, couldn't you then say that the government itself is equally liable considering that it allowed slavery to occur in the first place?<br>
<br>
And if we do say that the US government is equally liable and needs to pay up, consider where it gets its money.. out of the pocket of everyone living in the US.<br>
<br>
Would you then say that every single person living in this country is then liable for reprirations? Never mind that many of us didn't even have a single ancestor in the US during the time period in question. Mine were all starving away in Europe still.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now what about other contries? Would it then be reasonable to make repiration clains against other countries that were involved in it? Would we start a world wide witch hunt to go after the decedants of people involved with slavery?<br>

<br>
My ancestors *were* slave owners (ran a cotton plantation on Jeckyll Island, GA from just after the Revolution until the Civil War), and they were financially ruined by means their sole livelihood being taken away from them by the *loss* of slave labor (and the destruction of the South's economy as a result of General Sherman's 'scorched earth' policy, destroying the railroads, etc).  They were forced to sell off their holdings to wealthy Northern industrialists and eventually were reduced to being subsistence farmers in South Carolina. <br>
<br>
Should we be entitled to compensation?<br>
<br>
I'd also like to add that my side of the family is decended from both those those slaveholders *and* slaves (my paternal great-grandfather was a mulatto who could 'pass', as it were, it is believed that discovery of his heritage led to his financial ruin and subsequent suicide) so...<br>
<br>
