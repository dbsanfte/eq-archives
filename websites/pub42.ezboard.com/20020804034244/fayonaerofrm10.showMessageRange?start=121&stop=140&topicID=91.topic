<br>
She wants 3 Spores that drop from Undead Sprites, spores that are &quot;Much like the ones that exist in the Plane of Fear&quot;<br>
<br>
Equestrielle then chased me to the zone, I saw her approaching and thought *I think i'd better turn and run now&quot; targetted her, set my pet on her and bailed to the zone.<br>
<br>
I zoned before I conned her tho, but I knew that she's KOS to everyone now so I just had a gut reaction/instinct and legged it =)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps a little<br>

<br>
He would be on Faydark's Champions faction. Additionally, the item he rewards people with is not usable by evil races.<br>
<br>
Equiestreille gone bad is around L40. She'll /con green at L55, but still give some exp. She can fear and hits like a giant. She drops a Unicorn Horn when slain, which is strange as her horn was removed by Firiona Ve. I have not seen her myself and have no information as to her appearance.<br>
<br>
New entities in the forest:<br>
<br>
The Dread Caller:<br>
Reports say that he looks like a miniture Cazic Thule. /cons Blue at L56 and red at L45. Warrior Class and double attacks for 120. When slain, he will drop an Idol of Koada'dal Flesh and Solified Essence of Fear.<br>
<br>
Lady Nidra the Escaped: L25-35 Fairy Enchanter.<br>
<br>
Syrisi the Purifier: L35+ Brownie Druid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of special note, Princess Jolena of the Fairy Kindom is currently missing. This has become a great concern to rangers across many worlds as she was a contact for one of our quests. The enchanters of Felwithe seem unaware that she has gone missing. Any news of her whereabout would be greatly appreciated.<br>

The whole thing is getting complicated and people tend to believe this all was just a big hoax. Here is why it isn't.<br>
But also. I have no clu e what will happen when. Maybe this all leads us in many months of waiting.. maybe this all leads us to the truth of Norrath, maybe we will having a war tomorrow....<br>
___________________________________<br>
<br>
Where to begin? From the beginning mayhaps. Melondar the Bard. What I do remember is when we first started talking that he mentioned he was a herald. Now he also said some things to me that NO ONE knew. How did he KNOW these things?<br>
<br>
Then lets look at North K again. HOW did he know about all this? As to the spires and such, Melondar traveled WITH us. NO ONE had set foot in the spires yet, AT ALL. NO ONE. He was COMPLETELY with us. I watched his movements, he never left the company of the Inner War Council AT ALL. So then how did he know when no one had been there? HOW? <br>
<br>
Also remember, other realities (servers) have claimed there are Melondar-like personas walking about and one supposedly spoken to by Bertoxxulous himself or an agent thereof.<br>
<br>
Tyrana Sil is found at the very topmost floor of High Keep in the secret area. The torturers that I spoke of are in the area past the bank. Also, why is there a skeleton in High Keep? Tearon I believe. Someone explain to me the dark elf in the guise of a High Elf. Since when did High Elves become necromancers or shadowknights?<br>
<br>
Alot of the Correlation between the &quot;alliance&quot; so to speak can be seen in BOTH the quest for Soulfire and the Bayle List quest. Consider what we know aout Soulfire and then the time of Aradune Mithara (known as beta). Soulfire was held in the hands of WHO? Pietro Zarn, the Shadow Knight Lord of the Dismal Rage which is under Freepot in the tunnels.<br>
<br>
As we know of it, later it is discovered that a troll was the one that stole the sword and wisked it away to Pietro Zarn who ordered the blade to be decommissioned. Why was Lucan so interested in Soulfire after looking through the ruins of Zimel's shop? (Soulfire Quest again) And why did Lucan have Zimel thrown in jail as well? Zimel gives the key to take to the banker in High Keep. Why is brother Hayle imprisoned inside Split Paw?<br>
<br>
Here is something else, Enter the Bayle List. Approach Kane Bayle and say &quot;the disease is spreading&quot; and he wants you to take &quot;Blackburrow stout&quot; to Barn Bloodstone in high pass and the quest goes on from there. It ultimately leads you to Pietro Zarn who sends you to who? Sir Lucan? Why is the Coalition of Tradefolk Illegal replacing the Coalition of Trade Folk in North Freeport and in the Freeport area?<br>
<br>
Why does killing Lucan make one KOS with the thieves in the tunnels after X amount of times? So why is Lucan allied with the thieves? Also note that their are hidden factions that do not always represent themselves. Ever wonder why your instantly KOS to something with no reason of race or relgion or mob or class to play in? I wonder why.<br>
<br>
Why are their thieves smuggling from the sewers under Qeynos? Why is the Circle of Unseen Hands associating with them as well as the Bloodsabres? Why is their a dark elf in Qeynos that works for McCabe outside the gates off to the side?<br>
<br>
Why is there a known Bloodsabre (or was at one point in time) guard there in Qeynos? Why are there quests to raise faction with both the corrupt guards of Qeynos and the Freeport Militia out of High Keep? Whats the association and why would THEY care about High Keep? Carson is a rogue, and also known to be involved with &quot;merchanting&quot; so to speak and a &quot;weapons collector&quot; and a known gambler.<br>
<br>
Also, why are the smugglers in the smugglers den on high keep faction and why do they harbor a corrupt Qeynos guardsmen (Dylin Starshine) also involved in the Tesimant of Venear and the Bayle List 2 quest? Why harbor him? Why allow it? Why? So carson smuggles, what and why? Ever notice the smugglers in the sewers under qeynos? Awful curious they happen to be there with the bloodsabres, and the dark elf. Interesting, no? <br>
<br>
Carson also deals in flesh as well. Interesting how Tayla Ironforge made it so easily from Qeynos to the Maidens Fancy and then somehow made it to the hands of another merchant by the inkeep losing a game of the &quot;kings court&quot;. Did he really lose the game or did he throw it and did Carson use his contacts to get her placed there. While we are at it why does the Ebon Mask of Neriak hate Carson McCabe? Notice the dragon paraphanalia? I wonder if he happens to hold something or persuing something they wish? Maybe the Claw of Veeshan perhaps? I wonder why.<br>
<br>
What about the &quot;personalities of high pass&quot; seen in Qeynos hills and such? What about Scar ( a known dark elf) seen in both High Pass and in Freeport that speaks of Lucan only leaving Freeport when his reign is absolute. Interesting. I wonder whats going on. All things have a reason, don't they?<br>
<br>
We know the Heraldric Sword and the Bribe WERE FOUND on Carson AFTER Bloody Kithicor happened. It was a heraldric sword if I remember correctly, no one ever ID'd it and I don't think the bribe had actual text associated with it.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't be surprised if Carson was providing arms for a war. As to the symbols of Bertoxxulous, ever go to Paineel or Miragul's lab? Look at the symbols. Those are the symbols of Paineel. They reappear in the circles found throughout Norrath that also show the symbols of the gods, including Bertoxxulous.<br>
<br>
Why is it both are aligned in Mistmoore? Why is it House X'lottl is also mining ore out of Permafrost and feeding it to the Bloodsabres? Ever notice the Erudite Traveler in the hills? Thats a house X'Lottl member, follow his note to permafrost. Remember the news? Why do you think it is exactly that the Erudites are so angry exactly? I'd wager its more then food.<br>
<br>
Lanys was known in Bloody Kithicor to have allied with Mayong Mistmoore. As was evident by the attack of dark elves (living) that held the Heraldric symbols of Castle Mistmoore and then the taunts and shouts of allegiance to Lanys T'Vyll. So why were they coveting Mayong's standard? What about when the heroes and I went into Castle Mistmoore and found the letter in the maids room? The Lord of Felwithe speaks of Khasra.<br>
<br>
The note spoke of Khasra serving one other aside from Mayong. It also spoke of Mayong's spawns which suffered much more then that of the aeons past, a great ARMY that Mayong has had hidden away. I wonder what for. Who is the other Dark Elf? It said not even so and so knew and I brought up that it perhaps was reference to Tserrina as such since she is an abomination in Mayong's eyes. So that leaves one person left I can see Khasra serving, Lanys. After all Lanys isn't exactly welcome in Neriak at the moment...is she? Remember what the papers from Kaladim said recently about Lanys? I wonder what this all means. She has already publicly stated she means to help Bertoxxulous and the Bloodsabres.<br>
<br>
Enter the capturing of the first part of Governor of the Wicked (The Eye of Judgement) and her chosen which became known as &quot;The Discerning&quot; who solved the riddle of the Sphinx in Rathe Mountains. Shes SWORN her allegiance to the Bloodsabres OPENLY. Now if shes working with Mayong what does all this mean? She has also professed and proclaimed war and also sworn that she will see the end of Tunare and Firiona Vie. I wonder what all this means...<br>
<br>
As to Trakanon, remember his prophecy became BEFORE his betrayal to the Ring of Scale at the Field of Bone, It happened BEFORE he became &quot;The Plague Dragon&quot;. He was denied rest in the Dragon Necropolis and hence, is no longer as he was in life. What remains is a grim shadow of what was.<br>
<br>
Consider the prophecy of Trakanon and then look at at the history of Norrath as we know of it as well as looking at the circles. We know the coming of the gods when Veeshan first found Norrath, then we know the second coming that ended with the banishment of the Shisar.<br>
<br>
Then lets take that and look at the circles which can be found in Oasis of Marr, Rathe area, Neriak, Ak Anon, Bloodsabres shrine, Mayong's Lab, just to name some. Start with the center symbol. Veeshan, she was the first to come to Norrath. Left, is Tunare symbolized by the nine dots which also symbolizes the standing stones seen throughout norrath.<br>
<br>
Above the symbol of Veeshan is Brell, as depicted by the miners-like candleabre pictograph. To the right is the symbol of Veeshan which is three lines to symbolize the waves of the Ocean Lord. The circle that surrounds the four, Perhaps the Veil created by the pact of Brell, Tunare, and Prexus to keep the Wurmqueen in check. I wonder why shes not in the Plane of Sky...remember Rallos Zek was untrusting of the three and did not take part in the pact to forge the Veil denying Veeshan access to Norrath.<br>
<br>
The four sigils on the outside. Lower left is Rallos Zek (yet to show influence yet), Upper left is Innoruuk, Upper right is Cazic Thule, lower right is Bertoxxulous. The four horsemen of armageddon, or the Prophecy of Trakanon.<br>
<br>
One note on Thubr, he also did not know the theory I had about Lanys when I brought it up to him about Lanys and Mayong standing side by side, how do you think we all ended up in Mistmoore that night? Remember these two statements (spoken OOC of course) that will bring much when dealing with &quot;NPC's&quot; that are &quot;being played&quot; and thats this...Role Playing and &quot;perceptions&quot; from the NPC's viewpoint. Not every NPC, knows everything about everyone. Do you know what your neighbor did last night at 10 o clock when you were doing whatever it is you were doing? What about what your doing tomorrow? Do you know what your neighbor is going to do?<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this answers and helps some things...<br>

GM Event on Bertox<br>
Xeros Doomwalker [6/8/2001-5:02:23 AM]  Comments[9] <br>
<br>
It was a normal day of trading in the Eastern Commonlands, when an ominous silence swept across the land. A chilling breeze came out of the shadows in the woods. Then, hordes of undead, skeletons, ghouls, mummies, and zombies stormed the tunnel and outlying areas. Many young travelers perished but the stronger quickly overcame the undead army. Muffled laughter was heard from the shadows as the night turned horribly dark. Suddenly the air was filled with the sound of battle as swarms of Tier`Dal invaded the land, attacking everyone in sight. Many of the Tier`Dal were quickly disposed of but the upper hierarchy proved to be much more of a challenge for the unaware adventurers who were quickly trying to form together to push back the onslaught.<br>
<br>
Several high ranking officers and priests were killed, but not without losses. The Tier`Dal General arrived at this point, laying waste to many of the injured, while the remaining few fought valiantly to bring him to justice. Several people fled to North Ro to rally back against the remaining Dark Elves, but when they returned, Innoruuk's army had vanished......<br>

Tier'Dal invasion in EC eh? Slimy little buggers.<br>

<br>
I agree with this and all we can dis either In character: Be happy that the evil forces give us time and are not strong enough to attack us already, or then ooc: Be pissed at Verant for letting us wait and not finishing what they started.<br>
<br>
However I am SURE EVERYTHING we are expecting WILL happen. The signs are clear and the story of Norrath simply points it out.<br>
<br>
Here I have copied Lord Banegrivms actual post about all the concerns and frustration.<br>
People attacked him personally and he is defending himself, which he really has the right to, since I believe in his words and his cause.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Connections, am I convinced that Runnyeye and the Sleeper are involved in things? No, Not yet. Do I suspect they may be involved? Yes. I know the leader of the Ring of Scale wants the Sleeper to awaken whose spirit now rests in the Dragon Necropolis. Jared Dar I believe. Do I believe Cazic Thule and Bertoxxulous and their worldly retainers may be in cahoots? Yes I do, all based upon things that I have found<br>
<br>
A Teir`Dal and a Koada`Dal stand before you. They are each holding identical stones behind their backs. The Teir`Dal says the stone is black. The Koada`Dal says the stone is white. Which do you believe?<br>
<br>
Because you are on the side of light, because you would sooner trust a High Elf than a Dark Elf, you would believe the Koada`Dal, yes?<br>
<br>
No I don't. I find out more BEFORE, I make a decision. I know that I have seen dark elves that are kind and compassionate and that I know I have seen supposed high elven paladins that are anything but. As to Melondar...I believe Arrathorn said it best. He KNEW about all this BEFORE, ANY of it happened on ANY server. He was speaking with people long before the outbreak of the plague on ANY server and was there at Qeynos when the Hoax happened. <br>
<br>
Arrathorn, as to your question...I have not once stated anywhere &quot;Melondar said XXXX&quot; He is best described as a Merlin figure. Again, there have been reports of &quot;Merlin's&quot; on other servers as well. Remember about Merlin to Arthur's court, how often did he EVER give a DIRECT answer? There is your answer. Believe me there are times speaking with him I want to pull my hair out LOL! <br>
<br>
As to the core of whats happened and been happening, I've been following things since day one...I payed attention, I role played my character and enjoyed the storylines to quests and had FUN doing so. The reward for me was NOT the loot, it was the fantasy story that was made in following a storyline in the process of it all and the aventure that was had along the way. If you pay attention to the GM events, the quests, the faction hits, the stories told as you follow through the quests...you will find ALOT that you never KNEW about. Ever stop and smell the roses? <br>
<br>
Everything that has been DISCOVERED was JUST THAT, DISCOVERED! Alot has been posted, and ALOT of what I said seems to have slipped through the cracks. Prime example and possible reason to explain some things here that I have mentioned. Lanys SAID ther would be war HERSELF. She SAID that SHE was going to HELP the coming off Bertoxxulous, HERSELF. She also SWEARS to destroy Firiona Vie AND Tunare. She has allied with who? Mayong Mistmoore! Now if they are allying, and they can all find &quot;common ground&quot;, then why not unite, join forces, dispatch all your possible enemies in one fell swoop and then you can worry about malcontents. Put yourselves in THEIR boots once.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself what would YOU do if YOU were Lanys or YOU were Mayong Mistmoore or Venril Sathir for that matter. Interesting...they all don't seem to like Firiona Vie that much, do they? Look again at EVERYTHING. Its not just one or two things that happen its the COLLECTIVE SUM of EVERYTHING that we know, EVERYTHING that we have SEEN with our OWN eyes. LOOK! It's there! EVERYTHING!<br>
<br>
Now as to other items of note. How long are we going to debate about Melondar now for? I've said MANY relevant items of note, it keeps getting swept under the covers, WHY? I posted a few things recently and no one bothered to look. If they did they didn't mention it.<br>
<br>
Now who or what Melondar is we may NEVER know. Its a possibility and something we HAVE to accept. Flat out, plain and simple, its a FACT. The FACTS are THINGS are happening, and they will KEEP happening. Now we can DO SOMETHING about it OR we can stand around with our hands in our pockets and keep talking about something none of us may never have an answer to and let the greatest thing thats ever happened in EverQuest slip through the cracks.<br>
<br>
I don't plan on sitting idley by and letting this go. I BELIEVE and I believe for what I have SEEN with my OWN eyes anD what I have RESEARCHED! I LOOKED! I SAW! This IS real. Something IS happening and no matter what anyone says or does there is NO off switch to it all. Something WILL happen.<br>
<br>
As to the matter of posting and such. These ARE public forums open for EVERYONES enjoyment not just the 1st Fist of Light. Now on that note, I realize some people may be a bit gruffer and perhaps more raw then others and I also understand that others might be highly eloquent and such. All the way across the board lets remember to please be courteous and respectful to each other here, as Ladies and Gentleman.<br>
<br>
Personally I have NO problems with people disagreeing with me AT ALL. I am not perfect by any means, I am not always right by any means. Look at some of my earlier statements, I was off in some areas until I later found out for myself by adventuring through Norrath AND being CORRECTED by people as well. I would rather be proven that I am wrong in something then to go down a path being wrong thinking that I am right. I appreciate honesty and being approached with corrections. Why shouldn't I? Especially when the end result is a better me.<br>
<br>
Again, lets remember these are public forums for all. Lets also respect peoples opinions wether we agree or disagree. Not a hard thing to do and I think the majority of the posters here are all mature and respectfull individuals. <br>
<br>
On that note I have an announcement. As a result of the success of these threads and the amounts of posts and the like as well as side threads started, I am going to be making a seperate message board this evening called &quot;The Great War of Norrath&quot;. This board will be accessible off the fist site located at www.1fol.cjb.net by clicking on the &quot;Message Board&quot; link on the left hand side of the main page. I will be taking both war threads and moving them over to the new boards as soon as they are up.<br>
<br>
Again, lets remember to keep things civil here and continue to enjoy what we all have started and flourished in. I am very honored to be able to be here and to be able to help in any way shape or form that I can for the whole of the community as a whole and look forward to the things we can hope to accomplish in the end.<br>

These used to drop from the undead sprites as they are corrupted fairies. I can't tell you which variant is dropping it, so kill them all.<br>

<br>
<br>
As for Melondar the Bard...<br>
Could it be possible that this &quot;herald&quot; you speak of is an agent and herald for Veeshan? Some bards to worship dragons and the Wurmqueen in paticular. Just a though.<br>

<br>
I think we have to <br>
a) combine facts and history of Norrath and things we find out and all this. This is very important. We also need to try to read out of those things and make assuptions.. but<br>
b) Also stay real. The fact that everyone expected the big war (there will be no big war, there will be several smaller ones as we think) after the patch and none happened really made us all suffer and get frustrated and lower the efforts. I think we have to be ready and awake and keep our eyes open. I still think everything can happen at any time. but I also think nothing could happen for 2-3 months (if we are unlucky and verant really sucks /ooc off).<br>
<br>
This story happens very slow and reached a point where the big colapse could happen any second a few months ago. <br>
We are wlaking on the edge and the risk to fall down to a big war is big. Still we could also manage to walk on on that small line for a long time...<br>
