(or &quot;who needs chanters?&quot;)</span><hr size=1> Well, it just so happens that I've been pretty damned hungry for exp recently and I couldn't find perfect groups, so i'd just round up whoever I could find at the entrance and see what we could do.<br>
<br>
Well, five strait ae groups later, i'm a frickin addict.<br>
So here's the deal: in an ae group, you have to forget everything you ever learned from an enchanter.  If you start behaving like a normal group, you are dead.  What makes an ae group?  Well lets just say that ONE of these groups was a cleric, two shamen, a ranger, me, and a wizard.<br>
<br>
Huh? only ONE wizard? whats the deal?<br>
<br>
Ok here is what I learned.  Ae tactics is NOT just the wizard and magacian sitting there tossing out ae nukes.  That is only one of THREE important parts.  The other two are debuffs and damage sheilds.  This means that one of the key classes you need is either a shaman with cripple AND slow, or ranger with swarm caller, or other tank with willsapper or other debuffing weapon.  A secondary class that makes a damage sheild is also usefull, like Druid or magician.<br>
<br>
So here are the tactics.  Pulling singles is no longer what you are aiming for, instead, pulling in a manner that staggers the  entry of the mobs is the best, so that your shaman has a chance to land cripples on each target before they whack ya.  Shamen do cripple first, THEN slow.  Damage shields must always be up on tanks, as must be resist magic and dex, (for their rain procing weapons) and regen.  (did i mention we did this without clerics at one point?).  Tanks do NOT all hit the same mob, and, instead, have the duty of whacking as many different mobs as they can to piss them all off.  It is everyone's job to position mobs such that they cluster together....that means no heals and nukes from orbit or distance..EVERYONE joins in the fun and gets right up next to them.  The more pets the better, as pets=tanks that are ok to die.  This means shaman pets, sk pets, magician pets, necro pets, EVERYONE should pet up.  Tanks should use weapons that proc debuffs and aes.  Weapons that proc rains are especially usefull, as they get resisted a lot and make all the mobs REALLY hate you.<br>
<br>
As far as pace goes, rather than pull so as to stagger spawns, you pull only when one of your casters is at full mana.  This WOULD seem to be slower pulling, except that whenever you DO pull, you are pulling four or five instead of one or two.<br>
<br>
Remember also, in this set of tactics, rooting out of combat is USELESS and, in fact, detrimental to the killing. as you want all the mobs next to each other and whacking on tanks with damage shields, with two tanks, you want to have half hitting each tank.  With three you want 1/3 hitting each tank.  This of course, goes against the standard policy of &quot;try to make every mob hit the same tank to maximize ch&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, these tactics let tanks start tanking again, and brought all the fun back into the game for me.  I went back into a mez group and had to unlearn all these bad habits again.....sigh....I can't wait to try this stuff out in velketors...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ulivtinth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Livtinth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/12/01 7:30:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ae tactics in sebilis.

When we were doing this, the lowest level was the cleric at 52, and the tanks were 54-56.

(or &quot;who needs chanters?&quo</span><hr size=1> Though I LOVE AE groups, I'll have to disagree with your tactics. You still need a chanter to do it right IMHO. First off you need more than one wiz or mage, as neither has really enough mana to drop a frog from full health to death with a full bar using AE's. Secondly, there is no point to having a shaman in this group unless he has the AE slow spell. The idea is to pull 6+ mobs and he wont have time to slow them all.<br>
<br>
My sebilis AE group:<br>
<br>
myself (57 mage)<br>
2x 53+ wizzies using pulse or 51+ mages using scin<br>
52+cleric<br>
53+chanter<br>
55+ Pally or bard<br>
<br>
-Pally pulls train with DA, or bard uses selo's to pull one.<br>
<br>
-- Chanter AE stuns (3 STUNS ARE VITAL)<br>
-- Nukers AE nuke.  The key are point blank nukes such as jills static pulse, scintillation, and zephyr of ice. Wizards and mages are the only viable AE nukers post 50 for these types of groups.  Pillars and rains are also a big no-no imho due to the fact that they max at 4 targets and risk aggroing mobs out of chanter stun radius<br>
<br>
result is 12-20 frogs dead in under 30 seconds. Usually all the nukers are at 50% mana and the chanter at about 70%. Hardest part after developing a rhytm isn't downtime due to medding, its the difficulty of finding 10+ mobs to pull)<br>
<br>
Not saying your tactic doesnt work or is wrong, but I'm an absolute nutball concerning AE groups to the extent where I don't join regular groups anymore cause its the same old mezz,kill,mezz,kill etc. After much experimentation the group I've described lays waste to everything.<br>
<br>
If you can't get a chanter-- this is the seconds best option imho<br>
<br>
2 AE nukers<br>
1 Shaman<br>
3 pally's<br>
<br>
With this group you can still pull 4-5 mob trains in sebilis and be ok, especially if the AE'rs are mages with earth pets. Pally's each chain stun a diff mob while shammy slows them, and AE nukers go to work.<br>
<br>
P.S: Have a high lvl shaman cast cripple on an orc pawn and it will still hit for max) its a useless spell imho<br>

(or &quot;who needs chanters?&quo</span><hr size=1> Sigh....now that i've tried ae with a chanter...yeah..i can see, you need EITHER a chanter OR a shaman.  Not both.  And the pulling methods when using a chanter are different than the pulling methods with a shaman.  And, yer right...with the chanter, the mobs don't ever get a shot at at attacking, so slowing is worthless, as is damage sheilds.<br>
<br>
My major point was that the group without a chanter is so much more common than the group with the perfect ae setup, and "doing ae right" is just another way of saying "there's only one way to do things, and you should just sit on your ass and do nothing if you can't do it that way".  And that ae isn't something that is special, but something that can be done on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
"Cripple is useless outside of pvp"<br>
<br>
Sigh....as for all stat buffs and debuffs, there are three stat ranges: too high, medium, and too low.  If a particular buff or debuff doesn't change the stat range from one range to another, it's useless.  When you are working with mobs that are lower than your level but still giving you exp, stat debuffs matter.  When you are working with whites, yellows and reds, You are quite correct, they don't, unless done massivly, as they don't change the mobs stats from too high to medium, and just leave them at too high.<br>
<br>
What am i talking about? well, when yer getting hit, you either get hit with a lot of minimum hits, a lot of modal hits, or a lot of above modal hits.  What yer getting hit by is dependent on yer ac vs the mobs attack.  When their attack overwhelms yer ac, lowering their attack from godly to way superior just doesn't do much.  When their attack is minor (greens attacking you) crippling them is ALSO going to do not a whole hell of a lot.<br>
<br>
But when you can convert above modal hits into modal hits, or better yet into minimum hits, THAT is when the cripple line shines.  Especially when combined with damage shields.  Especially when the ranger is using swarmcaller.  Its a matter of what works maximally in a group setting, and as a generallist class, the best thing you can do is whatever the rest of the party isn't doing.<br>

<br>
Maniacles claims that &quot;Shamen do cripple first, THEN slow&quot; has some kind of effect (besides getting the shaman beat up while his spells refresh so he can cast the REAL debuff, slow).<br>
<br>
Next time try JUST cripple.  And then try JUST slow (after you do CR from the first test :P).  Turgurs is what made that work, a fast casting, long lasting, 70 percent slow.  <br>
<br>
Do you honestly think that Cripple decreased the damage output of the mobs by even 10 percent?  <br>
<br>
I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Edit:  In keeping with the main topic, I think it is pretty cool when folks are willing to try new things, doing an AE group without an enchanter is pretty creative <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The mage really helps when you have those single mobs that agro onto you.  His pet and the tank type are able to down those single mobs fairly fast so that you don't waste a bunch of caster mana to kill a single mob.

(or &quot;who needs chanters?&quo</span><hr size=1> Without a chanter the max pull is really about 4-5 mobs, and even then the nukers are going to get roughed up bad unless you have a good cleric.  Essentially, if there is no chanter available I prefer mages for an AoE group, 'cause three extra earth pets means three mobs rooted and tanked that you don't have to worry about jumping you while you AoE.  With a chanter the pulls go 10+ easy if your group knows what they are doing.  Essentially, in a pure AE group I either want a 56+ wizzie or a 51+ mage.  The reason on the levels being simple.  At lvl 51 mages get scintillation which is 361 mana 608 dmg 3 sec cast and 5 sec recast(unlimited targets). This is a mages only point-blank AE that they get post 50, but it is a damn good one. At 53 Wizzies get Jills Static Pulse which is 280mana 495 dmg 2 sec cast, 5 sec recast.  This is about as good as the mage AE.  Wizzies pull out ahead when they reach 56 and get Zephyr of Ice which is 320 mana 595 dmg.  So at 56 while the mage is waiting for scintillation to recycle, the wizzie can cycle back and for between 2 AE's.  For this reason, I want 51+ mages or 56+ wizzies, and to a lesser extent a 53+ wizzie.  Pets help a lot in cleaning straglers, and if your doing the exit in Sebilis parking them in the hallway while the train is incoming works great in keeping the mobs stacked.  Also, if you have a 55+ mage in your group, pulling trains is easy.  Just have a ranger or SK pull and DOT a mob, then CoH said ranger/sk.  CoH will clear aggro, but next tick the mob deep in will reaggro due to the DoT.  Result?  Massive train making its way to wherever you summoned the puller to<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (p.s.:  Don't do this if the train will run by another camp plz)<br>
<br>
Biggest problem with AE groups?<br>
-- Even a slight screw up and nobody has a chance to scream before dying. If chanter or cleric goes AFK or LD in middle of fight, it just takes one round of missed stuns for things to go really bad.<br>
<br>
-- Inexperience and terror.  Those who have not done it before usually wet there pants upon incoming when they see ten mobs, and lock up in fright.  I always recommend starting small with AE newbies in the group<br>
<br>
-- People who don't know how to target point blank AE's.  With the exception of an AE xp group and green farming, there has been little occasion for mage/wizzies to use these spells, hence many don't know how to target them properly and miss the mobs altogether.  For these people, I just have them stand next to the chanter at all times, guaranteeing they hit. (point blank AE's have the same targetting radius as chanter AE stun)<br>
<br>
-- Clerics that have been so tuned to the old med, stand up, CH, med routine-- that they can't deal with the frantic pace of healing needed in AE group  on a big pull. CH's will get the group killed fast and it's spells like remedy and divine light that keep the group alive for the 30 seconds needed to bring that train down.<br>
<br>
-- Lack of experimentation, BALLS, and innovation in the 50+ game.  Everybody has been tuned to the &quot;safe&quot; standard group of cleric/chanter/tanks/ and a nuker where you mezz adds and take them down over a period of time.  When you tell someone at 50+ that your going to pull AND kill trains of 10+ mobs they look at you like you just bought your toon of E-bay.  Getting a &quot;pick-up&quot; AE group together is a hard thing to do due to these prejudices, as well as the fact that even if you do convince them otherwise, if anyone dies on that first AE pull cause of their inexperience, they damn the whole AE thing and want to switch back to mez...<br>
