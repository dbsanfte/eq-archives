I am not a hot head, and I HATE confrontation, but I need to be a little cleared. <br>
<br>
To everyone coming from an unbiased standpoint, Immortal Mercy's first attempt at Ragefire was fucked up. Someone thought it might be a good idea if they fought adds....and while we (my guild) had seen Immortal Mercy in SF alot this past week, I dont feel they were given the chance they deserve. <br>
To kiting a mob around: If Immortal Mercy yielded to another guild while they tried a second time on a mob, that is uncommon for many in this game and it is humble. That is why it doesnt happen often, and unfortunantly, once you lose a mob, its another guilds turn.  It was a nice try though, to whoever that was running him around naked. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am not in Landslide you dumbass. I am in a small guild, one smaller than IM. Your the one with your head so far up your tight ass you dont know what the hell you are talking about. You need to heed your own advice about learning to read. All your pandering about uber this and that and you were all along assuming im in Uber Landslide. :P<br>
<br>
<i>"In your earlier post you jumped to the conclusion that I said we would train while another guild was engaged and KS like happened today"</i><br>
<br>
What? Where the hell did you get this? Cut and paste stupid ass, I dont recall saying YOU would train anyone based on your most recent declaration of IM's new policy on Ragefire. Are you still confusing what I say with what Landslide members say? Im not in thier guild you dope. Put down the crack pipe.<br>
<br>
<i>"Which brings me to Akheva. WTF are you talking about? Make up all the stupid ass shit you want about Akheva to detract attention from how wrong you are. I've never pulled mobs off anyone there or anywhere else for that matter. I've never been there during a Landslide raid. I would leave the zone if I saw that. On the rare occasion I go to akheva, I go to one camp. If it is taken I leave. Oh wait, maybe I did pull all those centis with the really neat and uber weapons I just had to have for myself, greedy hypocritical bitch that I am. Yea right. Please try to come up with a better fantasy than my pulling mobs from you for a centi shortsword. That is comical. (And I will never learn a lesson from a jackass like you)"</i><br>
<br>
Ok clueless retard, let me explain a few things. We dont raid centi's, im not in Landslide, and you were the one that brought up "me setting my own trap 4 months ago". Now you play stupid and dont even get the facts close to the truth. It was Shadow Reavers we were pulling, they drop Shaded and Lunar Weapons where we were, not centi bullshit, and Landslide was not even in the zone. You dumbasses sat on the middle stairs right where shit paths thru/by, when pulled to the pull spot behind the fallen pillar. Since you are a fountain of knowledge im sure you knew that tho. But I gave you benefit of the doubt there and after you ganked a few spawns, I informed you that you are sitting in a bad spot. You decided not to reply or move. Which resulted in you agroing mobs we pulled and a few times you actively moved into thier way. I got tired of it and you jumped out to grab the wrong one at the right time. Your fault for not moving when asked to. We were there first, for quite a while, you moved into our pull path, were asked to move, didnt and got screwed. Your fault.<br>
<br>
Now... I think what is going on here is that scrambled egg you call a brain has things mixed up like me belonging in Landslide. Statements you are making are throwing me off. The only two interactions ive had with IM are Akheva and Ragefire, so I assumed you meant Akheva since it was semi close to that time frame. I assumed incorrectly I think, as I now think you are referring to the Ragefire incident with Landslide, which I had no involvement at all in, since I am not in Landslide. If you could get simple things like tags right, you would save us both some hassle in this arguement.<br>
<br>
<i>"What did you do to my guild? You personally flamed us and called us liars. Until that point I had no clue who you were personally."</i><br>
<br>
You had no clue who I am, yet you remember me from 4 months ago: "Yeugo that you set your own trap about what you did 4 months ago to a little epic-less guild called IM, but hey, that's old news" doing something I was never present for? Come on Succuba, at least scroll back and check your shit before you post it here, contradicting yourself in the same thread is pretty stupid. <br>
<br>
<i>"You have an opinion about everything -- which is of course, always miraculously right"</i><br>
<br>
Sigh, here we go again... I have posted numerous times that I WAS WRONG on various subjects and opinions. I said I was wrong in caps so hopefully you focus on the words and realize your statement is incorrect.<br>
<br>
<i>"I am pissed and my ass is sore from being fucked repeatedly by your guild and others. You are the one spewing the "woe is me" shit, and I am playing my small violin for you."</i><br>
<br>
My guild, has never fucked your guild, so stop with the drama, queen. We try to stay away from large masses of players and higher end guilds to avoid just this kind of shit. We go where 1-2 groups can go and work without having to deal with others much. We might be an anti-social bunch, but we at least respect others camps and who gets where first. We dont leapfrog or use Verants bs rules to get to camps and expect people to treat us the same way.<br>
<br>
There is no "woe is me" for I am not the one that got screwed over here. You were screwed, and from all the antics YOU have pulled, I would say YOU deserve it. Too bad the guild you are in had to pay the price for the crap some of its shithead members like you do. Why the hell would I be crying when you were the ones that lost Ragefire... your logic is simply screwed up as are your facts.<br>
<br>
<i>"Anyway, now Yeugeo has someone else to flame for saying Ragefire is a FFA mob."</i><br>
<br>
Naw, im no fan of RIP and vice versa, but I think I like hearing your fucked up logic and sniveling, so ill keep goading you along.<br>
<br>
<i>"So flame to your hearts content, and catch my pussy in game, big stud."</i><br>
<br>
Hahaha you gonna try and play the part like you are female now?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Let me say it one more time Succuba, in hopes that it sinks thru that thick skull of yours.... I am not in Landslide.</b> Your posts assume and insinuate it, and I think its the cause of your rad spaz here. Now you can try to think up some trash and direct comments towards my correct guild.<br>
<br>
Maybe next time, you should tell everyone that you are not allowed to post and only other members of your guild may, because you are doing a shitty job speaking for your guild. At least stop posting while pissed off and calm down, its not helping you being pissed off and posting. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/udekeeverburn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deke Everburn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(3/30/02 10:30:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Immortal Mercy hypocritical?</span><hr size=1> sweet fucking flaming jesus.<br>

Wow, I do owe a big apology to Landslide for thinking someone like Yeugeo would be in your guild.  If he'd had the balls to state his guild affiliation maybe I would not have made that mistake.  Nonetheless it is my mistake for which I take responsibility.  I am sorry Landslide.<br>
<br>
Yeugeo, what I have said about YOU are my personal views -- not those of IM.  People who read this can draw their own conclusions about what I've said and what you've said.  I really could give a shit what you think, and you are not worth typing about any more.<br>
<br>
Heya Shorty!  Long time no see.  We had 30 people in zone when Ragefire was engaged -- overkill.

Oh now I have to post my guild each time, I see.

Shit! you need to make up your mind, is it my fault or your fault, you sure are one confused person.

I will need to check back in my posts and see where I said you specifically were involved in the ahkeva incident, oh wait, I dont need to check back, because your posts here are the first time ive ever seen your name before, so I know I didnt mention you. In truth, the only person I remember from Ahkeva was Succuba because of his ramblings about being a Succubas. Was actually pretty funny: <br>
Succuba shouts: "Do you even know what a Succubas is?" <br>
Yuegou shouts: "Some fat guy sitting behind his computer pretending to be a girl?"<br>
Succ exploded after that, those buttons are way too easy to find.<br>

And Yeugou, please forgive me, but it does seem that you're keeping this flame alive mostly IMO, (some stupidity on our side of the flame also). <br>
Lost Fires was over and done with last week..They got their epic and moved on, you didn't. People used that situation to justify training and ks'ing a mob. Is it right? no. Are we upset? Of course. IM is not going to KS anyone. But we're not going to let 4-5 people take RF like we let them before when we had 24-30 in the zone, or give up the mob to everybody just because they want us to. LS and RiP have taken RF the mob, IM has not. <br>
Using the excuse that we tried to take their camp when no one is there (and that we DID concede) is not the same as using that same excuse to train and KS the mob itself. (RiP or LS never conceded anything at all, never even said that it possibly may have happened our way)<br>
Has IM done alot of stupid things? Yes we have. But so have other guilds. We're not the only guild blessed with that problem. I may not be the brightest person, or the best cleric, but i do know when someone is trying to boost themselves up in everyone's eyes.<br>
And i'm not condemning all of RiP and LS, they helped me on my epic, for which i'm eternally grateful. I'm just addressing those people in those guilds who think doing what they did is right. So if i did upset anyone in LS or RiP who weren't there and had nothing to do with any of these incidents, I'm very sorry and hope that you can forgive me.<br>
And FYI, these are my opinions, and mine ONLY...so please don't take everything out of context and start throwing blame around please. It's time to move on all, even if these flames are the most entertaining thing i've read all week......If you flame me please, please do so only to me...I hate to upset people who have nothing to do with anything...Thank you <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=81&stop=84>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.threadControl?topicID=1158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub42.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ayonaerofrm1">General Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm6">NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)<option value="ayonaerofrm7">The Bazaar<option value="ayonaerofrm12">Nuggets<option value="ayonaerofrm8">Raid Forum<option value="ayonaerofrm9">Polls, Tests & Beyond<option value="ayonaerofrm10">Roleplaying & GM Events<option value="ayonaerofrm2">News and Information<option value="ayonaerofrm5">Guild Links<option value="ayonaerofrm3">Diplomacy Corner<option value="ayonaerofrm4">Administration Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ff0000>- </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/bayonaero>AyonaeRo</a><font color=#ff0000> - </font><a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm6>NAG (Nearly Anything Goes)</a> <font color=#ff0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
