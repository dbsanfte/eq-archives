"Where people who are not able to show their AMEX and/or insurance card are sent out of the hospital again. I know that europian social system are not the best, but such things you wont find there."<br>
<br>
Utterly wrong.<br>
<br>
"Your election system? Which I, despite some information gathering and research, am still not able to grasp - it escapes me why people need to pick other people who vote for them (very simplified, but that it's to what it comes down) the president."<br>
<br>
Our election system is designed as a safeguard against people like that Le Pen freak.<br>
<br>
"Your educational system? Where poor people have no chance to get a better education, except they are awesome Quaterbacks. Again granted that europians educational systems have flaws in them, but at least they are affordable."<br>
<br>
As mentioned elsewhere, our education system is one of the best in the world.  Anyone who is willing to work hard will get a shot at college.  Europeans probably wouldn't make it since working hard is an alien concept to them.<br>
<br>
"so we got also a lot bad apples but I also may remind you that America had 10 years ago a racist war in LA (exaggerated) - I have yet to find something similar in Europe."<br>
<br>
Yeah, no racist wars in Europe.  Killing Jews doesn't count eh?<br>
<br>
"Your economy? This is a point, where I partialy aggree. The US economy is strong and flowing, but with the recent drawbacks (Worldcom, etc.) Europe came pretty close regarding the currency."<br>
<br>
Europe will never come close to the US.  The reason is that the majoirty of the European workforce is more worried about how much vacation they will get than how much work they will do.<br>
<br>
VibesJoker,<br>
<br>
"I think that every black man in your country will surely agree that all they do is riot to grab stuff and that it had nothing to do with 4 white policeman beating the shit out of a guy."<br>
<br>
Yep, 4 policemen did something stupid, and they paid the price for it.  Take a look in the news right now, a cop just got caught beating up a kid, he is going to burn for that too.<br>
<br>
"Must be that great country where there are like 80% black prisoners, but hey that has nothing to do with the US .. must be a black thing?"<br>
<br>
When people commit crimes, they go to jail.  Crimes rates tend to be related to culture.  Right now the inner city culture is pretty fucked up.  It will change over time, and everyone in America is concerned and working on it.  Compare that with the Europeans who would rather take a vacation than work on solving problems.<br>
<br>
"You say that because Afghanistan did not give OBL to the US you have the right to attack that country .. So you would agree that if a US citizens plants a bomb in another country they have the right to do the same?"<br>
<br>
You know as well as I do that is a stupid statement.  If a US Citizen committed acts of terrorism there is no way we would knowingly harbor them.  Wake up dumbass.<br>
<br>
"Every time it comes down to the we are allowed to do so .. but you are not .. kinda discussion."<br>
<br>
When Europe decides that it would like to work instead of laying around on its ass, then perhaps you can step forward and play with the big boys.<br>
<br>
"Very simple .. If you knew Bin Laden was in Washington, you know he was in an Area of lets say 3000 square miles .. would you bomb that 3000 miles .. ok you would first tell everyone to leave their homes and then bomb it"<br>
<br>
Bin Laden would be dead in the street.  The difference is that a good portion of the Afghan people sympathize with the enemy.  That means a few of them get to eat bombs.<br>
<br>
"The Koeweit thing .. Really ... I know Saddam is a freak .. but can you seriously without a doubt tell me that if there was no oil then the US would have done something?"<br>
<br>
We have played policeman in plenty of countries that didn't have oil involved.<br>
<br>
"They were offered a cut of the profits from the pipelines; 15 per cent was mentioned. A US official observed that, with the Caspian's oil and gas flowing, Afghanistan would become "like Saudi Arabia", an oil colony with no democracy and the legal persecution of women"<br>
<br>
It is too bad that the pipeline was never setup.  You don't understand what a pipeline will mean for that country.  When you tie the economy of two countries together, especially a small country to a large country, the large country starts to have more influence over the small country.  You ever notice that Saudi Arabia is now one of the more moderate middle eastern countries?  An American woman can actually walk around there without getting the shit beaten out of her on sight (in most cases).<br>
<br>
The key to turning a country like Afghanistan around is to boost the economy of that country, and to tie that economy to peace.  Once people get a shot at a peaceful life they are reluctant to blow themselves up in schools.<br>
