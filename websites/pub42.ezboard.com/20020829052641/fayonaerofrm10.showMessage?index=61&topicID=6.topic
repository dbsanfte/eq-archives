Many of last night's patrons were up and enjoying breakfast and quite a few of them turned to look curiously at Vanlaan.  Vanlaan quickly gulped a few bites of food to cover his loss of composure.  Once he felt a little more in control, he looked up at Aedare again and hissed, &quot;I thought I told you to keep a low profile.&quot;  Aedare first looked disappointed, but then she got angry.  &quot;Don't take that tone with me Vanlaan.  I did all of this for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vanlaan decided he needed to get all the facts.  He decided he'd best do it on a full stomach.  Once he'd finished breakfast, he sat back and fully read the notes that Aedare had handed him.  Eating had given him the chance to calm down and he felt a little more mellow.  Besides, the Church taught that anger was only constructive when it was focused at one's enemies.  Aedare was definitely not his enemy.  The first note, somewhat worse for the wear, was the story of what Aedare had done.  She had tracked down the Paladin traitor in the Freeport Militia and had killed him, taking his head back to the Spires.  He knew the traitor had been plaguing the Spires for quite some time, so they were probably quite pleased with the kill, although probably not all that pleased with who had delivered the kill.  The second note was from the Priest X`Lottl informing them of their new orders.  Travel to Kunark and make nice with the Iksar.  Not an auspicious assignment, but it was a start.  He wondered what Drakhnar would do when he told him.<br>
<br>
The last note was the most puzzling of all.  It was an invitation from Derryll D`Inex.  She entitled herself as the Ebon Mistress and was obviously familiar with the Church hierarchy, although her name did not ring a bell.  Of course, since his exile from Neriak, there were probably lots of members of the Church he would not recognize.  She wanted to meet with them this evening so that they could discuss the possiblity of Vanlaan and Aedare joining her house.  Vanlaan thought about that.  It would be a good thing to be allied with a great House.  Even with the coup that Aedare had just accomplished, it seemed unlikely that the Spires would forgive them, and they were still holding the power in Neriak.  With a powerful House as an ally, perhaps they could finally return the Church to what it was before L`Vanon and Val`khan were lost.<br>
<br>
He looked up at Aedare.  &quot;I apologize for my hasty reaction.  You took me by surprise.  This is wonderful news and now I feel we can truly start doing His Will again.&quot;  His eyes lost their focus as he contemplated being able to return to Neriak.  He sighed.  Not yet.  They still had a lot of work to do.  He suddenly remembered the incident that had taken place just before he retired.  &quot;Do you remember the dwarf Paladin and wood-elf Druid who gave us some supplies some while ago?  The dwarf is here, accusing me of stealing his family crest ring.  The young bard was able to calm him down before he erupted into violence, but perhaps it would be best if we were away from here before he awoke.  Let's go out and find Drakhnar and be away from here.  We have much to do before the meeting with the Ebon Mistress.&quot;  He rose, put some money on the bar, and headed for the door. <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#800000"><b>Vanlaan</b></font>

The morning rays felt wonderfull and his muscles finaly were loosing their tightness.  The song of the birds was still alien to him though...something he still was not used to.  The song was completely different than the ones he was used to.  It even made him a little homesick.  He looked towards the inn and watched the door, knowing that Vanlaan should be coming out soon.  Then he heard the snapping of a twig below him.  Slowly he looked and saw the form of one of a militiaman.  He thought he recognised his build from the night before but he could not be sure.  Drakhnar slowly withdrew himself from the branch, trying not to make any quick movements that would draw attention to him.  To his relief, the miltiaman began to travel on.  Then he stopped....and turned...and looked up at Drakhnar's scaly face.  &quot;You!&quot; he shouted, &quot;You killed my Comrade's!  PREPARE TO DIE&quot; and with that he charged at the tree, obviously intent to climb up it.  Drakhnar quickly reached into his belt pouch and withdrew a few chips of bone and flung them at the ground in front of the militiaman's feet.  Quickly he chanted a spell and stepped into nothingness...only to appear a few yards away to the militaman's right.  Before the militiaman could regain his bearings, Drakhnar chanted another short spell, and the very shadows themselves began to gather at the feet of the hapless human.  Up they climbed and the militaman finaly found his quarry.  Before he could take one step, Drakhnar chanted another quick spell, this time the very ground opened up before the militaman...who's face was beginning to fill with horror as he looked down and saw death itself claw its way free with boney fingers.  His terror was furthered when he tried to back away, only to find his legs were being consumed by the very shadows.  They spread upwards, consuming his torso, he franticly tried to brush them off, only to have them consume his hands and spread up his arms.  Desprately he tried to swing at the skeleton that was now standing in front of him...only to find his very face being covered in darkness.   Drakhnar chanted another spell.  The militiaman crumpled to his knees and began to claw at his chest, his very heart felt as if it was going to explode.  He tried to crawl away.  Drakhnar pointed at the militiaman, this was all that was needed for the skeleton that was standing by, watching, to spring to life.  Mercelessly it began to claw at the militiaman's armor, pummeling him without end, cackleing gleefully.  Drakhnar chanted another spell, and the militiaman doubled over in pain as scalding blood poured forth from his nostrils and ears.   Drakhnar watched as his pet tore through the armor of the militaman and began to rend his very flesh from his bones.  Drakhnar quietly chanted one final spell and the militiaman was engulfed in the familiar green haze.  Once again time seemed to slow to a crawl.  The shadows that had consumed the man begin to fade....just in time for Drakhnar to see the life fading from his eye's.  This victims life was MUCH stonger than that little birds and Drakhnar felt it pulse through his body in a manner that was almost orgasmic.  Drakhnar sighed as he let a smile appear on his face.   Quickly he regained his composure and began to inspect his victim.  The man, or more appropriately, his corpse, did not yeild very much information, though it did yeild a few peices of platinum and a nice sword that Drakhnar would be more than happy to sell.  &quot;Fool&quot; Drakhnar said as we waved his hand in a dismissing manner....sending his pet back from where it came.   &quot;Oh well&quot; he hissed, &quot;Guesssss that is enough ressst for one morning.&quot;  And with that, Drakhnar chanted another spell, quickly concealing himself in the shadows as he walked towards the inn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#383838><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub42.ezboard.com/ucasidy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casidy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Veteran</span><br> <font color=#ff0000>(2/23/01 11:01:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yet another beginning...</span><hr size=1> A messenger had arrived before the sun rose, and had carried a message on the notes of morning to Casidy.<br>
<br>
It has woken her from her slumber.<br>
<br>
She had risen quickly, and had traveled in the dark to the mentioned spot in the tunnel to meet the member of the guild.<br>
<br>
She had understood the message, and had returned to the inn to gather her things.<br>
<br>
She walked back into the inn and noticed the lady at the table from the evening before.<br>
<br>
Perhaps she could be persuaded to accompany me on this quest. Pondering these thoughts Casidy smiled and asked the strange lady if she might share her table.<br>
<br>
Indicating to the barmaid to bring around some hot tea and some fresh muffins with the wave of her hand, and not waiting for the reply, Casidy sat down across from the lady.<br>
<br>
"G'morning, my name is Casidy might I ask what brings you to these parts of the commonlands traveler?"<br>

The softness in his arms held so very close to his body ... but it was not the same as last night .. just a pillow.  <br>
<br>
Opening his eyes finally looking around the illuminated room searching for something, or rather someone. A sigh of dissapointment and a flash of read streaked his face.  Who did he think he was?  Thinking that dispite the night that such a glorious creature would still be there... its like trying to awake and bring the dream out of your slumber and make it a reality, "one cannot catch and proclaim ownership to the soft breeze that blows in the window  this morning.  Sitting up and just throwing on his drake-hide leggings tossing his tunic and wraps in his backpack he took on last longing look at the bed and started walking downstairs to the common room.<br>
<br>
His heart skipped a beat as he headed towards the door seeing where they sat last night rembering the chill that ran up his spine as she softly put her hands on his tense shoulders ... relieving him of every ounce of tension in his body... her deftly handing him the key.<br>
<br>
With an aching in his heart and longing in his soul he departed the inn.... <br>
<br>
a gasp for air... *twitch* and the last raspy breath ... <br>
the ogre raider fell silently. Qwik laid the arms of his fallen oponent across his no longer heaving chest ... closing his eyelids and gave a look to the dead one.<br>
<br>
Qwik closed his eyes as he stepped aboard the ship taht looked as though it was going to fall to peices at any given time and thought to him self *to find ones self you sometimes need to get lost* unable to recall which of his masters had enlightend him with that quote , it didnt matter Qwik had to ease his troubled self somehow, somewhere , away from the few  he loved.... or loves, <br>
<br>
"mabey ill run into my sensi Chopp ... that could be exactly what i need" he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
when Qwiks return will be .. is uncertain but return he will. <p>================================================================================

<br>
She bounces to the table where Liandriana and the pretty young bard sit.  Good morrow Liandriana and mistress bard.  How goes it.  She introduces herself to the young bard, I am Febreeza Tinytank, Warrioress at your service.  I am famished, what is good to eat this morning.<br>

"Well met, I am Casidy, and I was just about to offer your companion here some muffins... they may not be the best in the land, but they are quite tasty." At her words, the barmaid placed a plate of warm fresh muffins before the three.<br>
<br>
"I have a strange task that has been set before me, and I am in need of some counsel as well as assistance." Casidy spoke more softly, pondering if she should proceed or wait to see if the Tracker from the evening before would be returning soon to join them.<br>
