<B>Definitions<BR>
<BR>Bannable Offense:</B>&nbsp; Offensive actions of a member that affects the guild in a negative manner.&nbsp; Banned members will be asked to remove themselves from the guild.&nbsp; If the member does not remove themselves, an officer contains the ability to remove the member forcibly.&nbsp; A bannable offense is warranted when any members conduct reflects poorly on the Altered Destiny guild and/or when guild members actions significantly decrease the enjoyment of the game.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ninja Looting:</B>&nbsp; Ninja looting is slang for a player whom loots an item before winning a lotto that takes place on any specific object.&nbsp; Ninja looting often happens in large raids when players do not have an affiliation with each other.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Barred:</B>&nbsp; Never to gain acceptance into the Altered Destiny guild or any of Altered Destiny's functions/events/raids.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Altered Destiny Rule Base</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Guild Wars and PvP:</B>&nbsp; Altered Destiny will not indulge in Guild wars for any reason whatsoever.&nbsp; Warring with other guild inhibits the growth of the AD guild and negatively impacts the low and middle level members substantially.&nbsp; PvP players as well will not be invited into the guild.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kill Stealing:</B>&nbsp; Altered Destiny will not tolerate a member stealing kills from anyone including non-members.&nbsp; Any complaint filed will be investigated by an appointed officer.&nbsp; At any time, an officer may remove any member for kill stealing.&nbsp; If any member doubts the ownership of a critter, please back away as to avoid a potential problem.&nbsp; Kill stealing named/rare spawns is subject to instant banning.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Guild Leave and Return:</B>&nbsp; Banned members will not be re-invited into Altered Destiny.&nbsp; Members whom leave the Altered Destiny guild will not regain entrance into the guild easily.&nbsp; Members whom leave for specific non-offensive circumstances will be judged by the officers and members of Altered Destiny.&nbsp;  These officers will heavily lean towards not re-inviting a member unless the circumstances as of their leave are acceptable to all members.&nbsp; Any player whom wishes re-entry into Altered Destiny will be voted on.&nbsp; If any member objects, then the player will not receive an invite.&nbsp; If a member chooses to leave the Altered Destiny guild, all primary and secondary characters within the guild are to be removed as well.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ninja Looting:</B>&nbsp; Ninja looting is bannable on the first offence even if the issue has been settled.&nbsp; This applies to any instance, whether the member is with the guild on a raid or surrounded by complete strangers, or anywhere in-between.&nbsp; Non-guilded members are barred from Altered Destiny and its events/raids for the entirety of the original player.&nbsp; A player whom made a mistake (Warrior which loots a cleric only item 'no-drop') will be voted against -- any oppositions or even a questionable vote will result in banning.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Inner-guild fights/arguments:</B>&nbsp; To all members which maintain and support a fight between members will result in the banning of all members involved.&nbsp; Altered Destiny will have zero tolerance as to fighting or squabbling which gains the attention of the guild in any way whatsoever.&nbsp; Fighting across guildsay which gains the attention of guild members will result in the immediate banning of all involved.&nbsp; Any issues with guild members should be brought to the officers attention before such an incident occurs.&nbsp; Non-aggressive (play fights) are a different matter and are exempt unless the play-style-argument changes into a negative demeaning battle.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fighting:</B>&nbsp; Any member whom supports a battle between non Altered Destiny guild members alter our guild name severely.&nbsp; Fighting in /ooc can result in banning. Any issues which result in fighting will be investigated by an officer.&nbsp; Fighting in general is not viewed or looked upon by the Altered Destiny guild and can result in banning.&nbsp; Any serious issue which gives Altered Destiny an unrespectable name will not be tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Harassment/Abusive Language/Training/Stealing/Picking Fights:</B>&nbsp; Members which enjoy partaking in such activities are not viewed upon kindly within the AD guild.&nbsp; Any of the above actions can result in banning.&nbsp; Officers will investigate any issue which comes into general view.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Non-Supportive Members:</B>&nbsp; A member of Altered Destiny which joins events of other guilds during Altered Destiny events/raids can lead to a dismissal from the guild.&nbsp; Members which consistently join other guilds for events when Altered Destiny is forming for their own events is not considered lightly.&nbsp; Any member whom is non-supportive to the Altered Destiny guild should not be held under the Altered Destiny name.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Abuse of Guildsay:</B>&nbsp; Any member which abuses the guildsay channel will be dismissed from the guild.&nbsp; Improper usage consists of but is not limited:&nbsp; Auctioning items over guildsay, being an annoyance to other members, and using the /guildsay channel as a replacement for /tell.&nbsp; Respect others and please use  other channels when appropriate.&nbsp; Abusing guildsay will result in warnings and/or the immediate removal of a member depending on severity and frequency of the occurrence.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Auctions During Guild Events:</B>&nbsp; Members whom auction items during a large guild event (group of 12 or more) may be dismissed from the guild.&nbsp; Auctions selling or looking for an item are not appropriate during these raids and are a distraction to the event, the players, and the tasks at hand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Loot and Lotto'ing:</B>&nbsp; Until a more specific rule is placed, lotto'ing of loot is to be decided upon by the lotto'r.&nbsp; During a large raid, if an item drops, and this item is questionable as to whom is to be in the lotto, the player in charge of the lotto (the lotto'r) is to make the final decision.&nbsp; Voice opinions before lotto takes place preferably with /tells to the lotto'r.&nbsp; The decision of the lotto'r is final and supercedes any other decision.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Releasing Private Message Forum Passwords to Non-AD members:</B>&nbsp; Any member which releases the passwords of Altered Destiny's private message forums to non-guilded Altered Destiny members will be banned immediately.&nbsp; Any member whom is believed to have given out Altered Destiny's private message forums passwords to non Altered Destiny guild members will be banned as well.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTES:</B>&nbsp; These rule sets should be followed by every single member.&nbsp; An ignorance as to the laws existence will not override the outcome.<BR>
