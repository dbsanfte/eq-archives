To anyone NOT in AD/DK, please understand that what I am posting is about me and AD/DK only and shouldn't be interpreted a statement about how AD/DK treats people not in their guilds.  It's a unique situation in my mind and one that prolly only I am concerned with.***<P>I gotta be honest....I am more than a lil saddened.  I was killing some friends (and the occasional mob) in Velk's today and with my occasional nakid self ports to Kael, I saw you all were about to do Woushi.  As our group was breaking up, I saw you then were all moving to DL to kill Gor.  At this time I sent a tell to Corona offering my help.  I haven't really raided with ya'll in a lil while and I have always felt welcomed.  He informed me it was a closed raid and I understood 100% and was happy to sit back...WAY outta immediate lag range and watch and cheer.  I even offered to help with any dragging (I dunno if you guys do that) 'cause I am warmly to Gor.<P>I understand that doing things as a Guild is important for morale, and once I got there it was obvious you had MORE than enough people.  Well...then I was informed that some people were very uncomfortable with me being there at all because of my ties with EK.  Pardon me, but wtf is that?<P>Guilt by association?  Was I there to steal Secret Tactics?  Jeez, people.  I would have hoped by now most of you would know me as a nice guy who just likes to help people and have fun and friends.  I guess I just don't understand....<P>Look..I am not gonna toot my own horn.  All I am gonna say is I spend almost all of my time on EQ for other people.  In between other peoples' quests, CR, or other needs, I like to have fun.<P>And on the topic of guild relations / competition.  I never did get this.  If it were up to me, all guilds would get along, be friends, and work around or WITH eachother.  But much like real life, EQ isn't ideal.  Guilds have reputations and pasts.  Mistakes are made, feelings are hurt.  And every guild deals with that differently.  Some close up to the rest of the server.  Some align themselves.  Many times, guilds change how they deal with it over time as well.<P>People who don't like Guild X and apply that to indiviuals really bother me.  It's no different than being racist.  I could say this about EK, but it really applies to all guilds.  ALL guilds have a couple people that maybe don't put the guild in a good light.  But if you don't see past that, you are gonna miss a ton a REALLY cool people and miss out on some good friendships.  Since EK was mentioned specifically to me, I would just like to say that EK has some of the most skilled, coolest, sweetest, and selfless people on the server in it.  If ya don't like 'em, I can't change yer opinion.  Not up to me to do that anyway.<P>But enough about other guilds.  This is between you and me.  If you don't want me helping or tagging along (in today's case, only talking about being in the general vacinity) because of something I did, I understand.  If it's because ya simply don't need me and I will just cause lag/confusion, ok np.  Maybe it's because you want to do it as a strict 'guild-ONLY' event - hey, I'm cool with that.  But when I am basically asked to leave cause I choose to spend a lot of time with a guild you don't like...I gotta say something.  And so I did...<P>The character I play, Reptak, can be summed up like this:<P>- Yes, I am in Axiom because they are my oldest and dearest friends.<BR>- Yes, I like to do fun things.<BR>- Yes, I do tend to join a lot of other guilds' raids.  9 times out of 10 there is never even a monk drop on the loot table.  I also believe in awarding loot by seniority.  It has never been about loot for me.  I do it cause a) they are my friends b)I enjoy raids and new experiences c) I like to see my friends get better equipped and be happy.<BR>- No, I DON'T judge PEOPLE by their guilds or affiliation.<BR>- No, I DON'T judge GUILDS by the actions of a few select people.<BR>- I enjoy the fact that I have a lot of friends and people trust me.  It means to world to me.  I didn't get these friends by just /waving and /cheering to people.  I EARNED it.<P>This was bound to happen to me sooner or later, I guess.  Hard to be friends with everyone when some of my friends don't get along.  But I still think it sucks.<P>In closing, I just wanna say that I still have the utmost respect and admiration for AD/DK.  I am just very sad because it appears to not be rescipricated.  This will not change about how I feel about my friends, but it still makes me very very sad.  As always, if you EVER need a hand with anything, just ask and don't think twice.  I hope you know I am always there to help.<P>-Reptak<P>--(Posted to both DK and AD boards)</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zretch</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey there Reppy.<P>I can tell you pretty confidently that the reason you wern't invited for Woushi or Gorenaire was because our dragon raids are closed.  Members and applicants only.<P>Why?  Well, dragons are quick to set up for, easy to get to, and are typically within easy distance from a port.  This means they make very convenient raids for everyone in our guild.  It's nice to have raids where you don't have to be there when people start breaking down or you're out of luck.  Some were logging in as buffing began.<P>There's where the problem comes in.  We like to include as many guild people on outdoor dragons as we possibly can simply because it's a fun time and it's convenient for everyone.  However, because we have such a large volume of people attending (everyone seems to enjoy coming out to kill a dragon ;-p) we're often strapped for healers for all of them.  The Woushi raid was a prime example.  8 groups, 2 of them had NO HEALING.  :P<P>Basically when our groups start filling up and we don't have the healers to make new groups, we have to close the raid down.  We also close the raid down to people just logging in once all groups are full and called just because it's a pain in the ass to reform groups.  If we allowed people to trickle in, we'd never get things started.  ;-)  How would you feel if you logged in and a member told you, "Sorry, Reppy, no room on the raid for you."  and when you looked at the raiding party, there were half a dozen people from other guilds there?<P>Our policy comes from the fact that we want to include as many people from AD and DK on these types of raids as possible, but also from the realization that we can't hold the raid open to additions forever or we'll never kill anything.  When the raid does close down to members, I want to make sure that we gave our members every opportunity to be involved.  This is something you'll see alot of in DF.  We typically have overwhelming numbers to do any given thing simply because when we hold a raid, we have nearly 100% participation of everyone online at the time.  Typically I can count on one hand the number of total people in both guilds that arn't attending any given raid, and normally the reason is that they have to log before the raid will get moving.  This means that adding people from other guilds, no matter who they are, often does nothing more than excludes members at some point or another.<P>I do hope that everyone understands that when we say we're holding a closed raid, we're doing so to give our members and our applicants the greatest chance to attend any given raid on any given night.  I've never felt bad about telling someone not in my guild that a raid is closed.  I fell very bad every time I tell a member of AD or DK that a raid is closed.  I'll certainly do the former to avoid having to do the latter.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Colron</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">yer still one of my favorite leezards reppy 8). btw im outts hammers 8)lol<P>------------------<BR>hit hard, hit fast, and have a healer ready cause boy will they be MAD!</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Keyes Sarabande</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Geesh Reptak, I've always considered you a friend of our guild like Fargus and others. <P>I don't quite understand how any EK association became involved with last night's raid and any message you may have recieved.  <P>You're assistance in corpse recovery in Western Wastes was greatly appreciated.
