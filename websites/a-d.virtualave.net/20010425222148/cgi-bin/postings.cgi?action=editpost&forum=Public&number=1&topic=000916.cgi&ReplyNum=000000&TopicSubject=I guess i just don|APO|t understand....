<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">***First off, if I could post this to members only section, I would.  To anyone NOT in AD/DK, please understand that what I am posting is about me and AD/DK only and shouldn't be interpreted a statement about how AD/DK treats people not in their guilds.  It's a unique situation in my mind and one that prolly only I am concerned with.***

I gotta be honest....I am more than a lil saddened.  I was killing some friends (and the occasional mob) in Velk's today and with my occasional nakid self ports to Kael, I saw you all were about to do Woushi.  As our group was breaking up, I saw you then were all moving to DL to kill Gor.  At this time I sent a tell to Corona offering my help.  I haven't really raided with ya'll in a lil while and I have always felt welcomed.  He informed me it was a closed raid and I understood 100% and was happy to sit back...WAY outta immediate lag range and watch and cheer.  I even offered to help with any dragging (I dunno if you guys do that) 'cause I am warmly to Gor.

I understand that doing things as a Guild is important for morale, and once I got there it was obvious you had MORE than enough people.  Well...then I was informed that some people were very uncomfortable with me being there at all because of my ties with EK.  Pardon me, but wtf is that?

Guilt by association?  Was I there to steal Secret Tactics?  Jeez, people.  I would have hoped by now most of you would know me as a nice guy who just likes to help people and have fun and friends.  I guess I just don't understand....

Look..I am not gonna toot my own horn.  All I am gonna say is I spend almost all of my time on EQ for other people.  In between other peoples' quests, CR, or other needs, I like to have fun.

And on the topic of guild relations / competition.  I never did get this.  If it were up to me, all guilds would get along, be friends, and work around or WITH eachother.  But much like real life, EQ isn't ideal.  Guilds have reputations and pasts.  Mistakes are made, feelings are hurt.  And every guild deals with that differently.  Some close up to the rest of the server.  Some align themselves.  Many times, guilds change how they deal with it over time as well.

People who don't like Guild X and apply that to indiviuals really bother me.  It's no different than being racist.  I could say this about EK, but it really applies to all guilds.  ALL guilds have a couple people that maybe don't put the guild in a good light.  But if you don't see past that, you are gonna miss a ton a REALLY cool people and miss out on some good friendships.  Since EK was mentioned specifically to me, I would just like to say that EK has some of the most skilled, coolest, sweetest, and selfless people on the server in it.  If ya don't like 'em, I can't change yer opinion.  Not up to me to do that anyway.

But enough about other guilds.  This is between you and me.  If you don't want me helping or tagging along (in today's case, only talking about being in the general vacinity) because of something I did, I understand.  If it's because ya simply don't need me and I will just cause lag/confusion, ok np.  Maybe it's because you want to do it as a strict 'guild-ONLY' event - hey, I'm cool with that.  But when I am basically asked to leave cause I choose to spend a lot of time with a guild you don't like...I gotta say something.  And so I did...

The character I play, Reptak, can be summed up like this:

- Yes, I am in Axiom because they are my oldest and dearest friends.
- Yes, I like to do fun things.
- Yes, I do tend to join a lot of other guilds' raids.  9 times out of 10 there is never even a monk drop on the loot table.  I also believe in awarding loot by seniority.  It has never been about loot for me.  I do it cause a) they are my friends b)I enjoy raids and new experiences c) I like to see my friends get better equipped and be happy.
- No, I DON'T judge PEOPLE by their guilds or affiliation.
- No, I DON'T judge GUILDS by the actions of a few select people.
- I enjoy the fact that I have a lot of friends and people trust me.  It means to world to me.  I didn't get these friends by just /waving and /cheering to people.  I EARNED it.

This was bound to happen to me sooner or later, I guess.  Hard to be friends with everyone when some of my friends don't get along.  But I still think it sucks.

In closing, I just wanna say that I still have the utmost respect and admiration for AD/DK.  I am just very sad because it appears to not be rescipricated.  This will not change about how I feel about my friends, but it still makes me very very sad.  As always, if you EVER need a hand with anything, just ask and don't think twice.  I hope you know I am always there to help.

-Reptak
