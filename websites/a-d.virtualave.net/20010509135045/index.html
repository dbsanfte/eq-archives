On Tuesday, I'm going to assume, everyone was feeling pretty good. Our own Dragon Force killed Venril Sathir, Talendor, Kelorek'Dar, Trakanon, and Wuoshi. Animals! I don't yet have all the details on drops but, most notably, we got some Mrylokar's Greaves, Eretria scored some Tolan's Darkwood Greaves, and Noruat nabbed a Blood Ember Breastplate. Congratulations to them.<p>We were pretty busy last night as well. First, a bunch of us swam out to Timorous Deep to help Fenani complete one of the last steps for her Druid epic weapon. Then we assembled as Dragon Force and killed the Dreadlands-inhabiting dragon Gorenaire. We killed him extremely fast, and after the fight I only saw one casualty. I think we've got this one down to a science. ;) I was disappointed to see that, once again, no book dropped for the Paladin epic. I'm really beginning to suspect something is wrong. He dropped a few things however...<p>- Druid Spell: Entrapping Roots -- <i>Tram</i><br>- Shaman Spell: Avatar -- <i>DK Guildfund</i><br>- Wizards Spell: Sunstrike -- <i>Tessera</i><br>- (x2)Hierophant's Crook -- <i>AD, DK Guildfunds</i><br>- Kyvruul's Mystical Pouch (10-slot, 100% weight reduction bag) -- <i>Xpoc</i><p>Immediately following the dragon slaying, we sent a small group into Karnor's Castle to kill Venril Sathir's remains. This yielded the final components for <b>two</b> of our rangers to complete their epic weapons. Congratulations to AD rangers Quoits and Blitze on completing the quest for this most impressive blade... Swiftwind<p><img src="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/swiftwind.jpg"><p>Then remainder of the night consisted of various questing, mostly for epic weapons and Veeshan's Peak keys. Another great night! I think you can definitely expect us to be quite busy this weekend.<p>Addendum: Congrats to Krowbar on finally completing the quest for the Warlord's Vambraces last night as well. They are simply amazing! <b>AC33 +5str +6sta +25hp +2svMagic +2svPoison</b>

The next day we decided to travel deeper, wanting to uncover some of the ancient secrets that lie within the walls of the Temple of Veeshan. Our presence was surely sensed as powerful guardian drakes were sent to dispatch us. They failed. We ventured further within the temple and found a suitable spot to set up our operations down one wing of the temple. It was there we pulled many creatures the likes of which none of us had ever seen. This was a true test of our strength and will. We began to fall back at the sheer force of the enemy pressure. However, we soon rallied back and established a solid footing which would later guide us through a day of success. Confidence grew within our forces and we killed beast after filthy beast. The gods smiled upon Altered Destiny this day.<p>- Ancient Tarnished Plate Vambraces -- <i>Krowbar</i><br>Yields the <b>Warlord's Vambraces</b> AC33 +5str +6sta +25hp +2svMagic +2svPoison<p>- Ancient Silk Gloves -- <i>Utanan</i><br>Yields the <b>Summoner's Gloves</b> Stats uknown as of yet.

We’ve been extremely busy in the Western Wastes, defiling the nests of countless dragons and dragonkin. A nice campsite was found where we can rest in relative safety during the off hours, while staying close to the action to minimalize travel time. During this time we’ve really had a chance to get some much-needed practice and refine our tactics.<p>Last night, the fruit of our labors could really be sensed as the dragon fell in record time and with astounding efficiency. For a large portion of the time, our pullers were casually strolling about the open terrain, looking for things to pull to the engagement site. We were literally killing dragons faster than they could spawn. <b>Zone cleared!</b><p>So much great new equipment was collected I gave up trying to keep track of everything. Suffice to say, everyone got some very nice upgrades. Today, Altered Destiny finishes up in the Western Wastes as we prepare for an epic return to *deep drum roll* the Temple of Veeshan! Stay tuned…<br>
