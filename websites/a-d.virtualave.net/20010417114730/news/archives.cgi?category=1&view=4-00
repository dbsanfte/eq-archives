This weekend certainly tops the cake.<p>Altered Destiny called out to the members to join in an unexpected trip to Hate.  We gathered in anticipation and our clearing began late.  Not only did we find a very nice camp for clearing a location we have all been wanting to experience, we also broke new ground!<p>Friday night Hate clear ran into the early morning of Saturday, the birds were chirping and the sun shown through most players windows as Innoruuk, God of Hate stood before Altered Destiny.<p>Altered Destiny stuck through the clear, and gathered for a shot at Innoruuk!  Nervously, Altered Destiny and one applicant stood in anticipation, not knowing what the outcome was going to be.  Altered Destiny was not armed with much knowledge on fighting Innoruuk, yet, it was time to find out just how difficult this god was.<p>Hearts raced and enthusiasm raged, our worst enemy was sleep deprivation.  The guild searched for a man to take the DT from Innoruuk, and the fingers were electing Altered Destiny's first time planes running monk Colron for taking this nasty blow.  Colron accepted, and we gathered in Innoruuks lair.<p>Wixramiablo says "Colron, walk to the end of this hallway slowly, sooner or later Innoruuk will see ya"<br>Colron says "Alrighty"<br>(everyone waits)<br>(everyone waits some more)<br>Aaric says "I don't see Inny on track.  Maybe he despawned?!"<br>Wixramiablo says "Nah.."<br>(Wixramiablo scurries down the hallway)<br>Wixramiablo says "I see him, he's coming this way.  Colron stand here..."<br>Innoruuk says "WIXRAMIABLO!"<br>Altered Destiny chuckles<br>Corona shouts "CHARGE!"<p>Altered Destiny and Innoruuk charged towards each other with great courage.  Even against a mighty foe, Altered Destiny remained strong and did not falter.  Our experience as a competent force shown bright and the players fought as if they have battled Innoruuk several times in the past!  A revultant rat joined in the fray creating more opposition to the forces of Altered Destiny!<p>Inny dropped like a rock to the fury of Altered Destiny.  Our numbers were few and the groups were not well rounded, yet Innoruuk had not a chance to survive!<p>When Innoruuk fell, only 5 players were lifeless, 4 of them caused by fingers of death, the later was from a falling incident.  Nonetheless, our battles did not end here.  Innoruuk brought friends upon his demise.  Two Ire Ghasts and a Spite wailed on all weary and beaten Members.  Battle cries rang out, swords clashed and the drained mages continued casting.  Altered Destiny did not lose faith, and were victorious!  All critters were dismissed, yet the tolls of death were high.  Nearly 18 out of 28 players were killed during the assault.<p>Cheers to Altered Destiny for taking down their very first God all in-guild with so few players!!!  Only 2 clerics being available certainly created a very intense atmosphere.<p>Congratulations to the following for recieving the prizes Innoruuk held as his possessions!<br>Zretch -- Beckon 2hs 30/42 +10int!  Zretch rocks house with this new toy, producing roughly 120damage per blow!<br>Corona -- Diamond Rod 1hb 10/30 Effect of Diamondskin  (uses a peridot as a reagent, 15 second charge delay)  Hits for roughly 20damage a shot with suprising accuracy!<p>Maestro was slain as well, congratulations to Fraglet (of Vengence) for recieving a Six Noted Blade!<p>During our Plane of Hate clear (Friday, Saturday) the following items were recieved!  Many of these items are extremely rare.<br>Nemasis -- Apothic Robe! AC11 5dex 12sta 14int 40mana<br>Aenadin -- Apothic Robe! AC11 5dex 12sta 14int 40mana<br>Wixramiablo -- Shadow Woven Gauntlets!

Instead of camping repops, AD gated down to Nektolus forrest to try thier hands at the Fire Giants!<p>Congrats to the following!<br>Aaric -- Polished Mithril Torque AC7 13int 13wis<br>Alumar -- Polished Mithril Mask  AC5 7int 7wis<br>Orbitalx -- Razing Sword of Skarlon!  2hs 25/40 Effect of Serpent Sight<p><br>Quite a fantastic weekend!  Cheers to Altered Destiny for sticking it through the night and dropping Innoruuk!  Many members are certainly pleased with the drops and our caster section certainly appears well equiped!<p>Another round of cheers should go to the following players for their kind donations to the guild fund!<br>Jaelen donated 226 Platinum!<br>Orbitalx donated a Mithril Two-Handed Sword after recieving a Razing Sword of Skarlon!  The sword was traded for a GCB which in turn was traded for coin and an EB breastplate.  After trades were complete, the Sword brought in 7000 Platinum!!<p><br>This weekend, Altered Destiny again astounded many players in and out of guild with their determination and success!  Congratulations to you all on your superior accomplishments!

Not only was Altered Destiny successful, the break was beautifully orchestrated!  Congratulations to you all for all the hard work grouping, training, and working together.  Altered Destiny now stands as one of the few guilds able to break fear all within guild!<p>During the break, every member stayed calm, cool and focused on accomplishing specific goals.  Everything flowed together naturally, and the run was exciting and entertaining.  The CR and Clerics did their jobs perfectly, without complaints and CR'd corpses in a relatively short time with what we were dealing with.  The pull group pulled perfect size pulls and in good consistancy.  The whole run basically ran itself!<p>Many months spent fighting Hate denizens, Fire giants, and in Kedge have trained the guild into being able to do this sort of run.  A run which was not possible 3 months ago through hard work has become easy.  It was apparant that Fear critters were a pushover compared to the nasties in Hate.  To all whom attending, cheers for battling through the night and into the wee hours of the morning!
