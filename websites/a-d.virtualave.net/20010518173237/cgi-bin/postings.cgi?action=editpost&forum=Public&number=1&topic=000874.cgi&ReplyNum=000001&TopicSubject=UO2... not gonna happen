<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I am truly saddened by this game being cancelled, here is some more info for those interested:

GameSpyDaily met up with Richard Garriott (Lord British) yesterday at the GDC in San Jose, and asked him about the recent cancellation of Ultima Online 2 just to see what his thoughts were. This is what he had to say:


"As everyone else has heard, I have heard that Origin is now shut down both as a name, which happened a few months ago, as well as the product Ultima Online 2, and the Harry Potter game and a variety of other services. For me, on the one hand, its very sad to see the company that I founded and sheparded for 20 years to basically be coming to a close as an era, so that's kind of sad. And also to see all of my friends... I've got 85 of my best friends that just got laid off. On the other hand, personally, it could be an opportunity in the sense that my non-compete [agreement with EA] runs out here in about 8 days, and I was debating how to hire a team to get back into the business and I know a lot of the best people, a lot of my best friends who were at Origin, were very committed to their team and to their project and to the leadership around them within that company. Of course there was a non-solicit clause in my non-compete, so it would have been difficult for me to build a team. Well, suddenly now its not so difficult, so its going to be interesting for me to go back to Austin and start up discussions with the large stable of close friends who are now looking for something to do, right about the time that I'm looking for something to do, so that should be fun."

We also ran into a couple of people who were prominent members of the UO2 development team and asked them their thoughts on what had just happened to them.


"Electronic Arts has capitulated in the online war for market share in the massively multiplayer online game market. The capitulated. They gave up. There's a fundamental misunderstanding among EA top executives about what would make a successful massively multiplayer game in terms of bringing in revenue long-term. They went for the short term gain at a very extreme long-term cost."

"The code for combat was done. Magic was done. Banking was done. Secure trading was done. The interface was completely re-written. We had a completely playable game that needed a huge balance pass but was certainly achievable. Beyond that, I leave you to draw your own conclusions about my current thoughts."

Already it seems as though online petitions are springing up all over the UO2 community, as fans struggle to keep their game alive. But the harsh reality of the cancellation is unlikely to change any time soon. EA has spoken.</TEXTAREA>
