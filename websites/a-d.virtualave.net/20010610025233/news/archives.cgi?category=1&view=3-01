</center><A NAME="985979018"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="4" FACE="arial"><b>A Great Day For Dragon Force...</FONT></b><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="1" FACE="arial"> - submitted by: <A HREF="mailto:mesmerist@blackcodemail.com">meeks</A> @ 14:03 EST 3/30/01</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">We certainly made the best of a weeknight last night as we accomplished much. Our night started out in the Dreadlands. As members began to log in, we amassed a small army. We knew it would be up to a couple hours before most of our west coast-based members logged in and we were itching for some action. So we decided to have a go at Gorenaire with a force much smaller than what we are used to employing against the king of the Dreadlands. Lacking greatly in several key classes, we prepared with what resources we had. The battle started slow and it looked like we might have a chance, until Gorenaire began to cast complete heal on himself. This weighed the odds in the dragon’s favor and, finally, we fell. Gorenaire had less than 10% of his health remaining, but walked away the victor.<p>Disppointed with the defeat, we reassembled with newfound purpose. We had defeated Gorenaire before and could not stop until he was dead. We reorganized, making a few changes in the group configurations, going over our strategy with a fine-tooth comb. Again, we got into formation as Eretria, the dragon-pulling extraordinaire, taunted the dragon towards his fate. Gorenaire was obviously enraged and frustrated at our persistence. We pummeled the dragon this time with overwhelming vengeance and he hardly had time to cast his powerful spells. Gorenaire quickly met his doom at an alarmingly fast rate. As we studied the aftermath, it came to our attention that we had suffered <b>one casualty!</b> One death against a foe of this caliber was something to celebrate and celebrate we did.<p><i>Found on Gorenaire’s corpse:</i><p>-	Shaman Spell: Torpor – DK Guildfund<br>-	Cleric Spell: Word of Redemption – Shiyenne<br>-	Wizard Spell: Sunstrike – Bryek<br>-	Shaman Spell: Avatar<br>-	Warhammer of Divine Grace<br>-	McVaxious Horn of War -- DK Guildfund<br>-	Dragon Bone Bracer – AD Guildfund<p>After a brief celebration, we headed down the Old Sebilis for yet another encounter. It was time to complete the quest for the <b>Singing Short Sword</b> for our own <b>Dyahannah</b>. Without going into details, Dyahannah turned in the components for her quest and immediately spawned our old friend Trakanon! Forewarned of his expected appearance, we were prepared for Trakanon. He was felled by our forces with relative ease and we were rewarded with the following:<p>- <b>Trakanon Guts</b> (the final component in the quest for the Singing Short Sword) – Dyahannah!<p>- <b>Mrylokar’s Breastplate</b> AC35, +10 Str, +10 Sta, +10 Agi, +10 Dex, -10 Wis, -10 Int, +5 Cha, +50 HP, LORE MAGIC Effect of Invigorate -- Wixramiablo<p>Dyahannah in turn completed the quest for the following:<p><b>Singing Short Sword</b>: Dmg 16, Dly 26. Wt 2.00. +15 Str, +10 Sta, +10 Dex, +15 Cha, +10 vsMg, +10 vsFire, +10 vsCold, +10 vsPos, +10 vsDis, +50 HP, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Dance of the Blade, BRD Only<p>Congratulations Dyahannah and the rest of Dragon Force on an evening of epic proportions!

My dog ate them! We've been very busy nonetheless, doing things like killing dragons, completing quests, and gaining some much needed experience. Here's the skinny...<p>A few days after the recent patch which contained the updates to the older planes, we traveled to the Plane of Fear and had a blast. We killed everything we saw and got some decent loot. Most notably, the newly strengthened Dracoliche dropped some most uber items! A <b>Grotesque Girdle</b> was awarded to our own Corona. We also received a <b>Fearsome Shield</b> which was won by Brikk! We will most certainly be back to pay a visit to the new and improved Cazic Thule, Dragon Force syle. Stay tuned...<p>I will be brief with the rest of our events between then and now as my notes are tragically incomplete and my brain is currently receiving less than its fair share of oxygen, most likely due to congestive mass of malted hops and dwarf innerds shacking up somewhere inside my battleworn frame. Enough about me.<p>We waxed Talendor again. This guy must really be starting to hate us. Remember the scene in Jurassic Park where the guy is sitting on the john when a T-Rex comes up and bites his head off? I'd imagine Talendor was having a similar experience that day. His drops...<p>- Cleric Spell: Aegis -- Spewidette<br>- Cleric Spell: Divine Intervention -- Mufin<br>- Cleric Spell: Banishment of Shadows -- Mystica<br>- Orb of Tishania -- Keyes<br>- (x2) Gauntlets of Fiery Might -- Adol, Mikekil<br>- Cloak of Flames -- Prellius<br>- Red Dragonscale -- DK Guildfund<p>We killed Trakanon several days later. Not exactly our smoothest raid to date as, in the interest of time, we had to fight him in the hallway. We looted a <b>Mrylokar's Breastplate</b> upon his death, after which five No Drop teeth and a Cloak of Piety rotted when the jugger train wiped us. Not a lot of fun folks, but worth a little chuckle I suppose, in retrospect. Maglan won the breastplate. Congrats Maglan!<p>Then, a couple days ago, we popped Wuoshi and Severilous. The loot goes something like this...<p><i>Wuoshi:</i><br>- Druid Spell: Protection of the Glades<br>- Magician Spell: Monster Summoning 3<br>- Skydarkener (a bow) -- Blitze<br>- Tanglewood Shield -- Psawed<br>- (x2)Emerald Dragonscale -- Bisrach, Johnko<p><i>Severilous</i><br>- Wizard Spell: Dictate<br>- Shaman Spell: Avatar -- Johnko<br>- Talisman of the Raptor -- Johnko<br>- Dragon Hero Bracer -- Adol<br>- Shield of the Green Dragon -- Zorkmid<br>- Orb of Tishania -- Glayde<p>Nice run there.<p>Which brings us to last night. We were a little bored and our scouts noticed that Gorenaire was out plundering the icy mountains of the Dreadlands. So we payed a little visit...<p>Gorenaire's loot:<p>- Necromancer Spell: Enslave Death -- Mezzik<br>- Wizard Spell: Disintegrate -- Bryek<br>- Wizard Spell: Flaming Sword of Zomm -- Misteus<br>- Druid/Magician Spell: Banishment -- Nemasis<br>- Wizard Spell: Winds of Gelid -- Misteus<br>- Warhammer of Divine Grace -- Winnikin<br>- White Dragonscale -- Cymrych<p>Congratulations Dragon Force!
