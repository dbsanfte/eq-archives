He asked me to "run to Sebilis and pick him up a Fellhammer". Since he was too low level to go get one for himself, I was obviously going to have a deep sympathy for him and instantly rush out to obtain one for the poor lad!<P>Needless to say, a severely humorous conversation ensued, much like yours. I remember him mentioning that he is 18 years old, he lives in Las Vegas, and his girlfriend is 35 years old. I was so utterly impressed by this that I had to let him know it in a special Meeks kind of way. Judging by the all caps obscenities that followed, he didn't feel like he had gained my complete respect. Nor did he get his Fellhammer.

I can't believe that's the guy you were talking to Wix.  Or rather, having spoken with him myself I can believe it.  A couple of weeks ago I was in DL and got a random tell from this guy asking me to come pick him up in OT to port him somewhere.  I didn't even find out where he wanted to go since after I replied: "Sorry I'm busy right now and the zone you are in would take me atleast 20-30 minutes to get there" he got all worked up and started trying to lay on the guilt trip while still managing to be insulting and demeaning.<P>Anyhow a couple of days later Mufin sends me a tell asking who Mechnakal is and I reply I have no idea.  Seems that he was trying to get in touch with me again (for ports/buffs/heading to Seb to pick him up a set of cobalt no doubt) and since I had him on ignore by this point was being rather abusive towards her, demanding to know why I wasn't responding to him lol.<P>They really need to make it where if you are on ignore and you send the person that has you on ignore it tells you.  Good show Wix, that was hilarious.<P>Jae</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Elohim</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">So bascially, AD has a stalker?   <IMG SRC="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>My advice to all members, when now traveling make sure your in pairs.

I sent Plaktu a tell asking him about it. His replay was he'd never mentioned helping the guy, was just recruited without concent LOL. For the next hour or so he was bitching about all high lvl people and what dip **** we were. He got quite a few replies in ooc from many people in the zone telling him to shut up it was so bad.

Apparently, I ported him a few times (and like most porters, we ported LOTS of people). He even remembered how many times I ported him (apparently). He said he considers me a "pal". I have no memory of him what so ever, except from what I've read here. It seems that he remembers people who "helps" him in one way or another and then comes back much later in life and ask for favors or claims that he "knows" you. I personally don't have anything against the guy, but I pretty much ignored his request to "talk" to my guild mate. <P>Funny thing was, after he gave up on me, he spoke to another guild mate asking the same thing. Of course, that other guild mate didn't know who the heck he was, but Mech was trying to use him, as he tried to use me, to "convince/threaten/whatever" the guild mate who wouldn't group with him to group with him (run on sentences, ya gotta lovem). The reason why he wouldn't group with him in the first place is because he grouped with him before and simply refuses to group with him again. I don't know the details about that though, but as this guy seems to have a very bad reputation. Poor Ret wants to “strangle him”, bless her soul.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldures</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks Wix, I just burned my freakin nostrils when my coffee spewed out of them!!!!!
