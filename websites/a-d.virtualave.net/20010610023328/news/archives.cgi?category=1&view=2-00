I use it all the time when I play and it REALLY helps out when you are grouped with people that are using the program. You don't have to type and that can save your life when you are in a big battle. All you need to use this program is a 56K modem and a headset. If you don't have a microphone you can listen to others while you fight. Think about it, NO TYPING.... what more can I say).<br>Be safe.<br>p.s. the program only costs $5 to register and is well worth it. You have a 15 day trial period to see if you like the program before purchasing it.<br>

The patches that were related to reducing the amount of drops in hate are definately in full force.  Although I believe the drops in general went from too many to too little, we recieved a few nice objects.<p>Congrats to the following:<br>Lammi (Non-guilded)  Cleric Shield (Prismatic Shield)<br>Mairi (AOD) Cleric gloves.  (All members present already had the gloves.  Although Mairi was not with us, she recieved the gloves before decay)<br>Fathersin (COS)  Shaman Boots<br>Lull (COS)  Enchanter Legs<br>Wixramiablo (SOR)  Jacinth for all of his fine tactical plays and timeless scouting and deaths.<p>All in all, throughout the day, the adventure was a large success.  Very few out of guild members joined with us.  (Can't even think of more then 2 actually)  Many various sor/bos/vod/cos players grouped in hate throughout the day and night.  Many perfect pulls were performed with the help of Natalia, Krowbar, Zretch, Wixramiablo, Maglan and Xiaohai!  Not a single train formed throughout the day.  Only one large massacre occured while spawns began to pop as we sat in the Maestro of Rancor's room.<p>Maestro of Rancor was also dismissed with the above guilds and AOD working in combination -- the drop was a bard weapon (Six Noted Blade)  Since Glayde of BOS already had the blade, the weapon was defaulted to Adres of AOD.<p>During the event, not only were we accepted and battling next to other very large guilds, we also recieved a few more proposals for alliance guilds.  We will look into these other guilds as they become publicly announced by their guild leaders on the SOR website.<p>Roughly 12 people camped in plane of hate due to SOR's very own monk (Xiaohai) falling asleep at the keyboard.   This seems to be a rather large issue which effects sor very often :)  Certainly, 15 hours in the plane was not that awefully long.  All are invited to group Sunday 1/20/00 at 11:00am est and enter POH at 12:00PM est.  The remaining members of the previous nights battles will be logging in at precisely 12:00PM EST.  Please form groups and begin migration to the SW corner of Plane of Hate at this time.  Although Corona may not be available during the beginning of the day, send /tells to other sor/bos members and influentials (tuvas, krowbar, glayde etc..)<p>Cheers and good night!<p>    --Corona

Those whom knew him well were fortunate to have him amongst their presence.  Shoog will be remembered as the roleplaying ogre with a dry sense of humor.  Many times i found myself laughing at a computer screen for some simple comment Shoog placed into /gsay with an ogre like accent.<p>Shoogs commitment to the guild he grew up with (BOS) was forever strong.  Shoog devoted his time into developing players to higher levels or fighting for equipment for them.  Never did he complain, nor did i ever hear this ogre ask for a single item.  He was always there to help another player with whatever they desired.  Shoog spent countless hours to give the many upcoming members something to look forward.  This ogre warrior holds my utmost regards for assisting the guilds into becoming something truely great.  This warrior always was with every large event which was planned and always playing an integral role -- never failing to show, and never being late nor a burden on anyone.  To this, I applause him.<p>Many are positive SOR and BOS will become a guild which can accomplish any goal--Dragons/Planes and any player experience which may take multiple large groups to achieve.  Shoog was a dedicated member whom made this yet to become (virtual) reality take place.  These changes have been happening, SOR/BOS moves forward every day in rapid progression.  All of the players whom grow to find these events happenening as if it has happened since the beginning of Rodcet Nife should know this:  Shoog is one of the many whom created this environment for all of you to enjoy.  Every day we work on accomplishing goals, strengthening our guild, and training the high level players and giving these high level players an exciting atmosphere.<p>We have achieved many of our goals faster then expected, yet, there is much more to be understood of these hostile territories.  Our guilds will eventually perform any run, no matter how big nor small.  To all the players whom may wonder in the future, just how these events began to happen, remember that Shoog did more then his fair share to bring this enjoyment to everyone.<p>Many members of course would like to see more from their leaders and higher level guild members.  And, many of these high level players would like to please them.  But, at the same time, these high level players, while having fun, are accomplishing new goals for the guild as a whole to set a standard to in order to open up a whole variety of possible runs which EQ has to offer.  This is not easy at all, we run very large risks of death, and the possibility of loosing every item each player has on many of the events.  At the same time we must understand and learn these new terrains-- How to break them and remain in control within the gaming environment.  Many of the upcoming players will take these runs for granted which in the future will not be as difficult to perform as they are currently.  These possibilities which we are opening to all are very time consuming and difficult to accomplish, taxing everyone whom participates in them at our current time.  Regarding these big plane runs, Shoog was a player whom would do anything the general leader asked him to do without complaining--even in times when he believed the outcome was going to be grim.  Its a process of failures until success -- and Shoog played an integral role risking much more then most.  He gave many members help in understanding the environment they are battling in and with this have made the planes a regular adventure to us all.  All should applaude Shoog for his dedication and assistance!<p>Although Shoog has seen more then most, and experienced many large events, his stay in EQ has worn.   Many high level members experience this with only few viable solutions which mainly are unacceptable reasons in the decision to stay.  If all knew how many hours Shoog has into the game, well, not only would Shoog be embarrassed, I would make myself look like a newbie.  His stay has not been short, trust me on this one.  Shoog has decided to retire due to a multitude of reasons--the game and time spent in it being the major determining factor.  Although Shoog retires, many will still remember him and miss him for many months to come.<p>Sincerly,<br>--Corona<p>Shoog, Wherever you go, and whatever you find, I hope its everything you rightfully deserve!

On this calendar we will post guild events. Once a guild event is post you must ADD yourself to the event to show us you are going to be there. It is very simple to use. In the headline PUT YOUR NAME, in the content say you are coming or not. Its that simple. If you make a mistake and wish to have the entry deleted email me and I will remove the entry. PLEASE only sign up to say you are coming if you are 99.9% sure you are going to be there otherwise this isn't going to work.<br>Thanks)

Now I don't know if it's the winter blues or the thought of valentines day with/without a valentine or whatever. All I know is lets change this around a bit and have some FUN!!!! We have new members I am sure everyone would like to get to know and put a face too). I suggest we have a little guild EVENT this Saturday in the Freeport Arena (Duel anybody muahahah). I was thinking this event could start at NOON EST time. It doesn't have to be an all day event but spending a few hours together while drinking and fighting doesn't seem like a bad idea. Then we can all head on over to oasis and let Kiladen terrorize the zone by letting him pull some of his legendary Spectre Trains). Who knows maybe this time he can pull a few Sg's along with those specs). Please let me know if you wish to attend by submitting your name in the events section of the message board under FP EVENT. <br>Thanks<br>
