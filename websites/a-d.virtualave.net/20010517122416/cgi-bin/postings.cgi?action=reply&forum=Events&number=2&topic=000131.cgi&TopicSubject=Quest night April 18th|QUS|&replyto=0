[B]If there isnt anything planned wed or if there is something like Plane of air which only certian people can go to.  WOuld anyone be interested in camping named wurms in BW.  Below is the detail directions I copied from Nemasis who copied it from someone else.  If your in the low 50s i think you should get a decent amount of exp here. Not great but some.  There is also a chance that the big named wurm Nezerkeneza(whatever) will drop the 0 weight shoulder slot which is UBER.  Notice its weight is 0.0


1) Get a full group up and head to Burning Woods. You can bring less than a full group but it is safer with a group and you can't do it solo.

2) Head to this loc in BW: NEG 463.94 , NEG 2549.86 -- That is Nek's spawn point.

3) If nek or the named bard wurm is up pull him to that spot and kill him there. If not pull any mob in the area to that spot and kill them there. 

4) Once you get the correct mob killed every 1-2 mins a mob will spawn at that loc. The PH can be anything ...wurms, bee, skelly, etc. Once they start spawning you can stop pulling the trash mobs. Just defend the spot when the trash roams to you. Nek is a random pop and only spawns at that loc. Keep killing the PH'ers until nek pops. The named bard wurm will also spawn there. The bard wurm will summon but nek won't. That and the roaming trash is why you need to bring a group. 

I have seen nek pop 3 times in a row and not pop for over 2 hours... it is random. Now as for the nek loot this is what it is:

Common - Nothing
Uncommon - Burning Embers/bard quest gut item
Rare- Shoulder piece 20 sv fire, 10 sv magic, 8ac, 0.0 weight all/all[/B][/QUOTE]

I try to give good details to make it easier.<BR>*copied*<P>Captain rottgrime<P>Pulling Rottgrime is a simple monk chain-pull. <BR>This pull is best done after 11pm game time, it is then that the Dragoons and General are out. <BR>You need to have one person that is non-kos to the outpost. <P>1. From the east side of the outpost, park your group a good ways out. <BR>2. Send your hailer (the non-kos person) into the outpost to target Rottgrime, than have hom wait at the FD spot. <BR>3. When the Golem has moved to it's closests point near the ocean (north), have your monk sneak in to the south, huggin the wall, to where Rottgrime is. <BR>5. The Golem paces between sides of the entrance. After he has moved to the left most position and starts to make his way back to the north most, have your monk grab Rottgrime and his marines and run to the FD spot and FD. <BR>*****Note**** <BR>DO NOT use weapons to pull Rottgrime, he is levle 55 and will summon you. Run into his aggro-range to pull him. <BR>6. Once the monk FD's, have your hailer start spam-hailing Rottgrime. Just like you do with Hasten. DO NOT let the monk /quit out to clear aggro. As long as the monk stays FD, hailing Rottgrime will keep him, if the monk LD's or /quits out, Rottgrime will move back to his spawn point and will not respond to hails until then. <BR>7. Wait, wait, wait. Wait until you cannot see any of the mobs, an then wait a little longer. If you have a second non-kos person. Have them go back with the mobs to the outpost and let the group know when all the mobs are back to the spawn point. <BR>*****Note***** <BR>(for those of you that do not know, when a mob returns to his spawn point, all hate is always removed) <BR>8. Once the mobs have returned to their spawn point, have your puller (not the monk) pull Rottgrime to the group. The monk should stand then FD, then repeat a few times to be sure that the golem is not still on his hate list. <BR>9. Kill Rottgrime, loot. <P>*****Notes***** <BR>Rottgrime was a very easy kill once we singled him out. (First attempt, we though we had him single, but were too close to the golem when we pulled and had all the marines, the golem, a dragoon, and the General add. 100% wipe-out) <P>Our group: <BR>51 monk <BR>53 cleric <BR>53 enchanter <BR>53 magician <BR>52 necromancer <BR>53 druid <P>Rottgrime has decent magic resistance, even after tashania our necro and enchanter were resisted on all DD's. Our mage was able to hit for max. All DoT's stuck. Snare stuck, but the earth pet's root was resisted. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">xpoc</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Here is another mob our guild doesnt do very often and I thought maybe i mentiion it. I think it has epic pieces for mage and enchanter.<P><BR>Neh'Ashirr, The City of Mist<BR>City of mist<P>first off no you dont have to kill all reavers. you have to kill the first one which will spawn either lord gahisk or another reaver right after the first is dead. 3 reavers in a row can spawn. to get the first reaver yes you will need a rogue to open a door. i am not sure of the skill the rogue will need. we have a level 60 rogue and a 49 rogue both of them can open all of the doors needed. btw it is better to have a level 55 plus pull the mobs if you can. getting singles makes this place alot easier. set up a camp in the courtyard area and have the rogue and puller head across the bridge. there will be a door to the right where the first reaver is. try to pull all of the mobs in the room single and bring them to the courtyard to kill. after the mobs with the reaver are dead pull the reaver. NOTE reavers are 100% magic resistent with alot of HP. make sure you have tanks and lots of em. kill the reaver it will spawn the lord, like i said there may be up to 3 reavers before the lord pops. but all pops are right after the previous mob dies. kill the lord and have everyone move up into the room where the reaver was..next the puller will open the door on the right and pull the hall mobs into the room. make sure everyone is in the middle and not near the walls so you dont aggro the hall mobs. kill all of those and go through the right door into the hall. make a right and move into corner. continue killing hall mobs up the ramp. now it GETS HARD. up the ramp you will see another door ahead of you DONT go in there and try to avoid it. there is a invisable wall you can walk through on the right side of the wall next to the door. NOTE have everyone turn off run and remove sow or jboots. there is a series of see through ramps to go up, and if you fall off you are screwed. have the pull go alone and try to bring the mobs at the top of the ramps down to there hall to kill. clear that room at the top then have one group at a time go on up slowly. stay in the middle of that room to or you will aggro mobs in next room. pull next room and kill then move out on the walkway to the corner. you will see another door ahead that needs to be picked. have the rogue stay up there and keep opening the door while the puller brings the mobs in there to the corner to kill. NOTE make sure the rogue always uses hide sneak. clear that room and move in. BTW the whole series after the first reaver is VERY hard without teamwork. now your in a room waiting. the puller needs to continue on and pull the mobs up ahead. outside the next door of the room there is another walkway. there are missing pieces of the walkway so have run off and sow gone again. then move out there in a single file line to the corner. this is where you will fight the reaver that spawns neh ashir. the tanks MUST surround them so they dont fall off if they do your dead unless you all get camped out. otherwise he will summon peeps down and beat them to death hehe. anyway kill the reaver then lord neh ashir will spawn. NOTE up to 4 reavers can spawn first so be ready for a LONG HARD fight. the lord is very hard, has around 32000 HP and hits real hard. again 100% magic resistent, so be ready for a long fight. the torch is also a rare drop *sigh* so be prepared to have to go back a couple times. the ornate rune shield is the common drop so atleast you will get yourself and your casters a kickass item while trying. i hope this helps some man. if at all possible have a level 60 pull. thats what we do and he gets single mobs EVERY time. good luck to you. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bryek</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Doing WW tonight X.
