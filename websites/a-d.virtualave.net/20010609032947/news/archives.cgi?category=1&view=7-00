</center><A NAME="963345181"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="4" FACE="arial"><b>Altered Destiny is Accepting New Members!</FONT></b><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="1" FACE="arial"> - submitted by: <A HREF="mailto:Audioman@mindspring.com">Corona</A> @ 15:53 EST 7/11/00</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Nearly 5 months ago, Altered Destiny closed their doors from accepting new members into the guild.  Over the last 5 months, only a handful of players were invited into AD, apologies to those whom applied yet did not receive any response from the guild.  At the time, we had more members then we could take care of.  Doors were closed in order for the guild to care to the existing member base.  Time has moved on since then, and once again, we have room for new members!<p>Altered Destiny has never been a guild which actively recruits players, instead, we look for players whom come to us explaining their interests to join the Altered Destiny guild.  We expect quite a bit out of our members, we look for interesting personalities with a passion to play the game of EverQuest, even through the release of Kunark.  We are not interested in players whom wish to join the guild for items or to simply be part of an organized guild structure -- these types of players will be turned away.  AD members currently work with each other in order to overcome goals and challenges which can be celebrated between members.  AD is a close community of players whom help differing members in turn to benefit the guild as a whole.<p>If you have interest in joining AD, share a love for the Everquest game and wish to be involved in a guild consisting of a mature player base, then feel free to apply to our guild!  Currently we are looking for members whom have reached the 47th level (although lower level players will be considered, we have difficulty catering to the lower level players).<p>In order to become a member, one will be required to become an applicant to the guild, in which the applicant will be under review for a period around one month in length.  Members will vote on all applicants, and acceptable applicants will become members.  Even though an applicant will not become a member instantly, the applicant will get to know the members of AD, our raids, structures, organization while taking part in the majority of Altered Destiny's guild events!<p>Players whom applied in the past whom were never contacted, please feel free to re-apply!  We look forward in meeting new players with charismatic personalities!<p>Cheers!<br>--Corona<p>The following information is included in this news page due to the problems with our webpage.  Unfortunately the source code to this webpage has been lost, with some luck, the following information should be contained in a separate page in the near future.<p>Application Procedures<p>Altered Destiny consists of a like-minded grouping of working class players.  Raids are usually scheduled around the 9am to 5pm working schedule for eastern to pacific time zones.  Members are proud of their in-guild achievements yet they do not care to brag of the guilds accomplishments.  AD members are motivated to increase the guild's abilities without focusing purely on themselves or push themselves specifically for materialistic gain.  Altered Destiny is always searching for players whom share a passion for the game of Everquest.  We welcome players whom wish to excel while at the same time remaining charismatic, positive and surrounded by other mature players.<p>If you are interested in becoming a member of AD, please follow the instructions given below in order to both facilitate our role and yours.<p>Step 1 - Review the rules/policies of the Altered Destiny(AD) guild, and be willing to abide by them.  Altered Destiny enforces these rulesets and expects all members to uphold an above average level of common decency in any and all forms.  Our rulesets can be found here:  http://a-d.virtualave.net/Rules/rules.html<p>Step 2 - Submit a post on the Altered Destiny public message forum detailing your name, level and class of all your characters (clearly state your primary character).  Include a thorough description of your interests and expectations of why you have applied to AD.  Be sure to mention previous guilds you have been a member of and an associated explanation on the reasons of departure if pertinent.  Explaining previous raid experience will also help AD properly prepare you for accompanying Altered Destiny on any raids you may attend while under evaluation (Raid experience is not mandatory for guild acceptance).<p>Note: If you are just looking for a guild to join, then AD is probably not the best choice for you.  If AD finds an interest applied to another guild at the same time and views the request as a serious intent, you will not be considered.<p>Step 3 - The Board of Review is comprised of Altered Destiny members Lastel Silverstone, Eretria Silverthorn and Gylen which handle all players whom express interest in joining the guild of Altered Destiny --  Be patient, the members of the Board of Review evaluate each expressed interest in turn.  After an initial review of your interests to join Altered Destiny, you may be contacted by a member of the Board of Review either in game or through the public message forums.  The members of the Board of Review will assist in answering any questions or concerns you may have.  At any time the Board of Review may elevate your interest in joining AD into the status of an applicant.  Your application will then be moved from the public message forum to the members only applicant forum, in order to facilitate our work.<p>Step 4 -   During this time you are invited to attend as many guild raids/events as you can, as well, you are encouraged to group with AD members as much as possible. In the case of raids, the applicant should not expect to be included in loot lotto's, but may receive items should the event leader find it appropriate.  Please be prepared for any guild raids, if you are in need of keys (IE: Old Sebilis) you may ask any member of the Board of Review (or the member you speak with commonly) to arrange some sort of key hunting schedule. Make sure to plan ahead of time because obtaining keys will not be done just before the raid -- this applies for non-guilded and guilded individuals.  An applicant is not responsible for money related items used during raids unless requested (in which case the applicant will be reimbursed by the guilds Treasury).<p>Roughly after a review period of one month, the existing guild members will be asked to vote upon the applicant.  Spending as much time as possible with the members of Altered Destiny allows the guild as a whole to judge the abilities and personality of the applicant. In general we are looking for individuals who are able to play their class efficiently, able to cooperate and work well with group members and other groups, ability to take orders or lead if necessary and of course a player whom is enjoyable to be around.<p>Step 5 - If any guildmember objects to the applicant at any time during the one month period, the applicant will be informed that an invite will not be given.  If after one month the guild has found that the applicant would be a good addition to AD, then he/she will be welcomed into our ranks and invited as a member.<p>--Altered Destiny
