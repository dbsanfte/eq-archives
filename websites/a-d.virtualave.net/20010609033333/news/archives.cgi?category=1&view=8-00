Altered Destiny has been extremely active over the last few weeks, not only reviewing new members to fill the guild, training as well as heavy raiding in new and exciting locations!<p>Altered Destiny has been raiding various locations where no one on Rodcet Nife has been.  The new runs have been difficult, and trying on all members.  Most of the new environments have been extremely hostile as our members are not quite level 60 yet.  Yet, we have been doing incredibly well meeting objectives and completing goals Altered Destiny has put in front of them!<p>Over the past several weeks, Altered Destiny has frequently visited Trakanon's Lair in deep Sebilis!  We are trainign for the day where we can take down the biggest dragon outside of Veeshans Peak constantly.  Altered Destiny has been very successful in the clearing of Trakanons lair, and have even become quite versed in properly evading Trakanon himself!<p>Over the last 3 weeks, we have tackled the Jaugernots, learning their ways, their tactics and their weekness's.  In doing so, we have pulled named Golems right from under the feet of Trakanon, sometimes without him noticing.  While our tactics are nearly complete for a successful and effecient clear of Trakanon's Lair, we still have some work to do!<p>On Friday August 4th, Altered Destiny was the first to take down the oversized Sebilite Protector!  5 members of AD were used for the pull, one where 2 of the primary pullers lost their lives pulling this meany back to the groups!
