On Tuesday, I'm going to assume, everyone was feeling pretty good. Our own Dragon Force killed Venril Sathir, Talendor, Kelorek'Dar, Trakanon, and Wuoshi. Animals! I don't yet have all the details on drops but, most notably, we got some Mrylokar's Greaves, Eretria scored some Tolan's Darkwood Greaves, and Noruat nabbed a Blood Ember Breastplate. Congratulations to them.<p>We were pretty busy last night as well. First, a bunch of us swam out to Timorous Deep to help Fenani complete one of the last steps for her Druid epic weapon. Then we assembled as Dragon Force and killed the Dreadlands-inhabiting dragon Gorenaire. We killed him extremely fast, and after the fight I only saw one casualty. I think we've got this one down to a science. ;) I was disappointed to see that, once again, no book dropped for the Paladin epic. I'm really beginning to suspect something is wrong. He dropped a few things however...<p>- Druid Spell: Entrapping Roots -- <i>Tram</i><br>- Shaman Spell: Avatar -- <i>DK Guildfund</i><br>- Wizards Spell: Sunstrike -- <i>Tessera</i><br>- (x2)Hierophant's Crook -- <i>AD, DK Guildfunds</i><br>- Kyvruul's Mystical Pouch (10-slot, 100% weight reduction bag) -- <i>Xpoc</i><p>Immediately following the dragon slaying, we sent a small group into Karnor's Castle to kill Venril Sathir's remains. This yielded the final components for <b>two</b> of our rangers to complete their epic weapons. Congratulations to AD rangers Quoits and Blitze on completing the quest for this most impressive blade... Swiftwind<p><img src="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/swiftwind.jpg"><p>Then remainder of the night consisted of various questing, mostly for epic weapons and Veeshan's Peak keys. Another great night! I think you can definitely expect us to be quite busy this weekend.<p>Addendum: Congrats to Krowbar on finally completing the quest for the Warlord's Vambraces last night as well. They are simply amazing! <b>AC33 +5str +6sta +25hp +2svMagic +2svPoison</b>

The next day we decided to travel deeper, wanting to uncover some of the ancient secrets that lie within the walls of the Temple of Veeshan. Our presence was surely sensed as powerful guardian drakes were sent to dispatch us. They failed. We ventured further within the temple and found a suitable spot to set up our operations down one wing of the temple. It was there we pulled many creatures the likes of which none of us had ever seen. This was a true test of our strength and will. We began to fall back at the sheer force of the enemy pressure. However, we soon rallied back and established a solid footing which would later guide us through a day of success. Confidence grew within our forces and we killed beast after filthy beast.

We’ve been extremely busy in the Western Wastes, defiling the nests of countless dragons and dragonkin. A nice campsite was found where we can rest in relative safety during the off hours, while staying close to the action to minimalize travel time. During this time we’ve really had a chance to get some much-needed practice and refine our tactics.<p>Last night, the fruit of our labors could really be sensed as the dragon fell in record time and with astounding efficiency. For a large portion of the time, our pullers were casually strolling about the open terrain, looking for things to pull to the engagement site. We were literally killing dragons faster than they could spawn. <b>Zone cleared!</b><p>So much great new equipment was collected I gave up trying to keep track of everything. Suffice to say, everyone got some very nice upgrades. Today, Altered Destiny finishes up in the Western Wastes as we prepare for an epic return to *deep drum roll* the Temple of Veeshan!

We departed on our journey around midday. The weather was less than optimal for any type of extensive travel, but we were driven, collectively, by the desire for battle with our sworn enemies.<p>As we were traveling through the Cobalt Scar, we sent our scouts ahead to check for any signs of danger. Everything seemed calm and we prepared for the next leg of our trek, through Siren's Grotto. All of a sudden, the cry came from the distance. A scout had sighted the sly sea dragon, Kelorek'Dar. Having had a couple run-ins with Kelorek’Dar before, it was quickly decided that he be exterminated. We drew the despicable serpent to a nearby shore of jagged rocks, sprinkled with fine white sand. With swords drawn and balls of fiery hatred suspended in anticipation, a loud clash occurred on the shores of Cobalt Scar. Kelorek’Dar was slain.<p>We found a few valuable items on Kelorek’Dar:<p>-	Shadowknight Spell: Death Peace – AD Guildfund<br>-	Wizard Spell: Icy Spear of Solist -- Nezzar<br>-	(x2) Sea Dragon Scales -- DK Guildfund<br>-	(x2) Kelorek’Dar Spine Razor, Dmg 9 Dly 20 ROG Only -- AD Guildfund<br>-	(x2) Bioluminescent Orb, +8 Str +10 Int +10 vsMg +10 vsFire +10 vsCold Effect:Blinding Luminance – Aonein, Rekna<p>After a brief celebration, we collected our supplies and headed for our final destination, the Western Wastes. We were assaulted quickly by the dragon inhabitants of the land. The killing ensued and continued on into the late hours of the night. Many of our members were rewarded with new equipment for their efforts.<p>Here is the majority of what was looted (although there was more):<p>-	Entariz: Reinforced Dragonskin Mask – Koskosio<br>-	Esorpa of the Ring: Esorpa’s Talisman – Oyen<br>-	Atpaev: Peerless Dragonskin Mask – Demott<br>-	Karkona: Worked Dragonwing Mantle<br>-	Draazak: Draazak’s Talisman – Meeks<br>-	Derasinal: Reinforced Bracer<br>-	Ayillish: Matchless Bracer – Lumilla<br>-	Amcilla: Amcilla’s Talisman – Bobec<br>-	Yeldema: Reinforced Dragonhorn Boots<br>-	Mazi: Peerless Dragonleg Breeches – Nobbok<br>-	Von: Worked Dragonleg Breeches – Dyahannah<br>-	Ionat: Ionat’s Talisman – Shoog<p>Congratulations AD on a successful night of dragon slaying.

We've defiled the nests of such reprehensible foes as Korocust, the Herbalist, the Prince, and the King himself. Until today, however, we had never engaged in battle with the Queen of Chardok. Being that several of our valiant warriors were at the final stages of the quest for their epic weapon, and that the Queen posessed an ancient blade which is needed in the quest, it was high time for Dragon Force to make an appearance. We weren't about to let any fancy-schmancy sarnak ruin our plans after months of arduous dragon slaying. Dragon Force scored big! We dropped the queen and the king 3 times, gathering some much needed quest components for our members. Here's the details...<p>- Sarnak Battleshield -- <i>Aruthra</i><br>- the Prince's head (for the enchanter epic weapon quest) -- <i>Pimest</i><br>- (x4)a Singed Scroll from Overking Bathezed (for the cleric epic weapon quest) -- <i>Aruthra, Bisrach, Clarf, Spewidette</i><br>- (x3)Ancient Blade from the queen (for the warrior epic weapon quest) -- <i>Krowbar, Mcrush, Vahan</i><p>We also uncovered other valuable items throughout the night such as spells, diamonds, blue diamonds, and Argent Defenders (cough).
