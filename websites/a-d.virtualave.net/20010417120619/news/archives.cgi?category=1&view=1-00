All members are to meet at the druid circle in lavastorm.  Cloudy Stones of Veeshan can be purchased from the library in the Erudian City which are needed for a teleport into POA.  Whomever purchases these stones will be compensated with various drops while in air (Those which are non-quest items). <p>Although not much is known about the Plane of Air, a few notes to mention...  Most likely we will be battling in a non-agro area.  Of course, these critters will agro when we attack, but, sitting near them is fine.  Each individual should attend the Plane of Air raid with deep pockets.  Although we will be killing faeries for free keys, we may not loot enough of them.  Please bring 1000p (yes, 1000p, This is not a typo) on your person.  Also, all casters please bring many bat wings as Levitation will be essential to our journeys. <p>No details have been mentioned to me exactly, yet, from my experience, here is what to expect:<br>Partys arrive in POA.  Groups begin killing the Faerie Princess-when dismissed a quest NPC will spawn in her spot (Do not hail this Halfling--he will vanish after a few Hails).  Next, groups will move to the teleporter which only one faerie resides on.  Groups will begin killing the faeries in the immediate area.  These faeries drop components used in a Quest to get keys used for travelling further into POA.  Each member will loot one of each quest component off of each faerie(each faerie drops 3 rabbits feet and 3 tiny swords).  Next, parties will begin giving their quest components to the halfling.  This Halfling quest npc will provide keys to continue our quest further.  NOTE:  after dispatching the Faerie princess, all groups must work fast in order to keep the halfling from despawning (if brave, we may wish to kill the faeries first and attempt to avoid the princess till last).  NOTE:  This keys are no-rent.  If a member camps/dies/goes LD the keys will vanish and this person will be required to buy the appropriate key.  Expensive keys can also be purchased from the Key Master which resides on this isle.<p>One key (not sure which one this is, but i believe it is the Key of Swords) is used on ONE particular gate/teleporter to transport that individual to a non-hostile floating rock island (this is the best i can describe it).  If someone zones into an area with Azaraks and is quickly dispatched--this person has used the wrong key on the wrong teleporter.  Once all members are on this non-hostile rock isle where the Noble is, groups will begin sowing and levitating.  Parties will run off this isle and hopefully all make it to an island that is just below.  This island as well is a non agro isle.  All groups will move to the camp site which is noted as being another teleporter.  When all are then situated upon the teleporter on this isle, we will use Monk FD pulling in order to attempt to pull singular mobs into our battle area.  Keep in mind there are 2 wandering mobs here which will need to be cleared first.  We will clear this isle.  During our kills on this isle, each member is to loot various quest items for more keys (not sure which items but i believe they are animal figurines)  Once this isle is clear there is a temple with another tough NPC in it.  This NPC will take 24-30 people to take down.  Once killed, this NPC will spawn another Quest NPC with whom members can recieve keys to the next level.  From here, i have no idea what to expect except very tough fights in hostile agro territory. <p>Since most of the area's are non-agro, it will be likely that this event will continue for several days.  Surely, some will log in order to be ready to do it again the next day. <p>NOTE: Don't persue a conversation with Gorgulasks' or any other NPC's for that matter.  Also, don't duel near the faeries and presumably the critters on isle2. <p>Remember that POA is uncharted territory and most of the plane still remains a mystery.  Many puzzles will have to be solved on our journey -- please have patience as influentials make decisions for all (Can't have 24 people all wanting to do different things).  There are rumors of POA being a plane for the next patch which increases levels of characters past the 50 restriction -- however, this simply is NOT true.  Verant has noted that POA is a very "Different" plane and as of yet, no one has reached the top floating rock/island however the POA was designed for the current gaming environment. <p>NOTE:  The quest npc's are found below Isle1 which is our zone in point -- there is no way to get to this area except to use a fresh gate into POA from the mortal realms. Once getting to the quest NPC's, one has no decision except to leave POA. <p>See ya then!! <p>    --Corona   Souls of Relevance <p>NOTE:  To leave POA, one simple jumps off of any isle.  After jumping, the person will arrive in the ocean in freeport.

The latest patches certainly played an effect on the items found during this raid as well as the difficulty of Hate.  Less items were found overall, however, we found a few extremely nice pieces.<p>    First would like to make an apology to VOD for misspelling their name for the second time.  Just to remind everyone VOD abbreviation stands for Visions of Disorder.<p>      Our trip in Hate lasted 3 days--everyone camped out in Hate on Sunday as well as Monday and Tuesday.  First, a warm thanks to all of our pullers this last week while in Hate!  Monks Xiaohai, Kanja, Natalia all did a fantastic job!  (I will not mention the monk whom pulled twice and thought he was wonderful...)  Another round of applause for our secondary pullers mainly Shoog and Krowbar--both of these HP sponges have certainly showed that they can take a hell of a beating!  Thanks to Wixramiablo and Ilian whom played the role of scouts now that enchanters have been so rudely nerfed!  For first time scouters, both performed their role to perfection.  As usual, all put on a nice show!<p>    Sunday was extremely successful due to groups consisting of SOR/BOS and VOD members.  Not a single train was formed.  Every player there worked together in unity, truely what is needed to do these runs successfully.  Thanks to all for their patience while forming groups on Monday.  Organizers had very little time to get in the game, get the gems and the required players.<p>    Very nice treasures were found during our trip, especially the Indicolite Breastplate (Ac35, +15Str, +15dex, +15sta) which is now owned by Big Bird Shoog Adoog!!  Congratulations Shoog for this most excellent piece of fashionable warrior armor.  Congratulations to Krowbar for recieving the Indicolite Gauntlets (Ac16, +5dex, +5sta, +50Hp)!  Delheru tossed his pair of Gatorskin legs for a set of Ethereal Mist Greaves (Ac15, +5str +9wis, +5agil, +7svPois) which a Cleric of Innoruk kindly handed to him!  Acka as well found a new pair of purple Ethereal Mist Boots (Ac15, +5int, +7SvCold) clerical boots!  Seela recieved the Prismatic Shield (18Ac, +10SvAll)!  Riea is a new proud owner of boots (Not sure but might of been Rune Etched Boots Ac14, +9Agi, +20hps, +7SvCold).  Kanja also recieved a monk only Shuriken of the Tranquil (100Damage, 20Delay, 200Range)!  Congratulations to all whom recieved presents!!<p>Till next time,<p>    Cheers and good fortune!<br>        --Corona<p>"I feel like I'm turning into Barney the dinosaur" -- Thunderwulf (Souls of Relevance)<p>PS:  Would like to give Verant a big middle finger for resetting the server three times as SOR/BOS/VOD attempted Maestro of Rancor on Tuesday.
