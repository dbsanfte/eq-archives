Dol Armoth showed at around the same time -- however they lacked the members to break into Cazics world.<p>AD had difficulty entering the realm and making it to the campsite.  The portal entrance was crawling with mobs and many met a grim doom upon entry.  Throughout the  night, our luck seemed to be running in a bad direction.  Critters were agro'ing into places where they shouldn't roam and chaos in the realm was noticed.<p>Our members were held up at the camp site for what seemed to be an eternity while trying to rise the dead.  Cazic was not happy and placed his minions against us at the most inopportune times.  Even Dracko happened to agro the camp.  Many hours of downtime and a large loss of exp was noticed by all members.<p>Once our pull team got into place and our forces were ready, we quickly turned the tables on Mr Thule.  Our pull time brought quick organization after clearing out the roamers and things went smooth in the later part of the night.<p>Dracko took revenge on Altered Destiny for our previous weeks actions and AD was not ready for his arrival, yet, he came and desmissed Altered Destiny with little opposition.  In the future, im sure Altered Destiny will return the favor.<p>Even though the night was one of the clerics leading the show and practicing in efficiency of rising the deceased, AD had a fantastic time.  AD held true throughout the night and never let the ill fate of dying scare them into leaving.  Altered Destiny remained strong and focused to conquer the Plane of Fear.<p>Several months ago when Sor/Bos entered into fear, discouragement tore the forces apart as they viewed the zone as unconquerable.  Our numbers were few and our members were highly trained yet we simply did not have the amount of players we find common today.  Altered Destiny holds onto focus and never lets opposition scare them away.  In the next planes/dungeons that we have yet to venture into, this simple act will hold Altered Destiny amongst the others.<p>Congratulations to the following whom found drops in thier favor!<br>Sbena -- Valorium Arms! 16ac 5str 9dex 10svCold<br>Jenton -- Blighted Robe! 11AC 10dex 10sta 13int 40mana<br>Jenton -- Blighted Bracer 3AC 4str 5dex 15mana<br>Bryek -- Cryosilk Choker 4AC 10mana 1int 4dex 10svDisease<br>Bryek -- Cryosilk Amise 4AC 2sta 1int 10mana 10svMagic<br>Caliburnus -- Cryosilk Sash 4AC 1str 2int 10mana 10svMagic (We forced Caliburnus to at least loot something)<br>Zaxxon -- Cryosilk Amise 4AC 2sta 1int 10mana 10svMagic<br>Zaxxon --  Carmine Pants 5AC 10hps 3str 3sta<br>Xiaohai -- Shiverback Greaves 5AC 5agi 5wis 7svFire<br>Kaladarr (DA) -- Umbral Gloves 13AC 5str 5int 35mana 10svDisease (Zretch had)<br>Kaladarr (DA) -- Umbral Bracer 10AC 5dex 3int (Zretch had)<br>Shoog -- Amy Tendril 9/25 1hs 5str 4dex<br>Gylen -- Valorium Bracer 10AC 5dex 5str 10mana 5svPoisen<br>Lagaluss -- Thorny Vine Gauntlets AC11 9str 9dex 7svFire<br>Eretria -- Thorny Vine Vambraces 13AC 9dex 9int 7svMagic<br>Betto -- Vermiculated Arms 7AC 5Dex 5sta 5agi 7svMagic<br>Lastel -- Vermiculated Greaves 8Ac 3str 5wis 7svDisease<br>Aruthra -- Girdle of the Diligent 10AC 5sta 5wis<br>Faldaar -- Blighted Sleeves 5AC 7int 15hps 10svFire<br>Guildfund -- Flayed Tourmoilskin Belt<br>Rotted -- Eyerazia<br>Rotted -- Vermiculated Arms<p>Congratulations to Jenton for recieving a new Robe!

My first omen of the night to come was the fact that I perished on the initial break and my body falled on Bryek's in the shape of a cross.   The night would prove to be long and ardurous, but the rewards would also be great.  Time and time again our camp was besieged the denizens of Fear and though many times we were able to repel, it was quite evident that this was a new and improved form of tactics that we faced from our foes than our last trip.  A few times, almost none in the party were spared from the wrath of Cazic.  However, we pressed on for there was game afoot.  The first major treasure was found by Xiaohai, an exquisite set of Shiverback leggings, much like the ones that decomposed on him on our first trip.  Following the legs, the spiders were kind enough to drop a cryosilk swatch which Corona procured, a crysosilk mantle which Bryek found room in his heart for, and a cryosilk sash which was my first piece of plane's gear.  Thank you to the wizards for insisting that I grab the sash before it decomposed.   The last piece of wizard gear was gained by Zaxxon, near the end of the night, carmine legs of unparalled grandeur.<p>The profits, which we well deserved for our valor, did not stop at the above however.  Orbitalx won a lotto for some finely wrought valorium bracers, but circumstances did not permit their retrieval and he was kind of enough to defer his win to Gylen for fear that they would be lost.  Sbena, it is now that I wish to praise your goodness. Never once did Sbena ask to be in a lotto, or complain.  Her enthusiasm and good will, were, as always, a shiny example to us all.  In the end, those who wish goodwill have it returned to them, and fate could not resist the irrestible Beans.  Just before daybreak, a random fetid fiend dropped a set of valorium vambraces, and since Sbena was the only paladin there she was forced to embrace them.  Congrats to Beans, I think they have found a wonderful home.  The hardfought spoils did not end there either though.  Jenton was lucky enough to gain both a breathtaking Blight robe and bracer on the same night!!!  Faldaar, who was kind enough to allow Jenton to have the bracers without a lotto, was treated by fate to a wondrous set of blighted arms.  The ranger contigent led by Aaric, Eretria, Blitze, Swiftfeet, and Lagaluss gained a set of Ranger only arms for Eretria, congratulations Eretria and I apologize that I can not remember the name of the arms.<br>  <br>The clerics were not without favor last night either,  Aruthra recovered a Girdle of the Diligent and his diety's blessing was surely upon him.  Thank you to Mufin, Fister, Belanor, Aruthra, Ailicec, and Thunderwulf we might not always say it, but we know without good clerics, you dont have a good time.  The druid contigent led by Lastel, Jaelen, Wyland, and Betto was not to be overlooked and as it seemed to be a girl's night out, it was Lastel who took home Druidic leggings of great power.  I think there may have been another drop of legs or arms as well, but since I was away from my body temporarily at the time, please accept my apologies for not knowing the full details.<p>I would like to conclude this crazed wizards writings with a few classic excerpts from the long night.  First off, Keyes, your ability to detract Cazic's attention is unparalled and I think Cazic must really hate your taste in music.  Alumar, I know your head must already be huge from the constant praise, but you are worthy of it.  When you mezzed 3 boogey men and than sat and meditated in the center of them, like a quarterback in a huddle, while we finished a turmoil toad, my jaw dropped.  Maglan, I know you were pretty quiet, but thank you for coming and for all the backstabs, there was a reason your group was getting a lot of kills and I think we both know what it was.  Thank you to the entire warrior contigent who only gained a whip for their efforts, Montaz, Elldog, Meeks, Nobbok, Krowbar, and Shoog a frail little pasty tallard couldnt ask for a more supportive group of big men.  Beleni, what can be said, you know we all love ya, and I will be at your side when that spite finally coughs up a treasure.  Though the spoils were great, much misfortune did accompany us and I would like to give props to the Dracoliche on his preemptive strike while we were all very low on mana, though we could have finished him and had him over half dead, we could not finish him and the two worry wraiths, amygdalan knight, and turmoil toad that came with him.  I believe that brings the score to AD 2 Dracoliche 1, we will be back for your bleached bones Draco.<p>"If you didnt have a few rough trips, you wouldn't appreciate the good ones"  <br>Elldog Mcbain<p>Nuff Said,<br>Caliburnus

Zretch had sent word to me via a messenger that I was to come meet him and my heart raced as I thought back to the first bat I killed in front of Felwithe and how someday I would travel to reaches outside Norrath itself. <br> <br>When I reached the druid ring, my confidence began to soar as all manner of race and class had assembled under the flag of Altered Destiny for the upcoming raid.  Lumbering ogres sat sharpening their wickedly deadly blades, among them sat Krowbar, Shoog, and Nobbok casually teasing their smaller barbarian counterparts.  Although not as large as ogres, the barbarians that sat before me seemed to have descended from giants, Montaz and and Elldog were obviously quite accomplished veteran mercenaries from the multiple scars of valor they bore.  Lastly, but definitely not the least of these massive races, sat the trolls.  Zretch and Meeks were feasting on the last bites of a roast pig and something told me I would do best to leave them to their work.<p>Aaric, Quoits, and Swiftfeet sat putting the final touches on some flight arrows in preparation for what was to come.  Their elven features made me feel much more comfortable, though I knew from my days on Faydwer that any who underestimated the demihumans because of their size seldom lived to regret that mistake.  Tuvas, Gylen, and Orbitalx shone like the morning sun with their meticulously polished armour and symbols of righteousness displayed proudly on their shields.  I regret that I did not pay closer attention to the clerics that assembled there, for I soon was to realize their value, but I did see Mufin praying to a darkelf god prior to our entry through the portal.<p>Two more barbarians covered in all manners of feathers and strange furs also prepared strange potions before me.  I knew them to be Beleni and Shayl and though I did not fully understand their art, I knew it to hold great power.  Many druids sat and scratched behind their ears as we awaited the signal, Wyland, Jaelen, Lastel, Daene, Betto, and Gigagiglamesh all were present and many I had seen before at one time or another on my beautiful Faydwer.  Two bards Glayde and Keyes sang battle hymns and played music from their unbelievably dextrous fingers that helped relieve my earlier doubts about the job at hand.<p>Lastly sat the caster contigent, and many high elves adorned them.  Corona, Eamwen, Zaxxon, Bryek, and Rixx headed the wizard contigent and I knew most of them only by the awe they instilled on wizards of the lower circles in Felwithe.  Aenadin and Nemasis were among the magicians and both of them were also local legends in my small circle.  Faldaar was the lone necromancer and his power I had only heard scary stories about as a child.  Alumar represented the enchanters and his magic proved to be critical in our travels to come, though I am still not sure of his race and he changes appearance so often.  I think he may be an Iskar though.  The last person I remember (and please forgive my journal if you were not included, my memory sometimes lacks) was Xiaohai the human monk I had often seen in Felwithe and knew to be one of the best monks in the land, and possibly the best.<p>After a brief round of introductions we prepared to enter the fray.  Just as the 8 AM hour hit, group after group of AD poured through the portal.  Many were slaughtered on the initial entry, including myself.  However ressurections were to be had, and a brave group of individuals still suffering from res effects managed to take on 3 scarelings and dispatch them.  The teamwork that that feat entailed gave me some insight as to why this group of like minded individuals was so effective.   Eventually we all were gathered back together.  Unfortunately I had died in a graveyard far from hope and was to spend most of the night in my underwear.  Thank you to Faldaar who allowed me to borrow his SMR so I could maintain some modicum of decency, your not really evil Faldaar, just misunderstood.   Creature after creature fell before a torrent of blades and a supernova of magical ires.<p>Once up and running the AD team was a force even Cazic Thule feared, though you could not tell from his incessant whining for us to leave or face his minions.  Eventually the group came close to clearing the area where my corpse had fallen.  However a Dracolich had decided he would guard my corpse so no one ninja looted it, remind me to thank him later.  After a brief <br>discussion it was decided that we would attack him.  I could not decide if this was foolishness or bravery, though I later realized it was merely confidence.  The Dracolich appeared from the mist and my heart nearly froze.  He or She (the anatomy was difficult at my distance) stood nearly 30 feet tall and her claws cut like polished diamonds.  Not a woman or man among us flinched however, and the rush to engage began.  Melee fighters sweated blood and tears as the pain of her attacks began to mount.  Casters fired all manner of spell at her in hopes of bringing this beast down as quickly as possible.  Suddenly I was taken over by the sheer horror of her roar,  I turned and ran the other way with many at my sides.  Realizing I could not <br>leave my compatriots to die, I gained power over the dragon's fear inducing roar and turned to reengage.  Her magic was not done with me yet though and slowly I felt my life leaving me from her roar, and than I collapsed.  When I returned she had been slain, the brave warriors had continued to grind away at her despite the pain and the casters had used every ounce of mana they could summon.  I was one of the first back on the scene after the dragon slaying and it was with great sadness that I walked through the field of corpses that had once been my comrades, but slowly life returned to the Plane of Fear and the clerics had everyone back to their oldselves in minutes.   Regrouped and with yet another dragon under AD's belt we set out for more adventure.   Cazic, be careful what you wish for, you might be next....

As well as the items retrieved are substantial!<p>Congratulations AD for the time you all have put into making the raids we now see commonly!  They have become extremely successful.  This weekend, AD bound together for a fear break on friday.  Altered Destiny took out Draco for the first time all in-guild on the first try!  Although our goals were for Cazic Thule, time ran late, and our players became tired.  Nonetheless, our second fear break never lead to a train, and did end very successfully!<p>On saturday, AD journeyed to Hate.  AD cleared the NE corner and recieved a few nice items.  Sunday was another all day clear of hate, leaving everything empty except the NE corner.  Very nice work on the amount of critters which were taken out by the hands of Altered Destiny!<p>Congratulations to the following whom recieved the following drops on fridays Fear raid!<br>Faldaar -- Blighted Robe! 11Ac 13int 10dex 10sta 40mana<br>Faldaar -- Blighted Cap 5Ac 7wis 8int 10hps 20mana<br>Aaric -- Thorny Vine Greaves 14Ac 5wis 9agi 15mana 7disease<br>Aaric -- Thorny Vine Helm 14Ac 9cha 5wis 10mana 10svcold<br>Krowbar -- Amy Tendril Whip 1hs 9/25 5str 4dex<br>Jaelen -- Vermiculated Legs 8Ac 3str 5wis 7svdisease<br>Wyland -- Vermiculated Arms 7Ac 5dex 5sta 5agi 7svmagic<br>Wyland -- Vermiculated Bracer 5Ac 9wis 15mana 7svfire 7svcold<br>Corona -- Cryosilk Amise 4Ac 2sta 1int 10mana 10svcold<br>Aenadin -- Cryosilk Cloak 5Ac 2agi 1int 10mana 10svfire<br>Koskosio -- Cleric Belt (not sure of name) 10Ac 5str 5wis<br>Eamwen -- Carmine Sleeves 4Ac 7int 30hps 10svcold<br>Faldaars Pet! -- Flux Bladed Axe 7/22 1hs 150dd 5str 4sta (all had)<br>Rotted -- 2 Eyerazias<br>Rotted -- Shiverback Legs 5Ac 5agi 5wis 7svfire (xia's corpse was unretrievable)<br>Rotted -- Umbral boots (Zretch already has 2 pairs)<br>Guildfund -- 3 Flayed Tourmoilskin Belts<p>When Draco was put to rest, 2 members retrieved the following items!<br>Alumar -- Bone Clasped Girdle! 4Ac 7str 7dex 7sta 75hps 75mana<br>Faldaar -- Staff of the Undead Legions! 2hb 20/47 Effect of Beguile Undead<p>Needless to say, Faldaar had an extremely good night and now looks quite stunning in the new robe!<p>-------------------------------------------------------<p>On Saturday, Altered Destiny was standing around and kicking pebbles at each other when they decided to jump into hate and do a quick run through!
