Oyen seems to think that we made fun out of his reading/writing disorder which isn't true at all. All we meant was that his reason for not porting Vesi was pretty childish, I didn't even know about his dyslexia before he started asking me what I thought about people who had it. I was on a raid so I didn't have that much time to explain it to him properly, I only told him that I don't care whether people have dyslexia or not. That having a disorder of any kind doesn't make a person better or worse. I have sometimes experienced that people with a handicap can be very defensive about it and in a conflict situation they sometimes hide behind their handicap so that others can't say anything negative to them.<P>Not porting someone is all fine, his reason for not doing it was kinda sad and I gave him my opinion which he took very emotionally. I thought he was just being mean and I didn't think we deserved it so I was maybe a bit too snappish with him. My apologies. His line where he says that 'I liked you Vesi' sounds kinda weird to me too, sounds like he stopped liking him when we switched guild. We are still the same people even with a different guildtag.<P>What comes to our reasons for leaving AD guild, I can say that it was mainly because of our rl friends with whom we wanted to do raids and stuff together. We tried doing this while still in AD but that led into problems, some people thought that raiding with another guild meant that we were being disloyal towards AD. So we left and joined the guild our rl friends are in and I must say that these last few weeks have been the greatest time I have spent in Everquest, playing an online game with rl friends can be so much fun  <IMG SRC="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/smile.gif"> Anyway we don't think ill of any AD member and we still have friends in the guild. We are in no way disheartened about leaving AD, it was a slightly difficult situation which ended well.</FONT></TD></TR><TR background="http://a-d.virtualave.net/ubb/back2.jpg"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fulgore</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well said Lumilla.<BR>..Fulgore</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>
