The presence of a powerful creature is sensed in the skin searing humid fog. The adventurers realize a monumental battle against the poison dragon known as Trakanon is near! Courageously, fighters move pressingly forward along a treacherous ledge hidden deep in the shadows. Mages of various religions follow closely behind their larger kin, frequently turning around nervously to see if any devilish beings have taken notice of their presence. The ogres and troll's quiet their subtle grunts and paladins strap their armor tight to avoid making a sound. The silent army crests a ledge and set their eyes on the mighty dragon Trakanon.<p>Warriors raise their swords still dripping with red blood above their heads, grunting and shouting words of rage and courage.  Paladin's kneel, head pressed against the hilt of their mighty swords blessing their surrounding adventurers.  Powerful priests with glowing eyes of fluorescent blue call upon their gods for support. Mages with glints of color around the hands and head chant harmoniously in a foreign arcane language.   The sky sizzles with energy and the air is filled with absolute power!<p>A battle cry is sound, a massive rush of valorous tanks strewn with armor of unknown lands charge  towards the almighty dragon. The mages chants blend together as one in rhythmic unison, rising to a deafening roar.  Sparks of color fly from swords and Mages hand, all uniformly landing on the greatest dragon known to man!  Together, they immortalize as Dragon Force!<p><br>Saturday, September 9th at 7:40pm EST, Trakanon fell for the first time on Rodcet Nife to the hands of 57 brave adventurers!  An incredible battle executed with precision led to a victory shared by both Altered Destiny and Dragon Knights!  The alliance known as Dragon Force led the attempt against the wretched beast resulting in Trakanon's Death on the first attempt!  Cheers to Corona of Altered Destiny and Mcrush of Dragon Knight for organizing this historic event!<p>Altered Destiny and Dragon Knight formed roughly on August 26th in order to band together to take down such monsters found throughout the lands!  This alliance was given the name Dragon Force.  May friendship and companionship run deep in the hearts of both guilds bringing a long lasting alliance to both guilds!

The new runs have been difficult, and trying on all members.  Most of the new environments have been extremely hostile as our members are not quite level 60 yet.  Yet, we have been doing incredibly well meeting objectives and completing goals Altered Destiny has put in front of them!<p>Over the past several weeks, Altered Destiny has frequently visited Trakanon's Lair in deep Sebilis!  We are trainign for the day where we can take down the biggest dragon outside of Veeshans Peak constantly.  Altered Destiny has been very successful in the clearing of Trakanons lair, and have even become quite versed in properly evading Trakanon himself!<p>Over the last 3 weeks, we have tackled the Jaugernots, learning their ways, their tactics and their weekness's.  In doing so, we have pulled named Golems right from under the feet of Trakanon, sometimes without him noticing.  While our tactics are nearly complete for a successful and effecient clear of Trakanon's Lair, we still have some work to do!<p>On Friday August 4th, Altered Destiny was the first to take down the oversized Sebilite Protector!  5 members of AD were used for the pull, one where 2 of the primary pullers lost their lives pulling this meany back to the groups!

For some reason the private boards and who's online kinda got screwed up. There is no way around this to my knowledge other then reseting the board. I will revert back to the standard message board, without stars, private messages, and who's online and try to fix it from there. Wish me luck.

</center><A NAME="963345181"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="4" FACE="arial"><b>Altered Destiny is Accepting New Members!</FONT></b><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="1" FACE="arial"> - submitted by: <A HREF="mailto:Audioman@mindspring.com">corona</A> @ 15:53 EST 7/11/00</FONT><BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffb0" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Nearly 5 months ago, Altered Destiny closed their doors from accepting new members into the guild.  Over the last 5 months, only a handful of players were invited into AD, apologies to those whom applied yet did not receive any response from the guild.  At the time, we had more members then we could take care of.  Doors were closed in order for the guild to care to the existing member base.  Time has moved on since then, and once again, we have room for new members!<p>Altered Destiny has never been a guild which actively recruits players, instead, we look for players whom come to us explaining their interests to join the Altered Destiny guild.  We expect quite a bit out of our members, we look for interesting personalities with a passion to play the game of EverQuest, even through the release of Kunark.  We are not interested in players whom wish to join the guild for items or to simply be part of an organized guild structure -- these types of players will be turned away.  AD members currently work with each other in order to overcome goals and challenges which can be celebrated between members.  AD is a close community of players whom help differing members in turn to benefit the guild as a whole.<p>If you have interest in joining AD, share a love for the Everquest game and wish to be involved in a guild consisting of a mature player base, then feel free to apply to our guild!  Currently we are looking for members whom have reached the 47th level (although lower level players will be considered, we have difficulty catering to the lower level players).<p>In order to become a member, one will be required to become an applicant to the guild, in which the applicant will be under review for a period around one month in length.  Members will vote on all applicants, and acceptable applicants will become members.  Even though an applicant will not become a member instantly, the applicant will get to know the members of AD, our raids, structures, organization while taking part in the majority of Altered Destiny's guild events!<p>Players whom applied in the past whom were never contacted, please feel free to re-apply!  We look forward in meeting new players with charismatic personalities!<p>Cheers!<br>--Corona<p>The following information is included in this news page due to the problems with our webpage.  Unfortunately the source code to this webpage has been lost, with some luck, the following information should be contained in a separate page in the near future.<p>Application Procedures<p>Altered Destiny consists of a like-minded grouping of working class players.  Raids are usually scheduled around the 9am to 5pm working schedule for eastern to pacific time zones.  Members are proud of their in-guild achievements yet they do not care to brag of the guilds accomplishments.  AD members are motivated to increase the guild's abilities without focusing purely on themselves or push themselves specifically for materialistic gain.  Altered Destiny is always searching for players whom share a passion for the game of Everquest.  We welcome players whom wish to excel while at the same time remaining charismatic, positive and surrounded by other mature players.<p>If you are interested in becoming a member of AD, please follow the instructions given below in order to both facilitate our role and yours.<p>Step 1 - Review the rules/policies of the Altered Destiny(AD) guild, and be willing to abide by them.  Altered Destiny enforces these rulesets and expects all members to uphold an above average level of common decency in any and all forms.  Our rulesets can be found here:  http://a-d.virtualave.net/Rules/rules.html<p>Step 2 - Submit a post on the Altered Destiny public message forum detailing your name, level and class of all your characters (clearly state your primary character).  Include a thorough description of your interests and expectations of why you have applied to AD.  Be sure to mention previous guilds you have been a member of and an associated explanation on the reasons of departure if pertinent.  Explaining previous raid experience will also help AD properly prepare you for accompanying Altered Destiny on any raids you may attend while under evaluation (Raid experience is not mandatory for guild acceptance).<p>Note: If you are just looking for a guild to join, then AD is probably not the best choice for you.  If AD finds an interest applied to another guild at the same time and views the request as a serious intent, you will not be considered.<p>Step 3 - The Board of Review is comprised of Altered Destiny members Lastel Silverstone, Eretria Silverthorn and Gylen which handle all players whom express interest in joining the guild of Altered Destiny --  Be patient, the members of the Board of Review evaluate each expressed interest in turn.  After an initial review of your interests to join Altered Destiny, you may be contacted by a member of the Board of Review either in game or through the public message forums.  The members of the Board of Review will assist in answering any questions or concerns you may have.  At any time the Board of Review may elevate your interest in joining AD into the status of an applicant.  Your application will then be moved from the public message forum to the members only applicant forum, in order to facilitate our work.<p>Step 4 -   During this time you are invited to attend as many guild raids/events as you can, as well, you are encouraged to group with AD members as much as possible. In the case of raids, the applicant should not expect to be included in loot lotto's, but may receive items should the event leader find it appropriate.  Please be prepared for any guild raids, if you are in need of keys (IE: Old Sebilis) you may ask any member of the Board of Review (or the member you speak with commonly) to arrange some sort of key hunting schedule. Make sure to plan ahead of time because obtaining keys will not be done just before the raid -- this applies for non-guilded and guilded individuals.  An applicant is not responsible for money related items used during raids unless requested (in which case the applicant will be reimbursed by the guilds Treasury).<p>Roughly after a review period of one month, the existing guild members will be asked to vote upon the applicant.  Spending as much time as possible with the members of Altered Destiny allows the guild as a whole to judge the abilities and personality of the applicant. In general we are looking for individuals who are able to play their class efficiently, able to cooperate and work well with group members and other groups, ability to take orders or lead if necessary and of course a player whom is enjoyable to be around.<p>Step 5 - If any guildmember objects to the applicant at any time during the one month period, the applicant will be informed that an invite will not be given.  If after one month the guild has found that the applicant would be a good addition to AD, then he/she will be welcomed into our ranks and invited as a member.<p>--Altered Destiny

Our destination was directed towards Trakanon's Lair!  Sixteen brave and courageous adventurers joined and entered the depths of this viscious dungeon.<p>Altered Destiny spent alot of time, taking the trip into deep sebilis slow and cautious.  After the members gained enough courage, we pushed into fight the first jaugernaut.  The jaugernauts were unlike anything Altered Destiny has ever met before.  A very intense battle consumed in which Altered Destiny was victorious!  Altered Destiny pushed into the banner room and scoped around.  The reports from the quickly dismissed scouting ranger were grim, the banner room appeared impossible.  AD pushed forward and eventually conquered new territory and moved in even further -- closer to trakanon.  Shortly before the adventurers layed sight into the lair, a mighty trained formed which took the lives of a few players whom did not have a group evacer.<p>Altered Destiny pushed into a place which was unbelievably difficult, and proved to themselves that such a feat can indeed be achieved!  Congratulations Altered Destiny for the persistance needed to dominate new territory!<p>Although no items were found before traks lair, the players experienced a new feel for the game.  Overcoming hesitation, and pushing to accel!  I think all had a blast, even though the rewards were not materialistic!<p>After the groups evaced, we promptly summoned the dead and performed resurections.  Due to time restraints, AD moved down to the Ostiary, Grupilort and Bronn spawn points.

Dol Armoth showed at around the same time -- however they lacked the members to break into Cazics world.<p>AD had difficulty entering the realm and making it to the campsite.  The portal entrance was crawling with mobs and many met a grim doom upon entry.  Throughout the  night, our luck seemed to be running in a bad direction.  Critters were agro'ing into places where they shouldn't roam and chaos in the realm was noticed.<p>Our members were held up at the camp site for what seemed to be an eternity while trying to rise the dead.  Cazic was not happy and placed his minions against us at the most inopportune times.  Even Dracko happened to agro the camp.  Many hours of downtime and a large loss of exp was noticed by all members.<p>Once our pull team got into place and our forces were ready, we quickly turned the tables on Mr Thule.  Our pull time brought quick organization after clearing out the roamers and things went smooth in the later part of the night.<p>Dracko took revenge on Altered Destiny for our previous weeks actions and AD was not ready for his arrival, yet, he came and desmissed Altered Destiny with little opposition.  In the future, im sure Altered Destiny will return the favor.<p>Even though the night was one of the clerics leading the show and practicing in efficiency of rising the deceased, AD had a fantastic time.  AD held true throughout the night and never let the ill fate of dying scare them into leaving.  Altered Destiny remained strong and focused to conquer the Plane of Fear.<p>Several months ago when Sor/Bos entered into fear, discouragement tore the forces apart as they viewed the zone as unconquerable.  Our numbers were few and our members were highly trained yet we simply did not have the amount of players we find common today.  Altered Destiny holds onto focus and never lets opposition scare them away.  In the next planes/dungeons that we have yet to venture into, this simple act will hold Altered Destiny amongst the others.<p>Congratulations to the following whom found drops in thier favor!<br>Sbena -- Valorium Arms! 16ac 5str 9dex 10svCold<br>Jenton -- Blighted Robe! 11AC 10dex 10sta 13int 40mana<br>Jenton -- Blighted Bracer 3AC 4str 5dex 15mana<br>Bryek -- Cryosilk Choker 4AC 10mana 1int 4dex 10svDisease<br>Bryek -- Cryosilk Amise 4AC 2sta 1int 10mana 10svMagic<br>Caliburnus -- Cryosilk Sash 4AC 1str 2int 10mana 10svMagic (We forced Caliburnus to at least loot something)<br>Zaxxon -- Cryosilk Amise 4AC 2sta 1int 10mana 10svMagic<br>Zaxxon --  Carmine Pants 5AC 10hps 3str 3sta<br>Xiaohai -- Shiverback Greaves 5AC 5agi 5wis 7svFire<br>Kaladarr (DA) -- Umbral Gloves 13AC 5str 5int 35mana 10svDisease (Zretch had)<br>Kaladarr (DA) -- Umbral Bracer 10AC 5dex 3int (Zretch had)<br>Shoog -- Amy Tendril 9/25 1hs 5str 4dex<br>Gylen -- Valorium Bracer 10AC 5dex 5str 10mana 5svPoisen<br>Lagaluss -- Thorny Vine Gauntlets AC11 9str 9dex 7svFire<br>Eretria -- Thorny Vine Vambraces 13AC 9dex 9int 7svMagic<br>Betto -- Vermiculated Arms 7AC 5Dex 5sta 5agi 7svMagic<br>Lastel -- Vermiculated Greaves 8Ac 3str 5wis 7svDisease<br>Aruthra -- Girdle of the Diligent 10AC 5sta 5wis<br>Faldaar -- Blighted Sleeves 5AC 7int 15hps 10svFire<br>Guildfund -- Flayed Tourmoilskin Belt<br>Rotted -- Eyerazia<br>Rotted -- Vermiculated Arms<p>Congratulations to Jenton for recieving a new Robe!

My first omen of the night to come was the fact that I perished on the initial break and my body falled on Bryek's in the shape of a cross.   The night would prove to be long and ardurous, but the rewards would also be great.  Time and time again our camp was besieged the denizens of Fear and though many times we were able to repel, it was quite evident that this was a new and improved form of tactics that we faced from our foes than our last trip.  A few times, almost none in the party were spared from the wrath of Cazic.  However, we pressed on for there was game afoot.  The first major treasure was found by Xiaohai, an exquisite set of Shiverback leggings, much like the ones that decomposed on him on our first trip.  Following the legs, the spiders were kind enough to drop a cryosilk swatch which Corona procured, a crysosilk mantle which Bryek found room in his heart for, and a cryosilk sash which was my first piece of plane's gear.  Thank you to the wizards for insisting that I grab the sash before it decomposed.   The last piece of wizard gear was gained by Zaxxon, near the end of the night, carmine legs of unparalled grandeur.<p>The profits, which we well deserved for our valor, did not stop at the above however.  Orbitalx won a lotto for some finely wrought valorium bracers, but circumstances did not permit their retrieval and he was kind of enough to defer his win to Gylen for fear that they would be lost.  Sbena, it is now that I wish to praise your goodness. Never once did Sbena ask to be in a lotto, or complain.  Her enthusiasm and good will, were, as always, a shiny example to us all.  In the end, those who wish goodwill have it returned to them, and fate could not resist the irrestible Beans.  Just before daybreak, a random fetid fiend dropped a set of valorium vambraces, and since Sbena was the only paladin there she was forced to embrace them.  Congrats to Beans, I think they have found a wonderful home.  The hardfought spoils did not end there either though.  Jenton was lucky enough to gain both a breathtaking Blight robe and bracer on the same night!!!  Faldaar, who was kind enough to allow Jenton to have the bracers without a lotto, was treated by fate to a wondrous set of blighted arms.  The ranger contigent led by Aaric, Eretria, Blitze, Swiftfeet, and Lagaluss gained a set of Ranger only arms for Eretria, congratulations Eretria and I apologize that I can not remember the name of the arms.<br>  <br>The clerics were not without favor last night either,  Aruthra recovered a Girdle of the Diligent and his diety's blessing was surely upon him.  Thank you to Mufin, Fister, Belanor, Aruthra, Ailicec, and Thunderwulf we might not always say it, but we know without good clerics, you dont have a good time.  The druid contigent led by Lastel, Jaelen, Wyland, and Betto was not to be overlooked and as it seemed to be a girl's night out, it was Lastel who took home Druidic leggings of great power.  I think there may have been another drop of legs or arms as well, but since I was away from my body temporarily at the time, please accept my apologies for not knowing the full details.<p>I would like to conclude this crazed wizards writings with a few classic excerpts from the long night.  First off, Keyes, your ability to detract Cazic's attention is unparalled and I think Cazic must really hate your taste in music.  Alumar, I know your head must already be huge from the constant praise, but you are worthy of it.  When you mezzed 3 boogey men and than sat and meditated in the center of them, like a quarterback in a huddle, while we finished a turmoil toad, my jaw dropped.  Maglan, I know you were pretty quiet, but thank you for coming and for all the backstabs, there was a reason your group was getting a lot of kills and I think we both know what it was.  Thank you to the entire warrior contigent who only gained a whip for their efforts, Montaz, Elldog, Meeks, Nobbok, Krowbar, and Shoog a frail little pasty tallard couldnt ask for a more supportive group of big men.  Beleni, what can be said, you know we all love ya, and I will be at your side when that spite finally coughs up a treasure.  Though the spoils were great, much misfortune did accompany us and I would like to give props to the Dracoliche on his preemptive strike while we were all very low on mana, though we could have finished him and had him over half dead, we could not finish him and the two worry wraiths, amygdalan knight, and turmoil toad that came with him.  I believe that brings the score to AD 2 Dracoliche 1, we will be back for your bleached bones Draco.<p>"If you didnt have a few rough trips, you wouldn't appreciate the good ones"  <br>Elldog Mcbain<p>Nuff Said,<br>Caliburnus
