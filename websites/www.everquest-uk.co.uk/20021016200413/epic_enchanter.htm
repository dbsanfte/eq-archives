                          ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and

                          an everyday item, you know. In fact i can't remember 
                          the last time someone requested it. I have given up 
                          keeping any here with me. You are going to need to find

                          Tempt him and give him this vial. He should cooperate.' 
                          <br>

                          Rilgor Plegnog says: 'Why do you want one of those contraptions. 
                          You will spend more time repairing it then you will 
                          writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you

                          in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How 
                          bad did you want that pen?' </p>
                        <p>You give Rilgor Plegnog a Shiny Metallic Robe. <br>
                          Rilgor Plegnog says: 'Very nice!! It is perfect! Here

                          any writing materials for me? The last few supplies

                          enchanted writing materials. He said they would help 
                          inspire me to capture my mind's images on paper. If 
                          you would just be so kind as to bring me plain old paper 
                          and a quill from Qeynos, I can get back to writing.

                        <p>Jeb Lemused is in the form of a Sarnak Imitator in 
                          the Burning woods. He is not always around, and killing

                          that is done, you will know what you seek. </p>

                          are to start on a long journey. Take this seal and it 
                          will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters 
                          of enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for 
                          you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, 
                          you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need

                          Krilan Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained 
                          his students to carry on the trade in a five-step process. 
                          Each student then became a master and chose one of their 
                          own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and 
                          I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting.

                          Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right.

                        <p>You: 'Who is modani?' <br>
                          A sarnak imitator: 'Modani is a master of illusions. 
                          You should seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out 
                          for him - he is never in his true form. The last time 
                          I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage 
                          to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues 
                          about his location there. </p>
                        <p>Modani will give you the Test of Illusions. </p>
                        <p>Modani Qu'Loni is the master of Illusion. He can be 
                          found in The Overthere, in the form of a Scorpis. He 
                          asks that in return for a piece of the Staff of the 
                          Shissar, you prove your worth by retrieving some items 
                          for him. </p>
                        <p>You will need to complete the snow blossums quest, 
                          the chalice of kings quest, and kill two high level 
                          Guildmasters. Two groups of 55+ should be able to handle 
                          both Guildmasters. </p>
                        <p>You: 'hail Modani Qu`Loni' <br>
                          Modani Qu`Loni: 'The hidden self inside a myriad of 
                          magic is one that walks quite softly. Yes, that is what 
                          you must seek.' </p>
                        <p>You give Modani Qu'Loni Jeb's Seal. <br>
                          Modani Qu`Loni: 'Ah yes, Jeb's seal. The time to craft 
                          a Serpent must have come. I will need components collected 
                          to craft the first of the pieces. I will also provide 
                          you with a sack in which you must combine the items. 
                          Are you ready to collect them?' </p>
                        <p>You: 'I am ready to collect them.' <br>
                          Modani Qu`Loni: 'Scattered throughout the world are 
                          various items. To prove your worth, go collect these 
                          and return them to me. The Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, 
                          Chalice of Kings, and snow blossoms.' </p>
                        <p>You: 'I need a sack.' <br>
                          Modani Qu'Loni: 'Take this sack and combine the items 
                          I requested in it. Then return it to me. ' <br>
                          You receive an Enchanter's Bag </p>
                        <p>You: 'What is the Chalice of Kings?' <br>
                          Modani Qu'Loni: 'The Chalice of Kings is the chalice 
                          of elven kings. Recently thought to be lost to the ages, 
                          it was recently discovered. I need its magical powers 
                          to create a magical liquid.' </p>
                        <p>The Chalice of Kings is found via this quest. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What is the Xolion Rod?' <br>
                          Modani Qu'Loni: 'This is the rod of an ancient civilization 
                          found on this continent. Nothing is known of it other 
                          than that the scaled ones discovered it years ago.' 
                        </p>
                        <p>The Rod is dropped by Vessel Drozlin. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What are Snow Blossoms?' <br>
                          Modani Qu'Loni: 'These are flowers that are also used 
                          in the creation process. They were once widespread, 
                          but now I am told they only grow in select places.' 
                        </p>
                        <p>Snow Blossums are found via this quest. </p>
                        <p>Innoruuk's Word is found on Verina Tomb. </p>
                        <p>You combine the four items in the bag. <br>
                          You hand Modani Qu'Loni the combined item. <br>
                          Modani Qu`Loni says: 'Excellent, you have done well. 
                          Here is the first piece of the staff. Now you must go 
                          seek out the second master; he will clear the path for 
                          you. <br>

                          A sarnak imitator: 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered 
                          the use of enlightened magic. Go to him once you have 
                          spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel, so you 
                          should not have to look far from his home to find him.

                          You: Are you mizzle? <br>
                          Clockwork VIIX: 'Oh hello! I'm Mizzle, that I am. I 
                          bet you want to be given true clarity, don't you?' </p>
                        <p>You: 'What are the required components? I am ready 
                          to collect them.' <br>

                          will then reward you with what you seek.' </p>
                        <p>You: 'What spoon?' <br>
                          Clockwork VIIX: 'Its a giant sized tool I will use to 
                          stir my magical pot. The spoon will help finish the

                          Clockwork VIIX: 'It is a key I lost long ago when I 
                          was travelling with a companion. We were traveling in 
                          the new lands flying over some large crevices when the 
                          key dropped out of my pocket.' </p>

                          Clockwork VIIX: 'The lost scroll contains the magical 
                          incantation I need to help you out. It was penned ages 
                          ago by the Elves. It was lost along with its protector 
                          during one of the raids on the Outpost in Firiona. I

                          to the new land. I just recently received a letter from 
                          her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are 
                          arriving every day, and that the outpost is well defended

                          for you. Its only purpose is to trap the essence of 
                          a particular book worm. If you should fail in your first 
                          attempt. Do not worry, I will provide you with another.

                          but still a day and night. And at night, the mist could 
                          suffocate one. Tis the fate of poor Jaxion. </p>
                        <p>The Ruby is given to the Wraith of Jaxion, who is found

                          thought they rid this area of these critters. Those 
                          things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be

                          a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. 
                          Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be 
                          sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I 
                          will provide you with one. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What is the head of a serpent?' <br>
                          Polzin Mrid: 'Serpent is probably not an accurate term 
                          form what you must return to me. It is actaully the 
                          reminants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was erradicated 
                          long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called 
                          the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city 
                          to learn more about these creatures. </p>
                        <p>The Wraith of the Shissir spawns after the death of 
                          Cazic Thule in the plane of Fear. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What is the essence of a ghost?' <br>
                          Polzin Mrid: 'You don't have to look for to find roaming 
                          spirits. One in particular though has more meaning then 
                          the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle 
                          was a dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when 
                          he stopped writing. Wel....look at me now. I fear that 
                          I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle. </p>
                        <p>Kinde's Ghost can be found deep, deep in the Hole. 
                          There are a few shamen quest NPCs around as well, so 
                          it's wise to kill a few birds with this stone. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What is the essence of a vampire?' <br>
                          Polzin Mrid: 'The essence of a vampire is just that. 
                          Only the most powerful of these creatures will possess 
                          what you need. </p>
                        <p>Forsaken Revenants, both male and female can drop the 
                          Essense, though it is very rare. </p>
                        <p>You: 'What sands of the mystic?' <br>
                          Polzin Mrid: 'They are sands that were imbued with the 
                          magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving 
                          their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand. 
                          One will need to search the shores. </p>

                        <p>All four pieces need to be combined in the sack which 
                          Polzin provides. <br>
                          Reward(s): <br>
                          4th Piece of the Staff</p>

                        <p>Combine the 4 items in the sack provided to recieve
