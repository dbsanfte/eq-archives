                        <p>Head off to Gornit's island [800, -5400] in the Ocean 
                          of Tears. Locate Captain Surestout and kill him. A lesser 
                          spirit will spawn where he's killed. It will ask you 
                          if you killed the Captain, respond with &quot;he threatened 
                          my life&quot; and then ask the spirit &quot;who are 
                          you?&quot; He will hand you A Tiny Gem and tell you 
                          to bring it to another shaman. Head off to North Freeport 
                          now and enter the sewers. Locate Bondl Felligan and 
                          hand him the tiny gem, he will head out to the nearest 
                          bar to buy drinks. If you follow him he will stop and 
                          speak to you. Tell him &quot;you can buy booze&quot; 
                          and he will tell you to follow him. He will enter the 
                          Jade Underground and on the third floor there will be 
                          a Greater Spirit waiting for you. Hail it and say the 
                          following if you are a barbarian &quot;I follow justice&quot;, 
                          an ogre &quot;I follow war&quot;, a troll &quot;I follow 
                          hate&quot;, or an iksar &quot;I follow fear&quot;. In 
                          the next room another Greater Spirit will spawn, talk 
                          to this one and it will tell you everything about the 
                          spirits and the way of the shaman. You will then receive 
                          an Opaque Gem. Once you have received the gem, say the 
                          following line &quot;I will walk the path of the Heyokah&quot;. 
                          This will cause the Greater Spirit to despawn and will 
                          start the next phase of this quest, the Test of Patience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Head off the Erud's Crossing now, and locate an Ogre 
                          Shaman by the name of Ooglyn [-900, 1600]. Hail her 
                          and then hand her the opaque gem. She will tell you 
                          to follow her, and will run off into the water. Head 
                          to [-1600, 4200] and wait for her. She will wait a bit, 
                          then tell you that this is the place, and will leave. 
                          Do not follow her, just wait and soon Srafen and Dillon 
                          will spawn. Talk to both of them and follow their conversation 
                          along. After awhile Froham will spawn and mention something 
                          about a magical arrow. He will then wander off, do NOT 
                          follow him, and remain with the others. After awhile 
                          Abe will spawn, talk to him and then ask him &quot;what 
                          Broken Arrow&quot;. Wait a bit and he will start to 
                          talk again, follow along his conversation and he will 
                          then hand you a Broken Arrow. Wait again for a couple 
                          of minutes, the Abe will tell you to follow him. Again 
                          remain where you are as a Greater Spirit is coming to 
                          you. Talk with him and he will tell you that you are 
                          now ready to take the Test of Wisdom. He hands you a 
                          Small Gem and tells you to locate the Wandering Spirit 
                          in West Karana [-500, -5300]. </p>
                        <p>When you locate the Wandering Spirit (looks like a 
                          willowisp) hand it the small gem. It will tell you to 
                          hurry to Rathe Mountains and help Tabien the Goodly 
                          [6300, 1500] who can be found near the Unkept Preservers. 
                          Kill him to receive the Marr's Promise. Next head over 
                          to [2900, -1900] and you should see Glaron the Wicked. 
                          Kill him to obtain Woe and Envy. Take all three items 
                          back to West Karana and hand them to the Wandering Spirit. 
                          It will hand you a sparkling gem. It will then hand 
                          you the Shield of Falsehood, make sure that you have 
                          a free general inventory slot open, otherwise the shield 
                          will disappear. </p>
                        <p>Head off to the Emerald Jungle and hand the sparkling 
                          gem to the Sentinel Spirit which can be found in a small 
                          hut like building [1250, 300]. He will then give you 
                          the test of Might, which begins in Castle Mistmoore. 
                          Head off to the castle and kill the Advisor. This will 
                          cause the Black Dire Wolf to spawn. Hail it and he will 
                          ask you to join him, to which you respond no. He will 
                          then attack you, and you will need a good group to bring 
                          him down. Loot the corpse to receive the Black Dire 
                          Pelt. Head back to the Emerald Jungle and hand the Sentinel 
                          Spirit the pelt. He will fashion the pelt into a pair 
                          of Black Fur Boots for you. He will then give you the 
                          next part of the quest. He wants to learn what happened 
                          to Torsis, and will hand you a booklet. He asks that 
                          you search the city and bring him back a completed report. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Head into the City of Mist and start killing everything 
                          you see as all the pieces of this quest drop off random 
                          mobs. They are the Merchant's Letter, Priest's Dairy, 
                          Personal Dairy, Written Announcement, Crier's Scroll, 
                          and the Student's Log. Put all six pages into the booklet 
                          and hit combine. Return this to the Sentinel Spirit 
                          and he will tell you that you must now kill Lord Ghiosk. 
                          Enter the City of Mist again and kill this lord. He 
                          is tough and you will need a good group to bring him 
                          down. Loot the three books off his corpse. Head back 
                          into the Emerald Jungle and locate the Spirit Sentinel 
                          in the pond [3685, -640]. Hand him the three books and 
                          he will tell you to fetch the High Scale, which again, 
                          is located in the City of Mist, and hand the Icon to 
                          High Scale Kirn. Head into CoM and run over to the temple 
                          (on the right side of the zone). Enter the temple, and 
                          turn right. Walk down the stairs and open the left door 
                          and the bottom of the landing. The High Scale Icon spawns 
                          in the corner of this room. </p>
                        <p>Head over to the Hole now and locate High Scale Kirn, 
                          who can be found standing in the middle of the room 
                          at the top of the tower in the Revenant Castle. Hand 
                          him the High Scale Icon and he will attack you. Kill 
                          him to obtain the Engraved Ring. </p>
                        <p>Head back to the City of Mist and hand the Engraved 
                          Ring to Neh'Ashiir. He will then attack you, kill him 
                          to obtain the Neh'Ashiir's Diary. Head back to the Emerald 
                          Jungle and hand the diary to the Sentinel Spirit in 
                          the underwater pond. At this point he will tell you 
                          to bring proof to Lord Rak'Ashiir. Head into the Plane 
                          of Fear and kill the named Golems (Terror, Fright), 
                          this will cause an Iksar Broodling to spawn. Kill it 
                          to obtain the Tear. Run back to the City of Mist and 
                          give Rak'Ashiir the child's tear. As of a recent patch, 
                          he will now aggro you after you hand in the tear. Kill 
                          him to obtain the Scale. Head back to Emerald Jungle 
                          and hand the Spirit Sentinel the scale and you will 
                          be rewarded with the Spear of Fate.</p>
