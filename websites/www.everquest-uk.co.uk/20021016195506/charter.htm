                        Guild was founded in 1999 by Kaladdar and others who were 
                        real life friends living in England. Lucky early members 
                        of the guild had holidays together and were privileged 
                        to enjoy personal friendships. 
                        <p>I was invited into the guild sometime in late 1999. 
                          I was excited to join such an illustrious group of loonies 
                          and terrific people many of whom I was and am proud 
                          to call my friends. I was the first American member. 
                          Circumstances change and life evolves. October 22, 2001, 
                          I was promoted to Guild Leader. I am happy to be heading 
                          such a terrific group of amusing, fun friends, as we 
                          battle critters and spend our relaxation time together. 
                          All the members of Charmed Alliance are working adults 
                          who choose to spend some or all ( LOL) of our free time 
                          adventuring together.</p>
                        <p>Our guild has held fast to the traditions, legendary 
                          repartee, camaraderie, and friendship which has always 
                          been the bedrock of our small but well reputed band 
                          of adventurers.</p>
                        <p>We have a few requirements for membership in our little 
                          family. They are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The potential member must be an adult over 18.<br>
                          2. The potential member must provide a valid email address--in 
                          case we need them and they haven't been reading the 
                          boards regularly.<br>
                          3. The potential member must be sponsored by a member 
                          in good standing. The potential member must accompany 
                          the guild on one of its weekend outings so that all 
                          guildies have an opportunity to evaluate them for membership.<br>
                          4. The potential member must possess a terrific sense 
                          of humour and an ability not to take the game too seriously.<br>
                          5. The potential member must be voted upon by all members. 
                          The Guild Leader will decide any ties.<br>
                          6. The potential member is a provisional member when 
                          initially tagged. The member or the guild may decide 
                          without animosity that the member and the guild do not 
                          mesh.<br>
                          7. The Guild Leader has the privilege of tagging all 
                          new members.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The following is a list of friendship rules I received 
                          from a good friend. I happily share them here as they 
                          seem so applicable to the CA sense of how things should 
                          be:</p>
                        <p><br>
                          1) When you are sad, ...I will get you drunk and help<br>
                          you plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made 
                          you sad.<br>
                          2) When you are blue, ...I'll try to dislodge whatever 
                          is choking you.<br>
                          3) When you smile, ...I'll know you finally got off 
                          line and got laid.<br>
                          4) When you are scared, ...I will rag you about it every 
                          chance I get.<br>
                          5) When you are worried, ...I will tell you horrible<br>
                          stories about how much worse it could be and to quit 
                          whining.<br>
                          6) When you are confused...I will use little words to 
                          explain it to your dumb ass.<br>
                          7) When you are sick.....stay away from me until you're 
                          well again. I don't want whatever you have.<br>
                          8) When you fall, I will point and laugh at your clumsy 
                          ass.<br>
                          9) When your character dies, I will do all I can to 
                          get you rezzed and then hound you endlessly about your 
                          stupidity.<br>
                          10) I will remind you it's just a damn game when you 
                          get caught up in the moment.</p>
