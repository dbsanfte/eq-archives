			 <P>We have only very few set policies as far as new members to the
				guild go. Firstly however you must be over 18 years old. This rule is not for
				awkwardness, its more to protect other people as we like to talk as we want in
				the guild without fear of language upsetting anyone. We are a solid group of
				friends and all new members are treated as such and this rule means we can all
				relax together alot more. </P> 
			 <P>Secondly you are better to be sponsored by another member of the
				guild. Fitting in and taking advantage of the fun and friendship we provide can
				be tougher without knowing anyone in the guild to start with. Again this is
				more to facilitate your enjoyment. </P> 
			 <P>Charmed Alliance is not a large guild, nor will it ever be so,
				however we do want to be part of large events and explore as much as we can. At
				present w are able to take a good few more members. </P> 
			 <P>Give myself or an officer within the guild a tell if you are
				interested in joining. A member online at the time will point you at the
				nearest officer :) </P>
