                        <p>The Start <br>
                          - Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods: ask &quot;what 
                          action&quot; and you will get a note. if not, then your 
                          faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by 
                          doing the muffin-quest in Freeport<br>
                          <br>
                          - Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark: give her the 
                          note and you receive a ring. Faelin roams the northern 
                          part of the zone near Crushbone. She is a rare spawn 
                          and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her 
                          the note she depops.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Giz X'Tin Kithikor: give him the ring, get a dark 
                          metal coin. Giz roams along the path. After u hand him 
                          the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks 
                          but u can run away with SoW.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. 
                          He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells 
                          you to find Athele. <br>
                          <br>
                          - Athele in East Karanas: give her the Coin and receive 
                          a worn amulet. give this amulet to Sionae, then to Nuien 
                          and finaly to Teloa. The last step is the trigger for 
                          the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkwlf Reavers (all 
                          about lvl 50) to spawn. <br>
                          <br>
                          - Find the Corruptor and kill him fast He and the 2 
                          reavers spawn on top of the hill east of the river (loc 
                          -1500, -1000). He will depop after 10 seconds if not 
                          attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and 
                          kill them. You dont need to kill the Reavers. Just kill 
                          the corruptor and loot the tome. If the Druids die, 
                          never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give 
                          Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring 
                          this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot; 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          - Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women 
                          that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note 
                          and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She 
                          will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so 
                          you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions 
                          some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>The Hardened Mixture </b><br>
                          - You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in 
                          Ella's mixing bowl.<br>
                          - Frozen Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks<br>
                          - Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket <br>
                          - Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp <br>
                          - Heartfruit from Greater Faydark<br>
                          <br>
                          - This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items 
                          in the bowl and you get a Hardened -Mixture.<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>The Runed Bowl</b><br>
                          - Go to the Chess Island (succor will take you there 
                          when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and 
                          ask Alrik Farsight<br>
                          &quot;how do you make an ancient bowl?&quot;. He gives 
                          you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. If he dont 
                          respond to you then your faction with Keepers of the 
                          Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the 
                          batwing-quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to 
                          you, give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. 
                          He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do 
                          a job for him.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe 
                          north and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. 
                          Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for 
                          the ancient bowl.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He 
                          will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the 
                          receipt.<br>
                          <br>
                          - The pattern says that you have to combine it with 
                          a piece of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder 
                          in a pottery wheel. NO skill in pottery required.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Platinum speckled powder can be obtained through another 
                          subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and 
                          give it to Merdan Fleetfoot in Surefall Glades. The 
                          old wooden painting that you receive has to be brought 
                          to the human skeleton that roams the western part of 
                          Frontier Mountains. Head back with the silver chained 
                          locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Galdes 
                          and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum 
                          speckled pouder.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm 
                          in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him &quot;what 
                          mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will tell 
                          you that he would like to have a colored axe for his 
                          service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in 
                          the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted 
                          clay. I think that if you are kos to the dwarfs then 
                          you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot 
                          Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get the clay. 
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          - Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery 
                          wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl <br>
                          <br>
                          <b>The Stones </b><br>
                          - Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter 
                          the hardened mixture and the rune crested bowl. She 
                          will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the 
                          Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in 
                          Firiona Vie.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself?&quot;, &quot;what 
                          answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. 
                          She tells you to bring her the stone you already have 
                          from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.<br>
                          <br>
                          - Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and loot the 
                          gem he drops. Venril is a very tough level 55 Necromancer 
                          that can only be beaten by very strong guilds. <br>
                          <br>
                          - Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal 
                          Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this 
                          is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid 
                          and the Ranger parts. Foloal tells you to take the stone 
                          and walk your path.<br>
                          <br>
                          - The Druid's path leads back to Ealla in Misty Thicket. 
                          Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar 
                          (10/30 9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease)...now you 
                          have one of the four final pieces. She asks you to collect 
                          the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark 
                          and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus. <br>

                          - The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find 
                          the corruption in the land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth 
                          (below lvl 30) in Everfrost Peaks (pops near Permafrost, 
                          Mammoth Calfs are PH), the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman 
                          (mid lvl 30) in Lake Rathe (PH are the sidespawns on 
                          top of the underwater-tower. Middle spawn is for Cleric 
                          Epic. Use wolfform to be non-aggro to the other goblins. 
                          They heal each other so kite him away. It can take several 
                          tainted to get the corrupted) and the Corrupted Hill 
                          Giant (mid lvl 30) in Rathe Mountains (HG area south 
                          of the hill with the Guard Tower). <br>
                          <br>
                          - Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to 
                          receive the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas 
                          and give him the heart. He will give you the Cleansed 
                          Spirit of Antonica.<br>
                          <br>

                          - You will meet a pained Unicorn in lesser Faydark. 
                          Collect for him the items looted from the Corrupted 
                          Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl 52, 1 or 2 groups needed. 
                          As far as I can remeber you have to pass the area where 
                          Estrella is and the named Seahorse), the Corrupted Cyclops 
                          (3-4 ppl, best tactic is fearkiting because he is lvl 
                          52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears and 
                          from the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They 
                          are green to 56/57 and give exp. Each can pop the tainted 
                          so it is possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the 
                          area. They are druids and the corrupted is a lvl 52 
                          druid so you need help from 2 or 3 people. Fearkiting 
                          is the best tactic) in Lesser Faydark.<br>
                          <br>
                          - The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 
                          3 items. This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix

                          is near the mines on the left side of the green river. 
                          There is another greeny gnome near him but you can do 
                          this part with super camou on you if you are kos or 
                          otherwise disliked there because you need no faction

                          and loot his Essence. Ulump is a lvl 55 warrior that 
                          doubles for 250 and he has 32k hp. He can't be slowed 
                          or tashed. You should have 2 groups with 4-6 melee and 
                          2-4 nukers (all as high lvl as possible) to kill him. 
                          Lure spells hit for full damage. <br>

                          of the plateau. Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted 
                          and only non-undead tainted will pop the corrupted), 
                          the Corrupted Barracuda (high 40,loc -900, -900) in 
                          Lake of ill Omen (only the blue tainted will pop the

                          breaks fast. Would be much easier if you have a friend 
                          that helps you kill the corrupted) and the Dragon Faydawer 
                          that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep (Guild needed
