                        <p><b>Cleric Epic Quest &quot; Water Sprinkler of Nem 
                          Ankh&quot; </b></p>
                        <p><br>
                          Head off to Lake Rathe, and talk to Schmendrick Lavawalker 
                          [3600, 0]. He spawns near the cabin where the Boots 
                          of the Reliant quest npc is. He will tell you to get 
                          him <b>Lord Burgurgle's Crown</b>.</p>
                        <p>Now get a small group and head into the underwater 
                          tower below the Erudite Isle, in Lake Rathe. Enter the 
                          Deepwater Goblin Tower [2800, 150] and head to the top. 
                          Lord Burgurgle spawns on the top floor, in the middle 
                          and has a placeholder. Kill him to loot Lord Burgurgle's 
                          Crown.</p>
                        <p>Head back and hand Schmendrick the King Burgurgle's 
                          Crown, and you will receive the <b>Oil of Fennin Ro</b>. 
                          Natasha Whitewater will then spawn nearby and she will 
                          proceed to kill Schmendrick. Once Schmendrick dies a 
                          Spirit of Flame will spawn in his place. Kill the Spirit 
                          of Flame and you will receive the <b>Damaged Goblin 
                          Crown</b>. Hand this crown to Natasha and you will be 
                          rewarded with the <b>Ornate Seashell</b>.</p>
                        <p>Now head off to Timorous Deep and talk to Omat Vastsea 
                          [-12000,-200]. Hand him the Ornate Seashell, and he 
                          will give you instructions on killing the Plasmatic 
                          Priest, which spawns in the Temple of Solusek Ro. He 
                          will then hand you the <b>Coral Statue of Tarew</b>.</p>
                        <p>Now head off to the Temple of Solusek Ro and locate 
                          the room with the throne [326,38]. At 9am a Seeker will 
                          spawn on the left. Say the following line to make sure 
                          it is the correct spawn, &quot;what plasmatic priest&quot;. 
                          Hand him the Coral Statue of Tarew, this will cause 
                          the Plasmatic Priest to spawn in the seekers place. 
                          Kill him and you can loot the <b>Bloodstained Plasmatic 
                          Priest Robe</b>. He uses Tremor and AoE spells so make 
                          sure you pull him to zone, otherwise the other npc's 
                          will kill him.</p>
                        <p>Next head over to Solusek's Eye to hunt down and kill 
                          Lord Gimblox who spawns near the King room [-800, -366]. 
                          His placeholder is a Large Fire Goblin. Once you kill 
                          the Lord, you can then loot the <b>Lord Gimblox's Signet 
                          Ring</b>. Head back to Omat and hand him the Bloodstained 
                          Plasmatic Priest Robe. He will reward you with the <b>Orb 
                          of Frozen Water</b> and once again Natasha Whitewater 
                          spawns. Hand her Lord Giblok's Signet Ring and she will 
                          give you more quest details and will then hand you another 
                          <b>Ornate Seashell</b> (which when identified is shown 
                          as Ornate Seashell II).</p>
                        <p>Now we head off to the Burning Woods to talk to Naxton 
                          Deepwater. Hand him the second Ornate Seashell and he 
                          will in turn hand you back the Message to Natasha. This 
                          will also cause Ixiblat Fer to spawn. He will tell you 
                          to kill the Ixiblat Fer and to obtain his Scepter. He 
                          is a God type mob and will require many groups to take 
                          him down. Charming some or the wandering wurms and using 
                          Fire Elementals works well, as well as pulling him to 
                          the Skyfire zone to fight him is suggested. Kill this 
                          elemental and loot the <b>Scepter of Ixblat Fer</b>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Next we head off to Chardok and search out Overking 
                          Bathezed. He is the boss of this dungeon and uses AoE 
                          spells which will aggro mobs in rooms above him causing 
                          many trains. Make sure the room above is empty before 
                          attacking him. Kill him to obtain the <b>Singed Scroll</b>. 
                          Now head back to Omat Vastsea and hand him the Scepter 
                          of Ixiblat Fer and the Singed Scroll. He will reward 
                          you with the <b>Orb of Clear Water</b>, and will ask 
                          you to head over to Lord Nagafen's Lair to kill Zordak 
                          Ragefire and return with his heart. Natasha Deepwater 
                          will spawn once again and if you hand her the Message 
                          to Natasha she will give you a <b>Shimmering Pearl</b> 
                          which she tells you to hand to Zordak Ragefire to block 
                          some of his powers.</p>
                        <p>Head off to Lord Nagafen's Lair and locate Zardok. 
                          Not much is certain on how to make Zordak spawn, but 
                          make sure that all Fire Giants are dead, as well as 
                          Lord Nagafen. Once you locate Zordak bring him to Nagy's 
                          lair and hand him the Shimmering Pearl, which will cause 
                          him to attack you. Kill him and he will spawn once again 
                          into a second form, Zordakalicus Ragefire, a nice red 
                          dragon. Kill this beast and you will be able to loot 
                          the <b>Heart of Zordak Ragefire.</b></p>
                        <p>Bring this heart back to Omat and he will reward you 
                          with the <b>Orb of Vapor</b>. This will cause Jhassad 
                          Oceanson to spawn. Run over and hand him all three orbs 
                          that you have received so far, Orb of Frozen Water, 
                          Orb of Clear Water, and the Orb of Vapor and he will 
                          hand you back the <b>Orb of the Triumvirate</b>. An 
                          Avatar of Water will spawn nearby, it does not respond 
                          to hails, nor any commands. Just hand it the Orb of 
                          the Triumvirate and you will be rewarded with the <b>Water 
                          Sprinkler of Nem Ankh</b>.<br>
