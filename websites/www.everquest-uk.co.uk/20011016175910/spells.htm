			 <P>With so many excellent spell listings and research resources out
				there, it would be foolish to try and emulate them.</P> 
			 <P>With that in mind, from this page are links to the best sites on
				the web, IMHO.</P> 
			 <P>The first site I *always* visit is
				<A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/" TARGET="_new">Casters Realm</A>. Total
				and complete, this site has everything you will ever need ot know regarding
				spells and their research too.</P>The other site I use is
			 <A HREF="http://www.eqcaster.com" TARGET="_new">EQ Caster</A>. They have an
			 excellent utility called EQ Caster, which basically parses your spdat file (the
			 EQ file on your HDD that stores all the spells info within the game) and
			 presents it in a quick and easy to view format. AS its reading directly from an
			 official EQ file, its as close to the real effects as you can get, although it
			 is well known that Verant likes to throw in the odd "made up" spell to catch
			 out those people who like to rant about such things :) Perfectly safe and OK to
			 use, its well worth a look.<BR><BR>If you know of any other excellent map sites
			 out there, please let me know.<BR><BR><A
