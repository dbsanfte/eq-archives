                        quest begins in the Overthere and results in the shadowknight's 
                        particle weapon. 
                        <p>This quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns 
                          near the docks in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn 
                          so don't be discouraged if he is not there the first 
                          few times you check for them. </p>
                        <p>Do not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. 
                          Kurron spawns near the docks and you will be able to 
                          swim or invis yourself to get to him. He is also far 
                          enough away from other NPC's that you do not have to 
                          worry about them aggroing you when you are there.</p>
                        <p>If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his 
                          mission is or he will attack you) and then agree to 
                          his terms(tell him &quot;I agree&quot;) then he will 
                          tell you that he seeks three pieces of darkforge armor(helm, 
                          chest and leggings) and 900pp. </p>
                        <p>Before turning in these items you need to gather up 
                          a good party and have them accompany you. Two groups 
                          would be best. </p>
                        <p>Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise 
                          in TrueSpirit faction and he will say that his mission 
                          is nearly complete. He will reward you with no items. 
                          If you ask him what mission he will tell you of his 
                          treachery and then attack you.</p>
                        <p>At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you 
                          will find a &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. 
                          You will need this for the next portion of the quest.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will 
                          not drop the note. This has been tested and confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in 
                          Paineel. He is upstairs in the newbie area looking out 
                          through the glass. If you hand him the note he will 
                          tell you a story of his apprentice. He will also tell 
                          you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no 
                          item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or 
                          not. I have contacted Verant about it with no response. 
                          Someone has told me that Verant responded to this on 
                          a public board saying that no item is supposed to be 
                          given but I was never able to find the thread. Either 
                          way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to continue 
                          the quest.</p>
                        <p>If you ask him what apprentice he will give you further 
                          background. Tell him that you will take his apprentice's 
                          place and he will ask you to prove your worth first. 
                          Duriek is aging and is in need of a cough elixir. This 
                          is obtained via a side quest in Neriak. </p>
                        <p>Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform 
                          you that he was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. 
                          Unfortunately he is no condition to gather the components. 
                          His previous apprentice was searching for them when 
                          he met his demise. </p>
                        <p>He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can 
                          be found in The Hole on Ratman Guards. The best place 
                          to find these guards is by taking a left upon entering 
                          the first fortress and then take another left and pass 
                          down past the pool. Between this area and the old city 
                          beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as patrollers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit 
                          for 370s, are very magic resistant and have a ton of 
                          hit points. The tome is a rare drop on them so you are 
                          likely going to have to kill several of them to obtain 
                          one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people and 
                          no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's 
                          stuck on the first attempt. In later raids we had as 
                          many as 25 people and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. 
                          A lot of it depends on if you can get Turgurs or another 
                          speed reducing spell to stick early.</p>
                        <p>Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction 
                          adjustment and will reveal what items he will need to 
                          complete the corrupted ghoulbane. He requires:</p>
                        <p>1) Blade of Abrogation from the Plane of Air<br>
                          2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear<br>
                          3) Ghoulbane from upper guk. <br>
                          4) Decrepit Sheath from a Qeynos side quest.</p>
                        <p>Returning this items to him will result in a corrupted 
                          ghoulbane(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 
                          1hslash) and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the 
                          City of Mist. This item is not much use to a shadowknight 
                          of this level but it is required for the next portion 
                          of the quest.</p>
                        <p>Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the 
                          City of Mist. This is just before the Reaver area near 
                          the large hut with all of the Goos. He spawns in the 
                          middle hut right past the big goo house. He spawns at 
                          the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are 
                          not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will reveal 
                          what he needs to forge your weapon.</p>
                        <p>Each of these steps is accomplished by completing a 
                          sub-quest. These sub-quests all tie in together. The 
                          heart of an innocent and the will of innoruuk are wearable 
                          items that are among the best that shadowknight can 
                          attain. As a result these sub-quests are listed with 
                          their own seperate pages that are cross-linked together. 
                          They are listed in the neccessary order of completion.</p>
                        <p>Heart of an Innocent<br>
                          The Will of Innoruuk<br>
                          Head of the Valiant</p>
                        <p>Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane 
                          to Lhranc and he will reward you by turning in to a 
                          living version of himself wielding the almighty Innoruuk's 
                          Curse. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon.</p>
