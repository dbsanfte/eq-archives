                        <p>Kargak Redblade and Wenden are the two people who handle 
                          most aspects of this quest. Talk to them for the begining 
                          quest information, they can be found standing in East 
                          Freeport near the East Gate.</p>
                        <p> <br>
                          Talk to Wenden and he will tell you that he can restore 
                          the Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt but only if you can bring

                        <p> Head back to Permafrost and start killing Goblins

                          you with the Mark of the Sword. He will then tell you
