I wanted to separate out the two issues and discuss them individually. I've started a separate thread on the issue concerning the unannounced change of the partisan pack, which is a bag given by an NPC for the purpose of completing a quest. <br><br>In this thread I'd like to discuss my comments where I said:<br><br>"Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then."<br><br>After reviewing this post that I made earlier, I do agree that it appears to be a threat when viewed out-of-context, and understand the general reaction that followed. The point of the post was to respond to multiple posts from people earlier in the thread who had no idea that they shouldn't use combinable containers, particularly free bags given by NPCs to complete quests, for general item storage.<br><br>I'd thought that the number of people using the bags for this purpose were the exception rather than the rule, an observation that was apparently mistaken given public response to my post. Given that public response, we won't be taking any steps to "destroy" items in combinable containers upon logout or linkdeath.<br><br>I do apologize for the way my response was phrased and hope everyone understands that neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">>>>1. Camping. Why couldn't the "long portion" of the camp be put at the OTHER end of the camp? Perhaps the NPC needs time to "craft" the quest item and changes in some way to show that they are ready to give the reward. Let the other items spawn almost continuously, and people would NEED to camp anything but the reward PC.<br><br><b>It's a doable idea, but wouldn't this be just a camp by another name? Whether I'm camping a creature that I want to kill, or one I want to talk to, it's still a camp. In this case, I can see 20 people standing around an NPC waiting for him to "be ready" and fighting over who can hand him the items fastest.</b><br><br>>>>2. Are there currently any suits of armor that give some "hidden" effect or bonus by virtue of wearing the entire suit? <br><br><b>No, there are not. It's a good idea though that might have some application for later implementation or future products.</b><br><br>>>>3. Are there currently any weapons in the game that have any "hidden" effect? <br><br><b>Not really. What an item can do is expressly stated upon it. We do have some plans for more cursed weaponry in the future, of course we just might have to be creative to "hide" the effect of the curse.</b><br><br>>>>4. If the answer to 2 and/or 3 is "no", are there any plans to add this feature to the game? <br><br><b>See above.</b><br><br>>>>5. You once said that GZ was going to conduct some tests with the wizard's spells vs. the other caster classes. Have these been completed? <br><br><b>Actually I believe that Brad said that, and it is indeed our opinion that offensive power is appropriate for the class.</b><br><br>>>>6. Why, exactly, was the definition of the wizard class changed on the everquest.com page under the classes section? <br><br><b>What change and when was it made? To my knowledge, it has read what it reads now since release. I believe that there was a change at one time in the beta period where it was changed from "damage" to "magical damage", but that's all I believe happened. Was there something else?</b><br><br>>>>7. Are there any plans to introduce items that directly influence/enhance trade skills? (Gnomish Jeweler's Loupe, Dwarven Smith's Hammer, Elven Sewing Needle, etc.) <br><br><b>Do you mean items that allow you to make better items with trades? It's a good idea, but we no firm plans in that direction.</b><br><br>>>>8. Why, since dwarves in fantasy literature (and even in EQ) are the finest smiths in all the realms, is there no ore in Kaladim? It even has a mine. <br><br><b>Good question. There's no ore in Kaladim? Hmmm, I'll check into that to see if it was a design or an oversight.</b><br><br>>>>9. Why can't enchanters be given a high-level illusion that allows them to change into the nearest ANIMATE object? <br><br><b>Races are a component of faction, and you adopt whatever race-faction you emulate. There's a lot of special case-coding to handle the animate races that players currently emulate. Opening that up to nearly everything else would be extremely problematic, if not impossible.</b><br><br>>>>10. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that absorbs magic directed at the wielder, perhaps converting it directly into mana/hit points? <br><br><b>There is already a bard song that has a damage shield that absorbs magical damage. There's also a cleric "reverse damage shield" that heals anyone that hits the target. That's the extent of what we have, and nothing new along these lines are planned.</b><br><br>>>>11. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that REFLECTS spells back at the caster? <br><br><b>No.</b><br><br>>>>12. Why can't the monk-only weapons that look like gloves be worn on the hands, and add directly to the ATTACK stat instead of requiring them to be 1h blunt? <br><br><b>Items cannot be set to use hand-to-hand skill, and combat can't go to an "equipment" slot to get combat statistics.</b><br><br>>>>13. If Verant doesn't like "spoiler sites", then why are there no spell descriptions anywhere in the game?<br><br><b>I think that you've answered your own question. We don't like spoilers. We'd prefer people figure these things out on their own and maintain their own knowledge-base.</b><br><br>>>>14. Will players ever be able to construct golems? (A.k.a. summon a temporary "golem-type" pet through some complicated quest) <br><br><b>We could certainly, by use of trade skill or quest, award an item that summoned a pet of any particular type, however we have no plans to do that at present.</b><br><br>>>>15. Necros can charm the undead; enchanters can charm...well...everything. Will Magicians ever have the ability/spell to charm elementals or other summoned creatures?<br><br><b>No, we have no plans along these lines at present.</b><br><br>>>>16. Are there any plans for an expansion geared toward the 10 - 30 range of player rather than the higher levels? <br><br><b>Velious is geared towards a higher level-range, however Kunark has support for all level ranges. <br><br>With Velious, the thinking is that there is already plenty of content to support the continually migrating portion of the customer-base that is in the 10-30 range. <br><br>I'm unable to talk about any post-Velious plans at this time.</b><br><br>>>>17. The Trackers' Water Extractor - This is currently broken, is it not? The purification tablets do not seem to exist, and the NPC that mentions them won't respond. <br><br><b>I inquired about this time time back, when Kunark first launched, and it was verified at the time that the tablets do exist. If I need to check into it further, please let me know.</b><br><br>>>>18. Bandages vs. Aloe Swatches vs. Maneater Plant Salve vs. Tailored Silk Bandages: Is there any difference other than price i.e. More healing, faster healing, etc.<br><br><b>No difference at this time.</b><br><br>>>>19. Are there any plans to give clerics any type of special ability that is tied to whatever deity they worship?<br><br><b>No, there are currently no plans along these lines. However, there are plans and implemented pieces of deity-specific quests that return deity-specific rewards.</b><br><br>>>>20. Are there any races and/or classes that you, personally, would like to see added to the game?<br><br><b>If we added a warrior/wizard hybrid, could we call him a "fire fighter"?<br><br>-Gordon</b></font></td>

It was that, then complaints about AC for various armors out there, weight, etc. We're running dozens of iterations in a controlled environment to be sure that the classes stack up as we thought they should, and if they stack up to the same level that we thought they should. <br><br>To answer your question, any changes, or lack thereof will be based on the outcome of these defensive tests.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

I don't exactly like spending 10 minutes making food and water everytime I go LD and its even more irritating when your in a group fighting and you have to create food for yourself why they are in need of help<br><br>Summon food and items are intentionally less-reliable than "real" items of the same nature. It's one of the balancing factors for having them there to begin with. Now it was never the intention for people to lose them when accidently going LD, however LDs remain a part of life on the internet, and there's no way to determine the difference between an accidental and intentional LD. There was one time when we allowed people to keep summoned items for an LD, but had to change it when we noticed our LD logs increase exponentially for the purpose of keeping the summoned items.<br><br>>>>There ought to be like a 30 minute timer before pets and summoned items automatically poof.

While one could argue that we should increase shiverback to a level that it's more powerful than the mundane stuff, one could also argue that we should lower the power of the mundane stuff and keep shiverback as it is.

Is is possible to have armor and weapons be right clicked and have them appear directly on your body, instead of having to drag them to your inventory picture. This would help elliviate some of the time it takes to loot your own corpse. Backpacks and other items can be right clicked directly into inventory slots, so why can't equipment be right clicked directly on?<br><br>No, it used to be like this in early beta, but was purposefully changed to it's current state. It simulates some time necessary to reequip items, rather than having it more or less instantaneous.<br><br>>>>2. Will we ever be able to use the hot buttons while meditating? I had read that this was being worked on a while ago, but I wasn't sure if it was implemented. Also, will Hot buttons be able to be used on the Merchant Purchase screen as well (see the next question)?? <br><br>Maybe, it's on Roy's plate. There's no gameplay reason why we wouldn't allow it since we allow you to use them by clicking them with the mouse, so the only thing left is to see if there's some technical reason, and if not, to implement it.<br><br>>>>3. Will we ever be able to purchase multiple items at once (food, water, and trade skill items)? <br><br>See #2 above.<br><br>>>>4. Is there a way to have food that will give temporary boosts to Ability scores? I think it would be cool to eat a piece of Bread of Stamina, or Mana Muffins. Is this possible to add to the game, if it isn't already a part of the Cooking skill?<br><br>This is not in our current plans, though we like the idea and will keep it in mind.<br><br>>>>5. Is there a way to increase the Hide/Sneak speed for Rogues?? <br><br>Already in. Rogues above 50 sneak at progressivly faster speeds, until level 60 where they can sneak at a full run.<br><br>>>>6. Why does sitting increase the aggro distance on enemies, especially green ones? <br><br>It really doesn't, however, sitting PCs are automatically added to the hate-list of any NPC in the awareness radius. Normally, an NPC that isn't mad at you, but would attack you anyway, becomes aware of you before they react to you. So, in other words, if the awareness radius is 200 ft, and the reaction radius is 100 ft, a wolf would attack a standing person once he crossed into reaction range. However, when the person is sitting, they are added to the hate list at the awareness range. The ranges themselves don't actually change.<br><br>This is intended.<br><br>>>>7. Why is it that Monsters have the ability to turn around immediately? <br><br>See the FAQ. NPCs have to be able to do things PCs can't to remain competitive. <br><br>>>>8. Does anyone else think the monsters ability scores are unfairly high? <br><br>Same as #7<br><br>>>>9. Where stunning creatures goes (like above with bash), how come players never know when they have actually stunned creatures? <br><br>There is a text message indicates this.<br><br>>>>Why do the monsters stun and sometimes cause cahracters to spin?<br><br>Because being stunned allows the player to make no further inputs for the duration of the stun. As such, any turn that you've begun, will continue while stunned. You'll never get spun if you are simply facing the creature. You only get spun if you are turning at the time you are stunned. I've always thought that this was a neat effect.<br><br>>>>10. Why is it that monsters don't have to follow the same rules of hit detection that players have to conform to?? I cannot tell you the number of times I have seen monsters go through walls, monsters standing inside of one another, and monsters that pass right through players? <br><br>See #7.<br><br>>>>11. I have noticed that small races sometimes have problems climbing onto ledges, when exiting the water from swimming. This is especially true for the Halas zone, where my Halfling has to try numerous times to get out of the water at both ledges. Often while trying to climb onto the ice near the Halas dock, I will fall (for 1 pt of dmg) under the ledge, and then be under the water in front of the ledge. Usually I have this happen four or five times to try and get up the ledge. Is this a known problem?<br><br>It's a known problem, and unfortunately cannot be fixed without man-months of work on each zone (basically rebuilding each one from scratch) followed by excessively long downloads.<br><br>>>>12. The bugs involved with boat trips? I am sure I don't need to mention the numerous bugs associated with the boats, especially having to do with characters appearing to be swimming and sharks appearing ON the boat. Have these been looked at. A friend of mine said that he had seen a response that in order to fix these the whole zone would have to be redone. Is this true? Or, is there a remedy in the works?<br><br>Sharks appearing on the boats is not a bug, but a consequence of the design. As for other boat related issues, you'll have to list them one by one.<br><br>>>>13. The zone doors in some zones are ridiculously small, and this can often cause people to "get stuck" while zoning, and cause them to be sent back through the zone the other way. This happens frequently in the West Karana/Qeynos Hills zone<br><br>This particular zone is on our plate to fix. No ETR.<br><br>>>>14. Has anyone else noticed a lack of Guides/GMs during late night hours? I usually play from 1am EST till about 6am EST daily, and usually it is rare to see one Guide on at that time, if any at all. <br><br>We're always working to improve coverage in the off-hours. We just moved a bunch of GMs around to fill that area better. As for Guides, they are players just like yourselves. We take every opportunity to recruit off-hours guides and do the best we can in that area.<br><br>>>>15. This question driectly relates to #14 above. I myself tried to appply to be a Guide using the re-designed form that was announced last week. I logged in and created a password for the guide program, and then began filling out the questionaire. I was about half way done filling it out, when because of pressing issues at work I decided to finish it later. I had never atually submitted the form, but when I tried to log in again and fill it out, it said I had already submitted a form. I would still like to try and fill it out again, but it continues to say that someone with my account name has already filled out a Guide application. I would hate to have to wait until the next form comes out some months from now to try and apply again. I also seem to remember this same problem with the last guide app I tried to submit. <br><br>When filling out the guide account, it only allows a station name to be entered once in order to prevent multiple applications submitted by the same person. What most likely happened in this case, is that the application was read as completed and submitted for grading.<br><br>If a situation such as this occurs, the applicant may write appadmin@verant.com and supply the station name and email address used when filling out the application and ask that we delete it so they may resubmit. If they wish to wait, the application will go into the queue to be graded and will fail as incomplete and once the database is purged of failed applications they will be able to resubmit the application.<br><br>>>>16. Whe will we be able to purchase only the Kunark upgrade through a version of the online store again??<br><br>Last I heard we've about gotten all of the bugs worked out. The plan is to provide a web-based utility to allow separate purchase of Kunark. We'll release more information in regards to this when we have it. I'm sorry that I don't have anything more for you now. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

The fact that we did publicize those additional numbers doesn't necessarily mean that we should publicize the next thing that seems "logical" given that argument. At some point we either have to stop releasing more numbers, or just release them all. Though there are certainly people who would like to see numbers on everything, we're of the mind that the game shouldn't be reduced to pure mathematics in the eyes of the players.<br><br>>>>Now about customer service.<br>>>>I have played now for 6 months atleast, bought two accounts because I knew my wife would love to play, (take my advice if you marry someone who loves pc games as much as you build or buy a second pc and phone line internet connection).<br>>>>I have played on Cazic thule, Karana, Solusek Ro and now my permanent home is 7th hammer.<br>>>>In all this time all my contacts with customer service, guides and GM's have been on my part respectful and none demanding, In all my time and contact I am pleased to say even when I have been turned down for what I asked, I never felt that I was being just brushed off.<br><br>Thanks for the note.

When the guide responded, said there was nothing she could do. I stated that I felt we could reproduce the bug and would that be proof, since to my knowledge it was an undocumented bug? Her response was again, no. So my question to the audience here, and to Abashi should he ever see this is: What is required to prove you are not lying to a GM?<br><br><b>Most bugs that would result in a resurrection leave some sort of signature that would allow the GM or Guide to verify the incident and make the correct decision. For instance, falling for 10K damage leaves a line of text that can be /reported in order to provide "proof".<br><br>The particular incident that you are mentioning however is not a bug. Centaurs by their nature are ornery critters, and have a very small percent chance of just going wild on someone.

The average player of EQ currently plays just over 20 hours per week, and it is in that range that EQ is generally geared towards. <br><br>Will a 2 hour per day player be able to acquire everything that a 4 hour per day player will in the same calander time? No, as the game is geared off of played-time versus calander time. Of course, there's also a bit better returns on time you can put in in one sitting, meaning that someone who plays 4 hours in one sitting will probably accomplish more than someone who plays 2 two-hour sittings.<br><br>I think that it is a foregone conclusion that people who have more time to play will be able to do more in game. <br><br>>>>. I have noticed that I am getting to the point that I can no-longer reasonablely solo (lvl 28), and I am getting quite frusterated with the game. Today I played for 2 hours and gained only 3/4 of a bubble of expeience, and maybe 6 pp. <br><br>That's actually a pretty good advancement rate compared to what people are seeing in the 50+ range. <br><br>>>>As is stand now - After every fight I have a minium downtime of 12 min (2 mend recycles).<br><br>Playing a monk is probably not the best choice for a solo player, particularly due to the downtime involved without a support class. However I'd consider the monk a very good class for a two-person group (with a healer of some sort, even a hybrid). You could probaby quadruple the amount of time you can fight thus doubling your advancement rate just by adding one person to your group.<br><br>As you certainly aren't the only person in this situation, there's probably other people out there as well who are in your situation, you just need to find them. Try advertising for cleric, druids, shaman, or paladins for your group. I hear complaints from all of those classes that they can't find groups in your level-range.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

Certainly there are a bunch of high level people who find those creatures green, but the person who is advancing through the game and encounters them while adventuring probably will get some experience off of them.

Your dev team will probably hate me for suggesting this, but its one way to maybe get something done about all the problems facing players in EQ. I suggest that Abashi and some of the dev team take the top complaints people are having, wizards, monks, etc..., and give them exactly what they want.<br><br>Just to preface my answer, I'm going to ask everyone to keep an open mind and not take offense at anything here. Most of us have played MMOG's for some time. Whether in the commercial setting, or in the form of MUDs, some of the issues we deal with are not due to any one particular person, but common problems that will be encountered any time someone tries to develop of a game of this nature.<br><br>On to the subject at hand. This would be a radical idea. Let's assume for a moment that we can get those classes to agree on what they want and make the change. Should we decide to "revert back" later, how upset would people be then? Next, lets understand that some other classes would feel slighted by the changes made to these classes. They'd then expect to get what they want. Then other classes that weren't involved in the first two changes would figure that they also deserve what they want. Then we'd be back to the first two classes that feel slighted as it is. This would continue until we put our foot down and said, "No more".<br><br>But we don't need to try that, because it's already been done. Over the past 7 months, tons of positive changes have been made to the classes, with very few negative ones. Any positive change made to one class satisfied them for the time until a few months down the road when all of the other changes were factored in. Several of the loudest complaints I'm hearing now are coming from the same classes that had complaints that we fixed months ago. The feeling of, "It's our turn now", keeps coming around again and again. We're now at the point to put our foot down as mentioned above.<br><br>We can't afford to go making changes that we know will unbalance the game just for the purpose of reducing complaints, when the situation remains that there will always be issues that the players feel need to be addressed. There will always be some inequality felt by some classes, because we've designed the game not for equality but for balance. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I often get email from a few folks who make some very good arguments concerning risk in PvP. Basically, the standpoint is that if the environment does not contain risk, there is no sense in engaging in it. "Item loot" itself does not handle this risk, as players of casting classes are not affected to the same extreme as melee characters.<br><br>One argument is that we should implement experience-loss in PvP. I like this idea, unfortunately some core issues with the way life in EQ works makes implementing this unreasonable. For anything that couldn't be handled in code, an additional load would be placed on the CS staff. Believe it or not, even though people playing on PvP servers should be more tolerant of interaction with other players, 90% of the petitions there are for some kind of perceived harassment. <br><br>The core EQ system, meaning, the things that define EQ as EQ, do not allow some of these issues to be resolved without drastically changing the PvE portion of the game which we want to remain intact.<br><br>That said, I still firmly believe that some form of risk associated with PvP needs to be in game. Since that risk cannot be experience-based, and item-based risk doesn't hurt people who can bag their items or fight without them, I'm considering the following option: Making it so that everyone, regardless of class, can only bind in cities on the PvP Servers only.<br><br>City-only binding (again, on PvP servers only) would allow people to, for instance, eject an opposing force from a zone, and provide the additional risk of making all of them run back to recover their corpse and engage again. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this? Do you feel that PvP needs more real and equal risk associated with it regardless of class? <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

In addition, the last poll we conducted on the subject actually surprised us with how many individual people expressed satisfaction when given a specific intent to express otherwise.<br><br>>>>My question to you Verant is this, Why then do some many people flame Verant on this board? <br><br>Human psychology. People are more likely to get worked up and post about something that upsets them than they are about something that pleases them. People who are happy with the game are often too busy playing it to come here to the boards.<br><br>>>>I can hardly find a nice thing being said about EQ or Verant.<br><br>Those posts are here, but the way the thread system works has the most controversial issues constantly being moved to the front page. Go back about 50 pages and see how many positive posts you see.<br><br>Also, check out other sites that we (Brad and I) do not post to regularly. You actually get some good discussions going on about various issues with very few of the flames that are popular here. I frequently go out and read these other boards to "get my bearings" when I get the feeling that what is so often portrayed here is the norm. <br><br>>>>Here is my take on the problem. First off, you are using the stick to motivate players. Nerfs, EXP. losses post 50, slow EXP climbs and lack of bug fixes, customer support, etc.<br><br>Given the choice of only the "stick" or the "carrot", as your title mentions, I would say that we actually provide more carrot than stick. There is always more to do in EverQuest. More items to get, new spells to learn, new quests to complete, and other classes that haven't been played. We provide so much stuff to do that no one will ever experience all of the diversity that EverQuest has to offer.<br><br>>>>At level 50+ you camp EXP. Thats right, sit down and kill/kill/kill just to see your exp bar move a pixel<br><br>I'm a little dismayed that people continue to do this. Prior to levels above 50 being attainable, people did not "camp EXP" at level 50. They were happy to have fun and play the game at level 50 with the general understanding that they would never advance. All of a sudden we open up levels above 50, and everyone goes in XP camp mode. Why? There's no point to it. If they just played the game the same way that they were playing it once they reached 50, they would find themselves advancing. <br><br>I guess that it's the mindset that the "carrot" in this case encourages. <br><br>>>>Nerfs. Why so many for all the wrong reasons? Instead of coding something properly we get unannounced nerfs. Then Verant wonders why people flame them? I don't understand. Throw a cold bucket of water on me while I am sleeping and I can guarantee I will not be a happy person.<br><br>We don't enjoy nerfing anything. Players will always figure out things that we didn't intend. Let's face it, players have far more people "on the job" than we do. We don't enjoy nerfing, and we do enjoy enhancing. However, enhancing or nerfing exclusivly will break the game quickly. Many are fond of quoting this article titled "Mudwimping", which advocates exclusive enhancements. There's a term for that as well that the author doesn't mention: Mudflation. <br><br>>>>Verant, I truly think you have a great game. I think it needs alot of work to be one of the all time great games. Remeber to use the carrot and not the stick and I bet your reputation will come back full swing. I also would be willing to bet that me/us will once again truly enjoy a great game.<br><br>Though I didn't agree with some of your assertions, I would like to thank you for taking the time to express your opinions. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

For a moment I felt something....." and proceeds to give you the quest. The head of the magician's guild gives an even darker tale.(after all, the hole is populated with earth elementals, and one would think that after all that time in there, they'd be a little screwed up...). Then, A large group of NPC shadowknights goes through the newbie field in paineel (maybe lead by the head of the necro guild)and they take up positions around what will be the entrance to the hole. The head of the necro guild dissapears for a few minutes, and then reappears and leaves, leaving the guards behind. When hailed, the guards respond with" This area is closed by the order of (I forget the paineel necro guild head's name). Leave now for your own saftey."

Visitors to the paladin guild in erudin finds all the paladins there extremely upset about something, and when hailed, they mumble something about "the hole reopens". Then, a few weeks later, and if you are of a high enough level, the guards around the hole allow you in. They could have added text like(for paladins)"Good. Perhaps the followers of good can finally be of some use. Have no fear, Paladin, when you die, your corpse will be resurected for the greater good of our lord Cazic-Thule" Come on, Verant.

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some names will be removed for privacy as I will be using snippets of one of our high level Enchanters, but in a nut shell.. why are we losing players?<br><br>"Basically Enchanters are back to being buff-#@!$es on large raids and apparently that can be done quite well playing [Enchanter], etc on a 2nd computer. In large groups, mesmo is a waste. Mana wise, it's much more efficient to divide and conquer, rather then trying to get 20-30 melee on a single mob. If mesmo doesn't land first try, the Enchanter just ends up being the tank for the 10 seconds it takes active target to die. Honestly, I don't see mesmo working in Veeshan's Peak - the high level mesmo's don't appear to work on giant mobs."<br><br>-- He's pretty accurate here, on the last few raids we've done with 40+ people involved it's been pretty pointless to try and mes everything and have literally 30 people beat on one thing. And for some odd reason an enchanter almost always died :P<br><br>"To consider the "Manna Robe" level 60 caster loot is a complete smack in the face. However, I have neither the time nor patience to fight "The Vision." I've already fought for changes on CRoA, Amulet of Necropotence, etc - to no avail. I don't want this to sound like a greed issue; however, there are essentially no "Oh my god!" rewards for a pure caster - at least, outside of VP .. and even that I question."<br><br>-- So I ask in the title of this post, what DOES Verant consider "Caster Loot"? and we continue to the meat of the issue:<br><br>"Every melee class and priest class has new weapons and new armor sets to be camped. INT casters have a few random pieces, which really don't do anything but continue to shuffle stat points. To be honest, it becomes a bit frustrating to hear requests to camp "the next piece of uber-gear" - when does an INT caster get to request help for camping gear? What do we have to look forward to? Apparently, nothing. I don't question the need for INT casters, I question the incentive to play one."<br><br>-- Yeah, I play a warrior. Thanks for giving me 9128379128317 new weapons to look forward to and a badass new set of armor to go with them. Our casters are all using basically the same gear they had pre-kunark with the exception of maybe 1 new robe, and a couple other trinkets.<br><br>"I'm still one of the best equipped casters in the game, yet my gear hasn't had a significant change in almost 5 months. This is basically true of all FoH's "Senior" casters. I don't speak on behalf of any of them; however, having zero goals to strive for certainly doesn't entice me to logon. Without even touching Veeshan's Peak, FoH melee and priest classes can replace/upgrade a good 75-100% of their gear in Kunark."<br><br>-- Again, thx 91283719283 new weapons and armor.<br><br>"Spells as loot? Hardly. That's ~ 18-20 "pieces of loot" of which 6-10 are used once level 60 is reached. I realize weapons & armor get dated as well; however, weapons do provide flexibility depending on the situation (i.e: Snare Whips, Truncheon of Doom, Stun Weapons). Regardless, priests have new armor sets, weapons, AND spells.<br><br>To be honest, I consider spell upgrades on par with melee skill gains or discipline gains, not loot. In the case of an Enchanter some of those spell upgrades are required to even touch a mob (mesmos/charm). You can still hit a level 55 mob with a Ykesha, level 49 Enchanter Charm/Mesmo get a nice cheese-out message of "this target is too high..."<br><br>With Veeshan Peak promising melee weapons with ratios greater then 1.0 and upwards of 2; I honestly don't see "caster power" keeping up. Our spells do not get more powerful. Our mana total still caps. I hear rumors of a true Mana Regen robe in VP, but Mana Regen isn't really an issue. Full Mana is Full Mana. Casters seem to be specifically exclused from items with any sort of regen/heal.<br>SPDAT is well examined, and there's no uber-promising effects that could be on a VP casters item."<br><br>-- That's pretty much his entire post with a few bits snipped out here and there, and some points I'm not sure I agree with but the general message here is "what the hell does Verant consider caster loot?" It's disheartening to see mele get new items almost every day/time a raid goes on while the casters sit around saying "gee that's nice, but the item i've been wearing for 30 levels now beats it out..."<br><br>So I ask here, what do other people think? What do those of you playing pure casters think of the loot for your classes? Are you satisified with depending on spells as your "oh my god!" loot?<br><br>I've asked around, wanting to know what people would consider "oh my god" loot and the best suggestion I've seen so far is something along the lines of a "spell haste" item for pure casters, whereas when the item worn the casting duration for X spell line is decreased by a certain percantage. Much like RBB/COF is 30% haste, you could have different items for casters that reduce spell casting time for certain types of schools, whether they be resistance based (have a COF type robe/cloak that reduces casting time for fire based spells) or the type of spell (abjuration/conjuration, etc). This is one of the biggest bonuses I could see for a pure caster because in reality.. there doesn't seem to be much left in the way of stat improvements, with mana being capped, INT/WIS doesn't do ANYTHING over 200, etc... what DO casters have to look forward to?<br><br>Bakara Bandylegs<br>Warrior of Veeshan<br><br><b>I guess that one of the situations is that things that are considered "good" caster loot aren't very diverse. Int casters want int, and that's it. Wis casters want wis, and that's it. Now, since the int/wis softcaps weren't changed in regards to Kunark, a lot of people are running around right up against 200 points. There's only so much more that can be done with them.<br><br>Melee characters on the other hand need weapons, AC, and every other stat they can get. As a caster, I really don't care about AC items that I can get, since if I get hit I'm dead anyway.<br><br>Basically, one of the cool things about being a melee class is that more options are open to you in regards to equipment. I think that casters will always be at a disadvantage in this area.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br></font></td>

The spawn point is shared by four spawns. The rarest of which is the quest spawn. I have been camping this particular spawn for the last three evenings. 5 hours per evening (I had a few books to read, so I figured I would do that during my camp fest). The quest spawn has not appeared. I have killed the no experience yielding lookouts, sentries, and veterans that have spawned in place of the quest NPC quite a number of times. A 72 minute spawn rate is not ok if the spawn point is shared with multiple spawns and the potentiality that the quest NPC will spawn is slim to none. It is quite unreasonable and the item is hardly worth it. I have personally waited on this spawn more than enough. Any reasonable person would have given up after three hours. Heck, I spent that much time waiting for the quest NPC in Misty Thicket and that still seemed painful--in hindsight, it was a pleasure in comparison.<br><br>Maybe you should use quest testers when you develop your new quests. Have one of your staff perform these quests and sit through the process. Then let us all know after such occurance which quests your staff has completed and have them tell us why these quests meet your "risk and rewards" criteria... and then have them rate their enjoyment level of performing these quests.<br><br>Personally, I enjoy the game for the most part. But I think every class, in order to make their group stronger and more competative against the environment has to make equipment improvements. A 3 AC upgrade is not very substancial of an improvement over my current glove, and the quest should reflect this.<br><br>Fortunately, my monk is not as item dependent as my soon to be deleted paladin, but there are gross examples of poor quest design for that class as well (see the mid level Ro armor quests).<br><br>Best,<br><br>M<br><br><b>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item.<br><br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br></font></td>

I read a post somewhere where you said it was a trade-off for the exceptional AC, yet there is no more AC than the comparable paladin armor and theirs is a third the weight of ours.<br><br>Is it because ogres and trolls can be SK's and they start with such high strength? Why penalize the small races simply because the large races have higher strength? Do they not pay for this in the form of an experience penalty? Let them have their strength advantage. It isn't fair to the rest of us who play smaller races.<br><br>What is your vision of a shadow knight? From the history of SK armor and weapons, I gather that it is a troll or ogre with a huge axe. Can you guys tone down on the Vision thing, please? It doesn't have to be cut and dry. Just because you see every shadow knight as a troll and ogre doesn't mean that the VAST majority of shadow knights are these two races. In fact it is the opposite. They are the minority. Don't adhere so closely to your Vision. Parts such as this should be a little more flexible.<br><br>And why is it that, even though trolls and ogres can be warriors, the Cobalt armor is as light as the paladin armor? Why is it that when it comes to the weight on SK armor and weapons (axes), the class is always measured in terms of a troll or ogre?<br><br>I think the weight issues on this armor should be reviewed and drastically reduced. Either that or increase the AC. And lay off the Vision a little, will ya? Sheesh.<br><br>Vaedar<br>Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br>Xegony<br><br><b>The guys have looked the issue over. The blood ember armor weight is intentional.

Am I missing an important reason why no_drop should still be in game for all but the most uber/critical items?<br><br>NODROP was originally created with the intent of requiring that someone be at a specific event in order to reap the benefits of it. Quest items are a good example of what NODROP was intended for. We also expanded upon this initial design as an anti-farming measure. <br><br>Of course, with all of the new lands, items, areas, creatures, etc., that Kunark brought to the table, and with the introduction of contextual random loot, the need for anti-farming measures is decreasing. Most of the items in Kunark are not NODROP unless part of some quest. <br><br>We probably won't, however, go about removing the NODROP tags from existing items.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>
