I wanted to separate out the two issues and discuss them individually. I've started a separate thread on the issue concerning the unannounced change of the partisan pack, which is a bag given by an NPC for the purpose of completing a quest. <br><br>In this thread I'd like to discuss my comments where I said:<br><br>"Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then."<br><br>After reviewing this post that I made earlier, I do agree that it appears to be a threat when viewed out-of-context, and understand the general reaction that followed. The point of the post was to respond to multiple posts from people earlier in the thread who had no idea that they shouldn't use combinable containers, particularly free bags given by NPCs to complete quests, for general item storage.<br><br>I'd thought that the number of people using the bags for this purpose were the exception rather than the rule, an observation that was apparently mistaken given public response to my post. Given that public response, we won't be taking any steps to "destroy" items in combinable containers upon logout or linkdeath.<br><br>I do apologize for the way my response was phrased and hope everyone understands that neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

Perhaps the NPC needs time to "craft" the quest item and changes in some way to show that they are ready to give the reward. Let the other items spawn almost continuously, and people would NEED to camp anything but the reward PC.<br><br><b>It's a doable idea, but wouldn't this be just a camp by another name? Whether I'm camping a creature that I want to kill, or one I want to talk to, it's still a camp. In this case, I can see 20 people standing around an NPC waiting for him to "be ready" and fighting over who can hand him the items fastest.</b><br><br>>>>2. Are there currently any suits of armor that give some "hidden" effect or bonus by virtue of wearing the entire suit? <br><br><b>No, there are not. It's a good idea though that might have some application for later implementation or future products.</b><br><br>>>>3. Are there currently any weapons in the game that have any "hidden" effect? <br><br><b>Not really. What an item can do is expressly stated upon it. We do have some plans for more cursed weaponry in the future, of course we just might have to be creative to "hide" the effect of the curse.</b><br><br>>>>4. If the answer to 2 and/or 3 is "no", are there any plans to add this feature to the game? <br><br><b>See above.</b><br><br>>>>5. You once said that GZ was going to conduct some tests with the wizard's spells vs. the other caster classes. Have these been completed? <br><br><b>Actually I believe that Brad said that, and it is indeed our opinion that offensive power is appropriate for the class.</b><br><br>>>>6. Why, exactly, was the definition of the wizard class changed on the everquest.com page under the classes section? <br><br><b>What change and when was it made? To my knowledge, it has read what it reads now since release. I believe that there was a change at one time in the beta period where it was changed from "damage" to "magical damage", but that's all I believe happened. Was there something else?</b><br><br>>>>7. Are there any plans to introduce items that directly influence/enhance trade skills? (Gnomish Jeweler's Loupe, Dwarven Smith's Hammer, Elven Sewing Needle, etc.) <br><br><b>Do you mean items that allow you to make better items with trades? It's a good idea, but we no firm plans in that direction.</b><br><br>>>>8. Why, since dwarves in fantasy literature (and even in EQ) are the finest smiths in all the realms, is there no ore in Kaladim? It even has a mine. <br><br><b>Good question. There's no ore in Kaladim? Hmmm, I'll check into that to see if it was a design or an oversight.</b><br><br>>>>9. Why can't enchanters be given a high-level illusion that allows them to change into the nearest ANIMATE object? <br><br><b>Races are a component of faction, and you adopt whatever race-faction you emulate. There's a lot of special case-coding to handle the animate races that players currently emulate. Opening that up to nearly everything else would be extremely problematic, if not impossible.</b><br><br>>>>10. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that absorbs magic directed at the wielder, perhaps converting it directly into mana/hit points? <br><br><b>There is already a bard song that has a damage shield that absorbs magical damage. There's also a cleric "reverse damage shield" that heals anyone that hits the target. That's the extent of what we have, and nothing new along these lines are planned.</b><br><br>>>>11. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that REFLECTS spells back at the caster? <br><br><b>No.</b><br><br>>>>12. Why can't the monk-only weapons that look like gloves be worn on the hands, and add directly to the ATTACK stat instead of requiring them to be 1h blunt? <br><br><b>Items cannot be set to use hand-to-hand skill, and combat can't go to an "equipment" slot to get combat statistics.</b><br><br>>>>13. If Verant doesn't like "spoiler sites", then why are there no spell descriptions anywhere in the game?<br><br><b>I think that you've answered your own question. We don't like spoilers. We'd prefer people figure these things out on their own and maintain their own knowledge-base.</b><br><br>>>>14. Will players ever be able to construct golems? (A.k.a. summon a temporary "golem-type" pet through some complicated quest) <br><br><b>We could certainly, by use of trade skill or quest, award an item that summoned a pet of any particular type, however we have no plans to do that at present.</b><br><br>>>>15. Necros can charm the undead; enchanters can charm...well...everything. Will Magicians ever have the ability/spell to charm elementals or other summoned creatures?<br><br><b>No, we have no plans along these lines at present.</b><br><br>>>>16. Are there any plans for an expansion geared toward the 10 - 30 range of player rather than the higher levels? <br><br><b>Velious is geared towards a higher level-range, however Kunark has support for all level ranges. <br><br>With Velious, the thinking is that there is already plenty of content to support the continually migrating portion of the customer-base that is in the 10-30 range. <br><br>I'm unable to talk about any post-Velious plans at this time.</b><br><br>>>>17. The Trackers' Water Extractor - This is currently broken, is it not? The purification tablets do not seem to exist, and the NPC that mentions them won't respond. <br><br><b>I inquired about this time time back, when Kunark first launched, and it was verified at the time that the tablets do exist. If I need to check into it further, please let me know.</b><br><br>>>>18. Bandages vs. Aloe Swatches vs. Maneater Plant Salve vs. Tailored Silk Bandages: Is there any difference other than price i.e. More healing, faster healing, etc.<br><br><b>No difference at this time.</b><br><br>>>>19. Are there any plans to give clerics any type of special ability that is tied to whatever deity they worship?<br><br><b>No, there are currently no plans along these lines. However, there are plans and implemented pieces of deity-specific quests that return deity-specific rewards.</b><br><br>>>>20. Are there any races and/or classes that you, personally, would like to see added to the game?<br><br><b>If we added a warrior/wizard hybrid, could we call him a "fire fighter"?<br><br>-Gordon</b></font></td>

It's one of the balancing factors for having them there to begin with.

This would help elliviate some of the time it takes to loot your own corpse. Backpacks and other items can be right clicked directly into inventory slots, so why can't equipment be right clicked directly on?<br><br>No, it used to be like this in early beta, but was purposefully changed to it's current state. It simulates some time necessary to reequip items, rather than having it more or less instantaneous.<br><br>>>>2. Will we ever be able to use the hot buttons while meditating? I had read that this was being worked on a while ago, but I wasn't sure if it was implemented. Also, will Hot buttons be able to be used on the Merchant Purchase screen as well (see the next question)?? <br><br>Maybe, it's on Roy's plate. There's no gameplay reason why we wouldn't allow it since we allow you to use them by clicking them with the mouse, so the only thing left is to see if there's some technical reason, and if not, to implement it.<br><br>>>>3. Will we ever be able to purchase multiple items at once (food, water, and trade skill items)? <br><br>See #2 above.<br><br>>>>4. Is there a way to have food that will give temporary boosts to Ability scores? I think it would be cool to eat a piece of Bread of Stamina, or Mana Muffins. Is this possible to add to the game, if it isn't already a part of the Cooking skill?<br><br>This is not in our current plans, though we like the idea and will keep it in mind.<br><br>>>>5. Is there a way to increase the Hide/Sneak speed for Rogues?? <br><br>Already in. Rogues above 50 sneak at progressivly faster speeds, until level 60 where they can sneak at a full run.<br><br>>>>6. Why does sitting increase the aggro distance on enemies, especially green ones? <br><br>It really doesn't, however, sitting PCs are automatically added to the hate-list of any NPC in the awareness radius. Normally, an NPC that isn't mad at you, but would attack you anyway, becomes aware of you before they react to you. So, in other words, if the awareness radius is 200 ft, and the reaction radius is 100 ft, a wolf would attack a standing person once he crossed into reaction range. However, when the person is sitting, they are added to the hate list at the awareness range. The ranges themselves don't actually change.<br><br>This is intended.<br><br>>>>7. Why is it that Monsters have the ability to turn around immediately? <br><br>See the FAQ. NPCs have to be able to do things PCs can't to remain competitive. <br><br>>>>8. Does anyone else think the monsters ability scores are unfairly high? <br><br>Same as #7<br><br>>>>9. Where stunning creatures goes (like above with bash), how come players never know when they have actually stunned creatures? <br><br>There is a text message indicates this.<br><br>>>>Why do the monsters stun and sometimes cause cahracters to spin?<br><br>Because being stunned allows the player to make no further inputs for the duration of the stun. As such, any turn that you've begun, will continue while stunned. You'll never get spun if you are simply facing the creature. You only get spun if you are turning at the time you are stunned. I've always thought that this was a neat effect.<br><br>>>>10. Why is it that monsters don't have to follow the same rules of hit detection that players have to conform to?? I cannot tell you the number of times I have seen monsters go through walls, monsters standing inside of one another, and monsters that pass right through players? <br><br>See #7.<br><br>>>>11. I have noticed that small races sometimes have problems climbing onto ledges, when exiting the water from swimming. This is especially true for the Halas zone, where my Halfling has to try numerous times to get out of the water at both ledges. Often while trying to climb onto the ice near the Halas dock, I will fall (for 1 pt of dmg) under the ledge, and then be under the water in front of the ledge. Usually I have this happen four or five times to try and get up the ledge. Is this a known problem?<br><br>It's a known problem, and unfortunately cannot be fixed without man-months of work on each zone (basically rebuilding each one from scratch) followed by excessively long downloads.<br><br>>>>12. The bugs involved with boat trips? I am sure I don't need to mention the numerous bugs associated with the boats, especially having to do with characters appearing to be swimming and sharks appearing ON the boat. Have these been looked at. A friend of mine said that he had seen a response that in order to fix these the whole zone would have to be redone. Is this true? Or, is there a remedy in the works?<br><br>Sharks appearing on the boats is not a bug, but a consequence of the design. As for other boat related issues, you'll have to list them one by one.<br><br>>>>13. The zone doors in some zones are ridiculously small, and this can often cause people to "get stuck" while zoning, and cause them to be sent back through the zone the other way. This happens frequently in the West Karana/Qeynos Hills zone<br><br>This particular zone is on our plate to fix. No ETR.<br><br>>>>14. Has anyone else noticed a lack of Guides/GMs during late night hours? I usually play from 1am EST till about 6am EST daily, and usually it is rare to see one Guide on at that time, if any at all. <br><br>We're always working to improve coverage in the off-hours. We just moved a bunch of GMs around to fill that area better. As for Guides, they are players just like yourselves. We take every opportunity to recruit off-hours guides and do the best we can in that area.<br><br>>>>15. This question driectly relates to #14 above. I myself tried to appply to be a Guide using the re-designed form that was announced last week. I logged in and created a password for the guide program, and then began filling out the questionaire. I was about half way done filling it out, when because of pressing issues at work I decided to finish it later. I had never atually submitted the form, but when I tried to log in again and fill it out, it said I had already submitted a form. I would still like to try and fill it out again, but it continues to say that someone with my account name has already filled out a Guide application. I would hate to have to wait until the next form comes out some months from now to try and apply again. I also seem to remember this same problem with the last guide app I tried to submit. <br><br>When filling out the guide account, it only allows a station name to be entered once in order to prevent multiple applications submitted by the same person. What most likely happened in this case, is that the application was read as completed and submitted for grading.<br><br>If a situation such as this occurs, the applicant may write appadmin@verant.com and supply the station name and email address used when filling out the application and ask that we delete it so they may resubmit. If they wish to wait, the application will go into the queue to be graded and will fail as incomplete and once the database is purged of failed applications they will be able to resubmit the application.<br><br>>>>16. Whe will we be able to purchase only the Kunark upgrade through a version of the online store again??<br><br>Last I heard we've about gotten all of the bugs worked out. The plan is to provide a web-based utility to allow separate purchase of Kunark. We'll release more information in regards to this when we have it. I'm sorry that I don't have anything more for you now. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

Last week it was suggested here on the boards that we implement a "Looking for Group" flag that players can set and view in order to help people get together quickly, allowing more time for adventuring. We've decided to try it out and it's on Test now.<br><br>The /lfg [on|off] command will set or unset your "LFG" flag. Players can then use all of the "/who" and "/who all" filters to find each others. For instance, "/who all rogue 45 50 lfg" will return all rogues between 45 and 50 who are looking for a group. "/who lfg" will return all players in the current zone who are looking for a group. <br><br>Your LFG flag will automatically unset when you enter a group. One final note, though anonymous and roleplaying characters can set their LFG flag, they will not show up in filtered /who lists. In other words, the first example above wouldn't return any anonymous rogues, however "/who all lfg" would return everyone in the game who is LFG (subject to the 20 person limit).<br><br>Assuming all goes well in testing, this change will most likely be in the next patch.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

We made groups, buffed up, and engaged the dragon only to have out ENTIRE force feared and sent running. As soon as the fear had gone, our whole caster force(Chanters, clerics, wizards, etc...) simply locked up, unable to cast any spell, and were simply mowed down one by one without a chance even to fight back. Is this what Verant intended?<br><br>Now before anyone get theyre panties up in a bunch, I want to make clear that I AM NOT, repeat, AM NOT complaining that our guild wasnt able to just slay this dragon without any challange at all. I really like that you made these two new dragons very challanging and not a cake walk like Vox and Nagfen had become. <br><br>What I am complaining about is that we didnt even get a chance at this dragon simply because out entire force was frozen unable to attack. I would just like ask Gordon/Verant if this is what you had in mind, or if this is a bug and do you intend to fix it. Thanks.<br><br><b>Hmmm, this patch was supposed to address that issue. The programmer who was doing unit testing on that, along with the rogue/pickpocket lockup along those same lines, wasn't able to reproduce it with this code.<br><br>I'll kick the issue back to them.

This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle. Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br><br><b>*Patch Day*</b><br><br>Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. <br><br><B>*General Enhancements*</b><br><br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br>- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally. Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook. Feel free to move one to the back. Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br>- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br>- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br>- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats. This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br>- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<br>- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<br><br><B>*Changes/Fixes*</b><br><br>- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br>- Scaler recipe now works<br>- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br>- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br>- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br>- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br>- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br>- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality. This has been repaired.<br>- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br>- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br>- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br>- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br>- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<br><br><B>*Dragons?*</b><br><br>Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended. Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch. Enjoy <br><br><br><B>*New Command For Tracking*</b><br><br>New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill. The command has two settings:<br><br>- ON: Default setting, same as it is now. Players will show up in the tracking window.<br>- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br><br><B>*Client Customizations*</b><br><br>Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory. This file contains customizable settings for:<br><br>- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br>- Default screen viewing mode<br>- Default travel speed (run or walk)<br><br>The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below. We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them. <br><br>Modifying this file is optional.<br><br><B>*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*</b><br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: <br><br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client.

It would make sense for them to have more classes available to them. Of course it's not really fair to include humans in the list as they can be anything but a shaman. <br><br>In any case, the game really isn't "light" vs. "dark". There isn't an alignment system that differentiates between the concepts of "good" and "evil". The faction system in game is far more complex than that, and makes more sense overall. Would dark elves consider themselves evil? Probably not. From their point of view the high elves probably look evil. Ogres and Trolls just don't have very discriminating diets, and there's no "evil" in consuming your prey.

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello all,<br><br>We're currently testing some new changes on the **Test Sever** that players should enjoy. I thought I'd come give everyone a sneak peak at what we are working on:<br><br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br><br>- /trackplayers [ON|OFF] command. This will allow rangers (and only rangers) to remove or include other players on their tracking display. <br><br>- New file, EQCLIENT.INI in your EQ directory will allow you to set some interesting options: 1) Color of all text messages (by setting RGB values for each defined text type: text types listed below), 2) Default "RUN", 3) Default "Overlay" view mode.<br><br>The EQCLIENT.INI setup info follows:<br><br>EQCLIENT.INI documentation<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. Here is a list of user color number to what it changes in game: <br><br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Unused at this time<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - Unused at this time<br>28 - Unused at this time<br>29 - Unused at this time<br>30 - Unused at this time<br>31 - Unused at this time<br>32 - Unused at this time<br><br>All colors to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client.

As we don't want to have to liberally ban people if it can be handled via other means, closing the threads is probably the best action we could take.<br><br>Dead issues: We'll also begin closing threads, explicitly or implicitly addressed to us, that we consider dead issues, issues that we've addressed already and consider "locked down". You all can feel free to continue discussing the issue amongst yourselves, but if it's a "Verant please read!" thread, and we consider the issue closed, we'll close the thread as well. We're going to do this in hopes of making room for new threads on other subjects that just can't seem to draw much interest on their first go-around. Rather than have a dozen threads pop up asking us to continue explaining the issue, this might be the best course of action.<br><br>In addition, I'm going to create a "dead issue" section of the FAQ for these things as they continue to come up.

Of course, it is possible that some of the notifications are missed due to zoning or fighting. at the time that the warning messages are sent. Others might log in after a message and feel that they weren't given a warning. I myself have sat on a server and watched warnings be issued every minute for 5 minutes, only to go into the chat-server and hear from people who didn't see the warning.<br><br>That said, if it's apparent that at least 5 minutes warning isn't given in the case of an outage, please let us know what server the problem occurred on so that we can take steps to ensure that proper warning is given in the future.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

The fact that we did publicize those additional numbers doesn't necessarily mean that we should publicize the next thing that seems "logical" given that argument. At some point we either have to stop releasing more numbers, or just release them all. Though there are certainly people who would like to see numbers on everything, we're of the mind that the game shouldn't be reduced to pure mathematics in the eyes of the players.<br><br>>>>Now about customer service.<br>>>>I have played now for 6 months atleast, bought two accounts because I knew my wife would love to play, (take my advice if you marry someone who loves pc games as much as you build or buy a second pc and phone line internet connection).<br>>>>I have played on Cazic thule, Karana, Solusek Ro and now my permanent home is 7th hammer.<br>>>>In all this time all my contacts with customer service, guides and GM's have been on my part respectful and none demanding, In all my time and contact I am pleased to say even when I have been turned down for what I asked, I never felt that I was being just brushed off.<br><br>Thanks for the note.

When the guide responded, said there was nothing she could do. I stated that I felt we could reproduce the bug and would that be proof, since to my knowledge it was an undocumented bug? Her response was again, no. So my question to the audience here, and to Abashi should he ever see this is: What is required to prove you are not lying to a GM?<br><br><b>Most bugs that would result in a resurrection leave some sort of signature that would allow the GM or Guide to verify the incident and make the correct decision. For instance, falling for 10K damage leaves a line of text that can be /reported in order to provide "proof".<br><br>The particular incident that you are mentioning however is not a bug. Centaurs by their nature are ornery critters, and have a very small percent chance of just going wild on someone. Of course this can be very inconvenient when there are other centaurs around, as their anger is contagious. <br><br>I think that one of the reasons people think that this is a bug is that this NPC personality trait isn't widely used in game. <br><br>-Gordon</b></font></td>
