Gordon has defended the changes, saying the world changes--you can't expect everything to be static. Unfortunately, both Gordon and many of the complainers have been wrong. The rule should be this: a change is NOT announced IF AND ONLY IF that change would be something reasonable in the fantasy world.<br><br>Example: Verant was right in not announcing the new dark elf camp. It is perfectly reasonable for dark elves to move into that camp.<br><br>Example: Verant was wrong to not announce the wolf form change.

It's a fairly good measuring stick. It doesn't quite fit every situation perfectly but it's probably as good as a written rule as we can apply. I think that there are more cases where we would decide to preannounce something that this rule says we shouldn't have to. <br><br>Also, one thing to point out is the difference between announcing something and preannouncing it.

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bertoxxulous server, being first alphabetically among EQ servers, has now become the default at the login screen. As we all know, many newcomers to EQ just click "PLAY," which sends them to the default server. Once, the default was the server with the lowest population. This helped servers to maintain a balance of population, with a few servers at each end of the population spectrum being the exceptions. This balance is no longer being kept in line. Even with a server split in late April, the population of Bertoxxulous has burgeoned and is reaching critical levels. Our server was hovering around 2200-2400 before the split. As of last night, the peak time population was in the high 2600's. This increase has been steady since the change in the login server organization. At this rate, Bertoxxulous will reach a peak time population of 3000+ within a few weeks. <br><br>My plea to you, Verant: Please return the default order of the servers to a population based order. This will help to even out the distribution of new EQ players, instead of watching them all pile into the already-crowded Bertoxxulous server. <br><br>Thank you for your consideration,<br><br>Player of McManus Lai'Dir, warrior of the Bertoxxulous server.<br><br><b>I thought I'd let you know that we are giving this issue some thought. There appears to be two problems associated with newer customers coming into the game:<br><br>1) They choose the one at the top of the list. This can be fixed by going back to the ascending list by population. <br><br>2) They choose the one with the most people, figuring that "More peope=better server". They skip over the 4 split servers that came up recently because they think that there must be something wrong with them if only 1000 people are on at peak. This one is more difficult issue to solve.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br><font size="1" color="660000">For the entire thread click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046639.html">here.</a></font></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A small, rural, area of Cazic Thule Wild Animal Park had acquired a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks, the female gorilla became very "in the mood," and difficult to handle. Upon examination, the park veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there were no male gorillas of the species available. While reflecting on their problem, The park administrators noticed an Ogre named Bakk, a part time, and half-sensible warrior, responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. The Ogre, like most Ogres, had little sense, but possessed ample ability to satisfy a female of ANY species. So, the park administrators thought they might have a solution. Bakk was approached with a proposition. Would he be willing to make love to the gorilla for 500 platinum? Bakk showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, Bakk announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions.<br><br>"First," he said, "Meez not want to kiss her. Secondly, you not tell people Bakk done this." <br><br>The park administration quickly agreed to these conditions, so they asked what was his third condition. <br><br>"Well," said Bakk, "Yubes gots to gib Bakk a week to come up wit de 500 platinum."</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 25th, 8:00am<br>--------------------<br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings all! The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>*Spells/Songs*<br><br>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br><br>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory. Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary. We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br><br>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected. Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br><br>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect. The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" <br><br>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level. They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis. They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br><br>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work. There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones. <br><br>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br><br>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></font></td>

Proficiency in a particular skill is not merely a function of skill points, but a function of level and stats as well. In other words, just because you stop gaining in one particular part of the equation doesn't mean that your proficiency hasn't changed.

Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br>- Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear. Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. <br>- Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed. Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed. In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible. The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br>- Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br><br><b>*Item Updates*</b><br><br>- Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br>- Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back. It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br>- The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact. This has been corrected.<br>- Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor. It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br>- The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br>- Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. <br>- The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br>- The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br>- The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br>- Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon. The "Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect.<br>- The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect on the targeted character.<br>- Mosquito Wings are available in game once again.<br>- Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have been repaired.<br><br>As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes to items that already exist in game. However, there are cases where a particularly unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail Whip mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest of maintaining game balance. <br><br>We will continue to repair problems, add content, and enhance gameplay in both Kunark and EQ proper.

However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we've decided to make a change.<br><br>Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, tomorrow morning we will be buffing up these newbie-protecting guards, making them immune to magic, and giving them some pretty good healing properties in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them.<br><br>In addition, though we will leave the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Currently they are typically on six-minute timers, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We will be normalizing the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <br><br>-Gordon<br><br><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#003366">Taken from yesterday's thread.

Being the gnome that I am, I asked them to do a little test for me. <br><br>Step 1: Blank out ALL of your mana. Use your lowest mana spell (eg true north) to get as little mana as possible. <br><br>Step 2: Sit without manaskin and time how long it takes to reach one bubble of mana.<br><br>Step 3: Repeat step 1. Now, with manaskin, time how long it takes to reach one bubble of mana.<br><br><br>-=-The Results-=-<br><br>Eaithahlsar, Level 52 High Elf Wizard:<br>200 INT, +310 Mana. <br>With Manaskin: 115 seconds.<br>Without Manaskin: 115 seconds.<br><br>Melendor, Level 52 Erudite Necromancer:<br>204 INT, +350 Mana.<br><br>With Manaskin: 127 seconds.<br>Without Manaskin: 126 seconds.

Manaskin only adds a very small amount to the mana-regen rate.

It is a diamond skin upgrade and uses a periodot to cast. It's still a very nice spell despite it's almost unnoticable mana regeneration.<br><br>-Porticemaster</font></td>
