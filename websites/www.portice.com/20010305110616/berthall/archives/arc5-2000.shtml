Features include: Several new poison books, stackable components, new suspensions, some purchasable components, and players now have the ability to purchase vials. Please check your vendors.<br>- Increased spell-drop percentages in three difficult Kunark zones where drops were less than should be expected.<br>- Corrected an error in the drop rate for a couple cleric spells making them unavailable. <br><br><b>Quest Fixes</b><br><br>- Fixed the "Minotaur Horns" Quest<br>- Fixed a misspelling in the guild-note for Erudite clerics worshipping Cazic-Thule.<br>- Fixed a misspelled keyword in the Trueshot Longbow Quest.<br>- The guild note for gnome clerics now states the appropriate gender for the guildmaster.<br>- Fixed the "illegible cantrip" Quest.<br>- Fixed the "Hunt for Meat" Quest.<br>- Removed Jinkus Felligan's doppelganger from Halas.<br>- Fixed the "Travis Twostring" quest.<br>- Fixed the "Algthin Dasmore" quest.<br>- Fixed the "Gather Components" quest.<br>- Fixed the "Lion Meat" quest.<br>- The Fleshy Orb quest and "Fabian" should really be fixed now. These were not correct after the last patch due to a data export issue.<br><br><b>Item Fixes</b><br><br>- Fixed spelling of "Basilisk Egg"<br>- The Brass Ring is now worn on the finger, instead of the waist.<br>- Fixed the "Broken Minotaur Lord's Horn"<br>- Fixed race/class restrictions listed for the "Bullsmasher". Item listed some inappropriate classes.<br>- Fixed race/class restrictions listed for "Patchwork Armor". Items listed some inappropriate classes.<br>- Fixed the model for the "Cast Iron Rapier".<br>- Fixed Race/class restrictions for the "Crushbone Belt". Item listed some inappropriate classes.<br>- Fixed the mundane "Electrum Peridot Bracelet" so that it would equip in the proper slot.<br>- The "Bloody Mantle" may now be equipped.<br>- Fixed the effect on the "Canyoneer Pike". Current owners of this item will need to trade it out with a GM in game.<br>- Fixed the "Howling Harpoon". Item was previously casting its spell upon the wielder, rather than the target. The fix will be automatically applied to existing items.<br>- Fixed the icon for the Degenerated Guk Weed.<br>- Fixed the icon for the Enshrouded Veil.<br>- The Splitpaw Hide Tunic will now look like "Leather" when equipped.<br>- "The Crusade of 1312AG" and "The Forbidden Tome" will now remain with the character after logout.<br>- Fixed race/class restrictions listed for the "Mortificator Staff". Item listed an inappropriate class.<br>- Fixed the icon for the Spectral Bow. In addition, removed "BRD" from the class listing since Bards do not have the Archery Skill.<br>- Removed excess classes listed on the "Silk Lined Steel Helm".<br>- Fixed the effect on the "Theurgist Mace".

Actually there was nearly a 1000 vote difference in favor of the current arrangement, but with over 180K votes total, that's well within the margin of error. This wasn't quite what we were expecting. <br><br>On the other hand, we've been hearing some good reports from the servers about the change. People who had never been on dragon runs, even ones not associated with guilds, have contacted and asked to go on dragon runs. In one case that I heard, a mid-30s cleric was invited along because they needed some extra healing power. <br><br>We're still keeping this matter open until we see how it plays out in game.

The chances of getting a spell are higher in some zones than others. Some zones (Karnor's comes to mind) don't have spells because there's enough loot there already.<br>2. Spell-drop chances are not completely random. In other words, you may have to go to several different zones to get all of your spells.<br>3. Not all spell drops are on the "random" tables. What I mean here is that sitting at a dungeon enterace or exit and pulling from the closest room will not guarantee that you get all of the spells in the zone/dungeon sooner or later. You might have to venture in further.<br><br>I hope this might clear up some of the ideas about spells out there. If anyone has any other questions or concerns, please post in this thread and I'll see if I can address your issue.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread, click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057923.html" target="_blank" >here.</a></font></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I often get email from a few folks who make some very good arguments concerning risk in PvP. Basically, the standpoint is that if the environment does not contain risk, there is no sense in engaging in it. "Item loot" itself does not handle this risk, as players of casting classes are not affected to the same extreme as melee characters.<br><br>One argument is that we should implement experience-loss in PvP. I like this idea, unfortunately some core issues with the way life in EQ works makes implementing this unreasonable. For anything that couldn't be handled in code, an additional load would be placed on the CS staff. Believe it or not, even though people playing on PvP servers should be more tolerant of interaction with other players, 90% of the petitions there are for some kind of perceived harassment. <br><br>The core EQ system, meaning, the things that define EQ as EQ, do not allow some of these issues to be resolved without drastically changing the PvE portion of the game which we want to remain intact.<br><br>That said, I still firmly believe that some form of risk associated with PvP needs to be in game. Since that risk cannot be experience-based, and item-based risk doesn't hurt people who can bag their items or fight without them, I'm considering the following option: Making it so that everyone, regardless of class, can only bind in cities on the PvP Servers only.<br><br>City-only binding (again, on PvP servers only) would allow people to, for instance, eject an opposing force from a zone, and provide the additional risk of making all of them run back to recover their corpse and engage again. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this?

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First off I would like to state that I am in awe at how little is being done about archery and how little Verant cares about the classes that can perform in this skill.<br><br>Everyone by now has become aware of the problems that archery has faced in this game. Everyone has become quite aware at how weak the skill is and how very useless it is as a whole. There are many problems that need to be addressed with archery. Everything from fletching to the actual shooting of the arrows and the damage inflicted. But Verant has previously shot down all complaints about archery citing that it is not a "valid form of combat" that archery "is a form of manaless casting" that archery if it were any more powerful it would cause the balance of the game to shift. And since these were the solid reasons given by Verant to deny any type of change in the positive for archery I must ask one question to Verant. Does that still hold true after the release of Kunark?<br><br>I bring this question up because Verant seems to have gone back on their own policies or rather their "Vision". If Archery is a form of manaless casting then may I then inquire to what all these new peices of armor is. Such as the Jaundiced bone bracer which has a unlimited amount of charges of the spell "winter roar" which is I believe a 250-290 dmg dd which btw is 10 fold more powerful than archery can ever prove to be. Or how about the ranger vambraces which holds stinging swarm, or even the cleric bracer that has stun? These all seem to be a "form of manaless casting" and a "valid form of combat". And I'm sure there are more examples such as these. <br><br>So if this is possible why is nothing being done about archery? Archery in its current state is nothing more than a tap on the back of a monster and a pulling tool. Why must the archers of Norrath sit back and have to deal with this type of punishment to their beloved skill? <br><br>Are we to watch Verant go back on their own words and be hypocrites? Or will Verant do something by fixing archery and making it a actual form of combat? Please I urge all of you archers to reply to this post and present it to Verant in the hopes that they will look at the circumstances and correct what needs to be corrected.<br><br>Vann Sillverrose<br>Ranger of Karana.<br><br><b>Archery was designed as a secondary form of combat. It was not meant to be more important or useful than melee combat or spell-casting. I understand that there are a lot of people out there that want to see it as a primary form of combat, seeing themselves as "archers", but that is not how we intended archery to be used in Norrath.<br><br>That said, there are some bows in game that do quite a fair amount of damage allowing someone to step back and take a few pot shots from time to time, but it won't replace melee.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056230.html" target="_blank" >here.</a></font></font></td>

In addition, the last poll we conducted on the subject actually surprised us with how many individual people expressed satisfaction when given a specific intent to express otherwise.<br><br>>>>My question to you Verant is this, Why then do some many people flame Verant on this board? <br><br>Human psychology. People are more likely to get worked up and post about something that upsets them than they are about something that pleases them. People who are happy with the game are often too busy playing it to come here to the boards.<br><br>>>>I can hardly find a nice thing being said about EQ or Verant.<br><br>Those posts are here, but the way the thread system works has the most controversial issues constantly being moved to the front page. Go back about 50 pages and see how many positive posts you see.<br><br>Also, check out other sites that we (Brad and I) do not post to regularly. You actually get some good discussions going on about various issues with very few of the flames that are popular here. I frequently go out and read these other boards to "get my bearings" when I get the feeling that what is so often portrayed here is the norm. <br><br>>>>Here is my take on the problem. First off, you are using the stick to motivate players. Nerfs, EXP. losses post 50, slow EXP climbs and lack of bug fixes, customer support, etc.<br><br>Given the choice of only the "stick" or the "carrot", as your title mentions, I would say that we actually provide more carrot than stick. There is always more to do in EverQuest. More items to get, new spells to learn, new quests to complete, and other classes that haven't been played. We provide so much stuff to do that no one will ever experience all of the diversity that EverQuest has to offer.<br><br>>>>At level 50+ you camp EXP. Thats right, sit down and kill/kill/kill just to see your exp bar move a pixel<br><br>I'm a little dismayed that people continue to do this. Prior to levels above 50 being attainable, people did not "camp EXP" at level 50. They were happy to have fun and play the game at level 50 with the general understanding that they would never advance. All of a sudden we open up levels above 50, and everyone goes in XP camp mode. Why? There's no point to it. If they just played the game the same way that they were playing it once they reached 50, they would find themselves advancing. <br><br>I guess that it's the mindset that the "carrot" in this case encourages. <br><br>>>>Nerfs. Why so many for all the wrong reasons? Instead of coding something properly we get unannounced nerfs. Then Verant wonders why people flame them? I don't understand. Throw a cold bucket of water on me while I am sleeping and I can guarantee I will not be a happy person.<br><br>We don't enjoy nerfing anything. Players will always figure out things that we didn't intend. Let's face it, players have far more people "on the job" than we do. We don't enjoy nerfing, and we do enjoy enhancing. However, enhancing or nerfing exclusivly will break the game quickly. Many are fond of quoting this article titled "Mudwimping", which advocates exclusive enhancements. There's a term for that as well that the author doesn't mention: Mudflation. <br><br>>>>Verant, I truly think you have a great game. I think it needs alot of work to be one of the all time great games. Remeber to use the carrot and not the stick and I bet your reputation will come back full swing. I also would be willing to bet that me/us will once again truly enjoy a great game.<br><br>Though I didn't agree with some of your assertions, I would like to thank you for taking the time to express your opinions. <br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

Then, one day, a player walks up to the head of the wizard guild (or cleric, or whatever) to get a quest. Instead of the normal text, the guild head says ".....excuse me. For a moment I felt something....." and proceeds to give you the quest. The head of the magician's guild gives an even darker tale.(after all, the hole is populated with earth elementals, and one would think that after all that time in there, they'd be a little screwed up...). Then, A large group of NPC shadowknights goes through the newbie field in paineel (maybe lead by the head of the necro guild)and they take up positions around what will be the entrance to the hole. The head of the necro guild dissapears for a few minutes, and then reappears and leaves, leaving the guards behind. When hailed, the guards respond with" This area is closed by the order of (I forget the paineel necro guild head's name). Leave now for your own saftey." If you try to go in, you are zoned back to the entrance of paineel. (we know Verant can do it, look at vox). Visitors to the paladin guild in erudin finds all the paladins there extremely upset about something, and when hailed, they mumble something about "the hole reopens". Then, a few weeks later, and if you are of a high enough level, the guards around the hole allow you in. They could have added text like(for paladins)"Good. Perhaps the followers of good can finally be of some use. Have no fear, Paladin, when you die, your corpse will be resurected for the greater good of our lord Cazic-Thule" Come on, Verant.

The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status. The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the "Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface. The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until later.<br><br>As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support characters starting at about level 40. It should be regarded as extremely dangerous. As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST. The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. <br><br><br>Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only<br><br>As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting rules for PvP combat on Vallon<br>Zek.<br><br><br>Resurrection<br><br>Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection. Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we've raised this limit from two hours to three. This should assist players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br><br><br>Warping<br><br>We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the larger Kunark zones. Please let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>Locked Doors<br><br>We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks. In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked doors without opening them. <br><br><br>Vox and Nagafen<br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers. As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br><br>One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging. This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people. This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br><br>Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights. Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons. This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players. In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings!<br><br>For those who do not know, as of this writing (6/21/2000), I am a level 52 Shaman with a 134 Alchemy skill. Just so you know my credentials  <br><br>I recently started selling gate potions. While this increased quite a bit the number of questions I field everyday, I have always been asked things about Alchemy. Also, on a regular basis, I have had to correct people with misconceptions about Alchemy and the potions Alchemists can make. <br><br>This document is an attempt to address some of these in a public forum, sort of a pre-emptive strike as it were. <br><br>*All player made alchemy potions have a CASTING TIME <br><br>**This means that all player made alchemy potions can be interrupted, just like if you were casting a spell. <br><br>***However, the potion is not used up if interrupted, so you can try again.<br><br>*No Alchemy potions are stackable in Inventory <br><br>*Each potion is ONE dose, meaning that if it is successfully used, it goes away. Just like a beer, you drink the beer, the beer goes away. <br><br>*Any race/class can use any Alchemy potion <br><br>*All potions that raise your Stats (STR, DEX, etc.) STACK with player cast buffs. I call these STAT potions. <br><br>**All STAT potions have side effects, positive and negative. For example: Greater Potion of Purity is +25 STR, +15 DEX and MINUS 20 STAmina (about 45hp for a level 50 shaman if remember right) However, if you are the dmg dealer, and not the dmg taker, this is a great buff for warriors and melee types with Proccing weapons. BTW, there are other STR potions with different side effects. <br><br>**There are two types of potions. There are auras and then there are the other physical stat potions. The auras are the potions with resists. <br><br>***Not all Aura potions will stack with the other potions. Of the ones that can, you can only stack one aura potion with one physical stat potion. NOTE: Purity and Power do NOT stack <br><br>*Potions that increase a STAT and/or resistance put up a Buff Icon. If your screen has 15 buff Icons up already, it will not work. You will be given the "This spell did not take hold" message and your potion will be GONE.<br><br>*Invis VS Undead Potion (IVU) works exactly like the player cast spell. So, the duration is random. Also, if a MOB would see through an IVU spell cast by a player, it will also see through the IVU potion. They are the same effect.<br><br>*SoW Potions work in OUTDOOR zones only. If Shaman/Druid can CAST SoW in a zone, then you can drink the potion in that zone. You can however drink the potion while in an OUTDOOR zone and then go into an indoor zone and you will still have SoW speed. Again, works just like the player cast SoW. Have been told by customers that they last a long time tho, longer than a SoW buff from a player.<br><br>*Shrink Potions currently work in DUNGEONS only (Fear and Hate zones are not considered dungeons, although Sky is). Again, if a Shaman can cast the Shrink spell in the zone, then you can use the potion too. It lasts as long you stay in the zone. However, it will go away when you camp, sometimes when you go LD, and if you change your form after drinking the potion (IOW, if you drink shrink potion, then cast wolf form, shrink will go away. If you want to be a teeny tiny wolf, go wolf form first, THEN drink potion) One note on this, Verant has said that they will be making the potion work in all zones "soon", whenever that is.<br><br>*Damage Shield potions are DRINKER dependant. (Level/4)+1 truncated (not exact, but very close). So, no, you can't buy them for your level 4 character for twinking, unless you only want a 2 point damage shld. A level 48 player gets a 13 point Dmg Shld. Lasts 8 to 9 minutes and STACKS with ALL player cast Damage shields.<br><br>*Potion of Frost goes to Everfrost. Have been told it drops you in the 3 Igloo area in Everfrost, near BB. If you can confirm, please do so<br><br>*Potion of Swamp goes to Innothule Swamp. You land in the Southern Hand that sticks out of the swamp, where the Shadowmen are. Shadowmen pose me no problems, but probably depends on your class/level. I wouldn't use Swamp potion if you were level 20, that's for sure. The Feerrott zone is West of the Hand<br><br>*The Lizard Blood Potion is NOT made by alchemists, it is dropped by a MoB.<br><br>*Alchemy made gate potions (Frost and Swamp) have about a 25 second casting time (according to a customer report). Obviously not a get-away-quick potion. It is a transportation potion. To help Tanks stuck in fear, or deep inside a dungeon, when no porters are available, or even as a way to get to Everfrost more quickly than porting to NK. I'm sure you can come up with many other situations where it would be handy (Can we say Kunark? I knew you could, hehe).<br><br>*The cost to a shaman to make a Potion is NOT the cost of the herbs that make it. For example, using nice round fictional numbers that do not relate to any potion in particular: Potion of Uberness requires Herb X and Herb Y. Herb X costs 15pp and Herb Y costs 5pp. This means that the total cost per ATTEMPT to make the potion is 20pp. If the Alchemists is 100% successful (yea, right, heh) then it does indeed cost 20pp to make. BUT, if the success rate is 75% instead, it actually costs the alchemist 26.7pp per success. If 50%, would cost 40pp per success. If 25%, would cost 80pp per success. That is the cost to the alchemist to make the potion. From there, it is up to the individual Alchemist to decide on a fair profit margin for himself and the customer. But please do not confuse cost per attempt with cost per success. I am constantly running into people who have gone on a website somewhere, jotted down herb component prices, and now think they know how much it costs to make the potion and try to argue with me about my prices.<br><br>*Alchemy skill is Level Capped and is a Shaman Only Skill. (Level-24)*5 For example, a level 50 Shaman would have a cap of 130: (50-24)*5=130 This means you must be at least at level 25 before being able to do any alchemy. Would not suggest trying to make gate potions until skill of 130, although some have started at 120 on other servers. Even if you start at 120 skill, you have to be level 48 to be able to get a skill that high. So, no, you can't create a mule shaman to make gate potions for you unless you are willing to Powerlevel the Shaman to level 48-50 and are willing to spend lots of plat, even with the price redux in herbs, will still take LOTS of plat to raise your skill high enough after you get level 48.<br><br>I would like to thank the people of Bristlebane who frequent The Inn of Bristlebane (<a href="http://www.draedon.com/cgi-bin/inn.pl">http://www.draedon.com/cgi-bin/inn.pl</a>) who helped with various info and questions. <br><br>--Mebe Spiritbringer of Bristlebane (Halo of Fire)<br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/054553.html">here.</a></font></font></td>

I've addressed the wizard before, and it led to nothing but bad feelings by those on the boards. <br><br>The idea of "defending" our position suggests that somehow, if I provide enough information, that all wizards (or all players of any other class for that matter) will be convinced that they are powerful enough, useful to the group, and appropriately balanced in the grand scheme of things.

I found it accidentaly too and I exploited it for what about 20mins before the gm came. Now im faced with the delima of should I ever return to that zone. I'm now unsure that if I fight them legitimatly will I be banned?. And if infact it comes to banning people which happens, you are in effect actually fining people the 10 bucks a month put into EQ and purchase price of the game. You should just accept that the game has faults not threaten to ban the very people that have made your company millions of dollars thus putting the blame on players for your faults. On a plus note I think EQ is a great game, very bugged but great nonetheless.<br><br><b>Warnings are just that: Warnings. They should be taken to heart as a learning experience.

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some names will be removed for privacy as I will be using snippets of one of our high level Enchanters, but in a nut shell.. why are we losing players?<br><br>"Basically Enchanters are back to being buff-#@!$es on large raids and apparently that can be done quite well playing [Enchanter], etc on a 2nd computer. In large groups, mesmo is a waste. Mana wise, it's much more efficient to divide and conquer, rather then trying to get 20-30 melee on a single mob. If mesmo doesn't land first try, the Enchanter just ends up being the tank for the 10 seconds it takes active target to die. Honestly, I don't see mesmo working in Veeshan's Peak - the high level mesmo's don't appear to work on giant mobs."<br><br>-- He's pretty accurate here, on the last few raids we've done with 40+ people involved it's been pretty pointless to try and mes everything and have literally 30 people beat on one thing. And for some odd reason an enchanter almost always died :P<br><br>"To consider the "Manna Robe" level 60 caster loot is a complete smack in the face. However, I have neither the time nor patience to fight "The Vision." I've already fought for changes on CRoA, Amulet of Necropotence, etc - to no avail. I don't want this to sound like a greed issue; however, there are essentially no "Oh my god!" rewards for a pure caster - at least, outside of VP .. and even that I question."<br><br>-- So I ask in the title of this post, what DOES Verant consider "Caster Loot"? and we continue to the meat of the issue:<br><br>"Every melee class and priest class has new weapons and new armor sets to be camped. INT casters have a few random pieces, which really don't do anything but continue to shuffle stat points. To be honest, it becomes a bit frustrating to hear requests to camp "the next piece of uber-gear" - when does an INT caster get to request help for camping gear? What do we have to look forward to? Apparently, nothing. I don't question the need for INT casters, I question the incentive to play one."<br><br>-- Yeah, I play a warrior. Thanks for giving me 9128379128317 new weapons to look forward to and a badass new set of armor to go with them. Our casters are all using basically the same gear they had pre-kunark with the exception of maybe 1 new robe, and a couple other trinkets.<br><br>"I'm still one of the best equipped casters in the game, yet my gear hasn't had a significant change in almost 5 months. This is basically true of all FoH's "Senior" casters. I don't speak on behalf of any of them; however, having zero goals to strive for certainly doesn't entice me to logon. Without even touching Veeshan's Peak, FoH melee and priest classes can replace/upgrade a good 75-100% of their gear in Kunark."<br><br>-- Again, thx 91283719283 new weapons and armor.<br><br>"Spells as loot? Hardly. That's ~ 18-20 "pieces of loot" of which 6-10 are used once level 60 is reached. I realize weapons & armor get dated as well; however, weapons do provide flexibility depending on the situation (i.e: Snare Whips, Truncheon of Doom, Stun Weapons). Regardless, priests have new armor sets, weapons, AND spells.<br><br>To be honest, I consider spell upgrades on par with melee skill gains or discipline gains, not loot. In the case of an Enchanter some of those spell upgrades are required to even touch a mob (mesmos/charm). You can still hit a level 55 mob with a Ykesha, level 49 Enchanter Charm/Mesmo get a nice cheese-out message of "this target is too high..."<br><br>With Veeshan Peak promising melee weapons with ratios greater then 1.0 and upwards of 2; I honestly don't see "caster power" keeping up. Our spells do not get more powerful. Our mana total still caps. I hear rumors of a true Mana Regen robe in VP, but Mana Regen isn't really an issue. Full Mana is Full Mana. Casters seem to be specifically exclused from items with any sort of regen/heal.<br>SPDAT is well examined, and there's no uber-promising effects that could be on a VP casters item."<br><br>-- That's pretty much his entire post with a few bits snipped out here and there, and some points I'm not sure I agree with but the general message here is "what the hell does Verant consider caster loot?" It's disheartening to see mele get new items almost every day/time a raid goes on while the casters sit around saying "gee that's nice, but the item i've been wearing for 30 levels now beats it out..."<br><br>So I ask here, what do other people think? What do those of you playing pure casters think of the loot for your classes? Are you satisified with depending on spells as your "oh my god!" loot?<br><br>I've asked around, wanting to know what people would consider "oh my god" loot and the best suggestion I've seen so far is something along the lines of a "spell haste" item for pure casters, whereas when the item worn the casting duration for X spell line is decreased by a certain percantage. Much like RBB/COF is 30% haste, you could have different items for casters that reduce spell casting time for certain types of schools, whether they be resistance based (have a COF type robe/cloak that reduces casting time for fire based spells) or the type of spell (abjuration/conjuration, etc). This is one of the biggest bonuses I could see for a pure caster because in reality.. there doesn't seem to be much left in the way of stat improvements, with mana being capped, INT/WIS doesn't do ANYTHING over 200, etc... what DO casters have to look forward to?<br><br>Bakara Bandylegs<br>Warrior of Veeshan<br><br><b>I guess that one of the situations is that things that are considered "good" caster loot aren't very diverse. Int casters want int, and that's it. Wis casters want wis, and that's it. Now, since the int/wis softcaps weren't changed in regards to Kunark, a lot of people are running around right up against 200 points. There's only so much more that can be done with them.<br><br>Melee characters on the other hand need weapons, AC, and every other stat they can get. As a caster, I really don't care about AC items that I can get, since if I get hit I'm dead anyway.<br><br>Basically, one of the cool things about being a melee class is that more options are open to you in regards to equipment. I think that casters will always be at a disadvantage in this area.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others have mentioned this already, but I figured repetition will help clarify the situation for you... The spawn point is shared by four spawns. The rarest of which is the quest spawn. I have been camping this particular spawn for the last three evenings. 5 hours per evening (I had a few books to read, so I figured I would do that during my camp fest). The quest spawn has not appeared. I have killed the no experience yielding lookouts, sentries, and veterans that have spawned in place of the quest NPC quite a number of times. A 72 minute spawn rate is not ok if the spawn point is shared with multiple spawns and the potentiality that the quest NPC will spawn is slim to none. It is quite unreasonable and the item is hardly worth it. I have personally waited on this spawn more than enough. Any reasonable person would have given up after three hours. Heck, I spent that much time waiting for the quest NPC in Misty Thicket and that still seemed painful--in hindsight, it was a pleasure in comparison.<br><br>Maybe you should use quest testers when you develop your new quests. Have one of your staff perform these quests and sit through the process. Then let us all know after such occurance which quests your staff has completed and have them tell us why these quests meet your "risk and rewards" criteria... and then have them rate their enjoyment level of performing these quests.<br><br>Personally, I enjoy the game for the most part. But I think every class, in order to make their group stronger and more competative against the environment has to make equipment improvements. A 3 AC upgrade is not very substancial of an improvement over my current glove, and the quest should reflect this.<br><br>Fortunately, my monk is not as item dependent as my soon to be deleted paladin, but there are gross examples of poor quest design for that class as well (see the mid level Ro armor quests).<br><br>Best,<br><br>M<br><br><b>Most of the complaints I see in regards to these rare spawns for quest components is related to the general feeling that there is an "entitlement" to these items. There isn't. No one is entitled to any particular item.<br><br>You can't fix a situation where everyone is camping by making what they are camping for more plentiful. That just encourages camping, as the camp duration gets shorter, and more people feeel that the camp time is worth the effort. As it is now, maybe people will get the idea that the camp is too long, and just choose not to camp. Then perhaps someone happening by can get lucky and find the spawn in question. If people are still choosing to camp it, perhaps we need to look into making it even rarer, closing the quest, or look into creating other items that represent reasonable alternatives to the item that people are choosing to camp.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br></font></td>

I don't know the answer to this question that has been plaguing me lately. Hopefully you can shed some light on the subject.<br><br>My AC and attack unbuffed have always been under 1000 Pre-RoK. With the exception when I had the shammy strength and/or wolf form my attack would get to the 1030ish. Not really a big deal when I viewed ATK 1030/1000 cause it didn't happen that often. Since RoK has come out, I am currently at level 55 and my attack is now greater than 1000 (i.e. 1040/1000). Does this mean that my attack is capped at 1000 and only 1000 is going to be caculated? My AC is slowly approaching 1000 as well. Will this be the case for AC to? <br><br>If that is the case then please consider lifting those caps. If it's not the case, why not just get rid of the /1000 part and have a single number up there for AC and ATK?<br><br>Thank you in advance for your time.<br><br><b>Numbers over 1000 are indeed calculated.<br><br>Back in beta, for a time, AC and ATK were displayed with two numbers each, showing the different components of the factor. For instance, AC was displayed with both a damage avoidance and a damage mitigation factor. This was highly confusing to a majority of the players, so both numbers were combined for the purpose of display.<br><br>Basically, the two numbers were added, then divided by a theoretical max that one could attain at the time, yielding a percentage. It's this percentage that is displayed.<br><br>Now, when we brought new items into the game that raised the true theoretical max (as opposed to the calculated theoretical max), and espicially when we brought out Kunark, we could have raised the calculated theoretical max so that the percentage would always be below 1000, but that would have resulted in most people seeing their AC drop, making them think that we had somehow nerfed it. So we left the calculated max the same, yeilding numbers greater than 1000.<br><br>For actual combat calculations, the values you see are still reduced into their specific componenets which aren't capped with exception of lower level twinking-impact caps that we've referenced before.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052536.html" target="_blank" >here.</a></font></font></td>

Am I missing an important reason why no_drop should still be in game for all but the most uber/critical items?<br><br>NODROP was originally created with the intent of requiring that someone be at a specific event in order to reap the benefits of it. Quest items are a good example of what NODROP was intended for. We also expanded upon this initial design as an anti-farming measure. <br><br>Of course, with all of the new lands, items, areas, creatures, etc., that Kunark brought to the table, and with the introduction of contextual random loot, the need for anti-farming measures is decreasing. Most of the items in Kunark are not NODROP unless part of some quest. <br><br>We probably won't, however, go about removing the NODROP tags from existing items.<br><br>-Gordon</font></td>

People would get upset and leave if they suddenly found themselves unable to play that character that they have months of playtime invested in. It would be an all-too-regular occurence if server population were capped.<br><br>Also, people new to the game often have friends that already play. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we just told all of these new players that they couldn't play with their friends.<br><br>As for your assertions on what would be fixed:<br><br>>>>Camping would be lessened<br><br>No, it wouldn't. People still camp on the test server which only has about 500 people on it at peak. They camp because its an easier and preferred method to get experience and loot. What there *would* be is less people waiting to join a particular camp. We're always working on this issue by trying to get people to spread out, moving loot around, randomizing drops, etc.<br><br>>>>Class envy would be less because competition would be less.<br><br>Class-envy will exist as long as some class can do something that another class can't. It's not related to competition for most. <br><br>>>>Finding groups would be easier<br><br>Actually we've found that smaller populations have more problems finding groups than larger ones. With more people on the server, there are more groups, and thus more groups that aren't full, leading to more groups that need people. <br><br>Servers with smaller populations (PvP servers, Test) often have people who cite problems finding groups, as well as problems getting services such as binding or resurrections during off-peak times.<br><br>>>>Economy would not be as screwed up<br><br>The economy being "screwed up" is subjective. Trading among people happens very frequently on the servers. Signs of a screwed up economy in a game of this nature are indicated by a lack of demand, due to an excess of supply, or vice versa. Either the items are too valuable to trade, or they are too worthless to be traded. <br><br>Since people are constantly trading items, the economy isn't "screwed up".<br><br>>>>People would be able to play and enjoy themselves and when the can actually play, they will tend to dwell less on the things they *cant* do, and the things they *cant* get.<br><br>That's based upon the personal psyche and choice of each player.

A couple of months ago Porticemaster came along, and did all the things I did not have the time, nor graphic talent to do, and has helped make this site much much more...  Now I feel that it should go a step further and better reflect the Bertoxx community... I would like to invite people to submit events to the calendar... not just the normal events already there, and not the ones that we have already said cannot be calendared... I want to see your community events... Weddings, swap meets, user run events, etc...  And with the addition to this, we will begin putting the planes and such in caps at the beginning of the event listing, so it is still easy to see such events and plan your own...  I think this is a good idea, though I could be wrong and have been in the past... But I think this site has now become a larger part of the Bertox community and as such can begin to take on further roles reflecting that...<br><br>Be Safe,<br>Webadmin</font></td>

Or even the best possible xp return. They only return the xp a 49th level res gives. Now that new higher level res's are out, it's obvious that this can be changed easily. Anyone who gets a GM res obviously deserves all the xp that they lost to whatever bug killed them. <br><br>2- The 49th level cleric spell has a 2 hour time limit on xp return. Also, when you make a petition and log out, that petition is cleared. (I might be wrong on this, but you can only put in one petition at any time, and if you log and come back, you can repetition). So...say you die and lose xp to some bug. You petition, and sit and wait. No gms are on. What can you do? If no gms are on in the next 2 hours, you're out of luck as far as a res goes. (Or even if they are on, but don't get to your petition in time) If you camp to preserve your timer, your petition goes away. If you don't have friends who are willing to come res you, or petition for you while you wait offline and then contact you, your xp is gone.<br><br>Why can't you give Guides and GMs a different version of Ressurect, that isn't constrained by time and returns 100% lost xp, and simply make it inaccessible to players? Anyone who is getting a res has proven that their xp was lost to an error and they deserve to have it back. Therefore, Verant should be doing everything possible to restore all their xp, and not limit their return because they chose to limit a player castable pre-expansion spell. <br><br><b>>>>GM ressurections constrained by 49 cleric spell...<br><br>No, they are not. They return 100% of the experience lost. They used to be constrained, not by the 49th cleric rez, but by the XP modifier for the zone. All rez's were constrained by this. <br><br>It was corrected a few months ago.<br><br>>>>2- The 49th level cleric spell has a 2 hour time limit on xp return. <br><br>All rez's have this two hour limit, not just the 49th cleric rez. We're currently looking into the possibility of having the GM Rez excluded from this time limit, but it's difficult, so I don't have an ETA. <br><br>>>>Also, when you make a petition and log out, that petition is cleared. <br><br>No, it's not.

If a GM has determined that you deserve a GM res, why not have it a full, no strings attached res?<br><br>2.) What is with all the random faction hits in the Lake of Ill Omen?<br><br><b>>>>GM's can do an Exp res when there is a game play problem right?

If a GM has determined that you deserve a GM res, why not have it a full, no strings attached res?<br><br>The process that attaches the "Resurrection Effects" is on the back end of the resurrection code. At the time that the effects are applied, all it knows is that you have been resurrected, not by what spell, which is why it's attached to all resurrections. I agree that this is a bit of a pain, and I'll see if we might have another way to determine what kind of Rez has been cast.<br><br>>>>2.) What is with all the random faction hits in the Lake of Ill Omen?<br><br>They aren't precisely random. They occur when you are on the hatelist of a creature killed by another group. Basically, it's part of the Hatelist propagation issue described here a few days ago.<br><br>For instance, you attack NPC A, who yells for help to NPC B, who yells for help to NPC C. NPCs A and B are close enough to you to chase after you, however NPC C is not. NPC C wanders around the zone and yells for help to NPCs D, E, F, and G, who are all too far away to come after you. However, since they all have a copy of the hatelist, whenever they are killed you will take a faction hit.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051430.html" target="_blank" >here.</a></font></font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br><b>General</b><br><ul><br>  <li>Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.</li><br>  <li>Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.</li><br>  <li>Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.</li><br>  <li>Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.</li><br>  <li>Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now. </li><br>  <li>Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.</li><br></ul><br><b>Items</b><br><ul><br>  <li>A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.</li><br>  <li>The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.</li><br>  <li>A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.</li><br>  <li>Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.</li><br></ul><br><b>PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions</b><br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable. <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.<br><br><b>Risk and Reward</b><br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk. <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br><b>PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers</b><br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via <a href="http://www.everquest.com">www.everquest.com</a>.<br><br><p>- The EverQuest Team</p></font></td>

Player characters get one chance to accept a resurrection. If they refuse, they can still be transported to the site with a resurrection, but won't get experience."</b></i><br><br>That is completely accurate, but does not precisely capture the entire issue. If a player does not accept the Resurrection (or Resuscitate) for ANY reason they have completely lost the opportunity to receive a restoration of experience. Those reasons can include: <br><br><ul><li>Being AFK and the cleric not bothering to check until the player is ready.</li><br><li>Going LD while the Res is being cast.</li><br><li>Zoning while the Res is being cast.</li><br><li>Saying no because you have no idea what spell was cast or upon which corpse (nobody contacted you ahead of time).</li><br><li>Being unfortunate enough to have someone open a trade with you (interferes with the dialog box).</li><br><li>The zone repops while waiting for the Res (all information gone).</li><br><li>My favorite of all, some well -or not so well- intentioned cleric casting Revive upon your fresh corpse. That's right, you can absolutely remove the possibility of a player receiving an experience res by tossing a good old Revive upon them. There is NOTHING the recipient can do to protect themselves against this. Nothing.</li></ul><br>The list above is intentionally left short; I'm sure the more imaginative among us can come up with many more examples. <br><br>In discussions about this issue on the EQ-Cleric site some clerics pointed out that nobody was absolutely entitled to an experience ressurection. I agree and disagree with that statement. In my opinion it would be more accurate to state that: <br><br>"Nobody is entitled to having a level 39+ cleric Rescusitate or Ressurect them, but if a player were fortunate enough to have one willing to do it, then they are absolutely entitled to being able to receive it successfully with regard to the game mechanics." In other words, if I have a cleric willing to Res me then I absolutely expect to get the experience restoration even if I miss the dialog box through being afk, crashing, zoning to avoid another death, or any other of the numerous possibilities. And as a cleric who provides many ressurections every night, I expect my recipients to always receive the experience I am willing to restore for them, even if I forgot to warn them I am casting (it's happened), they miss clicked (it's happened), they've gone link dead (it's happened), someone opened a trade window with them (it's happened), they went AFK after confirming with me (it's happened), the zone repops (it's happened), or any other conceivable reason. <br><br>The solution to this is simple, although the programming may not be. <br><br><ul><li>A player is eligible to receive an experience resurrection no matter how many times they click NO (or do nothing) until they either click YES, or their 2 hour time limit is expired.</li><br><li>If a zone repops please save the information required to provide the resurrection. I'm sure it's doable, albeit possibly difficult.</li><br><li>If a player goes linkdead AFTER clicking YES, either provide the experience anyway, or if that's not possible then allow them to still be eligible upon their return to the game.</li></ul><br>I agree with many who have stated before that NOBODY is 100% entitle to an experience resurrection from another player. I've said no so many times that I made a macro for it =P. However, if two players are willing to complete the transaction (a cleric and the recipient) then the game mechanics should be designed to ensure that the experience should be properly returned, regardless of the game/real life problems (e.g. ISP failure) that frequently occur. Furthermore, now that this issue is widely known, I must admit to being somewhat concerned about the possibility of malicious Clerics casting Revive upon people. <br><br>I fail to see how Everquest is enhanced by allowing the situation to remain status quo.<br><br><b>We've reopened this issue and are looking into the requested design change.

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello all,<br><br>There are a few issues that are on the boards in multiple threads, so I thought I'd address them in one post:<br><br><b>-TZ/VZ Moves-</b><br><br>We'll be opening the /movelog command on TZ and VZ this Friday and leaving it open through Monday for move mid next week between those two servers. Specific's will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this thread.<br><br>In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or likely. RZ was created at a different time than the two other servers, and has maintained its ruleset since release. Though we tried out the loot idea on TZ, our desire is to keep Rallos as it is at present. <br><br><b>-Shrink Potion-</b><br><br>We'll be giving the shrink potion (created via alchemy) the ability to shrink the user anywhere in the near future. It will be announced in the patch message when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment.<br><br><b>-Spell Drop Rates-</b><br><br>We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space in your backpack.<br><br><b>-Alchemy Prices-</b><br><br>We'll be adjusting these, making alchemy less expensive. It won't be in tomorrow's patch, but probably in the one after that.<br><br><b>-Poison-</b><br><br>Still looking good for an end-of-june implementation.<br><br><b>-Clipping Plane-</b><br><br>Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of the zone headers and put the "Maximum Clip" out as far as the data export would allow. This has been live for a while and we've been unable to find any other problems.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]<br><br><br><font size="1">For the entire thread click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048632.html">here</a>.</font></td>

We came to a big huge open room, then we see "Soando shivers and shakes" then right in front of me I see Trakanon! The lvl 60 with us conned him...red. Then he agroed. First aoe wave, 10dead...second aoe wave, 10more. Then his guardians came, hitting for 300+. He himself hit for dual 650's I heard from my groupmate. What I want to know, is do you think he is fair and "doable" in his current state? Yeah I agree he should be very hard, but an AoE dot that had to be at least 300dmg a tick and an AoE DD that was 800 or more damage...along with his guards bashing for 300...clerics arent gonna keep up with that.<br><br>Anyway abashi, would you tell me if that sounds right to you? It doesnt seem so...and if it is...I fear veeshan =)<br><br><b>Players have always surprised us with their ability to easily overcome situations that we first thought were undoable, so I don't think it will be too long before some, somewhere, show's Trakanon whats what.
