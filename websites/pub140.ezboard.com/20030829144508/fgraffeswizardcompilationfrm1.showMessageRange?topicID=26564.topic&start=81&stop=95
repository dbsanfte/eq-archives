<br>
I think that Darkpakt hit it right on the mark. Higher Level players are already hooked on EverQuest. They're not going to leave EQ for another game, nor are they going to cancel their accounts, until they have exhausted their own patience with the genre of the game. Content and quality of content are, honestly, very secondary here. It's really the community that keeps them going - their fellow players, their guild, and so on. <br>
<br>
Newbies need content and opportunities to experience rushes of fantasy, imagination and ambition to be locked into the EverQuest cycle of never-ending timesinks. In order for this to happen, they need to gradually shift their focus back to the lower level players. <br>
<br>
To date, SOE/VI's focus on placating the uber-guilds and uber-players with Kunark, Velious, Luclin and Planes of Power, has been aimed at establishing a relatively high and quasi-unattainable (for most people, anyways) cap that newbies will drool over as they hear about it for months and years to come. When I first started playing EQ in June of 1999, Plane of Fear and Plane of Hate were both the wildest rage (not to mention the forbidden Carmine to be harvested there by wizards). That same sort of appeal has to be there, and continue to grow wilder in order to appeal to more sophisticated audiences, and to their mean population (which, previously, had been at the mid-tier levels).<br>
<br>
But, one also needs to take into consideration that pandering to the lower-levels really is not going to last long, if it has not ended already. This is because EverQuest, for most intents and purposes, has stopped growing on the basis of attracting first time players, and its developers are much more focused on keeping its current player base from leaving and going to more sophisticated games. (Shadowbane, despite its graphical limitations and early lagginess, is proving a considerable relative drain on EQ membership - as has Dark Age of Camelot.) As more competition emerges, this will only be better for the players that remain on EverQuest, because the devs will be more willing to accomodate them to keep them interested in paying their monthly subscription fees. <br>
<br>
Don't like the Planes of Power now? Wait a year or two, and they'll be as accessible as Crushbone or Blackburrow (if not through sheer in-game mechanics, then, surely by pick-up raiding or more inclusive guilding practices).<br>
<br>
In either case, the age of pandering to either the top end or the low end has concluded; SOE is wise to pursue a policy of customer retention, and this means approaching the common denominator. It is, regrettably, one of the earliest signs, on MUDs, at least, of a game's slip into back-burner status.<br>

Then because of the PoEarth stuff, and the level of politics, and frustration that the guild faced, I'm now a solo elemental Flagged wizard.  Everyone in my guild quit.  Every one of my RL friends that loved this game quit EQ because PoP/EQ just stopped being fun, and seemed more like work.  I'm not willing to put in the 4-6 hours a day it would take for me to be able to join a guild that can actually help me reach the goals I once had.  RL holds so much more for me.  I still love the thrill of using my big nukes and tearing something apart, possibly the only reason I still play sometimes. <br>
<br>
4 Things need to occur to make EQ fun, and show that it isn't on the back burner.<br>
<br>
1) Complete an expansion before you release it<br>
2) Improve CS, at least one GM online 24/7 per server<br>
3) Make sure the Endgame is rich an vibrant for the guilds doing that, not just time sinks or Blocking events.<br>
4) Make it so that the game has things to do for every level players other than raiding.  single player or single groups should still feel like they can accomplish something.<br>
<br>
The reason that any person plays a Fantasy RPG is so they can feel like THIER character is the hero of the story, not just a face in the crowd that has to struggle to have &quot;Fun&quot;.<br>

Give us some sort of CS that can do something.  As others have mentioned you petition get a guide that apologizes and says they will hand it up to the next level.  After playing most of the day you never get a response form this second level.  You log off and log on the next day and guess what?  You have to start from scratch again because your petition has been whipped.<br>
<br>
2) Finish what you start.  As once again was mentioned each expansion released unfinished.  Sure the starting area's are complete, to a point, but the higher end area's of each expansion never are.  Why else would you have such pains to allow access to them?  And even then the people that have worked for access still get denied access till the next patch and then poof they are allowed in.<br>
<br>
3)STOP increasing the exp. eared in each expansion.  No one hunts in the original EQ zones because the exp. is bad.  It wasn't when the game came out though.  You released Kunark and people started hitting LOIO Over there and DL for exp.  You released Velious and people where then hitting Iceclad for cougars and CC for exp. Luclin comes out and now they are hitting PC and Dawnshroud.  PoP comes out and go take a look at zones like Velks.  What use to be busy as heck now has a few people in it.  Karnos when I was there on Thursday had 8 people in it.  5 where in my group the others where LFG.  A guildy who just came back to the game went to Overthere for a group and no one was there for him to group with.  We told him that everyone has moved to the moon.  If killing a level 46 mob gives you ¼ % exp. in Old world, ½ % exp. in Kunark ¾ % in Velious 1 % in Luclin and 2 % in PoP where would you go??  Why is it not ¼% all the way around then you won't have half the server in the one zone.<br>
<br>
4) Make new epics.  Wizard, bards, rogues, ranger, cleric epics are still worth while.  Paladin, warrior, Shadow knights at the least aren't anymore.  You can go spend 50K plat on a weapon that does better damage and has stats on it then all the effort to get your epic.  Give us new epics that actually ARE epic once again.  Make them hard to get so that you don't have level 51's walking around with their epics.  Make the old epics required for the new ones but give us new ones that we can work on that actually make us proud once again to have them. Rather then at least the joke with paladins being go ahead get your epic use it for a couple weeks and then put it in the bank because you'll be looting a better weapon anyway.<br>
<br>
5) Fix the content you already gave us.  There are tons of quests out there that are broken because a item doesn't drop or just simply not complete.  Finish them.   <p><p><center><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><TR><TD><IMG

<br>
Stop whining about shit when you obviously have no clue what you're talking about.<br>
<br>
Kunark was good for EVERYONE of ALL levels. So was Luclin. Velious was &quot;High Level Content&quot; only when 30+ was considered &quot;High Level&quot;<br>
<br>
What you are forgetting is that the Average player is level 45-55.  Which PoP is aimed at almost specifically to reduce the load at that level.<br>
<br>
You're saying the end-game doesn't matter, BUT IT DOES.  Why do you level up?  Why do you go after better and better gear?  Why do you play EQ instead of SB, DAoC, E&amp;B, or another game? Those are more fun at the 'lowbie' levels than EQ is.<br>
<br>
The End game is why people keep playing.  If you ever feel like you have beaten the game, you stop.  Some people have different ideas on what &quot;beaten&quot; is, but a large number of people tend to believe that if you have nothing new to do, you are done.<br>
<br>
One of the big problems with PoP is that when you can't invision yourself going forewards, you don't care anymore. As soon as you don't care, it doesn't matter if you're level 15 or level 60 with 500 AA, you are going to leave.<br>
<br>
People are briniging up things like &quot;we need a big ice nuke&quot;.   Well, thats fine that we need that, but it can wait for another expansion, its not game breaking if we don't have it NOW. The vast majaority of the hardcore gamers not having fun at all IS a game breaking problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oxoxoxoxox>Oxoxo Xoxox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1057<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> I have an idea for you Absor.  Have the team create some historic item quests with Lore.  Let me explain what I mean.<br>
<br>
We all have seen thread after thread about how people miss the old schoold days of items like Yaks, BBCs, and SMRs, coupled with the fact that these items are worthless due to mudflation.<br>
<br>
What I propose is that you create a quest for these items with some fun lore that updates them into usefull versions of themselves.  Kinda like Epic quests except perhaps not so long or difficult but still <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>worthwhile</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to complete.<br>
<br>
The result would be say an item called Short sword of the Ykesha with really nice stats (like 17/21 or something), perhaps an effect and when identified reflect some of this lore that was gained in a hard earned quest. a person if they so choose to could gain all these items just for kick and be an &quot;original&quot; EQ equipped character of sorts updated for modern play if you will.  Imagine the fun of being able to turn a Runed Cowl into something grand like the Circlet of the Falikan, but it is still the Runed Cowl, that has been given its &quot;original&quot; power back or something.. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68788" target="top">Oxoxo Xoxox ~ Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
 I know it is your company but instead of taking money from people who spend it on playing EQ ,to put towards Planetside, SWG, EQ2 or whatever crazy things is being done with it. Games some of us never intend or want to play, and put it towards making EQ better. <br>
<br>
 I do think necessary EQ is on the back burner so to speak, the right money isnt being given to the game like it should and it is spread around various other projects, spreading your resources and income to thin. Even though, EQ is the game producing the revenue it is getting neglected in order to pay for countless other projects, most of them not EQ.<br>
<br>
 The extra money will pay to hire more GMs which EQ really needs, more devs, designers and people that can finish the product instead of half-assed attempt. I know it is logical to put some of the earnings toward new projects but not at a point the game that makes the money is neglected.<br>
<br>
 Some may disagree but in my opinion EQ is being neglected, in the past it was spoiled. Was it the best back then? No, but not near as bad as now and some are noticing and leaving, thus cutting your pool of profits down overall. I dont claim to be a professional and I maybe just talking out my ass but right now it seems EQ does not recieve the attention it should. For whatever reason things have changed, more money allocated to it, I think would help. Just my 2cp though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=c0ren>C0REN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/03 11:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> 1) Buy a pocket calculater. Yes, I'm not kidding. If ALL your developers missed elementary school and have trouble dividing &quot;max. Raid = 78&quot; by &quot;trials ín PoTa = 5&quot; and get &quot;people per trial = 18&quot; as result, they REALLY need this pocket calculater. Or elementary school. (Or do you really just hired 100 monkeys?)<br>
<br>
2) Give us the feeling that you care. This thread had various ideas. But the base problem is all the same: You seem to give a flying fuck about what the playerbase thinks. This thread is no different btw., Absor did NOT post &quot;What do you think is the problem?&quot; but more &quot;We will try to find out by patching/nerfing in the next months what could be the problem and maybe we stumble over it and then we will bother to ask you if you agree with us.&quot; I cancelled this friday - on the day Furor's ultimatum run out. I did not cancel because I wanted some drastic changes. I cancelled because the only reaction this person got (and we're talking of a very public person which seems to hit the nerve of quite a share of the playerbase) was a &quot;/rude&quot;: You congratulated Afterlife (rumors say your favourite hatchling) on eqlive for finally beating the Rathe cockblock, when you finally unblocked it. I did not expect something like a &quot;We will obey, Mr. Furor.&quot; But I DID expect some &quot;We are aware that the Rathe encounter was majorly fucked up and we are sorry. We will from now engage in a dialog between the major guild's leaders to avoid annoying things like this happening again in the future. We will post if there is some major disagreement and what and why our position is.&quot;<br>
<br>
3) Fire all GMs. And hire some with some ethical and moral standards. When I read that GMs spawned mobs in PoTa to avoid that people, who work around <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>obviously broken</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> content, reach their goal and instead wipe, I'm speechless. Oh, and fire all developers that are touchy when their content gets beaten by less than the number that was planned for event XYZ.<br>
<br>
4) Give old models a horse. I don't want your Luclin models, they are ugly. I just want a mount. I don't want to say goodbye to the model I grew up with and trade it for a model which in my opinion not even remotely resembles any similarities.<br>
<br>
5) You gave the wizard class a major part of nerf bat hits in the last year. But even in general your usage of the nerf bat did show an IQ of sliced bread - dry. Stop going overboard. And don't wait with nerfs until all your GMs' favorite players are done with that part.<br>
<br>
6) Your definition of exploit is broken in that it doesn't allow to determine clearly if something is an exploit. Fix the definition. Also, please put up a list of all known exploits. Give the playerbase some days to get aware of it. THEN you may suspend accordingly. Currently this stupid guessworking and if-the-GM-is-in-the-mood-it's-ok sucks nuts. This board has seen more than one discussion if something is an exploit. Best example is the Workaround-without-raid-GFlux for the Concussion quest.<br>
<br>
7) Stop to break promises over and over and over. Don't promise if you are not sure and if you ARE sure, realize that promise in a short timeframe. I don't give a flying fuck if feature X is planned if it isn't in in less than let's say three month. Much less than two years.<br>
