They swarm easily and most won't run, and there are few casters, so you will get a gang easy.  Resistances aren't too bad now that they lowered them, and there's good kill zones on each floor.<br>
<br>
Each floor has a limited group of creatures on it, 3 different types plus the special spawns.  You require a key to move up to the next floor, which drops on each floor from a special spawn.  The special spawns are random and rare from any kill of a given type (for instance, the first floor one spawns from a moon beast - small white drolvarg types).  All the key spawns are tougher than the regular ones, so be ready, no pulling til everyone is out of mana because you might get a nasty suprise.  Much of the tower is undead, so you can move through much of it without too much trouble if you are invis to undead.  However, there are mixes of undead and non on some levels, so be aware.<br>
<br>
The tower is laid out so you can move from level to level fairly quickly and with not a lot of fuss if you know where you are going.  There are few maps out there for the tower, unfortunately, so you'll need to make your own or learn it for yourself.  Once you have the keys, you can move to the level you want and hunt there.  Consider the tower to be 7 mini dungeons, pick one and have fun.<br>
<br>
Each Key Spawn is an &quot;enraged&quot; something, enraged relative, enraged chef, etc.  They hit hard and are tough, resistant critters.  The keys are no-drop, so you need to have one person collect them until they have all the keys, so they can get you from start to finish.  Once that person has the key for a level then someone else can loot it.  If the key person uses they key on a mirror, all the party nearby goes with them to the next level.<br>
<br>
Treasure varies a lot, you will get some gnomeskin, fading shadow weapons, crystallized shadow, and other minor things on any floor, randomly.  The Fading Shadow stuff is fine steel that is magic and has minor stats.  Most of the monsters drop decent money, especially as you go up higher levels, but they do drop copper <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Gnomeskin armor is pretty much leather with some stats, only the gloves are very interesting but it has a distinctive, jet black appearance when worn (you can't wear it as a Wizard).<br>
<br>
First floor is simple, the mirrors are across the way.  The one on the right goes to the next floor, the one on the left goes to level 7 directly, but you need Tserrina's key for that.  The mirror behind you when you zone into the tower goes back outside to the left of the front door.  The floor around the pit is icy and slippery, careful on it or use lev.<br>
<br>
Second floor is a library haunted with ghosts.  The entire level is an entry hall, the mirror hall opposite the entry, and a huge open library room between them.  The library swarms with ghosts, including librarians, students, and scholars.  They are all casters, I think they are all necros, but none summon pets.  A couple nice range slot items for casters drop here, as does some monk armor that is no drop.  Due to the large open area, easy pulls, lots of spawns, and the amazingly rare enraged librarian, I strongly suggest using AE here.  Get every ghosty you can see and gather them for the beat down, you'll see that enraged librarian soon enough.<br>
<br>
Third Floor is more drolvarg guys, this time cooks oddly enough.  The Chef is probably enraged that they keep putting Alpo in the food.  There are also animated suits of armor (smaller than the ones in Wakening Lands) and skeletons and zombies.  This is pretty good hunting into the mid 40s or so, and straight forward.  The level is set up like a square, with lots of rooms and corridors, but isn't especially interesting in design.  The mirror here is behind a secret door that looks like a tapestry, you can walk through it to a corridor.  Nothing special drops here except off the Enraged Chef.<br>
<br>
Fourth Floor is a good one, mummies and goos and shadows.  The shadows cast damage shields on EVERYTHING so have a debuff up to give the melee guys a break from the pain.  The mummies drop mummy wraps and a lot of crystallized shadow drops up here, not sure what its for.  There are a couple special spawns, such as a named mummy that has some special drops and the key spawn.  She's a little different than the other key spawns, in that she shows up in a coffin in a special room only.  She spawns lying down and sits up like dracula, it's pretty cool to watch.  She drops a very nice caster item, a strange but very nice melee range slot book, and always the key, but most of the time she seems to have a dagger that procs summon bandages (but monks can't use).    Her spawn seems to be linked to killing the named mummy, by the way.  There is an underground area here with multiple pits that dump you into it, the way out is a gem in the center of the main room, click on it.  Many creatures wander past the zone in spot, its not as safe as the others, but its not uncontrollable either.  This will give you xps into the low 50s and is a pretty good level.  The shadows are hard to loot, as they are invisible.<br>
<br>
Level Five is a wedding party.  The power level of this is lower than the previous levels, oddly enough.  In fact many of the spawns are very green to almost anyone who can get into the tower.  However, it is a very nice level for other reasons.  First, the ushers here are all velium golems, and drop lots of velium.  Almost every kill gives you some velium for trades.  In addition, the bride and groom have magic rings that are very nice, plus she drops a veil that is pretty nice as well.  This is often camped by a lone caster, popping the bride and groom over and over.  From the looks of the bride, I think the groom probably appreciates it.  The enraged wedding guest has the key here, he looks like a spectre from the first floor and is very tough.  He used to be totally immune to magic, but they reduced that significantly.  Incidentally, in the room you come into, there's a mirror on the left facing it that takes you outside.  Be very careful clicking anywhere nearby it, even if you are facing away, it WILL take you outside.<br>
<br>
Level Six is more complex.  The main area is full of spectres and more white drolvargs.  These will give xps into level 54 or so, but it gets sparse.  A ghost of a dwarf spawns here that is for a quest, he also drops a very nice axe.  The level has MANY spawns, and some of the spectres are necros.  There are a lot of the moon beast guys on the way to the stairs and mirror, but they are good experience for many levels, so worth killing.  The mirror here doesn't require a key, it simply sends anyone who clicks on it to the bat cave.<br>
<br>
No, batman isn't there, but bats are, and a djinni.  Each bat you kill turns into a vampire that is even tougher than the bat.  Bats drain stamina, totally wipe it out, so the melee guys will need some zinging to keep them going well.  I like to time Tears to go off with the final wave hitting the vampire.  The Djinni is very tough, and charms.  He has vampire powers, so that means necro spells and some special abilities, plus the charm.  Have nullify up or you'll be sorry if the tank gets charmed.  Note: they go after healers and enchanters first, so you'll have clear casting.  Have an evac up here, it gets tough sometimes here.  The djinni drops the key and an earring usually.<br>
<br>
The key to the next floor is used on a crystal in a big claw, not the mirror you'll see on this level.  I am not honestly sure where the mirror goes, probably outside but I couldn't say.<br>
<br>
Seventh Floor.  This floor has a variety of creatures.  The entry has more golems, then there are some familiars that look like drakes.  To reach them you have to pass a tapestry that is trapped and claws at you!  Then there are some torches here, sort of like shadows but each one is a torch.  They drop no rent torches that give +75 hit points and some mana, but you can't equip them.  They are not lore, so in theory a melee could have 3 of them, which is a lot of hit points.  Further they proc steal strength, always useful even if they are terrible weapons.<br>
<br>
A spiral stair reaches up to the mirror room, using the key from the djinn to open the door.  All the mirrors but one go outside, and nobody is sure what the last one goes to.  Some speculations include an 8th floor or a plane that isn't open yet.<br>
<br>
There is a tapestry in the stair room that leads to a hidden area full of bats.  Each bat acts the same, spawns a vampire... or Tserrina syl'tor, the boss of the dungeon.  She drops various very nice caster gear and a key that lets you go to the top floor from level 1.  Tserrina is very, very tough.  <br>
<br>

Just a few notes about Tserrina.  She spawns off a special bat that is green to a level 53, the rest are blue.  This gives you a good warning to the spawn of her.  She is very fixating, if she aggros on someone she'll stay aggroed on them and reduce them to paste rapidly.  Tserrina doesn't cast much but she's pretty much impossible.  She's nearly total in magic resistance (no snares no stuns etc) and can charm.  She also hits very hard and has a ton of hit points.<br>
Tserrina is a very unique looking model, and drops very nice stuff for casters, and not so nice stuff for melee.<br>

My guild is crazy about this tower -- the one thing that can rip our members from almost any camp is &quot;hey, anyone up for ToFS?&quot; -- so here's my responses to some of your thoughts. I'm level 43, and have been doing this tower since around level 31, off and on, so I've got a slightly different perspective on some of the non-factual stuff.<br>
<br>
&quot;Note: this place begs for AE work, there's no overlapping and the monsters are all within a tight level range each level. They swarm easily and most won't run, and there are few casters, so you will get a gang easy. Resistances aren't too bad now that they lowered them, and there's good kill zones on each floor.&quot;<br>
<br>
AoE rocks on the second floor -- the library -- and I can see trying it on the sixth, but otherwise, you're going to get a mix of critters fighting you, so bring a tank. Pure AoE outside the more homogeneous floors could be trouble. (And every floor is potentially trouble. The number of times we've ported out of the tower or voluntarily taken a mirror out instead of evaccing is a pretty small percentage ...)<br>
<br>
&quot;Each floor has a limited group of creatures on it, 3 different types plus the special spawns.&quot;<br>
<br>
Huh. I guess it is three types. In some cases there's variants -- different types of flesh on the fourth floor -- but it's certainly three models. I never noticed that!<br>
<br>
&quot;Much of the tower is undead, so you can move through much of it without too much trouble if you are invis to undead. However, there are mixes of undead and non on some levels, so be aware.&quot;<br>
<br>
Third floor is a mix, as is fourth. I THINK the other floors are 100 percent undead otherwise. (I've never been aggroed using ITU to zip through the first floor, for instance.)<br>
<br>
&quot;There are few maps out there for the tower, unfortunately, so you'll need to make your own or learn it for yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Muse is currently working on ToFS for his next map at EQAtlas.com. Most of the floors don't NEED maps, other than the fourth floor, but they'll be handy. There are traps (fourth and sixth floors especially) and secret passages (third and fourth floors especially) that are worth knowing about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once you have the keys, you can move to the level you want and hunt there.&quot;<br>
<br>
And your bank vault will curse you for hunting here!<br>
<br>
&quot;Treasure varies a lot, you will get some gnomeskin, fading shadow weapons, crystallized shadow, and other minor things on any floor, randomly. The Fading Shadow stuff is fine steel that is magic and has minor stats. Most of the monsters drop decent money, especially as you go up higher levels, but they do drop copper  Gnomeskin armor is pretty much leather with some stats, only the gloves are very interesting but it has a distinctive, jet black appearance when worn (you can't wear it as a Wizard).&quot;<br>
<br>
Most of the common drops are pretty good for low 30s and below, but you've probably got better than that above that point. And casters have to wait on uncommon-to-rare drops, unfortunately. (The good news is that most of it is pretty good.)<br>
<br>
&quot;First floor is simple, the mirrors are across the way. The one on the right goes to the next floor, the one on the left goes to level 7 directly, but you need Tserrina's key for that. The mirror behind you when you zone into the tower goes back outside to the left of the front door. The floor around the pit is icy and slippery, careful on it or use lev.&quot;<br>
<br>
The pit will drop your ass in with a bunch of skellies. Make sure everyone in your group are levved when they &quot;just want to take a look.&quot;<br>
<br>
The mirrors throughout the tower, incidentally, drop you not terribly close to the mirror to zone in, and you'll almost certainly be dropped -- uninvized -- amongst a bunch of dervishes and upgraded dervishes. Accidentally zoning out kills a whole lot of people. If it happens to you, fire up your Jboots and run AWAY from the tower, where the dervishes are thickest. Head for the gnoll village if you're not KOS there, as that makes a good point to gather your wits for returning to the tower. (And you'll eventually zone out by accident. The zone-out mirrors, especially the one on the first and fifth floors, have a VERY large area they can be used from, even accidentally.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Second floor is a library haunted with ghosts. The entire level is an entry hall, the mirror hall opposite the entry, and a huge open library room between them. The library swarms with ghosts, including librarians, students, and scholars. They are all casters, I think they are all necros, but none summon pets. A couple nice range slot items for casters drop here, as does some monk armor that is no drop. Due to the large open area, easy pulls, lots of spawns, and the amazingly rare enraged librarian, I strongly suggest using AE here. Get every ghosty you can see and gather them for the beat down, you'll see that enraged librarian soon enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think there's also some wizards on this level, but I can't be sure. In any case, this is a beautiful level, easy to pull, and very atmospheric. Think of the opening of &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot; There's also a ghost story running through the whole tower, and if you sit and listen, you'll hear some of it played out here.<br>
<br>
The student's homework is the range slot item for casters. The teacher's syllabus is the range slot item for healers. Both are rares and drop off the angry librarian (key holder). Identify them each for a laugh. Both are pretty decent, although if you're in your mid-30s or above, you might already have something comparable or better (I sold my homework when I got the Seal of Thoridain for instance).<br>
<br>
&quot;Third Floor is more drolvarg guys, this time cooks oddly enough. The Chef is probably enraged that they keep putting Alpo in the food. There are also animated suits of armor (smaller than the ones in Wakening Lands) and skeletons and zombies. This is pretty good hunting into the mid 40s or so, and straight forward. The level is set up like a square, with lots of rooms and corridors, but isn't especially interesting in design. The mirror here is behind a secret door that looks like a tapestry, you can walk through it to a corridor. Nothing special drops here except off the Enraged Chef.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boring floor, frankly. There's a decent ring for tanks that drops off of ... cooks? Maids? In any case, stop, grab that, get the key and move on. Once you learn where the secret doors are on this level, you can move through this floor in less than a minute.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fourth Floor is a good one, mummies and goos and shadows. The shadows cast damage shields on EVERYTHING so have a debuff up to give the melee guys a break from the pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shdows, in case they're new to you (they were new to me) are liked shadowed men but are usually pure casters. Which means they're TOTALLY invisible. You'll take a few lumps from them when they add and you haven't realized it.<br>
<br>
When you first zone in, stay in that initial alcove -- stuff here has a WIDE assist radius and you'll be pulling without realizing it for the first few minutes. After that, stay close and go with an experienced guide if you can -- there are pit traps and secret doors everywhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are a couple special spawns, such as a named mummy that has some special drops and the key spawn. She's a little different than the other key spawns, in that she shows up in a coffin in a special room only. She spawns lying down and sits up like dracula, it's pretty cool to watch. She drops a very nice caster item, a strange but very nice melee range slot book, and always the key, but most of the time she seems to have a dagger that procs summon bandages (but monks can't use). Her spawn seems to be linked to killing the named mummy, by the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you're merging the three named NPCs here, Grim. Cara Omica, the creepy undead witch, drops the sorcerous bowl, the embalmer's skinning knife (every soloing wiz should have one) and the dirk of distraction (procs True North, although it's called &quot;distraction&quot; in the effect line).<br>
<br>
There's also a named armored shadow that drops the tank range slot book and a named mummy that drops the key.<br>
<br>
&quot;Level Five is a wedding party.&quot;<br>
<br>
My favorite! This place is a hoot.<br>
<br>
&quot;The power level of this is lower than the previous levels, oddly enough. In fact many of the spawns are very green to almost anyone who can get into the tower.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once you get to the wedding party, anyway. First you have to run the gauntlet of the golem ushers. It's key to have a good puller here. Also note that the golems have weird pathing and will &quot;gate&quot; (not actually casting it, just warping around) when they start to flee.<br>
<br>
&quot;In addition, the bride and groom have magic rings that are very nice, plus she drops a veil that is pretty nice as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
The rings are pretty insane, frankly. They go for 8K when someone's willing to sell them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Incidentally, in the room you come into, there's a mirror on the left facing it that takes you outside. Be very careful clicking anywhere nearby it, even if you are facing away, it WILL take you outside.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the most dangerous mirror in the tower, IMO. You can be halfway across the room and get sucked out by it by simply sitting down and standing up. When you first zone in, go LEFT (based on the direction you'll be facing -- i.e. down the hall to the wedding party). (Grim's notes have you turning around after you first zone in.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Level Six is more complex. The main area is full of spectres and more white drolvargs. These will give xps into level 54 or so, but it gets sparse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep. For pure XP grindage, you have to move through the corridors, pulling the guards carefully.<br>
<br>
Also worth noting:<br>
<br>
The dragon statue in the ice shades' library -- STAY AWAY! It procs a 500 point AoE with a HUGE radius and will fire repeatedly. It's total party wipeout time if two or three people wander up to it after the room has been cleared. (And your keys aren't soulbound ...)<br>
<br>
Second, there's a ledge above that room that hunting the corridors will eventually lead you to. Looking over the ledge will aggro the ice shades, who will run through the corridors pulling EVERY SPAWN ON THE FLOOR to you. Again, total party wipeout. The biggest train I ever saw -- dozens upon dozens of guards and shades, and they were stacked like we were AoE kiting, so there was no way to count them -- was on this floor when our cleric &quot;just wanted to see what was down there.&quot; Owie.<br>
<br>
This is an AMAZING dungeon, the best one I've encountered in the game yet. Plan on going slowly through it the first time you visit, just to learn the ropes, but you're almost certain to have a really good time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukadathdreamfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kadath Dreamfire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/01 12:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hawkmail.monmouth.edu/~posten/Kadath6sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tips on the Tower of Frozen Shadow</span><hr size=1> Tseriina isnt that hard.  When you have enticement of flame you can use that on her, and I've had good luck with Lure of frost as well.  A solid 45-50 group can take her down.<br>
<br>
Make sure you leave 1 set of keys in the bank!<br>
<br>
Also, here's the trick to knowing what bat will spawn Tseriina:  Pets wont attack that bat, at all!  So have a pet attack, and if they just sit there, Tseriina will pop.<br>
<br>
Bats are on a one hour timer, which stinks, since you can kill em in 15 minutes or less and are then stuck playing Gems or sweeping greens for 45 minutes.  However, Tseriina drops one of the nicest looking robes very very rarely.  Its worth the insane camp.  <br>

Tserrina's robe is very nice looking, even on a pasty high elf like me, and has good stats (its red in your inventory and blue on your bod though, oddly).  Lure of Frost landed on her every single time, I waited til she was half dead and uncorked til my mana was gone.  We were going to kill her or die trying, and she folded up first... but not before wandering out and getting some buddies we had to kill too.  Bad placement for her, would have liked to fight her somewhere else.<br>

My guild has 4 or 5 full sets of keys (including tessy's bypass key), and we'll take just about any excuse to get a raid going here.  That, and she has thus far refused to open up her wardrobe for me. :)  We did get a staff last night though, first time we've seen a rare off her.

Tons of fun and the layout as a dungeon crawl is very cool. Our guild has raided here 3 or 4 times now with a lot of success. My knowledge of levels 1-6 is limited because I missed our first raid here in which two sets of 1-6 keys were made. I have spent most of the time on the 7th floor. <br>
<br>
In the last 2 times we went there, we killed Tserinna 8 -10 times total I believe in around 15-18 hours total of camping her. It seems one of her most common drops is a mage only item(range maybe) and we didn't have a mage with us either time so they all rotted. She dropped the robe only once and that was during our first trip (Very nice robe). She dropped the staff 3 times our last trip and she dropped a nice melee whip our first time. Other than the mage item that she drops a lot, she also drops a very nice neck symbol.<br>
<br>
There are 4 bats that are on (I believe) a spawn timer of 45 minutes and the greenies sometimes turn into Tserrina, while the rest turn into lower vampies. Tserrina isn't too tough, but she is magic resistant. Enticement of Flame and Lures work nicely on her. I was 52 and dinged 53 while I was there last. I just waited til she was about half and unloaded Lure of Frost. Tserinna has a chance to pop after any of the green bats are killed. She popped twice in a row for us last time so always be on alert.<br>
<br>
While waiting for the bats to spawn, there are plenty of blues to kill. The highest we had with us was 55 and they were getting some exp. At 52 I was getting a lot of exp from the rest of the mobs on the 7th floor.<br>
<br>
Each time we had 2 groups of 40+, mostly 45+ with quite a few 50s. At the wee hours of the nite while people log to go to bed, we were still holding the floor with 4-5 50+ people. At the end we had a 55 war, 54 necro, 53 ench, 52-53 wiz(me), and a 53 cler. We had no problem with these 4-5 peeps holding the whole floor. I'm sure the 4 bats and their pops including Tserrina can be held with less than what we had. <br>
<br>
Tons of fun and I highly suggest everyone trying this place. Good loot and exp to boot.<br>
<br>
I do have one question about the 7th floor now that I have a Tserrina key. In the 7th floor mirror room, there is a locked door to get out into the reest of the 7th floor. When the Tserinna key is used and you pop into the mirror room, is it true that you need the 7th floor key to open the door to get out of the mirror room to proceed into the rest of the 7th floor? The only key I have is Tserrina's, which she drops every time. Do I need the 7th floor key as well? I couldnt test this out because I got the Tserinna key on our last raid and I haven't had a chance to try it myself yet. <p>Lokeii Qinobi<br>54 Channeler of The Seventh Hammer<br>Officer and Webmaster, <a href="http://www.mysticcircleofpower.com">Mystic Circle of Power</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uardius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ardius</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/1/01 6:20 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tips on the Tower of Frozen Shadow</span><hr size=1> Yes Lokeii, the doorway at the end of the &quot;mirror hall&quot; upstairs from Tserrina's lair is locked with the 7th floor key (the key from Vhal'Sera, the freeti on the 6th floor (6b, actually).
