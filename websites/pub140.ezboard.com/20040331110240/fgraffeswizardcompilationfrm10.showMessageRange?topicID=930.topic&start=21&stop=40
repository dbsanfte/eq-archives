<br>
This opinion does not come so much from the level 60+ perspective, but from the early levels.<br>
<br>
Untill level 29, Druids and Shaman recieved the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> same healing spells in the same order as clerics did.  The clerical advantage came 3 ways: 10% bonus to healing spells for clerics, 10% penalty for everyone else(vi always fixes things twice), and the spells come one spell circle later.  With release, the Druids and SHaman got regen spells to make up their lack somewhat, and Shaman had the poorly understood and underused till the endgame slow spells.  Clerics got a HoT with Luclin to mirror their HoT line in the post 50's at like level 19.<br>
<br>
Then, for reasons known only to VI, at level 39 Shaman and Druids did not recieve the superior healing spell, yet clerics got a second healing spell---the all mighty Complete Heal.  Unlike many other &quot;game breaking&quot; abilities in game such as slow or mez, the implications of Complete Heal were immediatly obvious, and only the lack of insane HP mobs prevented CH chains from forming on the spot upon release.<br>
<br>
The reasoning for this was simple in it's own way:  Clerics were the supreme healers of the game, so got sole access to the best healing spell in the game- Superior Heal.  CH was not seen as a healing spell, but as a spell to remove downtime, thus the high mana cost and long cast time... it simply was not supposed to be a battle heal.  Would have been nice if VI would have owned up to the way CH was being used then, at the beginning and done something about it (can we say 1 min non stack timer and radical reduction in size, possibly draining all mana?).  The only real problem with this reasoning is that the game manual clearly described both shaman and clerics as primarily healers, with cleric secondary focus going to nukes, and shaman secondary ability going to augmentation and debuff.  The balance on druids is that they got both the healing, and good nukes, and servicable buffs if a cleric wasn't around.<br>
<br>
What should have happened, IMHO, is when Kunark got underway, and dungeon crawling became a serious bad time without a Cleric/Chanter/Tank combo, is to revisit and complete the healing line.  When the top level was 50, they probably thought Sup heal and Greater heal was enough.  However, it quickly became evident to anyone and everyone it was not.  Level 39 should have seen Sup heal for shamans and Druids, 44 should have seen Even_Bigger_Heal for clerics, with shaman and druids getting that at 49, and then at 54 clerics could have gotten a special cleric only heal---assuming the new Heal Over Time line wasn't considered special enough.  Remember that according to VI back then, level 50-60 was for special wing-dings on the classes, not core functions.  50-60 was supposed to see the power upgrade of a single level, not 10 levels.  This worked for the casters, but melee don't scale well that way apparently.<br>
<br>
So, for both Shaman and Druids, even today, I would see it as fair, if not needed, to move Sup Heal to level 39, and to continue the basic healing line through at least level 49, on the same curve it always  was on, so Even_Bigger Heal is probably right at 1k or a little better on healing, And Clerics could possibly get a 1.5k quick heal in the late 50's, possibly at 60.  This would simply be a continuation of the balance that exists pre 50 with the healing classes, and give people more options of healer post 50.  I've been in groups with a shaman and druid, and them saying we should get a 'healer'--and that's just wrong.<br>

<br>
Shamans are the ONLY priest class with slows.  In exchange for it, we (yes, we as in my main is a shaman) pay for it by having weaker heals than druids, crappier nukes than druids, and fewer types of DoT's then the necros we share our 2 DoT lines with.  Now, admittedly, at level 60 we get Torpor and at 65 we get Quiessence, two of the best Heal over Time spells in the game, however Torpor is so insanely rare that it isn't even funny, usually selling for 80-100k and only dropping rarely from Kunark Dragons and even more rarely from a few other mobs in Kunark.  Many shamans never get Torpor.<br>
<br>
As such Shamans are, without question, the best slowers in the game.  Our best slow is level 51 or 52, and has the best % of any slow in the game.  Additionally, we have better armor, better damage mitigation, and better hp than enchanters.  As healers though, our 75% CHeal is capped lower than Druids, and with the 100% snare and the 30%(ish) slow attached to Torpor, it's not effective for healing tanks during combat.<br>
<br>
Most shamans have generally accepted the fact that we are specialists in buffing/debuffing/slowing.  But Druids can't seem to accept that they AREN'T specialists.  Druids fit the bill of &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none&quot;.  If they want to be a specialist at something, they'd have to give up a LOT of abilities.  Wizards, for example, specialize in doing damage, as such we get no heals, virtually no buffs and what few buffs we have are of limited usefulness either being self only or single target.  Wizards have NO abilities pertinent to xp grouping/raiding aside from evaccing/porting and doing lots of DPS.<br>
<br>
Clerics heal and mitigate death.  And for the most part, that is all they do.  They have some buffs, but mostly hp/ac buffs (which make sense for a healer), they have some nukes, but their nukes have relatively poor mana/damage ratios.  Clerics cannot effectively or efficiently fill in for any other class.  They are a TRUE specialist.  IF you want Druids to be as good at healing or be able to mitigate death the way that Clerics do, and be fair to clerics in the process,then they'd have to give up EVERYTHING else they do..effectively BECOMING clerics.  Somehow, I don't see the druids who are asking for these changes wanting that, they just want to be given it all without giving up anything in the process.  <br>
<br>
Do they need better heals.. Maybe, but personally I don't think so, I've never had any difficulty in PoP groups with Druid main healers.  Do they *need* death mitigation to make them more groupable.. No, they may want it, but they don't NEED it. Do they need to heal or mitigate death as well as clerics..hell no.<br>

<br>
I am not making this up, my 2nd account main character is now a 64 druid and I have been main healer for countless times. Having Nature's Infution, 5sec 1750 heal and Karana's Renewal 4860 heal 10sec its more than enough to keep up as the main healer in pretty much any exp group. Heck I was before in Inner camp and my druid being the main healer the group managed to kill 'the sleep walker'(sp?) without any deaths, and mind you he hits near 1k damage. And I was duo boxing my druid (main healer) and my wizard (possibly was the main damage dealer in group) in a group of Shaman, warrior, rogue, monk, wizard (me), druid (me).<br>

Personally i would take off the % mod on the Druid and shammy Cheal. The only issue i think it will have is Canni, and im not sure that will be that problematical. Of course, you then have to make clerics a 3 dimentional class rather then the boring waste of space you have to blackmail people into still playing, but what else can you do? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95533"><b>Jadrax Darkfire</b></a><br>

<br>
No, a druid should never be able to heal like a cleric. But even if we upped the heals say 30% of their current power, it would hardly over power them.<br>
<br>
Their complaint is very similar to ours, they want to be more group friendly, and currently, don't feel they are.<br>

<br>
<br>
The problem as I see it is how the Wizard is designed to be the Firecracker of the group. <br>
<br>
Things I could think of off the top of my head to make them more group friendly.<br>
<br>
1.) that sword pets DPS increased and its agro to be decreased. This would give them a way to start damaging very early in the fight and increase their over all DPS.<br>
<br>
2.) Make spell shield have a rune component also. Say 750pts or so. This would let wizards help with rune rotations. Or they could give it a DS component say 20 pts but stacks with all other DS's.<br>
<br>
3.) Grant Wizards(master of magic) a buff line of spells, similar to the shaman potion &quot;focus's&quot;. Thus a Wizard could increase the DPS, mana efficency, buff duration of a raid, etc.(this stacks with all other focusses)<br>
<br>
4.) Grant Wizards a self only resistance buffs(100 to all saves) that have a short duration say 5 minutes, and a warrior shield like ablitity, to protect a single target from <br>
magic.<br>
<br>
5.) Give wizards a gather mana type AA ablitity, except make it for 25% mana for the whole group.(say 30 minutes reset)<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay sorry guys, i'm a druid, I have no clue what yall want so thats the best i could come up with off the cuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
So, I'm willing to give up most group ports, the pet, charm, 61+ nukes, all debuffs, the str line. For slow a 50% slow, and shaman can get better heals, slow removed from torpor, better nukes, and rez. That sound fair?<br>
<br>
The other alternative is to make exp groups post 60 not require slow to give a decent amount of exp. <br>
This is my boat, I can solo for exp, but i really enjoy grouping and dispise soloing. When groups form they want a cleric, a slower(shaman, bard, bl, ench), a tank (war, sk, pal) that leaves 3 spots for damage dealers. While druids might be the 3 best nukers in a game. When comparing consistant dps (say over a period of 1 hour) mana dependant classe with out pets(ie. wizards and druids) come up short compared to non mana dependant classes (necro, mage, rogue, monk, ranger). Thus the likelyhood of getting one of the 3 open spots is much slimmer for a druid or a wizard. <br>
<br>
Heck give wizards slow and let me be the alt healer in a group.<br>

I don't want to become a buffer, i want to nuke and to do dmage, that's what the Wizard class is all about. Neither i want to be a part of a whatever gimped 'rune rotation'. I prefer to be in the 'nuke-rotation'.<br>

I suspect that's because this thread is mostly Wizards and Shamans discussing Druids. I assume the original poster is a Wizard, I can't imagine a Druid coming over here asking Wizards for abilites.<br>
<br>
To provide a counterpoint, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>don't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want rezzes. As another poster said, a heal to bridge the gap between Chloro and Ch woul be nice, but I can work around it.<br>
<br>
Druids are hard to balance. Solo outdoors we are essentially invulnerable, and can rot, quad, or charm. In groups, a 49 Shaman is preferable to a 59 Druid. Both situations are out of whack, but what can you do?<br>
<br>
My *only* concern for the class is if SOE decides soloing is evil, and outdoor content is bad. Then one side of our equation is negated without fixing the other. LDoN is going to be a rough expansion for Druids (and Wizards, I suspect).<br>
<br>
Anyway, not to derail the dialogue, but try to remember that one Wizard posting does not represent the class, nor does one Druid for that matter.<br>

In my experience, an evaccer is highly desirable - almost necessary - in a classic dungeon crawl.  Most of the people I hunted with in the early 50's wouldn't go into HS or the Hole without one.  If Verant remains true to that spirit, druids and wizards will both be highly sought after.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure whether that will be possible due to the instanced nature of these dungeons.  I would think they'd have to implement some sort of graveyard system - which makes the threat of a wipeout far less ominous.<br>
<br>
The other ability that used to be necessary in older-world dungeon crawls is snare.  If one runner got away in, say, Chardok, the group was in a lot of trouble.  (For some reason, in the newer expansions the mobs don't run much.)  If there are a lot of runners, then obviously snaring classes will be that much more desireable. <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

<br>
How about:<br>
Wizards get a 50% slow, 2 minute duration, 8 second casting time 10 second recast.  To be evil, add a 5/65 stun to the slow.  1 desease counter (ie, very easy to cure).<br>
<br>
Wizards vision line gains added 5% DD focus.  LoY one is L 65 cap.<br>
Wizards vision line made into a group buff, and doubled in duration.<br>
(your keen vision makes you able to hit with nukes a touch harder)<br>
<br>
Wizard familiars have a 20% to 50% chance of evacing a dieing groupmate of the wizard to safespot instead of dieing.  Range 100, and it kills the familiar (but not the buff).<br>
(a reason to keep flappy around)<br>
<br>
Xulz and Familiars both allowed to be up.  =p<br>
<br>
<br>
Shaman get a &quot;death mitigation&quot; buff that makes a player drop to 1 point of aggro (like Divine Aura), rooted and stunned for 1 minute, and lose all buffs instead of die.<br>
// Go go death mitigation<br>
<br>
Shaman get a group Topor at L 64 (500 mana).<br>
<br>
<br>
Necro rez changed to only consume the essence emerald 10% of the time.<br>
// More death mitigation!<br>
<br>
Monk gain a 10 minute reuse 80% rez at L 60.<br>
// Now we are talking Ghetto rez<br>
<br>
<br>
Bards get a 65% slow, dot, 2/65 second stun (3 ticks) at L 65<br>
// Bards become a primary slower.<br>
<br>
<br>
Druids and Clerics get a 200 mana 2 k &quot;30% mitigation&quot; buff<br>
<br>
1.0 casting time, 13 second recast time.<br>
30% of all melee damage to target is soaked until 2 k damage is soaked, at which point the buff poofs.<br>
1 minute duration<br>
L 51 for druids, 30% 2 k of mitigation<br>
L 55 for clerics, 20% 2 k of mitigation<br>
They don't stack.<br>
// There will be druid &quot;mitigation chains&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladins LoH and SK HT reuse duration dropped starting at L 50 down to 10 minutes at L 65 with max AAs.  &quot;AA enhanced&quot; versions of HT and LoH left at longer durations.<br>
// More healing and death mitigation.  Paladins lose rez utility, gain LoH utility.  Mirror in SK required for envy reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shamans and Druids get &quot;reincarnation&quot;, a 0% rez that does not prevent the target from being XP rezzed.<br>
<br>
Druids and Shaman get &quot;preserve corpse&quot;, resets the rez timer on a corpse to 3 hours (if it still has xp on it) and teleports it to zone safespot (if the target corpse's owner consents).<br>
// If someone dies, you don't have to stop xping.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kazad and PoC/9 upgraded to Aego-like duration.<br>
Ward of Gallentry made a group buff.<br>
Blessing of Reverence made into a group buff.<br>
// All horribly needed.<br>
<br>
Cleric nuke cost and casting/recast time dropped by 10%, and a -10 resist modifier added to the post 60 nuke.<br>
// Make Clerics better nukers, but MR only.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanters get L 65 Whisper of Morrel, a 8/65 stun, -30 resist mod, that places a 3 tick &quot;immune to Whisper of Morrel&quot; buff on targets who don't resist the spell.<br>
// WoM 2.<br>
<br>
There.  I've just doubled death mitigation in the game, improved healing for druids in a wierd way, and provided a few upgrades to other classes whose utility is reduced by the improved abilities of other classes.<br>
<br>
And yes, I would be ok with giving wizards rez or heals, other than it not fitting the game's theme very well.<br>

That's time to get everyone to the zone, rez, regain mana, rebuff, and regain mana *again*.<br>
<br>
In a reasonable evac case (i.e., the tank dies and the crowd-controller doesn't think he can tie things down for a battle-rez), you're up and running again in 2 minutes.  That's time for the rogue to fetch the tank's corpse and the casters to med, and then rezzing and rebuffing the tank.<br>
<br>
That's for the mundane cases.  Other places I prefer evac to rez: The Hole (long way to drag corpses, over twisty pathes), Plane of Fear (if you didn't successfully break in, rogue CR doesn't help you much), ToFS (er, how do I drag through the mirror again?), Dragon Necropolis (%&amp;*#$&amp; wizard constructs!), Mephits in PoN (one-way, so you need to get your naked party to ZO2, or else wait for the graveyard).<br>
<br>
Oh, and then there's the small matter of level 18-62, where Shroud of Stealth isn't an option but evac is. <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

I don't. I am not interested in buffing or debuffing players or mobs. My job description says make things go boom. <br>
<br>
Most wizards feel we need an improvement on our nukes, especialy between 50 adn 59. This can be either bigger nukes, or adjusting the mana cost of existing nukes. In the end, both are similar. <br>
<br>
Wizards also feel we need our self mana regen boosters improved. For a heavy mana dependant class, we have the lowest self mana regen buffs.<br>
<br>
Bric, you should read the whole thread. A druid came here looking for support to tell Sony make Druids better. While most wizards here don't feel druids need more, I have said I can see where they could use a bump in thier current healing spells. <br>
<br>
Tyron, some of those things, we have already. I know you said you don't know much about wizards. I think that is often what causes problems between classes, they just don't know enough about each other and what they can do. <br>
<br>
If Druids wanted to support bigger nukes, or more mana efficent nukes, along with better self mana regening spells, that's great, I would send feedback to Sony saying Druids need better heals.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3541<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 3:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> &gt;Wizards also feel we need our self mana regen boosters improved.

Yah, we only end up with 1 more mana regen than VoQ gives and it all stacks with VoQ, as well as pretty much everthing else. We are nowhere close to hurting for self mana regen. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The only problem with our mana <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>regen</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is nearly all of it is post 60, and AA.  Epic, Skinline, crappy familiars, and 34 harvest aren't much, we don't start to look good till you add the second harvest, and Uber Flappy v1.0, and 2.0...<br>
<br>
I still think there needs to be some kind of out-of-combat instant mana refill, but I know that's never going to happen.<br>
<br>
Instead, we can hope for the pre-60 familiars to get a bit of a boost, mana regen added to the entire skin line, and Harvest to work a bit better.  A self only clarity effect might be inline, so long as it does not stack with, and is inferior to enchanter clarity.<br>
<br>
So, once again, the 65 wizard with full AA is balanced, but the little wizard, pre 60 isn't. <p><br>
