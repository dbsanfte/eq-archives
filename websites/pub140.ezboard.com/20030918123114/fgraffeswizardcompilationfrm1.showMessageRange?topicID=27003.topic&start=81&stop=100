Too many people see them as critical when going up against unslowable mobs in PoP. Besides, Warrior agro is fixed by simply introducing a few more decent proc'ing weapons.<br>
<br>
Increasing healing agro will not hurt all healing classes. In fact it will help them. Doing a 7000 HP complete heal should put you at the top of the hate list... just as much as firing off a 7000 point nuke would. The big big heals have really offset the game/group balance. If you don't want agro for doing a complete heal, use heal of time spells, have several healing classes, everyone loads up on stuns, etc. Instead of having a cleric, you'll need to have druids, ranger, shaman, bards, ... spreading out some of the healing agro. Suddenly more healing classes are group attractive. Clerics no longer have to save every bit of mana for the last second complete heal -- they can actually nuke, stun, or swing their hammer. I play a planar level Cleric as well, I appreciate a different dynamic than buff and heal. These days it is extremely rare that a CH gains agro unless it is early in the fight.<br>
<br>
Wizards are not buffers. I knew that when I signed up as an apprentice Wizard. My familiar is just that... a creature that is familiar to me... not familiar to my group mates. To make a group effect that would make Wizards group utility perception change significantly would cause balancing outcries in the other classes. Anything less than that would be a cheezy lower level bard effect. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

I disagree (this point has been brought up hundreds of times on the warrior board). If you gave warriors the best aggro-control <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the best damage mitigation/evasion, in one fell swoop you would eliminate the knights' niche in supreme (plate class) aggro generation and punt them back to the dark ages of Kunark. What they should do, however, is increase the difference in HP and AC of warriors and knights to make it meaningful again.<br>
<br>

And totally godly in others, not sure what you would want more than that - should it always work on everything? Just to give you an example, I went ahead and bought Strong Root + the recycling faster skill just because of some PoP fights. How is that for useless..<br>

I knew this would come.<br>
<br>
Quin and Aauminki, i think you have to differntiate a little more.<br>
<br>
I, as a Wizard, want to do mainyl damage, and i do that nicely. In the Tier 4 planes (PoFIres) for example a lot of mobs are immune to run speed changes.<br>
If they are not, it is often hard (not impossible, but hard) to get a snare on them. I ended up one day with wasting 400 mana just because i had to cast snare 4, 5 times untill it sticked.<br>
<br>
Of course this changes if in your group is a tashing chanter present.<br>
Now let me assure you something: Since PoP my groups have not whiped because i have not snared and we got a 'runner'. I just kill those mobs, when they turn and try to run, this is much more efficient (in my very personal opinion and for my play-style) than to snare them.<br>
I prefer to invest mana in a Lure to be sure to kill them or in a standard nuke than into a resistant biatch snare.<br>
Aside that, even IF you shoul get an add because of a runner... , please that here is not 1999, my groups are able to handle an add, and i would love sometimes that 'auto-pull' feature. (As i said, has not happened yet, because the mobs were only able to move 2 feet from me, untill i my nuke send them to the Nirwana.)<br>
<br>
This is as well true for dungeon-like zones like CoD, where i find myself more often these days, to help to level some alts.<br>
<br>
Second: Stuns.<br>
Stuns are nice to have to, but NOT to save the chanter any more, lol. They are much more usefull in those incidents when a Mob tries to gate and the only exp zone in PoP i am aware of, where this happends is BoT. Aside the fact that BoT is suck exp and i don't group there often, it is the ONLY place where i use Telekin.<br>
<br>
With my now 308 AA (grats me, yay<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and 6400ish HP buffed i can tank quite well in those places, often better than low AA meatshields. Same applies for chanters with there arcane rune. AT least the chanters i group with have absolutly no problem to get their debuffs to stick and have not died every because i did not stun an ele-plane Mob. Oh please. Again, we are not in 1999 anymore.<br>
Then again, i would have only ONE spell that is able to stun high tier exp mobs and that is Telekin. If it gets resisted i have to wait anyway 163478 years untill it refreshes.<br>
Nope, i see no reason to mem Telekin (in my very personal play-style) other than in BoT.<br>
<br>
If you can tell me any reason why i should use that spell on Xegony (lol, why should i? I prefer to SoS her for allmost the same mana), please do so - it could be interesting.<br>
<br>
HoH and theirlikes... That are the places where i can really tank now efficiently (IF i have to), especially if a Mob is snared. Heck, the Mobs die within 20-40 seconds (manaproblem is no issue there for me since you can use a horse there) and i end up chain casting SoS, why should i even mem a snare or a stun?<br>
<br>
Groups love me, because i speed up their kills massively and am not afraid to nuke. I do this by nuking, and not by stunning or snaring. Who needs a snare, if the Mob is dead?<br>
<br>
Ya, i know this will differ so much from other's playstyles. Ya, i know there are Wiz out there who prefer to chain stun (which is not even possible anymore in the higher tier planes of PoP). But this is not MY playstyle. <br>
I just blow things up and am not afraid of getting then and when aggro. I can very well stand a beating. And groups love me for blowing things into oblivion.<br>
<br>
Finally, this is my adviuce for you, who have often troubles finding a group:<br>
Blow things up, show them that YOU speed up their exp rate massively. YOU are the killer in that group and not the monk or rogue or ranger.<br>
And allways remember: only a dead mob is a good mob. <br>
<br>

The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> zone I've ever had serious problems snaring on a regular basis in is Tactics.  For those situations, this is what you do.  Invest in an Orb of Tishan and a tola robe, and get haste from your nearby shaman/beastlord/bard etc.  It sounds cheesy, but it lands a fair MR debuff on the mob which is usually enough to make snaring a simple task.  You can even take a break to cast a nuke if you want, but it shouldn't take more than 15 seconds from the start of the fight with good haste, and you don't have to wait for the tank to build agro even.<br>

Telekin is a 9 second stun.  Your average slow mob will probably land about 5-6 hits in that time.  You have time to toss off concussions afterwards, and with SCS3 I never had a problem using Telekin frequently and avoiding agro with a single concussion after a telekin.  Using it somewhat frequently, you can cut a mob's total damage output by 1/6 to 1/5, which helps a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with shaman and druid healers.<br>
<br>
This goes into the whole &quot;a wizard does not just nuke&quot; ethic.  Nuking is what a wizard does best, but it's not the thing he has to be doing.  Knowing the situations where it'd be more advantegous to emphasize your other skills is what makes you a good wizard.  (shaman + necro + rogue + mage + warrior + wizard = awesome group.

Wait.... but wizards have problems with groups because we're very one-dimensional?  Or did you just hop out of the woodwork to bash abilities that some of us have figured out to use quite well, in instances I'm positive you haven't even thought of, and persist merely because you have an insatiable desire to always be right?  You can sit there and say &quot;I nuke&quot; all day long.  I say &quot;I nuke, but should the situation arise I can also do crowd control, I can ease the healer's burden, I can pull.&quot;  I never had problems finding a group, even at 2 in the morning when there's not a cleric, chanter, or bard within miles, because I learned to emphasize other strengths.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I can pour out a crapload of damage too, and have certainly been known to do it.  I don't view that as much of an accomplishment.  If I'm in a group with a bard, cleric, shaman, sk,  rogue, and myself, I'm going to be pouring out the damage.  I don't view that as much of an accomplishment, it's merely one of the multitude of tasks I am capable of when I must adapt to it.<br>
<br>
As a footnote to this post, I'd just like to add that I've hardly ever used the phrase &quot;wizards can't&quot;.  I haven't had much cause to.<br>

And about the stun component to DoT... dude, lay off the crack.  It's the OWN in PvP, but why the hell wasn't it set up like the Kunark draughts where one was stunless and one had a 0 sec stun?

Absolutely, you have your personal preferrence how to play your Wiz and i have my very personal way of playing my Wizard.

Groups invite Wizards to do damage and take a chanter or Bard for CC. If you give them damage above the average rate of destruction that the average Wizard provides, then they'll reinvite you.<br>

Just about every class has a situation where one or more of their skills won't work.  Saying snare is useless because there are a couple of zones where mobs are immune to it or mobs have higher than normal resists doesn't make any sense, just as it wouldn't to say mez is useless.<br>

Once again, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>situational</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  There are circumstances where it's better to nuke stuff down.  You seem to still think that the only use for snare is to keep mobs from running away.  As far as losing stats on the orb.... having 100 less mana for 15 seconds really doesn't break my balls too much, since really mana and effects are the only stats that tend to matter after a while.<br>

<br>
Natan:  Gimme another reason.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1) Crowd control.  A snared mob doesn't move fast.  A smart group is capable of killing things on one side of a room while you hold the mobs on the other.  Yes, a chanter is better at CC, and yes, there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mobs immune to snare, but I still found quite a few chances to play the crowd control.  And you can even nuke full throttle when you only have a couple mobs in camp.<br>
<br>
2) Train management.  Works best in outdoor zones, although there are plenty of indoor zones where if you have enough space (get in the way-back machine- halls in akheva were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>just</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wide enough to work this), you can snare mobs off of a train, turning a 10 mob stab at exodus into some sweet xp and one hell of a fight.<br>
<br>
I do have others, but I prefer to keep <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of my tricks to myself.  I fully expect you to poo-poo and say &quot;oh, that's too hard, I can't do full damage during that, wah wah wah&quot;, which is fine, I already stated that there are situations where maybe tons of damage isn't the thing your group needs most, and I know there are quite a few places in PoP, even in the elemental planes, where you can use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>both</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tactics.  Not every place, so none of this &quot;snare-immune&quot; crap people like to toss off as if it were the rule instead of the exception.<br>
<br>

Did you read the part I said about druid or shaman healers?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The right tools for the right situations.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Yes, you might not have a purpose to Telekin when you've got an overabundance of healing, but you also don't always have to have a cleric healer.<br>
<br>
Also, not everyone in game has 300 AA's.  I pity you.  I think I left my wizard with around 100, but if this thread is indicative of anything (and it's something I've said for a long time), experience != skill.<br>

So there's a place where a specific group (which, in my estimation, worked exceedingly well) doesn't hold up as normal?  Whoopdefreakindo!

SITUATIONAL.  I will force this through your head with a brick if need be, but once again everyone in the game does not have 300 aa, play at right below the end game, and have the strongest people to group with.<br>
<br>
As well, that's 18 seconds if you want to use Telekin again.  It's far from wasted time, after you've tossed off one concussion you're pretty much free to nuke, or, if you're a big tanking fan, don't even bother and land a SoS while he's stunned.  It's far from a &quot;wasted&quot; 18 seconds, the &quot;cast a fucking draught&quot; comment was supposed to be thickly sarcastic.<br>

There weren't many times I ever had to say &quot;LFG&quot;.  Or ask a friend if they had openings in a group.  Sometimes I had to fight for it if I wanted some time to quad.

I don't need this &quot;maybe they'll reinvite you&quot; shit, I never had to worry about being reinvited.  I could safely assume I would be.  Sounds like I'm stroking my cock here, but I'm not.<br>
<br>
Now, you can't always have a chanter.  I'd rather spend the time I would have spent hunting one down killing mobs, and doing so in a way that's not the standard, accepted way of play.  As far as what's &quot;more impressive&quot;... any idiot can nuke.  Nuking is by far the easiest thing a wizard does.  This is not a big secret to most people, only idiots still go &quot;oooh, aaah&quot; at 6k crits anymore.  But nuking is not the only skill wizards get, and there are situations where one is better than the other.  And there are very few situations I've found, even while doing CC, where I couldn't put out at least moderate damge.  Not many wizards I know who CC almost as well as a chanter, and KEI's readily available in the nexus.<br>

<br>
So... now, you're talking about a very slim sub-section of the game as if it was indicative of the entire game?  You've got to stop hauling out the &quot;Well, in plane of fire we do THIS&quot;, and &quot;in plane of fire, we do THAT&quot;, I have my elemental flags to, no one's sitting here thinking you're more uber because you have a lot of aa and flags, stop dragging that out wherever you can as it's obvious you're trying to use it to make it seem like you're the great uber wise player.  (Else, you wouldn't say it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nearly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as often.)  AA is nothing special, AA = time.  Flags are nothing special, I've known quite a few people in the top guilds of the game who were absolutely clueless.<br>
<br>
I'd also think it's a fair venture to say less than 1% of wizards tooling around in PoP have 200+ AA, so stop using that as the general case. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1054<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 12:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just about every class has a situation where one or more of their skills won't work.

Works best in outdoor zones, although there are plenty of indoor zones where if you have enough space (get in the way-back machine- halls in akheva were just wide enough to work this), you can snare mobs off of a train, turning a 10 mob stab at exodus into some sweet xp and one hell of a fight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You talk about AE groups or so? Never felt the urge to do AE again since PoP, nor have i ever experienced someone pulling for a standard group the way you described it, nor would i personally ever do it that way. I prefer to med and let others pull singles or doubles or triples.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do have others, but I prefer to keep some of my tricks to myself. I fully expect you to poo-poo and say &quot;oh, that's too hard, I can't do full damage during that, wah wah wah&quot;, which is fine, I already stated that there are situations where maybe tons of damage isn't the thing your group needs most, and I know there are quite a few places in PoP, even in the elemental planes, where you can use both tactics. Not every place, so none of this &quot;snare-immune&quot; crap people like to toss off as if it were the rule instead of the exception.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sure bro, everyone is entitled to his opinion, but i truely believe that you are constructing obscure theoretical situations here that just don't happen and are not realistical in PoP these days. (And that's where i do exp.)<br>

Hm... i do this when grouping with druids or shamans, too (as main healers).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As well, that's 18 seconds if you want to use Telekin again. It's far from wasted time, after you've tossed off one concussion you're pretty much free to nuke, or, if you're a big tanking fan, don't even bother and land a SoS while he's stunned. It's far from a &quot;wasted&quot; 18 seconds, the &quot;cast a fucking draught&quot; comment was supposed to be thickly sarcastic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It's a waste of mana and wasted time, in my very own opinion, and in my playstyle i am much better off spending the 300 mana on an AT which does 4 times the damage. (And the lifepsan of those Mobs does not exceed much more than 18 seconds anyway and everything is better than a resisted Telekin...)<br>

Now, you can't always have a chanter. I'd rather spend the time I would have spent hunting one down killing mobs, and doing so in a way that's not the standard, accepted way of play. As far as what's &quot;more impressive&quot;... any idiot can nuke. Nuking is by far the easiest thing a wizard does. This is not a big secret to most people, only idiots still go &quot;oooh, aaah&quot; at 6k crits anymore. But nuking is not the only skill wizards get, and there are situations where one is better than the other. And there are very few situations I've found, even while doing CC, where I couldn't put out at least moderate damge. Not many wizards I know who CC almost as well as a chanter, and KEI's readily available in the nexus.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup, yup, it's your view of this issue, my view is different:<br>
 Dead Mobs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resisted snare, root, telekin. That's my opinion. Most groups have already a form of CCer avaiable (aside the Wizards Ghetto-CCing).<br>

Ah bro, again i don't strike something, like you do, heh. It's your opinion, thats ok.<br>
Groups invite me, because they know i dish out a TON of damage, and if something goes wrong i even can offtank for them AND do damage and i DO that. That's my form of crowd controlling.<br>

Flags are nothing special, I've known quite a few people in the top guilds of the game who were absolutely clueless<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Heh and now you are bashing me, because i say: My 'thing' might not be suitable for every other Wizard or it might not be every Wizard's preference to do it this way, especially if they are NOT 65 and have NOT the essential defensive AAs?<br>
(I especially refer to your first quote where you jumped on me for saying this.)<br>
<br>
Claud you know what... you should wonder, why SoE did not continue after SoL (safe Telekin) to give us that many Stuns like they used to do pre 60... We are in 99% a DAMAGE dealing class.<br>
And i try to avoid everything that takes away from my DPS. That's why groups invite me. Might be different for you, Claud, but it is that way for me.<br>
And groups in 99% perceive us that way: As damage dealers. They don't want us as CCers, but as damage dealers. And this here is about perception. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A> at: 6/21/03 12:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fanya101>Fanya101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 3:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> its probebly a little late to reply to this thread and have it help any but here goes<br>
<br>
i'm now 57, for lvl 1-55 i soloed, thats all i did, i made a wizzy to solo.<br>
as for groups i cant get them, i went from 1-54 solo, guess what my friends base is 0, none, nada save my RL friends<br>
i played a shaman for 65 levels, 121aas, i know what i'm doing, i know about agro control and all that fun stuff, but the fact that no one knows my wizzy cause i retired my shaman means no one knows me, good and bad i guess<br>
<br>
i'm not sure what i'm saying i guess but this, since this exp change i have not soloed much cause the exp just isnt worth it, but at the same time i have not been able to get a group, i have sat lfg for hours and hours while i do quad just for something to do. is it my fault, kinda, i dont know the lower tier planes well at all, i never leveled in them, for that reason i dont like to start groups, could of i started a group here and there, probebly yes, but the fact is even at 57 now, i still cant get a group, will that change, who knows. personally i am not gonna ding past 60, i just dont want to, is that gonna limit my groups, probebly, more than likely yes. are wizzys ever gonna be desirable in groups, no clue, wish soe could figure out how to make grouping and soloing both a vialable option <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/tuttlec/Fanya%20sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

But, I tell you what, those times when I save CR and rebuffing with a quick exodus, or root or snare multiple incoming mobs giving time for the real cc peeps to mez/slow etc is a very useful bow.<br>
<br>
The only other dmg dealing class I ever see offering as much utility as us is rangers. I often see them snare, root park, off-tank etc and I love that. The more flexible a group is the more they can cope when the train arrives or other unexpected events.<br>
<br>
We are a flexible class even if it's simply stunning a mob that has jumped the chanter after a resisted slow. Yeah I could do over twice the dmg with AT (for almost twice the mana, Telekin is less than 25% more efficient) but I'm saving the cleric 400+ mana in heals too. 8 sec of a mob beating on a robe can be a *lot* of group mana saved. Even if the cleric is simply bubbling with mana he can nuke with his 400 mana instead and the *group* does more dmg to the mob. It's a synergie we can fit well into. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27003.topic&start=121&stop=137>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=27003.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=27003.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=27003.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=27003.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27003.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27003.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> -
