History
Ashen Was found as an Egg and Raised by an apprentice to a sorcerer. The Apprentice Taught Ashen How to Fly and Fight. Ash was Very Friendly when it came to Humans. Sometimes Too friendly. She was often trying to be friends with those who wouldnt Allow it and would rather her Ill Will...She is rather peaceful and quiet. Though when she gets excited she can be extremely Dangerous Or Hyper, Depending on the situation. 

Currently
Ashen was Kidnapped from her sorcerer While he was in the process of Teaching her to speak Fully. So she lacks Some of the extreme abilities to speak, her S's are still Hiss like and long. She was Abused by the Humans who took her. They caged her with amny other gryphons, Intent on making her a fur coat. She escaped the human's grasp now. But All that was done, has been undone. 

She Now fears humans to an extent, due to her previous treatment. But when she is befriended she is the most loyal and wonderful friend. She befriended an Elven man named Vartigius a year ago, He used her once to Ride upon in a battle... Against full blooded Humans, She was wounded and he was killed in the battle.

Now shes just out and About... Somewhat Looking for friends... Somewhat just looking for something to do.


Personality
Crazy alot of the time... Gullible Especially when food or money/jewels are involved.
Once befriended she is totally Loyal and Good hearted.

Weakness
Can be Somewhat Bird Brained 
Quick to act sometimes, Acts First Thinks later
