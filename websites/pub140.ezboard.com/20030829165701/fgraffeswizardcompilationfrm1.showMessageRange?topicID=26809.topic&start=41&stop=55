<br>
1.  It is the most complex game ever made.  Bar none.  The world is huge the game is intricate.  The balancing is nearly perfect.  <br>
<br>
2.  It has our friends and our history.  It is an internet gathering place unlike any other.  We come back again and again for it.  <br>

<br>
The number one thing that seemed to be putting him off the game was the scale of it. Ok, personally i think him having guildchat might have been a mistake, listening to a bunch of 65s whining about PoTa problems probebly is a bit disconcerting when your level 4 and have just been done in by a drowned citizen, but still.<br>
<br>
I honestly dont think the game has got any easier, if anything its got more complex. Focus items, level restrictions, newbie armours, horrably out of date and confusing newspapers. Thers a huge legacy of shit that makes no sense in this game, broken quests, quests that arnt broken but have no point, old style armour dyes...<br>
<br>
PoK is a nightmare, imagine hailing all the fcus item quest people, each requiring 4 stupidly named drops from 4 contenents.... God help you if you write all that down and sit thinking, where the fuck are these places.<br>
<br>
And Griffins in WC, now the tunnel is empty there lethal! Not to mention the joys of your guild telling you to go down a tunnel full of drowned citizens because none of them have a clue what they are as they havent been to freeport since they where added god knows how long ago.<br>
<br>
Hes just reached level eleven now and has learnt a new phrase, &quot;corpse recovery.&quot; Only when we did our first it was against rats in freeport at level 1, we could cope with that. He died in some lucin one we told him was safe and now cant get his corpse back as the lantern he had to buy. (he never got to kill firebeatles, some one took him somewhere more efficent....)<br>
<br>
Ok, hes twinked to high heaven... so what, i started playing just after kunark came out and got twinked by passing strangers... Ok my gear wasent as good, but compartivly it was better... I got an FBR, it was like the 5th best robe you ever saw then, it was awsome, i dident worry about getting a new one till i was past 50.<br>
<br>
Its not simpler, its not easier, its just different... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malodium>Malodium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 7:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> No matter how easy/hard the game is/was/will be, its not really that that ruins the 'vision'.

Its this attitude in people that ruins the experience for many.<br>
If everyone that played EQ had a life it wouldnt be like this.<br>
If the casual player prevailed, not many would have made it through NToV by now.<br>
I think its mostly because of this that the game doesnt feel as satisfying to some anymore.<br>

I remember the mage spell ageis of ro that was the level 60 group damage shield was put in with kunark but never started dropping until just before SoL rofl.<br>
<br>
The original team were a little to tight with the reigns, they never seemed to get around to actually fixing/implementing things that really would help the player base.<br>
<br>
 Graveyards = great idea great implementation.<br>
<br>
Mass Transit = good but perhaps should be on a slightly smaller scale.  Say 1 or two books per continant.<br>
<br>
Blass balancing, JFC the onld team totally screwed this up.  They would over power one class a rediculous amount and were so worried about increasing power of another to compensate they either left things alone or nerfed the powerful into the weak.<br>
<br>
The main problem I had with the old eq team is they always had &quot;penalties&quot; for XP, for this or that.  GDI the new team using Bonuses is A-OK with me.  Remember how long it took the old team to admit after two years of people throwing data at them that soloing was preferable to grouping for any class that could solo because you didnt get hit with any penalties nor have to split the xp.<br>
<br>
Thats the fundamental problem I had with them, they intentionally made roadblocks to things like grouping by making certain classes less desierable.  Heaven forbid you be a ranger or paladin back in kunark. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 2:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1>  While in the past downtimes could be a little harsh to med and recover compared to the constant rate at which you can pull now but the downtimes allowed you to chat much more and get to know people better. Chatting is still possible but many times it is not as easy as it once was, quite a few people 2 box now compared to then so chatting is even more difficult. Maybe it is me but random groups seem a lot less friendly than in the past not that they are aholes or anything just more business like and worried about bringing in the most exp as fast as they can. There was always some like this but for me the game seem a lot more social in the past rather than the constant grind.<br>
<br>
 I believe EQ is a lot easier now, the average playtime to sixty I think is indication of this. We have an application to my guild of a guy who started playing about 7-8 months ago who is close to 60, think 59 right now and he has just under 19 days of play time. While he may be a special case, I would be curious to see what the average play time to 60 is now, I would bet it is around 25 days, when a few years ago 100 or so was normal. There is exceptions but most of my friends are pretty average, they have more then some and less than others but they averaged around 120 days to 60. The limit has nothing to do with the old caps either as most were not 50 when RoK hit.<br>
<br>
 EQ has changed so much since its beta/release it is almost like a completly different game. For me the one thing I miss about the old EQ is the social aspects, as much as it pains me to say it now, I miss some of the RP or hopeless people who tried by talking in Old English. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derangedcreature>Deranged Creature</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 2:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ for the Masses</span><hr size=1> I personally liked the old EverQuest alot better than the new.  I was 50 before Kunark even came out, but even from back when I was a little one I remember when I made my first trip to Halas (14 human cleric all points into str.. go me)...  I remember the crappy guild me and my friend started and we were talking to the people in the guild telling them about the snow.  Going threw highhold pass and getting attacked by a gnoll and freaking out and then the wonderful guard helped me!...<br>
<br>
This was fun to me, I was lost everywhere I went.  Even EverFrost seemed huge to me, leveling out there (when people actually hunted there).  Sure it was slow, I died alot. long corpse recoveries at times.... But I had fun...<br>
<br>
Do I like Planes of Power?.. not really, it bores me.... I can't say I play EQ to much these days, but I remmeber my first time in Kunark and all, first time in sebilis... etc etc etc.. When it actually mattered... <br>
<br>
Now you goto Sebilis and you can kill half the zone off Bazaar bought gear, before my AC was lucky to be 800 as a cleric.. <br>
<br>
I will say there was a lack of zones back then but it seemed huge to me because I had to run everywhere, I actually know the zones and I find it sad how you have people now who are level 65 with 200+ aa and know jack shit about the game because they just get to Valor and sit in the caves all day long.  How is this fun?....  <br>
<br>
So to sum up my dribble, I think that the game sucks compared to what it was in alot of ways, but if you like the type of game it became.. more power to ya...  One thing I will never deny is the fact that mana regen and HP regen should have been higher from the start, that is one thing that ruins the game in a way.. 14 min med times.. Hell on my wizard it takes me about 12 right now with just clairty 3, and that sucks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...<br>

I still remember the time I had to walk + take boat for corpse run. The worst run was walking + boat from felwithe till warrens in erudin. I became lvl 20 and was excited to use my 1st gate, to see the new content. Then I forgot to bind myself and died in the warrens, de-dinging myself to 19. Now I ran from felwithe to Butcher, took the boat to Freeport (fell twice because of lag issue in the boat), then ran to high hold from freeport, crossed the karanas( I HATED WALKING WK WITHOUT SOW! ), went to qeynos, took me 30min to find the god damn port, binded there (good thing since I fell 3 times in here) then went all the way to warrens naked. Took me 3hours for this corpserun ( from this day on, I always remember to bind when I move to new places ).<br>
<br>
Although this experience was very frustrating, still gave me the feeling that I was exploring. With the new pok stones, 3 simple clicks can drive you from Faydware(sp?) to Odus. I have a feeling that EQ now is becoming something like Diablo. Which is one of the reasons that I took my 2nd break.<br>

5+ day respawns on key quest mobs<br>
PoK books available to everyone<br>
No level restriction on weapons / gear Pre PoP<br>
No level restriction on Buffs<br>
Summoning mobs<br>
Death touches<br>
Raid size forces needed for PoP progression<br>
<br>
<br>
Good points:<br>
<br>
More rez spell levels for clerics<br>
Lesser evacuate<br>
Lower level corpse summon<br>
Outdoor bind locations<br>
Level restrictions on gear that is tradeable<br>
focus effects<br>
FT items<br>
soulbinders<br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
In total, there was alot finally fixed. but along with the fix they implemented a few small issues that totally offset the way the EQ world worked.<br>
<br>
the way they finally adressed the problems for going into dungeons at lower levels by giving a rez option at lower levels, giving evacuate at lower levels and adding low level corpse summons sure made the game better to those groups. A death would not take the 5 hour it used to take before. and you can bind nearby.<br>
<br>
I like the idea that people below level 46 should consume some item when they want to travel with a book up to the PoK. Or down from the PoK Make it sufficiently expensive, (10pp) and the real newbies are forced to travel the world instead of taking the easy way out. The options that gave EQ its feeling was the huge size of it, and that has been removed <p><center>

<br>
I started in August of 2001...a few months before Luclin. I remember being awed by the vast scope of the game. But:<br>
<br>
1. I also ate up much time travelling. Time that I could have been XPing.<br>
<br>
2. I never was able to buy or sell anything in EC. The spam was terrible.<br>
<br>
I played until Easter of 2002 (and deleted my chars) and then quit until this last February. I came back at the end of Feb, when SoE sent the email offering 30 free days. I rolled my wizard in Feb and he dinged 47 last night.<br>
<br>
Now, I've had spurts of time where I go for XP, but have spent a lot of time seeing zones I never saw the first time. I have my 3rd Coldain shawl and the parts needed for the 4th. I have my Staff of the Wheel and T-Flux. I've been on a few &quot;lower level&quot; raids (The Hole, Crypt of Nadox, Hate's Fury) and saw and hunted in &quot;Gnome Heaven&quot; (Plane of Innovation) last weekend. My leezard fund is halfway there...I think I'll buy the black one with the red stripes. In other words, I've gone out of my way to enjoy the journey. It's well worth it.<br>
<br>
I think pretty much all of the changes are good. I think tommorow's patch will be wonderful --- I much prefer grouping. Also, I bet we see the high level buff fix --- which will force the lower levels to slow down a little bit and maybe chat during some downtime (no KEI/Aego/etc.)<br>
<br>
I don't think the PoK books are as bad as many of the &quot;old timers&quot; grumble. There are still many zones that are not really that easy to get to...I found playing my Enchanter on Stromm that I really missed my self-gates.<br>
<br>
I think many people are just burned out on EQ. Heck, it's given many folk 3 or 4 years of solid fun almost every day. What other game can really make that claim?<br>
<br>
For all the twinks and race to the top folk, I still see many people who are obvious newbies. You can tell from the questions they ask and the gear they wear. And it's usually a pleasure to get to know them...because they are feeling that sense of wonder at the world. Heck, I still get it whenever I'm zoning into a place I've never been. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ is doing fine. I think the game will continue to do fine.<br>
<br>
A challenge...roll a new character on a lower pop server and take no gifts from folk. Don't self twink, don't beg. Get to know some of the folk who really just bought the game. You may be surprised at how many of them there are. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2n6q6/morlar.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I don't feel like I'm on the xp treadmill (other than wanting to level/AA's for obvious reasons of power).  We do lots of things, and have explored lots of areas.  This game has a lot of faults.  However, I haven't found anything better.<br>
<br>
If you start to feel burned out, let me give you some advice.  Go to your newbie area/dungeon (for me, its the Bank at Kelethin/Crushbone) and either auction lower end gear cheap to the newbies (I sell Ulthork Armor/Velium Weapons for about 10pp each), and see how many &quot;real&quot; newbies there are in the game.  Or, set up an aid station/train derailer in the dungeon.  Mem best PBAE, and wait 10minutes.  Then, when the Emperor shows up in his train, burn them all down.  It is funny how &quot;powerful&quot; the newbs think you are, and really, really refreshing.<br>
<br>
EQ isn't on its death bed, and it can still be a very dynamic, and refreshing game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26809.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26809.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26809.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26809.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26809.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26809.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26809.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26809.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
