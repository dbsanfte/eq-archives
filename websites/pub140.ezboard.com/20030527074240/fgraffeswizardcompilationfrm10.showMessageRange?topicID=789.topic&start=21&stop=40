<br>
I completely disagree and in ALL lvls not only pre quadding lvls<br>
<br>
At pre 40 lvls they outsolo a wizard by multiples, i saw mages solo red cons all the time in a quick time so it s was very good exp. Mobs which i never had the mana pool for them at that lvls even if someone would keep them rooted for me i would have had to med for 5 minutes but pet and technic makes it not too hard for mages<br>
<br>
At the lvl 60 AA grind stage good equipped mages got about the same exp soloing than i was quadding in ME with the difference i had more FT and PoTC which they didn t need to do that well<br>
<br>
Another example yesterday in gu:<br>
<br>
++++ tells the guild: just soloed a treant in PoS &lt;chuckle&gt;<br>
You tell the guild: huh? i quad them<br>
You tell the guild: Ooh PoS??<br>
++++ tells the guild: Yep =)<br>
<br>
++++ is a mage of course<br>
<br>
I don t want mages to be nerfed in any way but your statement is absolutely wrong imo i can only agree luxum here in all points<br>
<br>
PS: <br>
<br>
one addition<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>my point is this. <br>
if almost all mages can get sofb and maelstrom of electricity, and almost all druids can get moonfire,<br>

<br>
Moonfire drops even of lvl 50 TM named vampires, i ve seen it with my own eyes about a month ago it s like a 1% chance and it s also posted on druidsgrove so i am not the only who saw that, maelstrom of electricity drops of lower Ssra bosses doesn t it? i think we have spare copies in our guild bank even and not because we have no mages in the guild<br>

You hit all the weak points in that message. Quadding is damn near impossible in many places now. And I simply love to be recognized for my ability to be able to port anywhere, I do. But it also comes with a price, getting tells all the time for TL's. <br>

My question is why haven't we ever seen Absor reply to one of these threads?  I'm sure he sees them and is aware of our concerns but it seems like he and VI don't give a rats ass.  This is probably the one major issue that spans more than one expansion we've had.  It's not going to go away until VI tells us to shove it or fixes it.<br>

Most of the time wizard whine about the other class get a nice nuke... but that is on top of the fact that we have real trouble to camp our spells, or even get spells.<br>
<br>
I have seen copy of 2 SoL mage nukes dropped from Doomshade and Rumblecrush. The thing is that wizards has some disadvantages on mobs who drops EER. Sunstrike for example VP is out of question. Like Luxum said no one... and I mean NO ONE will camp it to get SS, since its such a time sink and requires liek 2 groups completing the key quest. Kunark dragons are now for lower tier guilds which most of the high end guild ignore completely except those who are greedy. Emperor, appart from hierophant cloak I believe not many are looking forward to camp that place anymore ( atleast they are too busy going for better loots elsewhere ). <br>
<br>
EER, well THO is not a very desirable target. Being a pain in the ass of crossing the brindge, the repop is very high and him taking about 30min to kill (average that I heard) and he does not bring much benefit to other classes. Doomshade and Rumblecrush  and also Rhags gives some nice items appart from Spells. So they are more popular in my guild at least. That makes 2 spells out of my way, not to mention GSS which is EMP camp which require its own preparation.<br>
<br>
Availability of the spells has been an issue for us for the last 3 expantions. I know Torpor and Malo for shamans, and Emisary of Thule for necro is also rare ( but i doubt it... Emisary of Thule dropped from emp in crypt ). However, they have other roles that can use while trying to get those spells. For us wizards without nukes there is no way that can improve us significantly except for getting new AAs. ( mind you i bet SS &gt; DoF with SCF3 )<br>
<br>
I don't care if mages get the new nukes. Good better for them and for the group to have a bit more DSP. How ever the way they achieve it makes frustrating for the Designers, not mages but the people who actually put the spell into vendor, makes us very annoying. Many of us are missing SS because its VERY rare and also VERY expensive when u see it on market. EER and GSS are no different in availability. They might not be rare in achieving it, but the mobs that drops em are not very beneficial to the raid force or they are not ready... takes time to get ready etc. (Tho also needs preparation like getting Remove curse to all healers, which they are sold for 4k in TP).<br>
<br>
I am 100% for making SS vendor sold, even tho I got my copy from Gore I really do. EER and GSS or maybe just EER could be quested. My guild nor I think any1 is now interested in confronting THO just for the sake of a wizard spell.<br>

Actually with the instacast refresh change, DoR has a lower potential dps than SS (even when both are focused) when resists are not a factor (SS 232.3 dps vs DoR 229.7 dps).  If SS was focused and DoR was not, DoR would be 4.13 dmg/mana and SS would be 5.17 dmg/mana.  But that is not really why I am upset with the availability of those 2 Luclin spells.<br>
<br>
In order to even scribe DoR you need to be 62, AT 63, SoS 65.  So you have to abandon a great deal of pre-PoP content as well as get the PoP spells.  It now appears that VI is not done providing content geared to the sub-PoP levels.  There was a post in the General forum about PoP.  The gist of the thread said upper PoP was not for everyone; which in turn can mean that 61+ is not for everyone.  There are many reasons to stay in the low 60s, especially for those in smaller or diverse leveled guilds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>why are you guys still whining?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
We are not 'whining'.  This is still a valid issue for people in these levels.  VI is still tuning sub-60 content (i.e. Beastlord rare Luclin spells now on a vendor).  <br>

Also, the long cast time means less casts, ie 1 full resist will hurt your dps much more. <br>
<br>
Your argument is still flawed though as not all nukes were intended to get into the hands of all players. Sorry, but if your unwilling to abandon pre-pop content as XP locations then congratulations you will most likely be in the large pool of people who never get GSS and EER. And if you can't get sunstrike then congratulations your again in a large pool of people that can never do Kunark dragons. This game doesn't reward its players equally... but if you never even attempt to enter the high end game then never expect to get any of the most desired spells in our arsenal. <br>
<br>
Pursueing levels post 60 does not force you to abandon pre pop content... You just won't be rewarded as nicely with xp. Consider it a loot based camp instead =) <p>[63 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calfhigh>Calfhigh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/3/03 11:13:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=789.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most mages...</span><hr size=1> As a mage I wanted to post a few quick points.  <br>
one NUKES arnt everything.  FoT is a mana sink from hell a + a bolt any way.  as well look at utility of a wiz, snare/root/runes/lures/mana regen ( familiar, aa etc) all are advantages you have to aid your NUKING power.  FoT is asking to die if you cast it often.  I would love a smaller faster nuke of similar lesser efficiency.  &quot;you have been summoned&quot; sux.<br>
two If you want to compare the relative frequency of a spell compare gss to the mage 60 pet heal.  At most a few per server MIGHT have it.  Mages get a 3k+ hp pet, and a 500 point heal.  <br>
three PoP spells are only rare because they are new, i am the spell bank for my guild and i have ehtreal spells i junk now because they wont sell at 50pp.  Parchemtns drop fast, prices drop fast, spectral spells are on average 10-14k now, and falling FAST.  dont bitch about the old spells, when newer better ones are comming.<br>

However, it was obviously to the cost of wizards.  I agree that it must sting many wizards to see such a fine spell on a vendor while key wizard nukes remain nigh unobtainable.  Something needs to be done.<br>

HEALING is not your prime function by any means, never has been, never will be.  Should it be so rare?  No, i don't think so, but it is a very bad comparison to make with GSS since NUKING is a wizard's prime function.  The rarity of GSS would not be such a huge sticking point if 1. SS and EER were not also ridiculously rare, leaving only ice spear, a 1200 point, often resisted nuke for the average lvl 60 wizard   and  2. if FoT which is on a vendor was not clearly balanced off GSS but instead had been balanced off our common nuke, ice spear.<br>
<br>
As Raz said, i think it was an honest oversight on SOE's part.  They were so focused on fixing the damage the mod rod nerf did to mages that they seem to have forgotten that wizards are specialized nukers and that GSS is extremely rare.  The only way to fix that at this point is to either deal with our spell rarity at that level range, or add a vendor nuke for wizards at 61 which is balanced with FoT in mind.  Unfortunately it is clear to me that they will never deal with this inequity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwideonthegnome>GwideonTheGnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/4/03 11:30:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=789.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most mages...</span><hr size=1> Gnomish Greetings!<br>

I apologize for not detailing the math behind my numbers initially.  I only wanted to point out, that if you had trouble obtaining level 4 focus items, DoR's only advantage is in it's resists, a point which you seemed to disagree with.  I don't think level 4 mage summoned focus is that hard to obtain. But, if you can not find them and you already have level 3 focus, then you may be better off using Sunstrike.<br>

GSS was intended to filter down to lower status wizards eventually. If it were not so, it would have been named Ancient and be no-drop. GSS rightfully belonged to the top-end players when this was the premier nuke in the game. This is not true anymore. I never raised any objection when it was, I was content to wait as that was balanced. When another class is given a spell off of a vendor that so closely compares to GSS and at relatively the same level, then it became unbalanced. Any solution that does not put a comparable nuke within reach of the average player does not address the issue. <br>

<br>
Here is the Catch-22.  In order for the average Wizard to get GSS, you have to no longer need it.  How silly is that? The general consensus seems to be that once you have AT and SoS, you will not memorize EER and GSS.  But, if you get the levels and spells in PoP then you have the possibility to acquire the spells that you will no longer need.  <br>

I guess you need to ask yourself what makes you gaming time fun?  I have the most enjoyment when I am grouping and raiding and the task is a challenge.  Smaller and family style guilds often recruit lower level members in hopes that once they make friends with guild members they may stay instead of abandoning the guild for end-game guilds.  Where do you get experience groups?  Who do you raid with?  Mostly with your guild and friends, sometimes a pickup group.  If your friends are in the 50 - 61 level range, then leveling beyond 61 is going to green out many prime experience locations.  <br>
<br>
Yes, leveling would make farming easier.  Farming is not a challenge and not fun.  How often can you go blow Emperor Crush to pieces before it drives you bonkers?  How long will the new expansion hold your interest if it is not a challenge?<br>

Aye, it is about time the Magician got the respect he deserved all along.  I think the adjustments made to pets, and the spell additions have done wonders for the perception of the Magician and pet classes in general.  /applaud<br>

Thank you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It almost seems we get more support from our Magician friends than we do from our own community.  Some are so intent on squashing anything that even resembles a whine, that they fail to recognize valid issues.  As I am sure you are aware, the majority of Wizards do not want FoT adjusted.  It has sufficient drawbacks to not be overpowering for its level.<br>
