<br>
There is a shortage of healers at the high end game.  Tanks feel it, damage dealers feel it.  Slowers feel it less, because all slowers except for one have at least 1 other &quot;best of job&quot; group role.<br>
<br>
If druids gained the ability to act as a primary healer in a group (and that means death mitigation as well as healing) the grouping situation for other classes would improve.<br>
<br>
The balance problem between priests is a thorny issue, but the game needs more healers.<br>
<br>
There are 9 good damage dealers at L 65 (wiz mag nec dru enc bst mnk rog rng).  You want as many of these as you can fit.<br>
<br>
There are 7 I'd-invite-you-for-buffs buffers at L 65 (enc bard cle dru shm nec(!) bst).  More than a handful of these is suboptimal, and their use is sometimes situational.<br>
<br>
There are 4 good slowing classes at L 65 (bard, shaman, enchanter, beastlord).  A group needs 1 slower, excess usually does another job.<br>
<br>
There are 3 good tank classes at L 65 (war pal shd).  A group needs 1 tank, excess is usually suboptimal.<br>
<br>
There is 1 good healing class at L 65.  A group needs 1 healer.<br>

Perhaps druids do need an improvement on thier heals. At level 58, they get a heal that heals 75% or max 2925. That is hardly comparable to the clerics level 39 heal for 7.5. At level 60, they get a direct heal for 978.<br>
<br>
And yes, regens are very nice, mostly for making down time's smaller. But a 25 HP per tick regen, while taking 200 damage per hit isn't going to keep you alive longer then a few extra ticks.<br>
<br>
Shamans are not as good as druid heals. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't give Druids a Rez, no offense. Paladins, Clerics and Necros can do that.<br>
<br>
I would support Druids getting better heals. Not as good as a clerics, but the difference between the two is very large in my book. To large for a group to actually ever say, we have a druid, who needs a cleric.<br>

The stunning fact now is, that druids are so much more powerfull in other areas than clerics. Nukes? Snares? Soloing? Doting? Debuffing? Charming?<br>

You know what?  You're absolutely right.  They are not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>comparable</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  They're not clerics.  They are druids.<br>
<br>
Druids are the second best healer in the game hands down.  They are good enough in fact, that I've used them as the healer taking down nameds in BOT.  Hell?  You want more than that?<br>
<br>
Let's put things into perspective here.  How many times have druids been invited to groups, only to have the druid not want to heal at all?  I've seen it plenty.  Hell, I've had druids get an invite then /disband because they didn't want to be the healer! <p>Aazumar Dracostarr<br>

Since I don't play a druid or a cleric, I can say that I don't have first hand experience. <br>
<br>
Like I said, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PERHAPS</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> druids do need an improvment on thier heals. I went and read the heals of both clerics and druids and shaman before I made this post. And honestly, from what I read, I didn't think that Druid heals came even half way close to what clerics can do. In fact, at best they seemed to be only about a quater-third as good, level for level, as Clerics. <br>
<br>
That's just my opinion. Lets not also forget the recent arguements with magicians over the spells fire pets got. It became very clear that many (not all) magicians didn't know much about wizards spells, and vice versa. Thankfully, wizards, for the most part, advocated a better fire pet since the current one sucked, rather then saying, you have 3 other good pets, screw you if one sucks.<br>
<br>
It's not for one class to tell another class that thier spells are fine the way there are, unless you have the actual long time experience of playing the class in question.<br>
<br>
This consent wrangling between classes doesn't help anyone. Every class wants more for it's self. Maybe if a few classes worked together, both of them would get improvements they need.<br>

<br>
Give shamans and beastlords and hell monks death mitigation abilities (it doesn't have to be a rez, they could implement something new).  There needs to be more death mitigation classes in the game.<br>
<br>
Being able to use a druid as a healer is more of a sign that the encounter is easy for you.<br>
<br>
There needs to be more healing in the game.  That, as far as I can tell, is the largest bottleneck in grouping right now.  You could give necros a complete heal to solve the problem, but it is a problem.<br>
<br>
Best druid cheal ratio/HPsec: 7.8 ratio 382 HPsec<br>
Best cleric cheal ratio/HPsec: 18.75 ratio 612 HPsec<br>
<br>
Best druid large fast heal ratio/HPsec: 3.5 ratio 467 HPsec<br>
Best cleric large fast heal ratio/HPsec: 4.6 ratio 733 HPsec<br>
<br>
Best druid fast heal ratio/HPsec: 3.5 ratio 467 HPsec<br>
Best cleric fast heal ratio/HPsec: 3.6 ratio 829 HPsec<br>
<br>
Yes, druids aren't clerics.  2 druids using all their mana and effort can match 1 cleric, healing wise.  Druids are bad healers -- 2nd best in the damn game, but still bad compared to clerics.<br>
<br>
Possibly druids are the wrong class to get death mitigation and healing abilities.  But, damnit, EQ needs more of both.<br>
<br>
And yes, this &quot;problem&quot; should shrink as you go to a more and more powerful guild.  More 2nd box clerics, more clerics recruited because they are the single largest raid bottleneck in the game, and the like mitigate this problem for groups.<br>
<br>
An alternative would be to increase group size, to spread the thin clerics over more ground.  =p<br>

Druids are already one of the best classes in the game: they have the best roots, best run buffs, insane dots, good nukes, DC, charm mobs, they do have GOOD heals. They have several good buffs, that give HP and even mana regen. They have nice DS.<br>
<br>
But now u want to even give them better heals?<br>

I have xp-ed with druids as mainhealer in Bot or in Hoh.<br>
They can do it there without really problems. Sure, you do need a decent tank. Druids can't heal fast enough with crappy tanks, like a cleric is still able too!!<br>
<br>
If druids can be mainhealer in such zones, i barely think, they need to improve further.<br>

But, I want more healers to group with.  I like grouping, even if the xp sucks.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of watching guildmates go LFG for days.  It should be &quot;grab a healer, a slower, a tank, and 3 damage dealers&quot; and go to town.  Right now it is:<br>
Grab a cleric, a tank, a slower, and 3 damage dealers<br>
OR grab 2 druids, a tank, a slower, 1 damage dealer, and a paladin<br>
OR grab 1 druid, a buff tank, a slower, 2 damage dealers, and a paladin<br>
OR drop the paladin and go to places where there are 5 other clerics in zone, or you can bring a 2 box cleric.<br>
OR hunt in areas with mobs trivial to an equivilent group with a cleric.<br>
<br>
2 druids can replace a cleric in a CHeal chain, using twice as many people, generating twice as much lag, and requiring twice as much loot and keys to gear up.  Oh baby, can we recruit more druids for their amazing raiding abilities!  20 rangers (chloro power!) can replace a cleric as well you know.<br>
<br>
The 2nd and 3rd best healers in the game are half as good as the best healer.  Every other healer is support compared to those 3.<br>
<br>
There are 3 classes who can rez, one twice as good (1.75 to 2.5 times less xp lost) as the others.<br>
<br>
Would it be balanced if wizards lost teleporting and snare, and had twice the DPS of any other class in the game?  No.<br>
<br>
The 3rd best haste class is 88% as good as the best haste class.<br>
The 8th best damage dealer is very close (66% to 75% I'd say) to the best damage dealer.  Who the best damage dealer is is a matter of arguement and situation!<br>
The 3rd best tank is competative with the best tank outside MT on raids.<br>
The 3rd best slower is 71%+ as good as the best slower (BST vs Shaman).<br>
<br>
The 2nd best healer is half as good as the best healer.  The 3rd best healer is between half and a quarter as good as the best healer.  The 4th best healer is a paladin.<br>
<br>
Like I said, you may hate druids, or think they have too much.  But, the game needs more classes with better healing.  And clerics need more width.<br>

You seem to group with the wrong Druids. If a druid in a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ELEMENTAR PLANE (Tier 4)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> exp group can keep the group alive, then there is NO healing problem with them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And clerics need more width.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And Druids need LESS width.<br>
<br>
Finally, this quote came direct from Absor who initiated with his post the whole discussion and i personally think, that SOE realizes that Druids are at the maximum level of versatily in all of their skills. Any more enhancements without giving up some of their power will result in an even moreso unbalancing 'godclass':<br>

But I don't see anything wrong with upping thier current Heal spells. They shouldn't be as powerful or as versitile as a clerics. But honestly, druids as main healers are not really that funtional. Yes, they can do it, but then generally, they are limited to that in a group. Often when raiding, we will assign the druids to bridge heal, or to keep certain players alive, like if we have only one cleric, or one enchanter. The druid, keeps them alive, so that they can keep everyone else alive. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure why wizards are against druids getting improvments on thier heal spells. <br>

I don't see where your coming from at all... From a VT/Tier3 PoP perspective the guild I am currently has maybe too much healing power. We use clerics, druids, shamans, rangers, paladins, beastlords as healers on raids. Yes, everyone who can heal heals when it is needed. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://people.ucsc.edu/~arice/pictures/zuratulisig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=utnayrduscratu>Utnayr Duscratu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heal Like a Cleric</span><hr size=1> The whole subject of druids not needing the upgrade to heals is not a matter of hatred.<br>
<br>
We aren't hating on you because you are the 2nd best healers in the game.<br>
We aren't hating on you because you are the only class that ports other than us.<br>
We aren't hating on you because you are in the top three nukers.<br>
We aren't hating on you because you are also one of the better buffers.<br>
We aren't hating on you because you are one of the best DoT'ers in the game.<br>
<br>
We, and I mean more than just wizards, think that druids simply don't need the increase in power.  You as druids are the 2nd or 3rd best at a large list of things, basically allowing you to fill several different roles in a group.  You may not do them as well, but you shouldn't be able to, otherwise you might as well break out the pencils, paper, and dice and start playing RIFTS.  It's the difference of one spell line that can turn the class from balanced to being a munchkin class.<br>
<br>
Druids already do have a bad rep with many wizards, I'll admit that.  But this isn't about wizards being annoyed by how good such a versatile class is at nuking and tp'ing, while those wizards don't think that the difference should be as small as they are for damage dealing.  I think I speak for most of the people here when I say all this.  I wouldn't care if they came up with a line of slows for druids if they weren't as good as the current slowing classes.  Druids just don't need better heals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=101&stop=102>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=930.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=930.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> -
