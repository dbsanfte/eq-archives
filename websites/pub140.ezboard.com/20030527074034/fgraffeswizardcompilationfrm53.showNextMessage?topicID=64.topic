 Plane of Valor and Halls of Honor access<br>
<br>
Okay, I see a lot of speculation going on here and I see a lot of questions regarding flags and quests to get you into these zones. As a particular interest to Paladins the planes of honor seems especially important for us. So, I did a little research and I'm posting information here for you all to use.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.<br>
<br>
Okay, first is the Flagging for Plane of Valor. This can be obtained through a trial in the Plane of Justice. Get a good group together head to the basement and find the quest giver; Mavuin. You will most likely have to kill a few mobs to get to him.<br>
<br>
Trial of Lashing<br>
<br>
Here is what I know, you have to kill some mobs and get to Mavuin before you can initiate a quest (which seems to similar to the Caller FG quest).<br>
<br>
[Thu Oct 24 00:56:27 2002] You say, 'Hail, Mavuin'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 00:56:28 2002] Mavuin strains his eyes to look up at you in disbelief, then reaches down into a rusted vent and pulls out a journal. 'Please I implore you, take word to the Tribunal. I have done nothing wrong, yet I have been sentenced to eternity in this cell. I wish to present all of the [information] about my case to them. They must listen to my plea if they are truly the gods of justice.'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 00:56:36 2002] You say, 'what information?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 00:56:36 2002] Mavuin tells you, 'I know it has been said for years before me, and will be said for years after me, but I was truly framed for my crime. You see the gods feared the knowledge that I carry with me. So to prevent me passing this knowledge to others, it was set up to show that I had plotted to murder one of the other elders. Please go before the tribunal and plead my case. If you do this I will share what I know with you, I apologize for holding it against you, but I am desperate to be released.'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 00:56:36 2002] You have received a character flag!<br>
<br>
Then we went to the Tribunal to talk to them about his case...<br>
<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:03:59 2002] You say, 'what about Mavuin?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:03:59 2002] The Tribunal tells you, 'So, mortal, you wish us to allow a prisioner to plead his case? What power do you think that you hold that we should field your interests? You must prove yourself in one of our trials before we will consider hearing this plea.'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:04 2002] You tell your party, 'got one here'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:18 2002] You say, 'how do I prove myself in one of your trials?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:19 2002] The Tribunal says 'The trials of the Tribunal are no easy affair. They will severely test your might and skill. Are you prepared for such an ordeal?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:27 2002] You say, 'I am prepared for such an ordeal'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:27 2002] The Tribunal nods slightly. 'Very well. When you are ready, you may begin the trial of lashing. You must protect the victims from their tormentors. Be wary of the scourge of honor - you cannot fight it directly. You must find and destroy its life force to defeat it. We shall judge the mark of your success.'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:35 2002] You tell your party, 'oh s***, u read that?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:44 2002] Koramyan tells the group, 'yeah'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:50 2002] You tell your party, 'be rdy ok?'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:56 2002] You say, 'I am ready for the trial of lashing'<br>
[Thu Oct 24 01:04:56 2002] The Tribunal says 'Then begin.'<br>
<br>
you can do any of the trials Lashing is just the example here. Execution seems to be the most popular and said to be the easiest. I tend to disagree with that. I think they are all pretty equal, but people just haven't taken the time to figure the others out.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Mavuin'<br>
<br>
Mavuin tells you, 'So you have pleaded my case to the Tribunal, I am most thankful. I hope that they will listen to my case soon and release me. The knowledge that I promised you is this. The followers in the Plane of Tranquility are trying to find information on what has happened to Zebuxoruk. What I know is that he has been captured for a second time. If you want to find out more information I believe you should seek an audience with Karana and Mithaniel Marr. I can only assume that they were present at the time of his capture and know why this has taken place. Also seek from Marr a way to translate the divine language. Only with it can you understand the writing of the gods. There is no more that I can tell you, but thank you once again for your attempt in returning my freedom.'<br>
<br>
wow, congratz, now you're PoV and PoS flagged. So enjoy PoV it's great xp. What? you say you want to move on? Well let's hope you have a strong guild that are all flagged for PoV because the crap is about to hit the fan.<br>
<br>
Plane of Valor (key to Halls of Honor) Walkthrough<br>
<br>
I'm tired of everyone doing things only for themselves, so here it is - my walkthrough through Planes of Valor to Aerin'Dar, the key mob for Halls of Honor. It is also my opinion that currently this expansion is geared towards people in VT gear only - aerin'dar is WAY harder than he should be, and I want people to see that for themselves.<br>
<br>
Find Johon Popoah and hail him twice. I forgot to get the dialogue for this. Then go see Paralin, and hail him. Both are in the tents near zone in.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'You're either [brave], or your [stupid].'<br>
You say, 'I am brave'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'That you are. Perhaps you'd be interested in helping our [company].'<br>
You say, 'I will help your company'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'We're a part of the Battalion of Marr. We're soldiers from Che Virtuson. We were dispatched to this part of the Plane of Valor to eliminate an age old target. Unfortunately, due to some recent events our mission has been placed on hold and our [squad] has been asked to remain behind.'<br>
You say, 'What squad?'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'We are apart of Ducee Tapferson. Our squad is known for our bravery. We were successful in capturing this [razorfiend] earlier today. You've shown some bravery as well my friend and that is the reason I request your [assistance].'<br>
You say, 'What about that razorfiend'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'These vile beasts live in the caves west of here.'<br>
You say, 'I will provide you with assistance'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'Many of us here are anxious to leave. Many wish to regroup with the rest of our company. Other wish to go back to the Halls to complete the [Trials].'<br>
You say, 'What trials?'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'The Trials are overseen by the Heroes of Marr. It's these Trials that allow us to rise in rank. Only those who have passed the trials are able to enter the Temple of Marr. Now if you wish to aid us I must ask you to do a few [things].'<br>
You say, 'What things?'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'You must find the Master Sergeant and tell him that you are here to aid the cause.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am here to aid the cause'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln looks you over and says in a deep voice 'What could you possibly do to aid our cause. Perhaps you think you can slay [Aerin`Dar] himself?' The Master Sergeant begins to laugh uncontrollably.' I suggest you go back to whoever filled your head with this nonsense and stop wasting my time.'<br>
You say, 'What is Aerin'dar'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I don't have time to explain the glass dragon to you. Leave before I get angry.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'I'm sorry the Master Sergeant was unable to help you. Perhaps you should [prove] yourself before you attempt to jump 'into the fire' so to speak.'<br>
You say, 'How shall I prove myself'<br>
Paralin Notion says 'We've been running into a lot of problems lately with the razorfiends and the planarian larvae. Many soldiers have been getting sick because of the infestations that they cause. Capture the hearts of a razorfiend, a crystalline spider and a planarian larvae and bring them back to me. Our squad had enough problems capturing this small razorfiend here. This will become your first so called 'Trial' Finnien. It should be enough to prove your worth.'<br>
<br>
Once you have collected the three hearts and turned them in...<br>
<br>
Paralin Notion looks at you with surprise. 'Very good my friend. You've definitely proven yourself. Find the Master Sergeant. He should be able to help you this time.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I heard what you did for Paralin Notion. That's quite a noble feat indeed. Perhaps we can use your help. However, you'll need to talk to the Captain first. Afterall, I can't have you walking in the [glass lair] without permission.'<br>
You say, 'What glass lair'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'It's the prison that [Aerin`Dar] has been encased in for many generations.'<br>
You say, 'What about Aerin'dar'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Aerin`Dar is the crystalline dragon who once roamed the Plane of Valor. During a severe rainstorm it was struck down to the very core of it's being. The mighty Aerin`Dar fell from the sky and landed in what is now known as the Glassy Wasteland. Planarian larvae began to infest it's body eventually turning it's pure heart to evil. Our [company] was dispatched to this region of Valor to eliminate the threat.'<br>
You say, 'What company'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'My squad of men are a part of Che Virtuson. However, we specifically are a part of Ducee Buled. We fall under the command of Captain Ryglot. Our [mission], for the time being, is simple. But we've run into some problems lately.'<br>
You say, 'What mission'<br>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Not to fast Finnien. You'll have to speak to the Captain about that. I'm not at liberty to divulge that information at this time. That information is classified. I can tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.' Aaramis laughs. 'Go to Captain Ryglot and he'll be able to fill you in with all the details.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I am very [busy] at the moment. Perhaps you should come back at another time Finnien.'<br>
You say, 'Why are you busy'<br>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I can't go into any great detail, but the Crystalline Globe was taken from our command structure. Its believed to have been separated into three pieces. Unfortunately, we're having a lot of trouble relocating it. Perhaps you'd like to [help].'<br>
You say, 'I will help'<br>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'That's good to hear Finnien. I wish we had more soldiers like yourself willing to help. I'm going to need you to locate the missing pieces of the globe and bring them back to me. After you've acquired the pieces perhaps you'd be able to rally enough people to lend us a hand with another [mission] objective we've been unable to fulfill do to our diminished numbers.'<br>
You say, 'What mission?'<br>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, I can't go into any details as to our main purpose is, but one of our missions was to exterminate the crystalline dragon. However, due to our company being split we are unable to go forward with this part of the operation. It has been placed on hold, pending the outcome of the [war].'<br>
You say, 'What war?'<br>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help rally some people together I may be able to release some more information to you.'<br>
<br>
One crystalline orb piece drops off of the Luminii Crawler, one drops off frogs near the bridgehouse, and one drops off of the skellies. Once the Captain recieves the three pieces of the orb, he gives you back the completed orb, which is the key to Aerin'Dar's lair.<br>
<br>
Aerin'Dar hits for approximately 1400, is slowable, and has an AE on a -150 MR check, that does 3k dd, and 45% melee slow. He also has nine mobs in his room that add as you fight him, and are level 63 and mezzable by the Sleep spell.<br>

There is a possible alternative way to enter the Halls of Honor, however the quest is not finished so it's unconfirmed. I'll post it here anyway and update it if information comes out regarding it's success.<br>
<br>
Another way to get into Halls of Honor<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
you say, 'Hail, Grenic Drere'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:21 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Mortals, this far into the planes? Something that I never thought that I would see. Regardless that does not help my situation any does it?'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] You say, 'what situation?'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Not that it is your business, but this is where I call home. I have lost track of the years that I have spent here. This valley is my home, for I was exiled from [Mithaniel's Temple]. It is not a story that I am proud of and do not wish to share with you. So be one with you.'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] You say, 'where is Mithaniel's Temple?'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Only a mortal would be as thick headed to know not when to take their leave. He and his legions call his temple The Halls of Honor. Paladins that have served him well on Norrath have the opportunity to ascend into his ranks. They are in training to make sure that they are always prepared to defend what they believe is the right and honorable thing to do. Mithaniel is an extremely proud being, and will accept any challenge that you may have to offer him. If you are willing to challenge him, I may have some [information] you will find useful.'<br>
'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:54 2002] You say, 'what information?'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:55 2002] Grenic Drere says 'There are other methods to enter the Halls of Honor than those that are readily apparent, and as a former soldier of Marr I can offer you access into the Halls; however as with all such arrangements there must be something [paid] for something earned.'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] You say, 'paid?'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] Grenic Drere says 'I was not the only member of my squad that was sent into exile, my brothers in arms, were the impetus for our exile. I was but a mere pawn. They now reside in the Plane of Justice as bodiless shades. Their punishment was too lax for their actions; I want their eternal souls to be mine. Find a smith who will teach you to create a box of souls, weaken the shades, then capture their souls and return all three to me.'<br>
Bork Darkanvil is Located in Plane of Knowledge, he resides at -388, 493 in a building in the middle area but ground level.<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:05 2002] You say, 'Hail, Borik Darkanvil'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:05 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Greetings, Borik Darkanvil, at your service. I was once a planar traveler like you. Those days are behind me, now I am content to earn my keep as a blacksmith, and to experiment with some of the [special recipes] that I have picked up in these outer planes.'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:14 2002] You say, 'do you know of the box of souls?'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:14 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Borik Darkanvil's eyes grow narrow. 'So looking to capture some souls are you? It's none of my business I suppose so don't answer. I'm pretty sure that I don't want to know. I paid heavily for the formula for the Box of Souls, but its not a price I would pass on to anyone else. There isn't much to it, but it does take the hands of a skilled smith and the magic of Tanaan's forges to event attempt it. First you will need a block of [Perilium].'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:25 2002] You say, 'what is a block of Perilium?'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:09:25 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'Perilium was once used to make clockwork machines, there are now stronger metals so it has become harder and harder to find Perilium, much less a block that is large enough to be of any use. Then you will need to find the brain of a crystal spider, this is where the actual soul will be held. Of course the box will need a supernatural power source, the souls are held into place by the horror of their own dreams, the heart of an agony mephit will give the device that power. Forge these with a smithing hammer and a vial of sacred water and you will have your box. Of course if you have not the skill, I can [forge them for you].'<br>
[[Sat Oct 26 18:10:56 2002] You say, 'forge them for me?'<br>
[Sat Oct 26 18:10:56 2002] Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum. I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail.<br>
<br>

In a prison Cell at a dead end near the portal to the trials area there is a spawn of 3 shades all named A Tormented Wraith. When killed the will have a random/rare respawn of a named shade that falls to the ground and is unmeleeable. There are 3 variations of this named:<br>
<br>
An Exiled Officer of Marr<br>
An Exiled Soldier of Marr<br>
An Exiled Trooper of Marr<br>
<br>
Hand you box to each in succession and you will receive:<br>
<br>
Soul Sphere<br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>
WT: 0.5 Size: TINY<br>
Class: None<br>
Race: None<br>
<br>
Don't worry about the Lore thing, they each identify differently, so even though they are named the same and Lore they are actually different items. They identify as such:<br>
<br>
Item Lore: You sense the soul resisting.<br>
Item Lore: You sense an angry presence.<br>
Item Lore: The soul seems calm within.<br>
<br>
After you get all 3 souls, you head back to PoV and talk to Grenic Drere and hand them in. He will say:<br>
<br>
[Wed Nov 20 16:24:14 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Hmm, this is minor vindication, but vindication nonetheless. I will never again fight with my old compatriots, but now I know the punishment of those responsible for my exile is fitting for their crime. We did have an agreement, and while stripped of my rank I still have my honor. This ring is what all Soldiers of Marr wear to enter the Halls of Honor, it serves no use for me any longer, it is yours now.'<br>
[Wed Nov 20 16:24:14 2002] You gain experience!!<br>

He will give you:<br>
