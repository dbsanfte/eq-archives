Well I was low on mana after getting resed back in and I snared the monsters tell I had a descent amount of mana.<br>
<br>
I looked at the group members holding the Jail section it was a Monk, Cleric and Shawmen all 55-60.  The monk was tank and the Shawmen was slowing and casting endless chain's of DD spells.<br>
<br>
Now I fought in the Jail before, but I always felt I did more damage to the mob than I now understand I can really do on a whole.  I would cast my rain spells and was doing great I thought I was on a role and the mob's hp were dropping much faster than before.  I was gleaming because I felt useful.<br>
<br>
Wondering how much damage he was doing compared to me, I turned on the 'Other Hit's filter so I could see his damage. It about made me cry when I saw this tank dealing blows at the rate of 3 per second each dealing on average 70 damage to as high as 126 with out the 298 critical's he was getting.<br>
<br>
I must say I always thought our class was in need of some twinking and tinkering, however I saw the light for the fist time. He was doing 3x the amount of damage I was doing and had no limit on mana, the cleric who was him as well was telling me how much mana he had. All the time the shawmen was chain casting that spell that takes hp and gives him mana, providing a endless supply of DD spell damage.<br>
<br>
I knew monks were high damage, and rogue's too.  But it's this light that has just reinforced why I am in my last two months of EverQuest(see my post in the Rant Forum)<br>
<br>
To a end I can see our strengths in PBAOE groups, and on large raids with bane spells.  But how is one to get there?  VI hates us soloing and quadkiting(the immune mobs in SOL stands as a testament to this) and a nerf is just waiting to come out of the wood work on this one I feel.  VI has not done it yet only because we would raise such a (no better word for this so sorry guys) fit that our bitching is probably the only thing keeping us from tossing Glitter and Frosting at monsters in vain attempts to deal damage.<br>
<br>
With this I leave tonight as a very disappointed and disillusioned wizard, be well guys! <p><p align= "center"> <table width="290"><td style='filter: glow(color=yellow'

You can get over it, I have and I'm not even depending on us being fixed anymore. I do however know we suck for dmg. In fact I sent in an email to the developers corner yesterday asking that they massively increase the grouping bonus so that less desireable classes get a look in. Right now its all about a couple of melees and a shaman - these 3 people groups earn xp twice as fast.<br>
<br>
Contrast that with Anarchy online where the full group bonus was 200% or something, and people always wanted you whatever your class, because even though the xp had to be spread further, you didn't have to add a huge amount to the group to be a worthwhile return on xp for them.<br>

Also gilnor keep in mind you are only lvl 56 while this monk is 60 with about 20 AA points, a lvl 60 wizard with 20 aa points (max fury) will regularly make 3230dmg nukes and 2400dmg nuke which make that monk wanna piss himself.<br>

<br>
Last night in ToV I got sick of a particular group taking all the exp on our pharm session.  So I just forewarned the healers in my group and pretty much singlehandedly ganked the next 4 or 5 pulls.  Sure I was OOM after that, but the choruses of ooos and aaas from the raid at the crits and the cheers from the group made up for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You know the door is open for you to raid with your old friends if you want to hang with us from time to time.  We've got LOTS of wizzie firepower these days and I'm sure if you get the chance you'll see what I mean.  At some point or another we've all been where you are right now.  You'll get through it.  It's hard to justify things by saying &quot;just wait through another 4 levels and a bunch of alt exp,&quot; but the light is there to see at the end of the tunnel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umadleon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madleon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Queen of the <a href=http://www.drow.org/terms.html>SLRs</a>!</span><br>  Posts: 1068<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 10:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> I think u looking at it wrong Glin. In an XP group it's not the wizards responsibility to be the guy who carries the group. First, your damage output is based on your level. If you were level 60 you'd be doing a 1200 nuke for 300 mana instead of a 600. Your damage putput would be much more noticeable because of this. But still, in an XP group I think the wizard is there more for backup than anything. If you get an add, the wizard can bury the first one faster than any other class, letting the tank switch over quickly. As well as snaring, evacs, root parking, spell shielding, etc we have our uses. Yes, we're not a REQUIRED class and thats why can't always get a group but hey, how many other classes can quad kite? Quad kiting and PBAE groups is what saved me from the frustration of grouping. <br>
<br>
As well, getting a clickable nuke item will help you greatly. Velks robe is a good example of that, you can always contribute decent damage regardless of how much mana you have. <br>
<br>
Another thing is mana. People still bitch but from where I'm sitting, the medding problem has been somewhat fixed (not completely, focus items ARE needed). With c3 readily available now, for groups and soloing (get one at the end of your raid, theri duration will last a full xp night sometimes) I med twice as fast as I did before. Mind you, 60 familiar/epic helps alot too.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uyain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 11:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> Aye, What a lot of wizards have been pointing out for a very long time.<br>
 The items in game unfortuantly that will do the same for wiz<br>

The avaibility of these items have been a sore point among many a wiz.<br>
 To be efficient in a exp group, we or liminted to grouping with either a chanter or bard.<br>
 With all that said it dose get better when we hit 60. but you will never out damage in the long run a well equiped warrior, monk or rogue in an exp grind group.<br>

And here I am sitting there, wondering if I should tell them that with my epic, familiar, Kaodics, FT items, and so forth, being one of the best equipped wizards on my server, with loot from NToV and all three Velious kings and so forth, will only hold steady at 30 DPS.  I kinda do want to tell them that our damage output is bad... to laugh at the SK's and Paladins who wine that they're only getting 70 DPS in exp groups and that warriors have too much of an advantage over them, to roll my eyes that the rogues are upset because the best equipped rogue is only doing 137 DPS compared to a monk's 125 DPS... but will they ever invite me for a group again if they found that out?<br>
<br>
But here's the problem.  If you jack up either our spell damage or mana regen to close the gap, we'd simply become FAR too overpowered in raid situations.  That, plus wizards can almost hold even with melee exp if they quad kite, and maybe go a bit faster if they AE.  But if you keep it the way things are, wizards will continue to get shunned from groups, because our only real role is to do damage, which we ain't doing.  And quad kiting hour after hour gets very boring.<br>
<br>
The sad part is, our DPS increases by about 50% with the Velk robe, and almost 100% with the VP robe.  It's come to the point where a VP robe is almost required to fill your role in an exp group.  It was all good and stuff up until 50, things were overall balanced (in a non-twinked environment, but that's a whole other issue), but the gap got insane as you head towards 60.  And there's really not much you can do to balance it at this point, it just got that out of hand, and will totally mess with the balance of the &quot;end game&quot;.  Because you can't really compare our damage output on raids, because we can store up damage for a big fight, but be pretty worthless for 10 minutes after when it doesn't matter.  Melee damage is pretty constant on the other hand.  Big advantage to us on raids, but big big disadvantage in exp groups.<br>
<br>
Looking back at 46-60, I spent a significant amount of my time soloing, or duoing with my close shaman friend.  Relying on pickup groups lead me to retire my wizard for a month or two, and my chanter shot up in levels... only raiding with a couple close friends held my interest on my wizard, until I finially hit 60 and got to spend almost all my time raiding.  Most of the wizards I know spent most of their time quad kiting to 60, not because they wanted to, but as a lack of options.  Those that didn't, got PL'ed by their level 60 melee and cleric friends during free time.<br>
<br>
In the end, you play the game to have fun.  I simply didn't have fun exp grinding, it's just not fun to sit there LFG for hours, and on those occasions where friends do get you in a group, feeling guilty that you can't even do what your class is supposed to do.  Yeah, I know, we can be valuable by a well timed root on an overpull, or absorbing some minor damage, but in the end, I often felt a tad lacking.  Raids, on the other hand, are fun, and are what keeps me playing the game.  Too bad I feel like it was a chore for all those months post-50 actually getting to 60.  But once I got there, I'm having the time of my life.  And then they had to go and add AA. =/<br>
<br>
I do like my wizard, after all, I'm still playing him, and am enjoying it now.  I just wish I knew about the grouping situation we would undergo when I first started him, the day I bought the game.  Sure, I am the master of magical damage... on raids.  How often does your common, everyday player spend raiding boss mobs?  I guess that's why most of my wizard friends pretty much hit a dead end at the low 50's, and now have warriors and monks shooting up in levels like mad.<br>
<br>
We're a raiding class, period.  We just have to face up to that fact.<br>
<br>

They are a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoy playing both my Wizard and my Monk. Let the Ebayers go to Legends, good riddance to 'em. I could care less about Legends, it doesn't phase me in the least because I know that once a good game comes I am there. I have a pretty keen eye for good games, and I have not jumped on AO, DAoC, or the others.<br>
<br>
But I will say that WoW is looking promising, and I cannot wait to see what Blizzard can come up with. The good (and bad) part is that they will take a long time building the game to make sure it is done right.<br>
<br>
But only we can be the judge of that...<br>

<br>
I've been doing logs for my guild and I just don't see anything wrong.  <br>
<br>
Some interesting things I found when doing logs.<br>
<br>
Rains deal alot of damage!  <br>
Clarity 2 is our friend!<br>
Rogues and Monks indeed do alot of damage more so with discs and Rangers... YES, RANGERS are up there as well.  Paladins can take alot of damage.<br>
A 60 warrior will not outdamage a 60 wizard, more so with Clarity 2.  <br>
<br>
We can supply sustainable damage during regular groupings if we have C2 or any form of mana regen.  Without C2, we are as good as a melee wielding Fine Steel.<br>
<br>
As a class, the wizards are not gods but by no means are we useless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br>  Posts: 655<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 12:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> In an experience group, it's all about mana regen for a wizard. I've all but proven than wizards need a boost to their sustainable damage output in order to be able to hold their own in an experience group (for those new to the research, here's the link: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~dmoen/wizdps.htm">home.attbi.com/~dmoen/wizdps.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ). It basically demonstrates that a wizard's sustainable damage output without a right click nuke lags behind all three of the melee specialists (rogue, monk, and warrior) at all levels. A wizard with a right click nuke does a bit better, eclipsing the warrior from 49-51, and again pre-60 when he/she acquires a Velk robe, but at 60, even with a Rend Robe (our best right click nuke) we lag behind the damage output of all 3 tanks, even warriors.<br>
<br>
Wizards do have the ability to dump mana to bring down selected foes quickly, and we have a few utility spells (snare, stun, root, evac) which give a bit more depth and utility to the wizard class. Some even claim that our sustained damage output should not reach that of even warriors, but I feel that claim is absurd. Currently, a wizard without a right click nuke does approximately half the damage of a well equipped rogue for most of his career (and for the middle ages of level 20-40 it's even worse).<br>
<br>
My proposal was to add more right click nukes and to reduce casting costs of DDs by 25% across the board. To see the effect that this simple change would have, see: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~dmoen/fixwiz.htm">home.attbi.com/~dmoen/fixwiz.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> . Wizards without items would track warriors fairly closely, while wizards with items would track monks pretty well (with rogues remaining the damage kings, which is as it should be).<br>
<br>
Verant has seen my research, and the proposal has been read by the live team. Unfortunately, balance is a difficult task, and even if wizards are fairly easy to balance, Verant would not want to put in a wizard fix without adressing mages, enchanters, and necromancers at the same time. Look at it this way: if Verant put in a patch that provided a substantial boost to Mage damage output without addressing Wizards, this board would erupt into constant flame wars. As the other classes have more utility, Verant really needs to answer the hard balance questions before they can provide even the simplest and most obvious fixes for Wizards.<br>
<br>
There will be a boost given to Wizards, but it will take time.<br>
<br>
