Worry etched accross her face as she practically flew down the series of hallways and up a set of stairs to breathlessly barge into the empty bunk room that had once been occupied by one of her closest mentors and friends. The room was now devoid of all decorations and stood dark and forboding.  &quot; Illuminatum &quot;, She gave the command she had learned for lighting this very special room.  Nothing happened.   &quot;Illuminatum&quot;, she stated again, her voice quivering with ugency. Again nothing.  She started back towards the door when something crunched under her stubby bare feet.  Her night vision could just make out that it was a bug.  A rather large bug too for it left quite the mess on the cold stone floor.  She reached out her hand for the torch that was ensconced near the door.  She needed more light however, to make out the walls that were beginning to move of their own accord.  Her hand wrapped around the smooth ronium shaft of the torch. Her stubby fingers stretching accross it's engraved surface. She began to pull the torch from the holder when a large beetle fell from the ceiling and landed square on her arm and skittered up to her wrist and burried it's mandables into her soft skin. She leapt back clutching her hand to her chest and the torch that had been enchanted to light when it was removed from the wall flared to life as it tumbled dumbly to the floor. Having no warm flesh to maintain it's fire, the torch started to flicker out.  In the remaining few seconds of light, Malfi could make out what it was on the walls.  Bugs, hundreds of thousands of them covering the walls,  the ceiling, and the floor.  They had scattered as the torch clanked to the floor, but were closing in over it. The light extinguished having no touch to caress it to life.  She could feel them on her crawling over her skin now biting at her ankles. She lifted her hand to reach for the doorknob. It came off in her hand and became a large bug.  The swarm over took her as she let out a blood curdling scream.  They invaded her mouth and choked her to silence. She clutched at her throat, vomiting up bugs and bug parts, before falling numbly to the stone floor.  The high pitched cries of the swarms victory as the bugs began eating her body was the last thing she heard. <br>
       Almalfia awoke with a start. Beads of sweat formed accross her brow. She was shaken to her core. The same dream had been haunting her ever since her coronation into the High Priestesshood, and her subsequential trip to the Oracle.  Perhaps, it was tied to the message that the Oracle had held for her once she had made the long painstaking pilgrimage to the isolated island in the Ocean of Tears. The Oracles cryptic words still weighed heavily on her heart.  Since that trip, Malfi had a whole new outlook as to why that body of water was penned with such a poetic name.  Her mind raced over every detail of her nightmareish vision before it could slip away back into the corners of her dwarven brain.  Analyzing every detail. Searching for meaning.  Yet, it escaped her like a briar rabbit in a farmers field.  Her heart ached as she recalled the emptyness she felt when she entered that room.  Then, turning her head as if trying to avoid the vision that played out behind her eyelids. What, if anything did this dream mean?  <br>
     Gathering her belongings about her, Almalfia buckled her boots and headed out to the stables where her Drogmar was being kept. A young woodelf stablehand eyed her approach and had nearly finished saddleing and reining her mount when she entered the stall.  She smiled silent approval upon the young spuire as she swung her leg over the back of large black beast.  &quot;Shall I await your return m'laydee? Or, is this an extended journey?&quot; The subtle hint of curiosity creeping into the youths voice belied his innocent almond shaped eyes.<br>
&quot; Extended lad.&quot; Malfi's voice cracked as she spurried her steed out of the stall.  It was then that the squire noticed the extra baggage that was being saddled on the drogmar at the gate.  Puzzled, the young man went about cleaning the stalls and going about his duties in the usual elven way.<br>
      Malfi finished loading her beast down and made her way down the cobbled road.  She road to the crest of the horizon before turning back to take in the gleaming splendor that was the guildhall. Then turning once more she rode over the hill and off into the wilderness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=102.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
