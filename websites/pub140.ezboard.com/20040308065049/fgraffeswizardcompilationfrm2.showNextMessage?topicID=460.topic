Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> OK, word on this quest is getting out - I see more and more Druids doing the Druid version every day - but it should stay in game long enough for some of you guys to make a few plat and some nice easy levels.<br>
<br>
This quest has been out for a while - but it works best for TPers like Wizards and Druids.<br>
<br>
OK, first of all, you will need the faction to get into Kelethin (you DEs will have a longer route to take, but it is still doable - I'll get to that later.)<br>
<br>
Find Innkeep Wuleran. To do this, get to the Newbie lift (not the POD lift) and take the wood ramp up to the next level on the right of the platform the lift takes you too. Run across this platform to the Inn and Wuleran is inside. The Forge is on this same platform. Wuleran is where you will be finishing the quest. It helps to know where he is to start off.<br>
<br>
Now, TP to North Karana and run over the Stone Bridge into South Karana. When you zone, hoof it over to the Centaur Village at loc +200, -2250 or near there. Basically, head off to the left from the Stone Bridge at about a 30 degree angle off the water - you should run into the village.<br>
<br>
Find Jarlen Meadowgreen - he is a brother of the Centaurs that offer the Crafted Armor Quests and can usually be found in the same stable. If he is not there, try by the fire pit in the center of the village. <br>
<br>
You don't have to say anything (but I guess you could if you wanted to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Just hand him 2 GP and he will give you a Bag of Bread Loaves (Lore, No Drop).<br>
<br>
Now, if you are a GOOD character, bind here, in the stable, right next to Jarlen. <br>
<br>
Then, TP off to Greater Faydark and run back to Kelethin and hand over the bread to Innkeep Wuleran. Bingo! Killer EXP and 1 to 3 PP!!<br>
<br>
I started this quest at lv 23 and will make level 29 in less than an hour tonight (one bub to go). At level 28, I am still getting almost a half a blue per trip and have made well over 500 PP delivering bread! So, doing the Math, <br>
<br>
in level 28, I get a Yellow bub in about 12 trips. At 1.5 mins a trip, thats a bub every 18 to 20 mins. Add time to Med (get a Breeze or Clarity - really helps!) and you will make lv 28 to 29 in about 2 and a half hours and pick up about 100 PP in the process.<br>
<br>
Now, figuring you start at level 20, you will make about 1KP<br>
and level to 29 in less than 15 hours play I believe.<br>
<br>
Of course, much of this Math is dependant on your Mana situation and Sow. But it is still nice cash and exp.<br>
<br>
For EVIL characters, you should bind in Feerott next to Innkeep Gub, who can be found near the Oggok Entrance. To repeat the quest, you will have to TP to NK, and run back to SK and Jarlen Meadowgreen. Druids can do the same as Wizards (starting at level 19 for them), bind next to Jarlen BUT TP to Feerott to give the bread to Gub.<br>
<br>
I have almost made 29, and may do this quest to 30 if the exp is still good enough. <br>
<br>
Have fun people!<br>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> Yeah - I thought about that, but each level I would spend some time getting my spell skills maxed out - as such I rarely fizzle. <br>
<br>
I guess my defensive skills have suffered a bit, but, lets face it, if you are getting wailed on after level 30, chances are you are gonna die anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Wizards are not really known for their tanking abilities.<br>
<br>
I did really think about the consequences of non-combat leveling - but I don't think I have suffered so much that my character is unplayable. My casting skills are still almost maxed. I think the only place I have an issue is in the direct combat (i.e., Melee) skills - but I have not Melee'd a mob in ages. I have not carried a weapon since level 12 - when I got my Solist's Icy Wand.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I'm sure most people know the issues with fast leveling and the loss of skills - but the decision is theirs and I don't think there is such a big issue for someone who is aware of these issues. Like I said, I have not suffered in the Casting Skills - just the Melee.<br>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> Actually if you want to do this even faster there is an innkeeper in NK that you can turn the bread in too.  He is in the Inn near the gypsy camp.  I haven't tried this going to Kelethin so I don't know if the experience is better.<br>
<br>
As far as getting skills up.....<br>
<br>
The only skills that go up slow are defense and dodge.  The rest of the casting skills should max out just by fighting through one bubble of orange.  You absolutely have to get defense and dodge maxed each level or you are screwed hard.  It makes a difference.  Having said that, I see no reason why you couldn't do this and still have a perfectly viable character if you do it correctly.<br>
<br>
Although the time it takes you to cast spells over and over in each of the casting areas to max your skills will probably come closer to the actual time it takes to just level up by fighting.<br>
<br>
If you want to level without fighting you will need a magician and a healer type who are your very good friends because they will get bored.<br>
<br>
Ideally you would do this after each level but theoretically you could wait till you had gained two or three levels.<br>
<br>
In order to get defense and dodge up duel a mage pet, make sure its blue to you and have the mage use earth.  Have your friendly healer standing by to heal you or if no healer just have the mage back his pet off before you die and bind yourself back up to half.<br>
<br>
In order to get your spells skills up pick a low level spell in the area you want to raise and cast it over and over again.  Preferably spells you can cast on yourself.  Clarity helps alot when doing this.  For evocation just nuke yourself with low level spells and bind when you get low or have your healer friend do his thing.<br>
<br>
That is how to do it if you are dead set on doing it that way.  I have done this with a massively power leveled cleric and it worked just fine all his skills were maxed at 40 including defense and dodge... BUT IT WAS BORING AS HELL.<br>
<br>
In my opinion this is a great supplemental source of experience (like when you only have an hour or so to play or just need that last couple of blues to level and can't find a group) but it is way more fun getting levels the old fashioned way.<br>
<br>
<br>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> OK, so, the general consensus is this is a lousy way to play - And, I somewhat agree (It felt like cheating to tell the truth).<br>
<br>
My defense skill has suffered, and so has my dodge skill (although it is now up to 40 and I have not died yet through Melee).<br>
<br>
If I ever Melee, it is while in a group and I goof up and taunt the Mob on to myself. When Soloing, Melee is almost non-existant for me. My Root works just fine, Bonds of Force is a great addition to my spell book. If I pick my fights carefully, my opponent is always at max spell range. Those times I have been getting hit, I have channeled my way through with a Root (Chanelling is at 147). <br>
<br>
So, basically, I appreciate all your comments - but I don't think I will be starting Whammy all over again. He plays just as well as my Necro who has fought his way to lv 45 and never powerleveled even a bubble.<br>
<br>
We'll see if, in later life, Whammy has any problems - but right now, I don't see them. <br>
<br>
The main reason for doing this quest to gain exp was that I hate Lake of Ill Omen - I did my 20s there with Vermil (my Necro) and can't stand Kunark anymore. I am dreading going back with Whammy for his 35-45 stint (it IS a good exp spot, but the scenery sucks and I do not like the mobs there).<br>
<br>
Also, in my opinion, play is more fun after level 30 - the 20s just plain suck if you ask me - too low to go anywhere cool, and no Quests worth doing really. <br>
<br>
I also don't have hours and hours on my hands when I can play EQ constantly - getting into groups is hard because I can only stay for an hour - maybe less if the kids wake up.<br>
<br>
I only leveled 6 levels (i think) doing this quest - so I don't think I am  too screwed - if at all. <br>
<br>
I still recommend this quest if you just want to get past a certain point (like I did) or make some fast cash (2 gp to 2 pp in 90 seconds is not a bad turnaround)<br>
<br>
Anyway, everyone knows the drawbacks of non-combat leveling now (as can easilly be seen from the numerous posts here) but I don't think there would be any real harm done if you were smart about it.  <p>Vermil Darkmire<BR>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> I have a friend who plays a mage and one night we were both waiting for rezzes and compared our innate (no gear) stats. I was two levels higher than him at the time, I was 43 and he was 41. Comparing where we put points to start, stuff like that. <br>
<br>
I forget the exact numbers but my AC was about 30 or 40 points higher than his. As a mage he always had a pet to taunt mobs off of him so he almost never got hit more than once or twice. I on the other hand took my fair share of beatings as I leveled up.<br>
<br>
His attack was even worse, reflecting his offense skill. Again, he would never bother with melee since he had his pet to do it. When I was OOM in a group, or fighting mobs that resited my spells, I broke out my dagger or staff and went mano y mano. As a mage, he could let his pet melee and med up. <br>
<br>
This is not a knock on Mages, its just that as a pet class their pet does more tanking then them so their skills can suffer if they don't pay attention to them. <br>
<br>
I dont think I would ever use a EXP quest to level up, I would not want my skills to suffer. Yes I do quests that give me EXP, but I don't repeat them over and over to level.  The same can be said about powerleveling. Its fine to some point, but in the long run your skills will suffer. <br>

<br>
There is absolutely no point nuking yourself to practice evocation unless you want to specifically practice bind. Just find someone's pet and tell them you will be nuking it; the spell can't affect the pet (unless you're dueling or PvP) and your points will still raise even if it has no effect.<br>

You can also do it to players... but they get sick of the spam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Rather than casting on yourself a lvl 1 spell, find a corpse. The skill goes up, and no one gets spammed. You don't need a pet or anything. If it's a mob corpse it'll rot after a while, but player corpses remain.<br>

<br>
I'm an agnostic Erudite wiz, and so i was apprehensive to guards and merchants in gfay. Unfortunately, I like to do my banking there, inlcuding the selling of my loot, but I hated getting bad prices for all my stuff.<br>
<br>
Well, this quest gives you 4 positive factions:<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with KelethinMerchants got better.<br>
Your faction standing with FaydarksChampions got better.<br>
Your faction standing with EmeraldWarriors got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Anti-Mage got better.<br>
<br>
<br>
For me this was a big plus, in about 6 trips the merchants were indifferent, another 30 they turned aimably, and about 60 trips total the guards turned indifferent.<br>
<br>
This quest is worth doing a few times if you want your gfay merchant faction to be nice and high.<br>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> I hate to burst any bubbles here, but I totally disagree with the defensive skills crowd.<br>
<br>
I did a lot of PL'ing myself and have an incredibly poor offense and defense melee wise.  Now, my evoc is 235, my spec in evoc is 200'ish, etc.  But melee wise, Spankda sucks big time.<br>
<br>
I never, ever, ever, ever melee.  As far as dying from close contact hits -- extremely rare.  So rare, in fact, that it's not even a consideration.  I am not a melee and will never be.<br>
<br>
For really green stuff, they never hit me anyway.  For higher greens that hit, I channel though a lot.  For higher stuff, I'm more careful as I think anyone would be.<br>
<br>
I have a horrible offense and I'm actually glad of it.  I can safely duel a level 20 guy in the Arena of Qeynos with my The Overthere gating hammer and not worry about doing any damage before the hammer procs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utiberinusmaximus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiberinus Maximus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/24/01 6:27 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got lv 20?

I'm a Dark Elf but would really like to be able to bank in Kelethin when buying/selling in GFay...  I couldn't think of any way to raise Kelethin faction without hurting faction in my home city...  i.e. mass AE in Crushbone...<br>

Wanna make lv 29 and not kill a thing?</span><hr size=1> I really can't believe any of you would actually forgoe this quest due to lacking offense and defense skills. That's just insane!  Do you really think that a powerleveled wizard who has 50 less AC due to underdeveloped defense skills is really going to make him any less effective than a non-powerleveled wizard?  Seriously, you've just got to think about what you are saying.  My level 59 wizard (who was NOT powerleveled by the way) has roughly equivelent AC as my level 21 bard, which is about 550 AC.  Tanks that actually are my level have well over 1000 AC.  So you tell me, when tanks at my level have 1000+ AC to keep up with the mobs they would be fighting, do you really think it would matter if instead of 550 AC as I have now, I had 500AC instead?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
Secondly, offense?  That's worth even less.  What's the usefulness of this?  Whacking a noobie mob?  I have maxxed 1HB ay 110, and maxxed offense, and even still, I am lucky if I can land a blow on your typical sebilis mobs.<br>
<br>
Offense and defense are melee skills primarily, don't overly concern yourself with them.<br>
<br>
And of course, raising evocation is a non-issue.  Just chain cast that level 1 nuke.  Honestly, I don't see any substancial reason not to powerlevel your wizzy.<br>

Which is let's say a 1% better chance of NOT getting hit.  If you don't figure in the loss of DODGE skills.  If you're the primary evaccer, wouldn't it be nice to have even a 1% better chance of getting of that evac spell?  Or that final IC?<br>
I dont' care if it's 50 Ac or 500 AC, combined with dodge, I'm all for having a better chance of survival if a MOB is on me <p><br>Aniar Orrenson

Seriously, there is no reason not to do this because of defense skills. I am a caster, If I am saposed to have high melee/defense skills then more is screwed up in verants head then I thought. I rather do this quest over and over and gain faction/money/ex rather than going out struggleing and dieing over and over because I can't solo or get groups anywhere because the only area I can is full of reds so none of my spells stick. Pretty sure I'm going to stop at 24 and get into a HK group then when I can actually get spells to land. I just wish there was a faster way to get to the Cent camp *useing oggok method*. Also, is the oggok meathod less ex or something? I'v been getting about half a blue per quest at 20. Thats still pretty good but this guy makes it out to look like alot more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tsurok>Tsurok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/7/01 9:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Got lv 20?

I was maybe getting 1/10th  of a blue bubble per hand-in.  Nice faction hits, though.  <br>
<br>
I guess the other route gives much better experience.  As a DE, I wish I could do that one, if only for the faction.<br>

Its a lot easier to get faction up for Qeynos for us DEs.<br>
