Many of us started Wizards so we could have fun with the biggest single-shot damage spells in the game.  DPM efficiency is nice for grinding through XP, but that is not where the 'fun' is in this game.  The 'fun' for many of us is when you have the chance to show your class-specific skill to others in such a manner that they drop their jaw for a moment.<br>
<br>
Just because something makes it easier for you to level, that does not mean it's better.  It might be better for gaining levels/AAxp more quickly, but is it truly better for having fun?  Having fun, after all, is what this game is all about.  If all you want is to level as quickly as possible, you are missing the whole point.  Everquest has become a chore and you have yet to realize it.  I play it to have fun.  Nukes with larger amounts of damage and lower DPM ratios are fun.  I'd like to see them put more of these into the game, post level 50.  They are an easy way to add more fun to the game without adding more power to the class and upsetting the balance.<br>

Not via manaburn, but by big nukes.<br>
<br>
Trak has 32 k hps.<br>
<br>
Land 20 2 k nukes on trak, and you win.<br>
<br>
Land 10 4 k nukes on trak, and you win.<br>
<br>
Land 5 8 k nukes on trak, and you win.<br>
<br>
Of course, melee-range restrictions on nukes, resist debuffing, etc, all make the above hard.<br>
<br>
A nuke half the size can't pull off the MB effect, even if it is twice as fast and as efficient.  Meanwhile, in less extreme examples, that smaller nuke is just as good for the wizard.<br>
<br>
Hence, smaller faster casting nukes.<br>
<br>
Rains require a stationary mob, and time, to be useful.  Hence, rains can and should be better than nukes.<br>

That's an interesting perspective, Qaman, perhaps you could explain to me how you can draw a parallel between what I said and wanting Death Touch at level 65.  Wanting a less damaging than AE rain, but bigger blast at level 55 = wanting all power?

I have all our nukes in my spell book (preLoY), yes... SS, GSS, SoS, SoM, AT, EER... all the big BOOMS. Now, 95% of my gaming time I am raiding... usually in ele planes unless we're reflagging people. And, 90% of that time I use ADoI, ISoS, DoR. Whole this &quot;I need big nukes&quot; thing (especially in wake of some mage spell) has been blown out of proportion, imo.<br>
<br>
Then... what even more surprises me is the &quot;We need 1600-2500 damage cold nuke&quot; coalition... WHAT FOR? Chaining ADoI/ISoS/DoE is great damage in short time and less prone to interruptions. Even without ADoI it is doable. And not to mention manaefficiency on that chain... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yeh, the one thing I could agree on some level is &quot;We used to hit HUGE chunk out of mobs and now we only hit sliver&quot;... but... 1st level melees with their guild given weapons can hit for 50% of mob's HP. Do you see them claiming they should do that 50% of mobHP per swing at 65? No. For a reason. Even our own nukes do about 50% of mobHP at level 1 (or was it 33%). Anyway... if we always got nukes that did say 33% of mobs HP... what kind of zergling armies we would see of mobs? As an advocate for AE-type stuff, I'd love such amounts of mobs... but if I want that kind of &quot;power&quot; I'll load up Quake or some other FPS.<br>

Because they aren't even close to the same. There are a *lot* of downsides to rain spells and a *lot* of situations where they are not useful at all. By just saying but it does more damage, you are ignoring everything else about the spell. So if we are going to ignore everything about spells except damage, I want AE DT. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I also disagree too for the poster who said you can't play a class. No one actually is forced to play as others think they should. You play for fun, and anyway you like it. Well of course you should play efficiently when it comes to grouping.<br>
<br>
Now, about big nukes. It simply impress people and thats it. I am a 63 wizard with 106AA. And of all my career being a wizard, I never solod. Surprised? No since soloing sux, boring and if I have to solo, then I go play another single player game which is more entertaining. About big nukes, I am one of the 2 wizards in my guild and I do not own AT, GSS and EER (though will probably soon once I get hold of those runes for research). We are allianced with another guild who has 3 wizards, which 2 of them are 65 and have access to AT. Sure their nukes are big, and I see 5k crits all the time. I think they got drought of E'ci aswell. I have sunstrike, but guess what? I never use it any more except just for finishing off some gating mob which requires fast killing in very short time. ( but still rarely use it since I got drought of thunder)<br>
<br>
What I am using is Isos, and DoR all the time. Maybe Drought of Thunder for those annoying Cleric mobs and gating mobs to prevent them from casting. I own a haste staff (from the mech dragon in PoI forgot name... too bad its 2hb <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and I cast DoR in 2.5sec, Isos in 3.1 sec. I am chain casting these 2 spells constantly and I get more crits than any other wizards in the alliance guild. I own the highest DPS! Yes you heard me highest! All guild rogues wields ssra, pop, Ntov, primal weapons with access to best haste and haste gear. Rangers have AM3 etc blah blah and such. <br>
But I still can out damage them with my crappy gear. Compared with 2 wizards owning AT. I outdamaged them by 3 times. I rarely get summoned due to concussion. DoR and Isos price are a joke, seen them going as low as 1k for DoR and Isos... uh well those are actually been given out.<br>
<br>
My gear? Well I got FT2 from gear. Most of them comes from my AA points. Imp fam, epic, mc3. My mana pool is about 3800 according to magelo, nothing surprising and most of my gear are very much obtainable. My arms are from ME, I think toilers. The head... ug yes its from PoF (laugh), the bracer, Ear and neck are from JC. The pants is from UP. Boots is from ToV, and its not actually that good. I use it for mana. Potc ear, well you can get all the compo for around 6k these days. Just buying each pieces when i got cash. 2ndary item is the quest in WL. Can be done solo AND in 1 day. And its very nice. The only, and I repeat the only RAID item I got is the CT robe, the sash which is from Acrylia Caverns and the ring which is the emp key. (well I call it farming but oh well) <br>
<br>
I share the pain that you cannot find groups. But I see this problem is not the wizards part but its because from other people's prespective of viewing the wizards. Most people in this board (appart from the fact that they are being a wizard) knows the value of a wizard. Also I believe the friends and guildies that they are grouping also knows how potential a wizard can be. But some people doesn't see it that way. Maybe because they saw a wizard use large nuke ( pre 60s and post 49) and med nearly all the time. I have seen those types of wizards myself. Also I have seen the same thing in the guild too. Yesterday Velketor was up. And I called out the guild that he was up and maybe we can take him down ( so that I had a chance for my conflag robe which i think its still usefull to have a non mana cost DD ). My guild agreed, but the alliance guild did not. They said that he drops nothing good except 1 item ( which i presume was a melee gear ) and they had planned to go to Sleepers Tomb after taking down King Tormax, Statue and Idol. Was shocked myself how little value they put to casters. Maybe they didn't know about the gear they drop is usefull to the casters ( yes not only wizards, mage drop is good aswell i recall drops a clicable DD boots )<br>
but I kept my mouth shut. We alliance have gone too far and I did not want to put our relation into vain just for me being unreasonable to the other guild bacause of one mob. ( and yes I do NOT own the ST key. Hell I am not even in the list of obtaining the key... + the wizards are on the bottom of the list )<br>
<br>
I believe my guild + alliance guild simply sees the casters as extra damage imput. And /chucle I think thats why they could take down Grummus but not Aerin'Dar. You see, in PoP you require more caster power than melee. Simply to end the fight faster. Yes melee, rogue and even rangers can have a high dps, but not as high as a caster. You cannot relly alot from the cleric heals because of how the mob hit SO hard in pop and to MULTIPLE people that eighther the attackers die fast, or ma dies because of out of mana. I have seen this. I have been temporarely in a very strong Euro guild. They had alot of mages, wizards and I have seen the burst power that we casters can provide. I came back to my old guild due to RL issues and I was forced to be casual player. And saw the difference. <br>
<br>
Ugh... why my post become so long? Anyway to the first poster, try grouping with your guild more. If you are not then try joining one. Family type guild is a good start. Many of my guildies makes alt but they never make a caster type ( due to its... poor starting compared to a twink melee ). Almost all my alts are casters, except a coupel which are 59war 53 sham and 53 cleric. I enjoy playing the mage, alot. Ugh... chanters are so hard to play heh and so hard to exp soloing. ( charm solo ugh.. the horror ) Casters are not broke, not to mention wizards are not broke. Now that the new research has been introduced, you have more chance of getting those ever wanted GSS, EER and other spells you ever dreamed of. Have faith in your class that you rolled. And uh, never compare EQ casters with another RPG. They are totally different. Then again EQ is hardly an RPG anyway :P<br>

You can take your &quot;easier&quot; and shove it right up your ass.  It was our work and determination in sticking with the class we love, without turning into whiny ass kunark rangers or paladins, that got you all of your toys.  Countless hours of discussions on graffe.com, countless feedbacks with ideas, and an immense ammount of work to come up with ideas that didnt break the shit out of our class, and actually made it balanced.<br>
<br>
We don't have any new rains, pbaoe, etc. because we don't need them.  Mobs in PoP have significantly fewer hp than luclin and velious, and are designed with pbaoe out of the question in the first place.<br>
<br>
There was a time when as a wizard, you could nuke an xp mob, and its health wouldn't move.  THATS when wizards were broken.  We had nothing to offer raids or xp groups.  WE dealt with that shit, and STILL progressed.<br>
<br>
Tweaks are all we need now, and really only at certain levels.  And regardless of what is tweaked, it still isn't going to give any of you whiners enough personality to be accepted into a good xp group.  There is an aura of self-loathing that just seeps from your posts, and I'm sure it is the same way when you go LFG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=assassinite>Assassinite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/26/03 10:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>rogues arent limited by mana, and have at least SOME defensive skills.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

At least wizards are able to do their full damage throughout a PoP boss fight.  I'm stuck eating AoEs and chewing on ripostes.  And with the low amount of good rogue weapons available since Velious, my DPS is barely even worth the mana it takes to keep me alive.<br>

We have never had these problems with our Rogues. Given that you are taking a lot of Ripostes, my suggestion would be to stand behind the mob instead of in front (and yes, this is pretty much never a problem for us, if you can't stand behind the mob, it isn't a problem with your class). The fights where Rogues can't be in melee range are a very small portion of them. The vast majority of fights there is no problem. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Draught of ice at 57 is a nice boost over previous draughts though, that was missed.  Until you hit 50, you were used to getting a good damage upgrade/spell every 4 or 5 levels.  So really, at 54 or 55 is when I feel we should have gotten the boost in damage to the next set of draughts, not 57.  <br>
<br>
Focus items ARE available now, be happy for that.  AA abilities are available, be happy for that.  Flowing thoughts items, while not TOO common, at least are available.  <br>
<br>
I agree, the class could use some work pre-60, and I agree that with Elnerick's and Garrisons available at 60, I could see that Sunstrike could have been made a level 55 or 57 spell.  But the class is NOT broken just because you don't have/use the available equipment in the game.  I feel there should be more damage focus 3 and 4 items in the game, and that's a better complaint.<br>
<br>
Another thing to look at, as you went from 39 to 44 to 49, not only did the new spell do a lot more damage, but the casting times went up.  Lower cast time spells like draughts will allow you to channel through being hit at a reasonable rate, so you can nuke a mob down while going toe to toe(assuming the mob doesn't have too many HP).  So that 3 second cast on draughts is VERY welcome rather than being stuck with 6+ second nukes.  6 second nukes are nice when you can root/snare/nuke and have no problem getting the spell off, but try that when you are in an XP group and need to cast.<br>

<br>
Wizards as a whole should be able to do a percentage of a mob and the big hits were nice to have and see.  But don't discount Ice Comet.  We still have level 56 wizards using IC on Ahkeva hits.<br>
<br>
I personally have Sunstrike, Ice spear of solist.  I don't have GSS or EER.  I mainly use Draught of fire, Draught of thunder (level 61), ice spear, and sword pet.  I have FT1 and 10 AA at level 61.  <br>
<br>
I dont count myself as broken but I do think we are underpowered compared to Mages and sometimes even druids.  Mages in groups can outdamage me with just their pets.  In raids I can usually outdamage the mages because of resists on spells - but if they have their pets out we have had raids saved just because of mage pets.  Druids can outdamage me in certain conditions and seeing consistant 2300+ crits is disappointing.  But that druid has 30+ AA points.<br>
<br>
I have played cleric to 57 (still working on her) and monk (48 now but he is my green farming/explorer).  Every character class can do things differently but I get more requests for my cleric for groups.  Rarely do I get a request for exp group with wizard.  Normally I am asked to help on a raid.  But I do have the capabilities of soloing with the wizard.  The biggest pain is that to do solo in the PoP zones is that I have to have KEI.  I don't NEED bracelets or anything else.  <br>
<br>
I don't care about dieing it is the getting KEI again that I hate.  But I do have the option of soloing where alot of the other classes can't solo at these levels.  (Social skills are there and do work - heck, I deal with Milaru and I am still sane so that should count toward something).  My drawback is I get BORED soloing exp.  I know what quading is - that is how I gained the majority of my exp from 51-61.  My other exp was actually in raids or KS raid groups before they had the raid tool.<br>
<br>
If they really wanted to balance out Wizards more I would think better mana regen or innate standing mana regen - NOT an AA ability.<br>
<br>
If they gave us bigger nukes they definitely would have to adjust agro because you can not stand up to getting agro on these upper end mobs.<br>
<br>
Side Note:  Giants bane is worth the peridot cost if the guild pays for the dots. I don't work to pay someone else.  My normal nuking is around 20k but my best was 32k on Velks before the mod rod nerf.  I don't have Dragon's Bane yet so I still use normal nukes on them.  But I do know that I do excellent damage on the dragons.<br>
<br>
I hope this gives someone enjoyment in reading someone elses opinion.  If you don't agree with anything I said then put your 2 cents in - because that is all any messages on bulletin boards are really worth (if that much).<br>

I would say that they have been ignored by the Developement teams. For the longest time, Mages complained about how weak they were, how thier pets never listened and that all they were good at was summoning stuff. So Sony made some changes to the pets, tossed a few nukes, now everyone loves mages. Sony even said the class was under powered, and that they had always intended for mages to be good damage dealers. Fair enough. Nothing against Mages, I enjoy grouping with them. Yes, it is a bit annoying to think that Sony just gives them a buyable nuke as good as one of ours. I can live with it. <br>
<br>
There are lots of mage only items out there. Some are rather recent. These were put into the game to encourage people to play mages again. I do think Sony went farther then they needed to make mages balanced at the same level with other classes. I can live with that. <br>
<br>
At level 52, I'm at 241 int, and as best as I can figure out, I'm at 2700 mana with my equipment. I believe the mana cap for casters is just over 4000k at level 60. So I'm not that far off. I have an earring of soltice, my familar up, and manaskin, in effect, giving me a three point mana regen per tick at all times over normal regen. Not bad really. I have a horse, so I can sit on him when outdoors. The mana just flies up then.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think it's a shame that none of our nukes get to the 3k mark, even at 65. I can live with that. One thing we have over other casters is that some of our spells are harder to resist. Which means we are going to do damage, while mages are wasting mana trying to land a nuke and kept thier pet alive. We have all kinds of damage spells. Fire, cold and magic. Posion and disease based spells would be interesting too, but oh well. Mages are lucky, they get Malo, which allows them to lower resistances before nuking. What would be nice is some lower damage nukes, like Ro's Sundering for druids, that would lower resistances at the same time. But we don't.<br>
<br>
I was told that wizards have the best chance of getting a Crit then other caster classes. I don't know if this is true or not. I do know I crit more then other casters around me.<br>
<br>
I do think wizards are a bit limited in their range of spells. Mages have nukes, utilites and buffs. Same for necros and enchanters. Personally, I like not having to buff 5 or more people. So I really wouldn't want a range of buffs for others. Though a few for ourselves would be nice. Why don't we have better damage shields? Aren't we the masters of damage in all it's forms? <br>
<br>
Why not give us an interesting line of shield spells? What if, instead of just minor ac, hp and mr increases, they had different effects? Say the first one had an effect like a shadowstep spell? each time you're hit, poof, you port away. What if one had a stun on it? You get hit, the mob is stunned. None of these shields need be long lasting or unresistable, in the case of the stun idea. What about an aggro lowering shield? Get hit, the aggro lowers, and the mob turns onto someone else, providing there is someone else. A shield that we get hit, the mob is rooted for a tick and we can move away? These shields could be non stackable, so someone couldnt' have a stun and aggro shield up at the same time. They might not even be stackable with the regular line of shields. I only suggewst this, since mages, necros and enchanters all get some form of pet that also doubles as an HP buffer. Generally speaking, a mob has to go through the pet before getting to the caster. So a new line of shield spells wouldn't give us more HP's or AC. But it would be something different, on level with pets. That is like having a 3k hp buffer. More actually, since they can heal their pets. Basically, it working some of our spells into shields.<br>
<br>
The shadowstep spells should be reworked. Does anyone use them? First, they should have some aggro lowering effect on them. Like, if you get jumped, you cast the spell, and move away, lowering your aggro, the mob forgets about you and you run away. But if your fighting a mob, and think, oh this isn't going well, and cast it, it may not be enough to get the mob off you. They should also be less random in distance. The range of the best one still has a chance of porting you very little distance. They would be more popular if they ported you in just one direction, say the one you are facing. But they plop you down anywhere. <br>
<br>
I have always thought the call of the hero spell was misplaced as a mage spell. They are good at summoning items, but moving people around is a wizard job (I don't included druids, because I am thinking of Translocates over porting). Why can't we have a spell that summons a person to their corpse? Sort of like a rez, only they have to be grouped with the wizard, and there is no xp cost restored, and lets say the spell has a terrible high cost gem. That way, it wouldn't be considered like a rez, or a summon corpse. <br>
<br>
Many of the wizard port spell have been made useless since PoP came out. Commons, Nek or N Ro were great to getting to Freeport. Now, you can get right to Freeport. The leve 54 levitate spell, also, no good, as O'Kiels Levity not only gives you an hour of levitation, but Fire resistance, and damage shield and Infravision with no component cost. Why would I care about an NPC (now researchable) drop spell that costs no batwing and lasts ten minutes and is self only? Maybe if they changed this spell to a buff that can be cast on others. Not all our spells are stackable with other buffs. Our shield spells don't stack with shaman spells. Since ours are self only, how is it going to hurt if they did? <br>
<br>
Our nukes are fine. In the end, they do more damage then anyone elses. Mages included. I hear lots of people at 50 wishing they get a nuke that did 600 - 1k damage, and we have that at 49. Tears of Druzzil spell is great. I've used it in Plane of Inovation many times. More often then not, all three waves land. That's 1800 damage for 380. Mages can't do that till 55. I was grouped with 2 level 55 mages once in POI, we decided to cast our spells all at the same time. That was three waves of 1800 damage each. The mobs fell so fast, you wouldn't believe it.<br>
<br>
Our roots could use some reworking. They are all the same, save that each one has the POTENTIAL to last longer. Rooted mobs have a chance to break each tick (six seconds) or every time it takes damage. Fair enough, a chance keeps it interesting. And the higher you are the lower the mobs chance are. Well, the duration it gets to check should also change as they get better. Root should be every tick, enstill, every 2 ticks (12 seconds) and immobolize every 3 ticks and so on. That would make a root like Paraylizing earth a very nice uselful root. What about an AE root? A Point Blank AE root for when you get mobbed? That would be nice. The duration could be very short for these types of spells. Making them more for escaping then kitting. Unlike AE stuns, the mobs can still hit you if rooted and you are still close. It would also be nice if our one snare wouldn't effect us. Since it doesn't effect other players, why does it effect us? A single target snare wouldn't be out of line. <br>
<br>
The Elnricks Entombment was a nice spell idea, but I quickly realized, it wasn't that good of a spell. Wizards are supposed to also be masters of instant movement. There are lots of ideas that can be used for this. What about a spell that will port a mob back to it's spawn point? Or at least move him farther away from you? We have a few spells that knock back creatures. Why not a knock back and root version? Or at least make the knock back farther then what it is. I've used the knockback spell on Kael raids to help move the mob up againts the walls so we could pin it into position while the tank and the giant went at it head to toe, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Give us better or longer lasting eye spells. Yes, they did change them so they didn't get aggro. Good. Now make them last longer then a few seconds. I've never a use for bind sight other then having some fun. I've tried using to to jump from mob to mob, to get an idea of how many creatures could be in a room, but often they mob isn't looking in the right direction. The best use I have found for this is guiding lost members through areas by seeing through thier eyes. But with all the old zones mapped out, anyone can find thier way around with eaze.<br>
<br>
It seems to me, that the dev teams have tried experimenting with various ideas for wizard spells, but were afraid to give them to much power or go into area's that belonged to other casters. At the same time, so many of our spells go unused. I hardly ever cast the heat sight or chill sight spells, as in time, I had items that acted as a light source. I do use the vision increasing spells from time to time. Each time they come out with a new spell, it seems to replace one we already had. (O'Kiels/Levitate at 54). So we really aren't getting new spells, just some better ones. <br>
<br>
I still enjoy playing a wizard. And I play a good one. I seldom slow down a group with OOM, as I don't think it's my job to burn down the mob completly. I assume my job is to do my share of damage, based on how many damage dealers there are in the group. 3 melees, a cleric, an enchanter and me, then my share of damage is about one quater.  <br>
<br>
If someone has trouble finding a group all the time, as a wizard, all I think is that they spent so much time soloing, they haven't made very many firends. I can always tell when someone has had a soloing career, from the way they play. I have lots of friends and can always find a group, or start making my own group. <br>
<br>
I get asked to join groups alot, from strangers, looking for a damage dealer. I get compliments from people I group with the first time about how nice it is to meet a wizard that doesn't get aggro all the time, and the same time I'm nuking enough to make a big difference. My friends say the notice a difference when I'm not arround in how long it takes to bring down a mob. <br>
