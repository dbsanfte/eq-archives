<br>
For days, Wyture and Muzzic had been scouting the darkly-perverted, ever-changing, forested landscape of Nightmare. Thickly-clustered broad trees with limbs stripped of bark and leaves, oozing sickly green sap from open sores and pocked trunks, obscured sight and kept vision to a minimum. The denizens of this realm used the abundant unnatural foliage and underbrush as camouflage to surprise and make a quick end of trespassers. Wyture could think of but one word to best sum up her experience here thus far: hostile.<br>
<br>
It was maddening the way the terrain would shift and flow in seemingly chaotic patterns in an attempt to lead the traveler astray. Lesser minds would have succumbed to the insanity of this unpredictable realm that seemed to cling to a perpetual state of twilight. Darkly opulent storm clouds raced overhead and carried an undercurrent of haunting siren-like voices raised in unending song which filtered through and completed the frightful atmosphere.<br>
<br>
In the past weeks, both Elven cities of the Greater Faydark had been struck by dark sendings. The powerful Faydark mists had somewhat protected against and averted a bit of the dark enchantment, but the strength of the crafter was ample enough to pierce the defensive fog and strike at the heart of the ancient cities. <br>
<br>
Even the halls of the Elven Elite, guardians of the Faydark, were not withstanding of this dark malady; the great Arcanist Spindley lived up to his name and was one of the elves to fall under the sway of the fell sending, while others of non-Elven lineage such as the Elite’s Troll Warlord, Nanbkek, and the estranged Vah Shir Lord of Beasts, Nirei, seemed completely immune.<br>
<br>
But the dark sending was damaged, its potency weakened by Elven shielding magic. Instead of insanity followed thereafter by death, the imperfect baleful magic caused a few score of Elves and those connected to the land to sicken and fever, trapped in fitful slumber and dark dreams. Any lasting harm was averted through cleansing prayers of the Cleric and Druid orders of the cities.<br>
<br>
During a moment of meditation and reflection on the attack, Lady Seyah, dutiful leader and Archon of the Elven Elite, received an augury from Tunare, Mother of the Elves. The portent directed Seyah to gather her fellows and strike against Terris Thule. After much deliberation with her council of officers, Seyah bade Wyture and Muzzic to infiltrate the dark plane, scout and report back with any information that would help the Elite in a counter strike against the Queen of Nightmares. The two seemed a natural choice for the task at hand – Wyture with her strong prayers and Muzzic with his potent song, both capable of swift travel, concealment, and awe-inspiring magic with little personal risk.<br>

<br>
Wyture whispered softly in the tongue of Elves as she quickly moved through the dense forest. “Muzzic, this way…be quick…” Even in this twisted otherworldly realm, the lesser plants and foliage acknowledged her as their kin and moved aside offering safe passage as she bounded deer-like through them.<br>
<br>
Muzzic followed through the undergrowth with a bit less grace but far more speed as he quietly beat his drums and hummed his song of travel keeping in syncopation with his steps. He easily dodged the grasping limbs and snaring thorns as he raced a step behind the druidess with a perpetual smile on his lips. <br>
<br>
As he followed Wyture’s lead, Muzzic couldn’t help but notice the way her casually braided golden hair ran down the center of her back. With each running step the braid bounced, exposing the length of her smooth, honey-colored nape and soft shoulders. The forest seemed to flow about her like liquid, leaving no visible sense of her passing. Muzzic’s daydream was short-lived as he once again ducked and dodged a grasping branch. He reluctantly sighed as he attempted to push these thoughts down and renewed his efforts on staying near the Druidess.<br>
<br>
“We’ve been over these grounds and are still no closer to finding this keep. Are you sure you saw something? The last time you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thought</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you saw something,” Muzzic let his low voice trail off with the implied snipe. A smirk lit his face as he reminisced over their close call earlier that morning. The half-blooded Troubadour seemed to enjoy the thrill of danger a bit too much; it always brought forth a twinkle to his eye and a skip to his step.<br>
<br>
Another day passed and the hunt continued…<br>
<br>
As the pair entered a small, seemingly unoccupied grove, Muzzic reached out and gently took hold of Wyture’s arm. She jumped, slightly startled, as she found herself spun about, facing the now helmless bard and being drawn ever closer.<br>
<br>
“Muzzic, what are you doing?” she awkwardly questioned in hushed tones, her brow half-raised. Crimson color crept up her cheeks as she found the line of her body pressed against his. She could feel his warmth despite the cool night air.<br>
<br>
“I only wish to kiss m’lady’s cheek,” softly purred Muzzic with a mischievous cat-that-got-the-canary grin as he locked his gaze with hers. A wisp of heat escaped his lips and floated on a slow breeze before dissipating.<br>
<br>
Wyture recovered a bit of breathing space as she placed her palm lightly against his thickened chest, pushing as she gently chided him, “Do you really think this is the time or the place for such flirtation?” Muzzic’s grin fell into a slight frown showing his displeasure. The shine in his eyes dulled as he replaced his helm in silence.<br>
<br>
As if on cue, a small flock of blood-stained ravens launched and took flight from their nearby perch. Feathers matted with blood and dirt carried a foul stench as wings fanned and beat the air. Sightless eye-sockets dripped ichor as the birds descended, black talons spread and gleaming.<br>
<br>
Wyture reached out with her mind and seized the closest of the flock. Her coercions we generally more subtle charms, but now was not a time for subtlety. Wyture gripped the angered beast with her iron will and then made it her own. It convulsed and reeled, almost falling, before righting itself and moving to her side.<br>
<br>
As Wyture’s desires overwhelmed and subverted the raven’s needs, Muzzic bellowed chords of disharmony, sound layered upon sound, woven together with devastating effect. His strong, clear voice resonated with power and boomed as it released. Wave after wave of flesh rending song battered the flock as Muzzic drew their attention away from the Druidess.<br>
<br>
In spite of his obvious efforts to manipulate and weave the songs, Muzzic still found the strength to bark a few words as he lured the flock of ravens behind him. “I’ll lose these. Meet at graveyard.” With that he and the flock fled the grove and faded into the darkness of twilight. The sound of his retreat was quickly covered by the wailing siren-like voices and the whipping of the wind against the barren trees.<br>
<br>
However morbid it sounded, Wyture had found the graveyard to be one of the safest places in this realm of Nightmares. It was as if the creatures feared the finality of death and so avoided the rows of gravestones near the little hut. When Muzzic and Wyture had first stumbled upon the graveyard, they established a few rules. Rule one: If they ever became separated, head to the graveyard and wait.<br>
<br>
Wyture smiled inwardly despite their situation. She hoped the impulsive Troubadour knew what he was doing. She had grown rather fond of his charming, rakish company during the past week of surveillance. She knew that Muzzic would be leading the flock, taunting and cajoling the dim-witted birds until he felt that he had gained enough distance to protect her. She found herself troubled that she feared for his safety more than just a little.<br>
<br>
Caught up in the moment with the narrow escape and the rush of adrenaline surging through her, Wyture failed to notice the small grove turning against her. Psychic roots enveloped her mind and threw her to one knee as a gnarled treant uprooted and shambled closer. Its stripped, rotting limbs moaned with effort as it lumbered forward on aged, decaying roots. Trails of sickly, runny sap and broken ground were left in its wake.<br>
<br>
With her concentration broken, the blood raven seemed to blink with eyeless sockets in a moment of confusion and disorientation. The raven’s mind was quickly returning as its own subverted desires were no longer so. Wyture cursed herself silently as pain rocked her senses and blurred her thoughts. She and Muzzic had both been careless and broke the second rule: Never let your guard down.<br>
<br>
Realizing her desperate situation, Wyture fought to clear her mind. She cried out to the ground beneath her. It fervently answered in kind as roots and vines shot upward, piercing and holding both the diseased treant and the bloodied raven motionless. Rule three: Never let them touch you. <br>
<br>
Wyture called out to the plants around her a second time. If she could keep these horrors from closing the short distance to her, she would ensure her victory or at least her retreat. Additional vines, roots and branches answered her plea and began to flail wildly, latching on to anything and everything within the area. The treant and raven both raised frustrated protestations to being so grounded and immobilized; the hobgoblin did not.<br>
<br>
Roots and vines melted off the charging hobgoblin like water off a trout. It rammed itself against the kneeling Druidess, knocking her from one knee onto her back. She could taste the coppery fluid against her tongue as her lip bruised and swelled. The proximity of the attack caused Wyture’s magical defenses to activate – thin, inch-long thorns erupted from her honeyed skin, sliding easily through her silvery chain armor, and pierced the creature as it crouched atop her midsection.<br>
<br>
The hobgoblin leaned closer, embracing Wyture with powerfully corded arms. A malicious grin lit its shadowed, disfigured face as it further impaled itself on the spikes protruding from her flesh. Slowly the hobgoblin sank down atop her, riding the pain until their bodies were pressed as one. <br>
<br>
Wyture struggled against the horrific beast knowing that she could not win this battle. As fear and desperation washed over her in a cresting wave of panic, her mouth began to fumble with half spoken prayers to her goddess.<br>
<br>
The hobgoblin opened a mouth filled with rotten flesh and sores. Rank, fetid breath and blackened spittle dribbled over Wyture’s face as the hobgoblin spoke in broken common, inches from her ear, “Little elf. You no welcome here. Time you die.”<br>
<br>
The hobgoblin reared back, suddenly pulling free from the thorny coat that had pinned it with a mist of tiny red droplets that looked like beads glistening in the night air. With one gruesome stroke and a howl of triumph raised skyward, the hobgoblin eviscerated the Druidess with its dark, dark, knife-like claws.<br>
<br>
Wyture cried out to Mother Tunare as a finished prayer of egress was torn from her bruised lips with a ragged scream that echoed through the night. As a swirling, comforting darkness rushed to greet her and dimmed her vision, the ground opened and welcomed her. It wrapped her deep within its heat-stealing embrace before carrying her to the nearest sanctuary this dark realm had to offer. She was beyond further harm from the enraging hobgoblin.<br>
<br>
When Muzzic arrived at the graveyard minutes later, pleased to be free from the fearful flock, he found the unconscious, broken druid lying amidst the tombstones.<br>
