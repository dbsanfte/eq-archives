No, no.  SoL is just out.  Not everything is known yet.  It's too early to be evaluating it as a negative for wizards.<br>
<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
<br>
I am not sure there is ANYTHING of benefit in SoL for me as a wizard that I have seen and been able to cash in on ... except decent blue mobs to solo at 55+ that do not summon.  There seems to be nothing that a wizard in a medium guild can obtain pre-60 that will have any significant effect on his performance.  Oh, I guess the marginal extra mana from 200+ INT is a benefit too.  But don't get me started on familiars.<br>
<br>
Does that mean I hate my wizard?  No.  I still love playing, and I am advancing rapidly from solo experience.  However, SoL has just made the gap even wider for wizards and melee. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>I like pie too, but<BR> you know what's <BR>wrong with Wizards?</span><br>  Posts: 4356<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/1/02 11:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> word from on high</span><hr size=1> Official word is now out: They aren't in the game yet, they didn't have time.

Ok, so spellcasting fury 3 is a 100 percent boost in damage 7 percent of the time.  How about an item that ups this by +2, +4, +10 percent of the time(not of the &quot;skill).  Focus item that does this should be VERY easy to code if it can be made to stack with the Alternate Advancement skills.  Even a +1 percent spell casting fury item that a level 30 could get would make people at that level happy.  Crits pre-55, what a nice thought.  Make them stack, put in a bunch of them, and suddenly the mid level game makes wizards feel a bit better.<br>
<br>
How about cutting the nonsense about fast damage only working on spells OVER 4 seconds out of there?  Or setting it to 5 percent, 15 percent, and 30 percent reduction in cast time?  THIS would make it more desired as well.<br>
<br>
They could also adjust the caster items already in the game so they arn't considered garbage anymore compared to the melee items.  30 seconds on a 320 damage DD from our Velious quest robes, compared to 625 damage with a 15 second cast time from the Velketor drop robe?  How about adjusting Carmine items that are sub-par to at least be a bit better?  +3 sta and +3 str on carmine legs?  Or for that matter, to make the Velious quest stuff at least BETTER than Netted Kelp for ALL items.<br>
<br>
I honestly wonder if the Verant development team has any concept of change.  Ok, the old loot in the game is sub-par, how about an upgrade?<br>

Note the last paragraph:<br>
<br>
With all the excitement and concern that focus items have brought up lately, we wanted to take a minute and talk about them. For those of you unfamiliar with them - focus items are armor, items, or weapons that enhance an aspect of spell casting for the character that wears them.  Focus items can have a wide variety of effects, including things like increased damage or healing, lowered cast times, decreased reagent use,<br>
increased spell range, and decreased resist rates.<br>
<br>
Focus items are a new and exciting concept for EverQuest, and one that we expect to change the game for spell casting classes. These items will allow casters to see the same level of improvement from earning items that melee characters do from acquiring better weapons and armor. For too long it's been the case that an item for melee classes is a much bigger upgrade than an equally hard to acquire item for casters. As more<br>
focus items make it into the game in the near future, casters of all levels should be able to obtain a number of useful focus items to improve their character.<br>
<br>
We recently introduced focus items as Magician spells - this was done for a couple of reasons. First, it allowed us to get the items into circulation fairly rapidly and into the hands of players. This let casters get a look at the new focus abilities and give feedback on them. Second, because it was such an important feature, putting the first batch in as No Rent summoned items made it more painless to players if we needed to make adjustments to the specific details of each item. Because the items were easy to acquire and didn't require anyone to lay out a great deal of time or effort to try them out, it was the best way we could introduce them at this time, and we think it worked out fairly well.<br>
<br>
We certainly considered leaving the focus items on the Test Server for a couple of weeks to try to work out all the little details of item balance and presentation before rolling them out to live servers. But we decided to go ahead and include them in the recent patch so we could get a broad range of feedback, show casters that we recognize some of the issues bothering them in game, and because we were pretty excited about focus items and expected players would be too.<br>
<br>
We understand that adjusting things after they have come into the game causes people some concern. As a rule, we try to not make changes to existing items when possible and to recognize the impact this may have on players when we do make changes. We will always try to notify our customers of changes of this type when we can, unless we want to keep something a mystery. Discovery is an important part of the game. This change, however, wasn't something we were trying to keep hidden, and it wasn't something we could have kept hidden had we tried to. We apologize for failing to mention these changes in the patch message.<br>
<br>
We understand that every player isn't going to agree with every change to the game or decision we make regarding game balance. However, the dev team makes each decision with the best interests of the game in mind. No decisions are ever made to antagonize players or characters of a certain class, or any players at all for that matter. When we make a change to the game or add a new feature, we do it with the intent of making the game better and keeping EverQuest running as an interesting and challenging game for years to come. As EverQuest continues to evolve and develop, more things will change. We'll continue to add new content and things to do. Things will continue to change for the better, but in a game of this size and complexity we need to have the option to change things that are too easy, too powerful, or too great a reward for the effort. At the same time we need to continue to fix and upgrade any part of the game that is too hard, unenjoyable, or inadequately rewarding. We're working on that each day, and we appreciate your patience and understanding. We want EverQuest to be a game you enjoy playing, and keeping the game balanced is crucial to this goal.<br>
<br>
<br>
On to the case in point - focus items. After we introduced focus items in the patch two days ago, we began to get a lot of very valuable feedback from players about the items. Some people loved them, some people hated them, and many people had suggestions for specific ways to change the items. We read over the suggestions, paid attention to the points they made and then decided to make some changes to the Magician summoned items we'd introduced. There were good points about the items made by people on both sides of the issue, and we feel we were very objective about the changes we made.<br>
<br>
Here are the changes that we introduced in last night's patch:<br>
<br>
- Jedah's Choker items - This item gives a chance of not using a reagent when you cast a spell that normally would use a reagent. The items were modified so they no longer effect Enchant Metal spells, or Imbue Gem spells. The goal of the item was to save reagents used for summoning pets, casting buffs, or using Translocate fragments, not to give people a chance at a free platinum bar every time they enchanted one. <br>
<br>
- Naki's Ring items - This item decreases spell cast time when worn. Initially, it worked on any spell. As of last night's patch, it works on spells between 4 and 9.5 seconds casting time. We are currently working on a feature to allow us to exclude certain spells from working with a focus item, and when we get that in we will alter this item to not have a max casting time limit for spells it works with. <br>
<br>
This item was altered because the decrease in casting time for Complete Heal proved to be too powerful, and was potentially unbalancing to the game. Complete heal is already an incredibly powerful tool for the Cleric, and was not in need of improvement. The 4 second minimum time was added to prevent some very fast casting spells from becoming even faster. We'll continue to evaluate fast casting spells and may improve this focus item in the future if it's needed.<br>
<br>
- Gallenite's Bracelet items - This item increases the amount of damage done by direct damage spells. This item was changed to not give additional damage on Wizard's Bane spells. Bane spells are already very efficient and are not in need of further improvement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall, the focus items in game now are well balanced and just needed a couple of minor tweaks so far to bring them in line. Once you see how the summoned focus items fit in with the ones that will be gotten in other ways, we're sure you will find they fit in nicely.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
We feel that these changes were fair and that it is reasonable to adjust new items that are added to the game in this way. We appreciate your patience and all of the very insightful feedback that players sent in. <br>
<br>
In the coming weeks, we'll be adding more focus items to the game as quest rewards, trade skill items, and as loot off of monsters. There is a high chance that we'll be upgrading many existing caster items to include focus effects, to keep casters from needing to start from scratch with their gear selections. When the process of working focus items into the game is done, we feel that casters will be quite happy with the results.<br>
