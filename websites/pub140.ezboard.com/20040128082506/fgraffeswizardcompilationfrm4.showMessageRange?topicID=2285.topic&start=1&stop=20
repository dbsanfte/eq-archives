I mean why bother with a public forum to begin with? I mean it seems they have little to no tolerance for anyone's post. i mean a guy asks information on  an item and they retard rickshaw it.<br>
<br>
Someone else make a post where they basically say afterlife &gt; FOH with some colorful language thrown in. Uhh big deal. Well not to furor he makes a new forum where he then posts the IP address of the poster(or what he thinks is the IP) He then encourages people to find who this poster is and post their name address telephone number which they did only it was not the actual person but the admin for the company. I realize the information may be public but encouraging others to stalk someone who posts something u dont like is just asine and borders on the illegal.<br>
<br>
Now i ask you why bother to take the time it must take to monitor these post, move them, ban them, investigate IP address. Would it not just be easier to NOT  have a public forum? I mean you have a public forum because you want people to just kiss your ass? Are people that insecure? I have noticed this on most guild boards. They just want postive ass-kissing basically anything else dont bother but the FOHguild website takes the cake. If i had posted this on his website at best it would be rickshawed and at worst he would try and find out who i am and have people stalk or harass  me. <br>
<br>
I simply find this sickening and scarey. I have not posted there ever in case your wondering<br>
<br>
Its his website but honestly encourage real life stalking of others can lead to real life consequences for him.<br>
<br>
He needs to wake up and realize it just a game and there are just words on the screen. And maybe seek some legal counsel<br>

There is a lot of dick-swinging in the high end EQ guilds, but more often it's random idiots who are just posting to stir things up.  It was happening a LOT, so Furor got sick of it. Sakerocket chose to be an idiot and ignore the warning so got whatever he had coming to him.<br>

<br>
If your not going to accept what people post then make it a private and invite your friends for your lively discussions.<br>
<br>
I think the site is setup as a bully pulpit. Furor gets off on all the attention. i simply would not have the time to bother  with all that crap. I realize  Most of the posts there are garbage. If things are/were getting out of hand. I would put a stop to it by removing the public forums not encouraging real life stalking ....problem solved.

<br>
Basically, if you plan on acting like a moron, be prepared to be treated like one. And unlike these boards which are still in the end owned by ezboard and thus have to follow rules of conduct, FoH boards are privatly owned by FoH, and they can do whatever they want.<br>
<br>
It's really the only board around which deals with issues that end game players are concerned about (if any such discussion happened on Graffe, it always ultimately ends in a casual vs hardcore player whinefest). There are always a number of Furor suck ups or lamers which post there, but once you get past those posts, there are some good arguments to be gotten there.<br>
<br>
If you don't think it's ok for them to do it, then simply don't post there. Or you can make a post there asking Furor to not be so mean, which will probably earn you a one way ticket to the retard rickshaw<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I never posted there as i did say in my post. The maybe a idioty for posting that but it simply did not warrent that.

The internet exists in the real world too. If someone calls you a dog fucker in a post it's the same as if they call you up on the phone and say it. The only difference is that with a post you get to be insulted at your own convenience.<br>
<br>
Stalking is something entirely different but I don't think the FoH boards promote stalking in any way. Any talk of stalking is just to get a laugh. Tons of people argue every day and only the most unstable ones resort to stalking. In fact, if someone stalked a person because of what he/she said on the FoH board, EVERYONE would make fun of the stalker. Furor would ban the stalker and say something like, &quot;Don't use my fucking board for your sick little games you shitmongers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do agree with you that a lot of posts on that messageboard are a pure waste of space. That's why a lot of them get shitcanned. The board seems to attract the Beavis and Butthead types. Who knows why these things happen. I just don't think it's wrong to release a poster's public info if that poster is being a jackass. If he/she is being rude from work then maybe his/her boss should know what he/she is posting on work hours. I welcome a little accountability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zurrenal>Zurren AL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 640<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/25/03 9:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> If you have the patience to read though all the BS fluff/asskissing/flaming on the FoH boards, there are good threads that pop up now and then, and generally have other high-end players taking part in the conversation.<br>

He did encourgage people to find who the person was. They succeded in getting him reprimanded because he made the post at work which was stupid.  There are no consequences for calling someone a moron or anything its called freedom of speech. CAlling someone at home to harass is different. Posting on a website something that anotehr does not like does not give you the right to harass them in realife. It does not give u the  right to stalk them or try to find out who they are.YOu can ban the from posting on ur website and using and posting the IP to do so is fine as long as your not encouraging people to find who the person is. If someone has committed an illegal act it is your duty to report it to the proper authority not encourge vigalante justice. If someone found who this guy was and then went and killed him. The real life furor could be charged as an accessory and a co-conspirtor to murder.

I think this is a potentially big problem as someone  can call someone a name and then they get  get tracked ambushed and killed over it. This has not happened yet but when it does i guarentee it will be come expressly illegal to do what furor is  doing.<br>
<br>
If you invite someone into your home and If that someone then flips you off/calls you names you do not then have the right to then stalk/harass them or assualt them. All you have the right to do is aask them to leave and bar them from returning. <br>
<br>
So you see just because he does not want this crap on his own boards does not somehow magically  bestow rights on him to do as he pleases.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 4916<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 11:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guild public forums</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>what part of he is carrying it too far do you not understand? If he does not want that crap on his board ban the poster then delete the post. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->He doesn't want to have to clear those kinds of posts from the board every day.  He has better things to do then moderate the message board 24 hours a day.  So fed up with doing exactly what you are suggesting he do, he posts a BIG WARNING that the consequences for such behavior would be that your IP address gets posted for the board freaks to do with as they please.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>YOU DO NOT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STALK the POSTER BY POSTING THEIR NAME ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Except he didn't do that.  He made public the poster's IP address, that's it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am pointing out must not be obvious to him. IF he banned these posters and then deleted these &quot;offensive&quot; posts. I am sure the crap would stop.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That was tried, it didn't work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I went to the website as i do other website looking for interesting game tidbits or info. I did not see anything except a cesspool of bullying by posters and furor and crew.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My guess is that you're just a bit too sensitive.  Furor is actually a really smart guy despite his manner.  He is very abrasive, but part of that is a show and is meant to be entertaining.  The rest is generally insightful and perceptive.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think it wold be soooo much easier to simply not have a public forum.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As stated before, it's a forum for end game players, and has been useful in that capacity over the last few yeras.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think because he uses it as a bully pulpit it encourages these posters.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->To which posters do you refer?  The snivelling idiots who can't read and like to annoy people?  Probably.  That doesn't invalidate the entire board, though, and those idiots shouldn't have the power to shut down such a board.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think this is a potentially big problem as someone can call someone a name and then they get get tracked ambushed and killed over it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You mean like what happens in real life if you offend someone with a vindictive personality?  Have you ever seen juvenile court?  &quot;Sheila told me that Patty was talking shit about me so I went and showd her why not to say stuff like that about people.&quot;  And it gets worse as you get older and more male.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> This has not happened yet but when it does i guarentee it will be come expressly illegal to do what furor is doing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And if they do, I suspect they will also force a more formalized registration of IP addresses, like Car Licence Plates.  So an administrator will have the option to turn over the offender's IP address to a government agency who will inform the local law enforcement that the poster should be arrested for online trespassing.<br>

That is my point. Yes someone may attack you if were to say these same things in person but they are not legal in doing so or in no way justified. I am perfectly within my rights to call people names  and insult them all day long. It called freedom of speech. No one can &quot;legally&quot; punish me. Furor does encourage people investigating who people are  in the forums rules read it again.<br>
<br>
As for as turning Ip addresses and emails over to the proper authorties for prosection for hassament is a reality now.<br>
<br>
As far as being too sensitive I have viewed a lot of websites and none come close to cesspool of the foh boards.<br>
<br>
 Personaly, I would not have a public forum. I have noticed a pattern on high-end guild sites of this type of behavior not as bad as FOH. I would  not invite complete strangers into my home nor post my phone number in a public place and then be surprised by all the idiots/heavybreathers or worse  that call or stop by. Furor is comepletly surprised.<br>
