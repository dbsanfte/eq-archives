<br>
First off, the justification:<br>
All of us have at least considered doing Skyshrine Armor at some point in our wizardly endeavors.  The resists and stats on it are some of the best in the game, and with the advent of PoP, these quests are still very nice for the reduced risk they now entail.  Most of us will spend our short period in EToV, or the Halls of Testing, camping the entrance, pulling mob after mob from deeper in to the door area and yelling at guildmates and lookie-loos who open the door while we're fighting and get us all wiped by the non-kos mobs in the next room.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as well as being potentially dangerous to those shortchanged in the brains department, HoT entrance camps are about as boring as raids come.  Yes, you can camp the entrance and get the same types of drops as everywhere else, but hundreds of people haven't died on Everest simply because they never realized you could hike up Mt. Rainier, snap a few pictures and get airlifted to safety later.  The point of doing laps around HoT is to keep the raid focussed, prevent boredom, and really hone your raiding skills to a fine edge.  You get to see parts of this zone hardly anyone will ever see, even the uberguilded.  Also, if a mob gates, oh frickin' well, it's 40 ft to his spawn point, he won't get very far.<br>
<br>
A HoT lap, of any kind, is essentially a giant game of &quot;beat the clock&quot;.  The pit, (or the two guardian wurms that spawn just down from the entrance drop off), has a 75 min spawn timer, give or take.  The point of a lap is to kill everything in your path from the pit in a giant loop that hopefully gets you back before these guardians respawn.  Laps can go from mildly difficult to nearly insane.<br>
<br>
My credentials:<br>
I am a 61 wizard on Tholuxe Paells server, now retired.  I started HoT laps at 56, before Shadows of Luclin, with the guild Shades of Fire as a guest on their raid.  I have since done variations of laps with Bellatoris and Lords of Shadowed Blade.  I have scouted the area intensely with both Eye of Tallon, and my own two feet.  I can confirm that the spawn points listed on this map are correct to the best of my knowledge, with little variation, and no variations that are likely to wipe your guild if you're able to get this far in the first place.<br>
<br>
And now, the map, courtesy of Rebraz and Gumkak of Terris Thule.  As originally posted on: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com" target="top">EQMAPS.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/halloftest.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
First off, the &quot;Standard Lap&quot;.<br>
From this map, the regular lap camps are:<br>
1. Corner just above the 'of' in Arch of Chaos.<br>
2. NW corner there, past the red wurm spawn point.<br>
3. Room with Travekalem and Lepethida. (My personal favorite, especially if your tanks suck as positioning the pull so it doesn't AE casters and clerics).<br>
4. Blue static spawn point just above the 'Wall aggro' notation in the southern halls.<br>
5. Named spawn point just before you get back to the pit.<br>
<br>
You should only need these 5 on a regular lap, unless you're training a new pull team, or are unsure of your capabilities. Camp 4 tends to be the most dangerous, make sure you have a spare tank watching your rear JIC the pull team missed a roamer. Shades of Fire on TP was able to do this lap with 20 people, pre-Luclin, with little or no ST or NToV gear, so it's not a rough run if everyone's awake. I was 56 at the time I guested this raid and recorded the spawnpoints with the other 19 of them.<br>
<br>
North Wing or Mini-lap:<br>
Camps 1-2 and then a quick run back down the N hall of Doz's room to repull pit so you can break to camp 1 again. If you're good and work it out with whomever's in S halls, you might also be able to get in some camp 3 pulls.<br>
<br>
South Wing or Mini-lap 2:<br>
Camps are based around the original camp 5 in the Standard lap.  Break to here from the pit, then pull anything S of this point to this camp.  When you start to run out of mobs. Move to the static wyvern spawn at the very southernmost point in the HoT area.  From this spot, pull N and E of your camp, making sure to get the roamers first.  Tricky part is going to be the roamer just N of the named spawn point to the N.  You may have to abort the named pull if you can get the roamer instead, this way you can be sure of no adds on the pull.  Once you're clear at this camp, move to the T junction just N of the static wurm spawn above your camp.  Open the door W of here after you take care of the roamer to your E, then take out everything left between you and the respawning pit.<br>
<br>
The Exit Hall lap:<br>
One of the things that separates those that run laps here, and the vast herds of EQ players at large is the realization that HoT contains an exit.  You'd be surprised how many players blunder through this area on their way to greater things, or become convinced that there couldn't possibly be anything of interest here past Doz's lair.  The exit lap is one of the least risky propositions in this area, because once you get tired, it's very easy to just clear to the exit and get out.  It's also the one lap here that doesn't require timing the pit spawns. <br>
<br>
That said, the first thing to do is clear to the exit lap area.  I like to do a North lap clear first, stopping at camp 3.  From here, instead of pulling S, get the roamer just west of you and clear whatever's between you and the named spawn to the west of you.  That named spawn is the first camp on an exit hall lap.  From this camp, you would normally pull the roamer between you and the camp you were just at, or the roamer just S of you.  On the break-in, you've probably already dropped one or both of these, so we can work on the next leg of the raid.  Head E, and pull towards the exit.  As soon as you've got room, move to the next named camp you can reach.  It's a little easier on the pull team dragging to here.  Be advised that in addition to the spawns listed, there is also a named drake that pops in the exit room itself.  Pull team needs to be aware that the raised platform in the exit room is a teleporter to WW, so have them stay off it.  Also, the lines on the map here that block off hallways are one-way walls, typically from the N.  Make sure the pull team has a map and knows not to run past these areas so they don't get stuck somewhere.  Mobs will happily run through these walls if pulled, but players cannot.  Now, with this area cleared, look to the S of you.  You want to clear to, then move toward the named spawn point just S of the first camp on this lap.  Welcome to the last camp.  From here, clear the S, and then wait for the roamer to spawn N of you, and clear back to camp one.  It is important to clear the two roamers in this area quickly, because they have a really nasty tendency of showing up when you're already engaged.<br>
<br>
Finally, for when it's just not a challenge anymore:<br>
<br>
The Master Lap:<br>
Usually, being able to complete this lap signals that it's high time you moved on to NTOV or something better.  This is the pinnacle of HoT raiding, and you'll be running like dogs to pull it off in time.<br>
<br>
Camps 1-3 are the same as a standard lap, at camp three, however, things get interesting.  From three, make like you're doing an exit hall lap and get to the first camp of this.  Skip exit camp 2 though, just grab whatever you can reach in the exit hallway before proceeding to camp 3 of the exit lap.  Pull S of here and clear as much as possible before moving on.  Your next camp is the dead end spot just below the &quot;o&quot; in the 'Wall aggro' message on the map.  Pull whatever you can get to from here, and advance to camp 5 of the standard lap.  From this camp, break the pit again.  Congratulations, you've just done something half your server will never even attempt!<br>
<br>
The Master Plus 1 lap:<br>
Ok, so you've done a Master Lap, people in your guild still need armor, you're looking for a challenge again.  Try this: Do a single master lap, then follow it with a single Standard lap.  This combo, which I refer to as the &quot;Master plus 1&quot;, allows you to get at every single spawn in HoT that popped while you were here.  For those doing the Master Lap, it picks up the spawns closest to Doz's room, which are also the spawns you are most likely to miss in the course of your Master Lap.  If you subscribe to the theory that drops are limited by spawns, this maxxes your ability to get that BP, Robe, or Tunic you've been after.  Frankly, I think that theory's a load of bull, but it does offer me a challenge, so what the hell?  If you're really really bored of this, do a Master Plus 1, then raid Doz as a last hurrah before you leave the place.  Pull that off, and I doubt there'll be anyone on your server who still thinks you belong in Velious.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Well, there you have it.  The Complete guide to HoT Laps.  Or at least as complete as I can make it.  If you have anything else to advise other players about in this zone, feel free to reply here.  Worst case, you end up bumping this thread so it survives long enough to challenge another group of players.  I'd like to thank all the guildmates who have helped me over the years in gathering data for this guide.  I had to buy an MQ of my only piece of Skyshrine Armor, but at least I got some good info out of it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
