<br>
With that said, pick up group are dangerous.  Flat out deadly in most cases.  The only time I go LFG is on my rogue on the odd times he's just playing around.  Most of the folks in my guild are busy leveling alts and are now of a level where they can join me if they wish to.  If I dont want to group, which is often because I can easily use downtime to do laundry, wash dishes, etc. I solo in whatever zone I find some good XP and little competition.<br>
<br>
I recommend a good guild with people of a like level, and soloing and XP grinding while you can.   <p><img src=http://24.26.194.142/sevepic.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=conalglassbones>Conal Glassbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 6:35:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26204.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: very bad day of EQ</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whenever I complain about not being about to get a group some idiot always pipes up and says I should go solo.<br>

Fact of the matter is I have solo'd at least 90% of my xp up to level 64 and I really can't stand it any longer. Solo is now bloody boring for me. I'd much rather get a group and get slow xp than solo for uber xp. I don't play the game to get xp I play to have fun and interact with others.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I think another part of the problem is so many of us have soloed our way through the levels that groups dont even think of us.Seems we still have the bad rep of always being oom even though now it's nearly always the cleric with the way PoP stuff hits.It's sad when you see people pass you by in levels simply because they can get groups. <br>

Now that my  warrior is almost caught up with my wizard (lvl 50, my wiz is 52), you'd think I'd be seeing things differently than before.  Before, I felt that no one appreciated the wizard.  Now, you'd think I'd be adopting the heavy melee group mentality (cleric, chanter, and warrior, pally, sk, rogue).  Well, I'm not.  I keep finding myself saying &quot;dang I wish we had a wizard,&quot; every time we lack one.  I sure am appreciative of the wizard class when we do have one.  Maybe it's because I gravitate toward dungeon zones and the wizards ability to evac and deal heavy dps when the situation warrants, and steady dps on single pulls.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
Whateverthecase, not everyone out there who is not playing a wizard that moment is unappreciative of the wizard class.<br>
<br>
Is my opinion different than the norm because I also play a wizard?  Probably.  Right or wrong, I tend to believe that this is a function of what I know about the wizard class, it's benefits and limitation, rather than a function of some emotional attachment to the wizard class.  <br>
<br>
If I play a warrior now having previously played a wizard and I like having a wizard in my group, and my preference to have a wizard present is based on their contribution (not some funked up emotional attachment to the wizard generated by previous wizard playing experience), then one of two things must be true.  Either a.) Most people running the pickup groups you're looking for are ignorant about you're assets or b.) the groups you're looking for are different than the groups I form in the environments I hunt in (as previously stated, I prefer dungeons).  If we assume that everyone knows what a wizard does best (which isn't true let's just assume for argument), then maybe there's some environments (let's say, sitting in an outdoor zone, not a dungeon, mindlessly doing the pull kill pull kill pull kill routine for hours on end without moving) where a wizard is not preferred.  Okay, if that situation is not one where a wizard is preferred (the static exp grind group where you just sit there in the same spot for six hours straight looking at the same skyline, the same trees, the same everything), we might ask why?  Efficiency?  Adding another melee get's an extra 3 percent experience per group member per hour because of whatever?  Who knows.  More importantly, who cares.  My opinion, I hate those groups anyhow.  I get SO bored of staring at the same things, killing same things, hour after hour.  Is that fun?  If everything you're doing in the game is boring and repetitive, couldn't you just as well be doing a tradeskill?  You're only left with socialization to stimulate you're cerebrial cortex at that point.  Can't you get socialization somewhere else, like a guild?  Or, a dungeon crawl group?  <br>
<br>
When I do play my wizard, I find myself sometimes wanting a group.  Some unusual occasions I've wanted a group... badly, and couldn't find one.  It's times like these that I'll, once in a blue moon, consider a boring, outdoor, exp grind group if one is offered.  But, ya know, I wind up disbanding and either soloing or loggin in my warrior in less than an hour.  Why?  It's SO BORING it borders on being GAY!<br>
<br>
The times I've most enjoyed grouping with my wizard is when I'm either a.) on a big raid or b.) in a dungeon group.  Not only do I find the people who do dungeons (not seb, karnors, or velks mind you, nothing crowded) appreciate my wizard more, but they also tend to be differen types of people, more interesting, and the time I spend in those groups is vastly more enjoyable than an exp grind situation.<br>
<br>
How do I find these groups?  Sometimes, but rarely, guildies.  Mostly I just find a spot I like at first, read up on it, spend some time poking around the dungeon if possible until I bump into a group doing something interesting.  After a while of polite hovering, I usually get invited.  Sometimes I even get invited to full groups as one extra in raid mode ;&gt;)<br>
<br>
Anyways, there's my 2cp.  Hope you get you're spirits up again! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naenibastra>Naeni Bast Ra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 8:07:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26204.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards just aren't appreciated!</span><hr size=1> Flintnilf has the answer....<br>
<br>
I dual box an enchanter, so i have part of the problem solved already.<br>
<br>
Now, first thing i do is find a cleric, then a tank and then filler and voila.... instant group for hours.<br>
<br>
I fill in with the classes i need and don't have to worry about being lfg.<br>
<br>
Now the only drawback is when i want to leave if i can't find them a replacement slower the group falls apart so i end up feeling guilty and staying too long in group =/<br>
<br>
anyway, be a leader not a follower and you'll always have groups and lots of friends, besides as soon as you start picking up the same people over and over they start asking you if you want to join them, because they have a spot open.<br>
<br>
Make them realize how great having a wizard in group is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~bri_space/_uimages/Naeni_small.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

You have to realize that the problems you are having are not your fault but are problems in the games design.<br>
I am experiencing something similar. I hardly ever get groups unless it is with friends, and the timing for that doesn't work out real often, so I am forced to solo. <br>
But, since making lvl 61 and Sony's briliiant idea to make everything that is not in PoP turn light blue or green to me, my options for soloing are very limited. I have a few flags, but really the only place I can do any good and that is reasonably safe is PoS Loroks, and unfortunately there are only about 4 of them and they are always camped (and I have seen some people do some pretty shitty things to acquire/keep that camp, of these mobs that wander all over). So yeah, I have become a bit jaded on the game myself of late. I might take a break, or at least only raid with my guild until such time as Sony decides to undo this level range thing they did to lvl 61+'s. But I don't take it personally. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=corinia>Corinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 10:56:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26204.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.burleehost.com/moyguild/avitars/sorceress.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards</span><hr size=1> I have always grouped.  I hate soloing.  I am just now learning to quad kite at level 52 and I've had jboots since level 38 or so.  I feel that I am a very good wizard in grouping situations and have been very lucky.  First of all, my family plays so they are usually on at the same time as I.  My husband (ranger) and brother (paladin) and I will generally group together but if they're not available, I have never had a problem finding a group.  I think it depends on your mindset.<br>
<br>
What are you looking for exactly?  Just to be in a group?  Experience, equipment, friendliness - all of these factor in.  I don't always group where I want to fight because sometimes I go to join friends.  I like to be around people.  Sometimes they come to where I want to fight.<br>
<br>
The first person mentioned not being able to get into a guild.  What kind of guild are you looking for?  I've found that most guilds are political and unless you're well liked you don't get much.  The guild I am in is a family guild.  We don't consider ourself uber.  We don't believe in raiding all the time.  We do believe hunting together.  We believe in giving things to each other and helping others in the world of Norrath as well.  So there is almost always someone I can group with from the guild.<br>
<br>
If there is absolutely no one available or the guild is off fighting (we have a lot of higher levels who can go places I don't go yet) somewhere else I can generally find a group somewhere.  I've gone to the LOY zones and just asked for a camp check and then told to people asking if they'd like to take a level 52 wizzy in and made a few friends that way.  As I've worked on my epic, I've made friends with people needing to slay the same mobs and can check with them if they need help.  I never go LFG.  I just ask people (in tells directly) if they need someone or find a pickup group at zoneline (and then move them to a safer place if that's a rough zoneline with trains).<br>
<br>
I also suggest what someone else suggested.  Put the group together yourself.  I've gone to zones and when I couldn't actually get INTO a group I would ooc group needs such and such classes and then as I got tells I'd have them meet me somewhere and that would work to get a group together.<br>
<br>
Good luck with finding a group.  It's not as hard as you may think. <p>Renia - wizardess of Cazic-Thule<br>

I'm flagged up to BoT/HoH, but it hasn't done me a bit of good.  I can LFG for hours, while the same three types of classes (melee/healer/slower) get nabbed almost immediately.  So much min/max'ing goes on now, that unless you are well known and have some of the right friends, it just seems near impossible to get *consistent* grouped xp.  After you get passed up so many times for a group, it gets very difficult to not take it personally and develop some angst.<br>
<br>
I literally spent months being helpless, but since last week, I returned to what I knew... soloing.  Part of the reason I abandoned soloing in the first place was all the hype surrounding xp in PoV when grouped (especially since all the solo spots in PoV are so contested).  However, let me assure you, that even though the xp might be better in an IC group in PoV, the xp I get solo is much more consistent, efficient, and dependable.  In less than one week, I have gone from zero xp in 61 to zero xp in 64... in a tier one zone at that.  For me, the only person I can depend on is myself.  It gets boring and lonely, but it is a means to an end... the end being 65, which greatly improves your marketability (or so it seems).<br>

*edit* A quick addendum for those that say, &quot;Get some friends.&quot;  A lot of people are very shy and that trait carries over into the game.  It's not as easy as it is for some. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nulland>Nulland</A> at: 4/22/03 11:57:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hibashira>Hibashira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 2:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26204.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>*edit* A quick addendum for those that say, &quot;Get some friends.&quot; A lot of people are very shy and that trait carries over into the game.

I also do not dispute that some of the shy people carry that side of their personality into their avatar.  But I will submit that shyness as a personality trait that should not be cherished or celebrated, instead, it should be overcame.  MMORPG provides an anonymous yet social environment for people to experiment.  Without the presence of real race, gender, age, caste, social status, and physical attributes, this is exactly the kind of environment where a shy person should begin exploring how to overcome that shyness.  What does it take to chat with others in a group?  What does it take add someone you have a good time chatting with on your friends list?  What does it take to say hi to those on your friends list?  What does it take to answer their call for help?  Friendships are born that way.  Don't make excuses to be anti-social.  It is not at all healthy. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nulland>Nulland</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 7:28:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26204.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards</span><hr size=1> Oh I agree with everything you're saying, Hibashira.

I think part of this is that I'm just as comfortable quadding as grouping, though I have to agree on that if you want a group... put one together. <br>

if you want to know bad, there's a 61 war on my server who annoyed everyone so much that he can't get pov flagged. nobody will do it. in november of last year he was level 58 and 150 days played. since he apparently doesn't sleep, the poor guy is level 61 with around 250 days /played now and practically lives on the poj trial platform. <br>
