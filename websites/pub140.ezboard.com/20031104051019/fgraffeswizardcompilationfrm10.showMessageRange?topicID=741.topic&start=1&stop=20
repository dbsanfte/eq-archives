Now, this is what i think should be done:<br>
<br>
-Lures added at lower levels, or resistances on monsters lowered when a wizard is nuking rather than another class.<br>
<br>
-More mana efficiency on nukes, if this is not possible, add new researchable, or looted nukes that have better efficency than our vendor spells. I.E: Wizard NPC's in Permafrost can randomly drop spells in or below their level range. these nukes can either be A. doing more damage than vendor nukes of that level, while being more resistable. or B. doing similar damage to the level's vendor nukes, while having a lower mana cost and similar resistability as vendor nukes. This will allow Wizards to get a more diverse spell book.<br>
<br>
-Lower damage on other classes nukes. if this is not possible, raise the damage on Wizard nukes by about 10%. VI talks about Wizards stepping on Magician territory by having bolts, other classes are stepping on our territory by having nukes that are of a very similar damage or mana efficiency to ours.<br>
<br>
-Make FT items available at lower levels. or add &quot;Caster Disciplines&quot; (this applies to all caster classes other than hybrids) that will regen mana at a very high rate for say, 3 ticks have have a base reuse time of 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
-A mana bonus for Int casters for reaching 255 int, so say that very last point gives you 100 mana, same could be done for wis casters, except hybrids<br>
<br>
-(Many thanks to Grimstaff for this idea) add a few very slow casting highly mana inefficient nukes at various levels. I.E a 300 damage nuke at 20 that costs 350 mana to cast with maybe a 5 second casting time. allowing wizards to do alot of damage in a single blast. and add a few very fast casting mana efficient nukes at various levels that will do less damage than a nuke of the same level, very much like a draught. This can be applied in conjunction with the drop spells in an earlier idea, having some at vendors and some in dungeons. This will allow many underused lower level dungeons and zones to be repopulated with newer characters looking for these new spells.<br>
<br>
-Taunt component on Wizard DDs lowered, this will allow Wizards to nuke a bit more than they do in combat<br>
<br>
-I haven't used a Flappy yet so table is open to ideas for them<br>
<br>
There we have it. the compilation of the most sensible ideas i have read and a couple of my own.<br>

I'm thinking no.  I am very rarely in a situation where aggro is the limiting factor on my output, usually my mana regen is what keeps me disiplined.  We already have access to concussion for aggro control.<br>

So, with this in mind, why not set up something like the following:<br>
<br>
For every 10 points of int above 100, spells do between 2 and 5 percent additional damage.<br>
<br>
For every 5 points of int above 200, an additional 5 percent damage is done.<br>
<br>
If stamina(it IS the secondary stat for wizards) is used to help our mana regen, provide an adjustment to our mana pool, or both were implemented, then that would also help.<br>
<br>
Add buffs for enchanters that would grant focus-type effects that stack with focus items.  If a haste buff stacks with a haste item, then why not a double focus if we have a buff?<br>
<br>
Put in more focus items that are class specific(or added to existing class specific items), which do more than the general &quot;all classes&quot; focus items.  Wizard specific improved damage focus items that do more than the &quot;up to 20 percent&quot; of existing focus items.  <br>
<br>
An &quot;enhanced&quot; version of invisibility that NOTHING can see thought without having a see invis put on it.  The number of mobs in game that can see invisible as a natural ability is very high in the 35+ game.  You'd figure a wizard would have figured out why, and improved the invisibility spells so whatever lets them naturally see invis would be nullified.<br>

But they have them, so the answer isn't to weaken other classes (just take note other game designers).  It just takes a little minor tweaking of Wizards to make the blasts more noticably superior and effective as they should be.  <br>
<br>
Slightly lower mana cost - this doesn't have to change much, 10% maximum lower mana for blasts only.<br>
Slightly faster blasts - this again doesn't have to be much, but should be done mostly at higher levels.  Between level 29 and 49 the casting times on blasts become absurd, even Verant recognized that (its why we have Draughts in the 50s).  A small shift, lowering by around 5-10% each would make the blasts come in when they need to without a real change in power for Wizards.  It wouldn't make Wizards more POTENT it would make them better designed and distinctive.<br>
Lowering recast times - there's lots of rumors and theories running around about recast times, but the simple fact is we all know that this can be cut down without breaking the game.  Lowering Wizard nuke recast times by half would make chain casting more of a valid option in emergencies.<br>
Lower Aggro - If you nuke faster for less mana, you'll be doing more damage overall with the same bar of mana (this would mean no need for mana regen effects, etc, etc).  However, doing so would get you turned into paste faster, and this would negate the entire advantage.  Lowering aggro slightly for the spells would allow Wizard to distinctly deal thier direct damage in a superior way to other casters.<br>
<br>
What's that, you say, Focus items do all this?  But they do it for ALL classes, not just Wizards.  Wizards SPECIFICALLY need work, just like Mages, Rangers, etc.  Changing all casters uniformly (oh, except for pet classes) doesn't help the individual ones, particularly in terms of balance relative to each other.<br>
<br>
There's other little things, such as the aforementioned low level Lure spells and more AE types at lower levels, but these are the major changes that would really make a difference.<br>
<br>
This is all pretty old stuff, I've posted my whole fix it list a couple times in the past and don't really feel a burning need to do so again.  The point is moot, none of this will happen. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 7/22/02 8:59:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukilzadikandinsky.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KilzadiKandinsky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/22/02 8:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance (No stupid ideas please)</span><hr size=1> see. now we're actually getting some intelligent posts in class balance forum *Gasp*. more choice in AEs would be nice. but Verant wont do that because it might set us up for better quadding, or AE groups, Druid nukes are almost as good as ours. they can evac, they can port, they can dot, they can sow, buff, regen. now thats absurd, they shouldn't have nukes as powerful as ours. they have similar variety to their nukes. our draughts may be slighter faster casting. but that doesn't balance us. now. lets have some ideas on Flappy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 704<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/28/02 8:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance (No stupid ideas please)</span><hr size=1> If you want ideas for familiars, one idea is that our familiar can toss a small DD spell at the same time as we do.

Agreed, but they could also give us +5% more damage and -5% mana savings on each spell. I'd be content with that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Slightly faster blasts - this again doesn't have to be much, but should be done mostly at higher levels.

There is no reason to drop the cast times on our 29-49 spells. With focus items, you can shave 10% off the cast time, which in most cases fixes the problem.<br>

You can avoid the network latency which plagues spell gems popping up instantly by using an instant click item right after casting.<br>

No, they're not for all classes. Ask the rogues and monks about them. They got nuthin with focus items, and that's whos damage we're trying to match (or beat).<br>
Bards can't use them either, and they could probably get the most use out of the of all the classes. Imagine if bards could twist 5 or 6 songs instead the average 3-4. That would be scary! Bards might actually rival some pure classes in abilities.<br>
<br>
I honestly have come to the point where I think we're balanced. A wise man ones said, 'you can tell when classes are balanced, because everybody bitches at about the same frequency.'. <br>
Well, in the past few months people have been bitching at about the same frequency, so I'd say we're either balanced or damn close.<br>
<br>
The real problem with the wizard class is that our presence isn't felt, heard or seen, minus when we get massive critical hits we look like we sit on our ass and do nothing.<br>
It's a flaw with the class, and it's one that needs to be improved a bit. <br>
We need to 'wow' other classes into wanting us, and right now we don't have the tools to do that in the low to mid-level ranges. With AA, we're pretty impressive.<br>
<br>
I could sit here and spout off spells, skills, and items that would give us wow factor, but the point is, Wizards in SOE's eyes are about where they want them, just like most other classes. <br>
They're going to tweak classes here and there as need be, but they aren't going to be making huge sweeping changes because people aren't feeling good about their class.<br>
<br>
Remember, wizards in EQ are part of their vision, not yours or mine.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usnyine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snyine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/02 1:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance (No stupid ideas please)</span><hr size=1> make flappies mana regen group related .... make flappy have additional effect of all the focus items in game but at a lower level .... increase casting time increase damage and reduce mana cost and aggro :P then flappy would rule :P <br>

It seems to me the question is really how do you provide Wizards with sdps without providing additional power to soloing or quadding. I think most will laugh and ridicule me, but I've found that my flaming sword helps add to my sdps. <br>
<br>
Previously, the flaming sword was an unrealistic avenue due to the high mana cost and the speed at which most mobs die in a grind group. Assuming that some of the changes go live including the reduced mana cost of the sword, then it may be a viable option of adding sdps to wizards. I can honestly say that while attempting to solo with the flaming sword proves humorous to witnesses it's a pain in the ass. I don't care what sort of efficiency I achieve -- You won't find me agro kiting something so that my sword can beat on it. I don't have the patience /shrug.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind seeing this line extend down to our lower levels. It wouldn't be hard to imagine a line up of these spells dancing swords, maces, daggers, and the like. It seems like a reasonable way they could add sdps without increasing our effectiveness at soloing. Again, I think some people may really dislike this idea, but from the countless &quot;balance idea!&quot; threads I'd say the community at large is having difficulty focusing on any single solution. Most people are in agreement about the major shortcomings, but not everyone agrees on how to resolve that. I think, in most instances, the suggestions for resolving the issue end up with a lot of unintended fringe benefits, which would result in a major power shift. <br>
<br>
Additionally, I would love to see our less useful spell lines converted into something useful. This includes our O'Kiels and Al'Kabor's lines. People have made scores of suggestions regarding these two lines and ways in which they could be made useful. Right now, that is probably my single largest pet peave and I see balance tweaks as a viable means to kill two birds with one stone. I get a worthless line or two of spells converted into something useful, and I get &quot;balance.&quot;<br>

<br>
GENERAL<br>
-Reduce resistances for Wizard attack spells from level 1-60, not an alleged reduction at level 35+. What resists a cleric would resist a Wizard like it was one color shift lower (whites like blues, etc). <br>
This offsets the lack of Wizard ability to get around resistances (with pets, buffs, etc), and makes the class immediately more attractive to groups - that guy will land his spells. It also makes the Wizard's mana more effective, since the Wizard is a mana hose. <br>
-Reduce resistances further for creatures lower level than the Caster, such as 15 levels at level 30. This would be for all casters, Moss snakes shouldn't shrug off spells from a level 55 Magician or Necro either. <br>
-If not this, then a minimum damage level for Caster Spells against targets below a certain level (like 15 levels under you). <br>
-Change Enstill to have a minimum duration if the creature is undamaged, like mez <br>
-make Paralyzing Earth area effect Root <br>
-Have aggro based on the intellect of the monster. I can see Vox recognizing that Conflag could have done 625 damage when it only did 6, but should a Grizzly Bear? <br>
-Fix the Concussion quest so someone under level 50 has a reasonable shot at doing the quest. This is really an embarrassment.  An alternative is just to make it available for sale or research.<br>
-Make the reagent for Diamondskin a Pearl, not a Peridot. For the effect and level this is absurdly overpriced, it just isn't worth using.<br>
<br>
ATTACK<br>
-Speed casting time by as much as 10% across the board past level 29. 6.3 seconds is unacceptable for a blast, that's longer than gate. Yes, this includes Draught spells, there's no excuse for them to be slower than the equivalent fast spells of other classes (see Scars of Sigil).  <br>
-Lower mana cost for all blasts by 10% or more, resulting in even more efficient spells. Less mana cost = no need for faster mana regeneration for Wizards. <br>
-Shorten recast delay between blasts by 1 second or so. Presently the delay is 2.2 to 2.5 seconds, this would make it 1.2 to 1.5 seconds. This would be limited to only normal blasts without extra effects. <br>
-Increase damage the few levels Wizards are out damaged by other classes in a single blast. There aren't many of these levels, but if it is acceptible for a Druid to do 22 damage at level 5, then it certainly is for Wizards to do 23, and at better mana cost.<br>
<br>
For example, at level 1, Clerics have the most powerful nuke in the game, doing 6 damage at level 1 and capping at 8 damage at level 3.  By comparison, Wizards do at best 4 damage at level 1 and 6 damage at level 3, Magicians and druids do 3-5 damage.  This was defended by Verant claiming that Clerics “needed help” at lower levels (??)<br>
At level 5, Wizards do 14 damage with their best blast, while Druids do 22 damage, and Clerics do 16 damage with their nukes.  The Druid damage isn’t even defended, presumably the concept would be that it only works outdoors, but that is hardly justification for a 50% greater damage, more mana efficient blast.<br>
At level 34, Wizards do 306 damage, while Magicians are doing 319 damage.  The Mage attack is a bolt, which has its own limitations but if that was justification for such a discrepency in damage then EVERY level Mages get a bolt it should be higher than the Wizard blast... and its not. <br>
 <br>
-Add in more blasts per circle of spells. Dipping up to 15 levels for a type of attack is totally unacceptable, every level should have at least 2 types of attack spells.  (suggestions of how to do so follow)<br>
-Add in Lure spells at level 24 and 34 (magic and cold respectively). This is done for two reasons, primarily being that lures ignore the 6+/1.2x resist cap. The other reason is the scattered rare creatures who are immune to magic such as EXG in Solusek A. <br>
-Add in superfast casting low efficiency, lower damage blasts scattered through the levels; something like a 75 point blast at level 20 that costs 100 mana and casts at 1.5-2 seconds. <br>
-Add in HUGE superpower blasts that cast very slowly and take whale loads of mana with a long recast hold time (for example, 250 damage at level 20, but costs 300 mana and takes 6 seconds to cast, with a 1 minute hold time), these would be few in number, perhaps at level 29 and 39 only.<br>
<br>
These two blasts give not only a way to fill in the extra blasts per level called for, but also give Wizards greater utility with what they have. This would make Wizard DD significantly and noticably better to all viewers than other classes... having a bare margin if any with an ability nearly every other class has is not mastery... and its a poor concept for class design.<br>
<br>
-Scatter more AE types through levels so you have each type every other spell circle. That means more options and better progression. <br>
-Change Al'Kabor to have unlimited target maximum, their poor damage and mana efficiency negates the possibility of exploiting this for experience. <br>
-Extend the range of Wizard blasts to 300 instead of 200, so that Wizards clearly have an advantage in attack spells. <br>
-Add a no-damage interrupt spell that cast quickly but is resisted like a stun spell. If it worked, it would stop casting in the creature but not do damage. This would be most useful at higher levels, perhaps at level 34+. <br>
This one is iffy, but would definitely make us more attractive to groups. This would turn casters off more often than not, its something Bards can do at level 28 with Pixie Strike (mes/damage song interrupts spells). <br>
-Fix AE Rain spells to hit with up to 3 waves on each of up to 4 targets. <br>
This would likely require the more powerful AE Rain spells to be lowered in damage. <br>
-The alternative is to raise the level 5-50 AE rain spells to greater power and make them ALL single target spells. Having done so this would require more AE spells scattered where rain was supposed to fill the gap... and it would make Magicians much happier. <br>
-Scale up damage, so each Draught and Lure spell does more than the previous version post 50. <br>
-Move Sunstrike to level 53, add in a new more powerful (1800 pt) blast at level 57.  Too powerful in the old world? Tell that to the guys with all those keen weapons. You ARE level 60, after all, if I go into Crushbone at level 40, I am pretty powerful. <br>
-A possibility is to Remove the cap to damage adders to spells, so that they keep going up until level 60,  This would make Shock of Frost do an astonishing 64 damage at level 60 (ooh, game breaking - Conflag, by comparison would do 680). Why DOES Ice Comet and Rend stop giving more damage at level 50? <br>
-Make AE spells have a Line of Sight from their target, so they will hit things the target can see but the Wizard cannot. Is it an explosion or not?<br>
 <br>
DEFENSE<br>
-Add in a minor skin line below level 16 when Wizards are incredibly vulnerable and die the easiest of any class in the game. level 4 (Malachite (5 silver), 12 pts max protection) and 12 (Turquoise (1 gold), 30 pts max protection)<br>
-Fix shadowstep etc to work more reliably (a minimum distance of your level for shadowstep and making it port up and around objects would help, yonder having minimum distance of twice your level, for example). <br>
-Add in an escape gate spell that lets Wizards gate at 2-3 seconds for more mana than regular gate (150 mana, for example). Why wouldn't the masters of teleportation have this? <br>
-Add in an upgrade to Resistant Skin. <br>
-Add in an actual Magic Resistance self buff (why was this left out? Enchanters get BOTH the skin spell and the MR buff line for others)<br>
<br>
TELEPORTATION<br>
-Add personal gate to South Ro as well as a group gate. <br>
-Move WK porter to other side of zone.  Yes, the abscond puts you there now but really... this is just obvious.<br>
-Add in a fade-type spell that teleports a random (minimum 3xlevel) distance but within 90 degrees of facing either direction (in other words, you go forward, slightly left or right randomly but FORWARD). <br>
-Make Translocates (push ports) require the TARGET have a portal chip that is consumed, not the Wizard. Or just drop the silly portal chip idea entirely.<br>
 <br>
SEEKING KNOWLEDGE <br>
This is an area that Verant just jettisoned, which truly is sad. It can be worked on without giving Wizards ANY more power, but more use to groups and more rounded design. <br>
-fix Bind Sight to work like it used to (can target monsters not in your LOS). <br>
-Add in a swimming Eye of Zomm that can move through water at, say, 100 swim level, or simply make Eye of Zomm swim.<br>
-Lower Chill Sight to level 24 and Heat Sight to level 8. <br>
-Add in a spell that eliminates environmental clutter for Wizards (no snow, fog, etc) at level 29.<br>
-Add in a spell that makes water, blood, etc clear to see through at level 16. <br>
<br>
THE PAYBACK<br>
To get all these goodies and changes you have to give a little, and here's where I would do it: <br>
-Eliminate bonds of force and atols spirit shackles.<br>
-Eliminate planar gates and give to Clerics or make walk on only.<br>
-Eliminate Invis to Undead (why do we have this anyway? Clerics would feel better if we had it taken and it really doesn't fit the class).<br>
-Eliminate bolts (we'd have the range anyway and it would give Magicians something extra special looking and interesting unique to their class).<br>
-Eliminate all magnify/glimpse/gaze etc spells (they don't work anyway). If not this, then have THESE spells increase spell range while in use.<br>
<br>
This gives us a superior grouping class with poorer soloing ability, unique utility, and greater and more obvious level of superiority in attack power without being overpowering.  It would give Wizards more tools in combat at the cost of a few abilities.  Now if Verant took its &quot;similar ability in all areas&quot; doctrine to other classes besides Priest Classes (you note they only mean POST 55, their new break point of where they care about) then the snare wouldn't have to be removed and we wouldn't be significantly better at soloing if at all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 8/30/02 12:19:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzefirstormwatch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zefir stormwatch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/4/02 4:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance (No stupid ideas please)</span><hr size=1> I will submit that I dont believe increasing our damage output (as suggested) will balance Wizards, nor make us more desireable in groups. I do think it will help, but I also think there will need to be more done outside of Nuking abilites.<br>
<br>
It's far too difficult to compete with a Monk or Rogue (as someone referenced as our real competition), who doesnt have to med, in damage. The small increases suggested wont relieve this much at all. And I dont think these changes would distance Wizards enough from the other caster classes we'd compete with to make a difference either.<br>
<br>
As much as some people admire Wizards for the 'illusion' of our great nuking abilites, we arent taken into groups for those reasons. Post 50, most groups have taken my Wizard into a group for one of 3 reasons exclusive of my dmg abilities: snare, evac (TLs with this also), and as one more person to do dmg.<br>
<br>
In situations that can be managed without Evac, or already having a snarer (druid/ranger/etc), then a rogue or other high dmg melee class or more rounded caster class will be taken. A less expensive nuke or faster mana regen abilities, unless very very significant, doesnt help much against a rogue that doesnt ever have to med.<br>
<br>
So ... the small advances ask for just wont help much. Being too focused as a caster in one area isnt helpful considering the downside of mana recovery. And asking to remove certain abilites (Atol's) will cause us more dmg than good. Making us more rounded, perhaps in new areas, would help us, make us more desired.<br>

But that's not an option to Verant, so we have to look at what we have.<br>
<br>
What keeps our damage over time down?<br>
Aggro<br>
Mana Cost<br>
<br>
Fixing those two things IN OUR SPELLS would make our damage over time go up without more downtime.  Lowering mana cost by 10% or more on our spells would make our spells use less mana thus we could cast more with less downtime.  Lowering the base aggro or making concussion lower level and not a quest would help with aggro (or both).<br>

new spell line for wizards too. or at least broken lines like Al'Kabor and O'kiels fixed, the best to to deal with this melee/caster balance problem IS to nerf every item down to stats it would have had in kunark, other than VT/ssra/VP/ToV loot its all way too powerful(and droppable, urgh). i think some lower level right click items would help wizards alot, i have an icy wand and i find its great for finishing the very last bit of a quad or nuking when i'm oom, clicky items add quite a bit of DPH to a wizard. i think we really need more nukes, a greater variety to choose from than just
