to be perfectly honest, my problem started at 51, when i started looking at my 50-59 spells... all of them were less damage than a 49 spell... ive been moderately disappointed since then. <br>
<br>
i know a lot of you may say BLA BLA they are more efficient, but i will tell you one thing, it SURE took a lot of the fun out of it. IMO wizards have been castrated. we were made for burst damage, the game changed literally at that point. i became reliant on quadding for xp... and a lot of people may argue, but group desirability for wizards is pathetically low, and it's NOT just perception. the class is underpowered groupwise, decent soloers, and good clean DPS for raids.<br>
<br>
instead of the spells scaling normally after 49, they actually decrease damage until 60.. where you get ice spear and sunstrike(if you are rich or lucky). Throughout these 10 levels.. you only get a small damage increase per nuke for the excuse of increased efficiency. this is not viable. why? it changes our role in a group.. from the guy who can get rid of that last 20% with a couple of nukes so u don't have to worry about it running, to just another damage dealer. a damage dealer who can't tank.. who can't buff.  a wizard's nuke should NOT take less than a tenth of a mobs HP.. its SUPPOSED to be a NUKE, not a magic missile.. a lightning bolt, not a backstab.. it should be a SUNSTRIKE not a slap on the wrist. from a roleplay perspective this completely ruins being a wizard for me. Mages can nuke just as hard.. AND they have a pet. YES they are less efficient and they run out of mana quick.. but that doesnt mean they cant crit for 5k just like a wizard can. on top of that, they can summon lots of neato stuff. Both mages and rogues in most situations have higher DPS.. a wizard is completely and utterly dependent on his mana pool, and everything a wizard does besides nukes,evacs, and TLs is utterly useless.. the damage shields? alkabor line? wait, how about i levitate you!! (nm im out of batwings) any buffs that you can buff yourself with someone else can give you better.. any damage we deal.. can be dealt by another class, no huge loss.<br>
<br>
past 60 there are NO point blank AES.. NO more pillar spells.. and the nukes that we do get, while competitive, are still not good enough to make up for our other weaknesses. since my early 50s ive been COMPLETELY dependent on c3 and mage bracelets as well, with nothing to give in return but TLs, which are pretty useless now with PoP out.<br>
<br>
here's the breakdown.. what classes exist in groups in eq, not by names, but by roles<br>
<br>
tanks - warriors/paladins/shadowknights<br>
healers - druids/clerics/shamans<br>
crowd control - bards/enchanters/FD pullers..<br>
buffing/other group benefits -cleric/druid/beastlord/magician/shaman/shadowknights/bards/enchanters/necromancers/rangers<br>
damage dealers- beastlords/monks/rogues/magicians/necromancers/rangers/wizards<br>
pullers- monks/necros/sks can all FD to single pull, tanks to do other pulling<br>
<br>
everyone other than wizards and rogues have a use other than doing damage within a group setting. rogues arent limited by mana, and have at least SOME defensive skills.<br>
to spell it out for you all, every class which is not a necessary grouping class has abilities that make them desired in a group, a lot of which are unique to that particular class, EXCEPT WIZARDS. ALL non caster groups ive found, being 55+ usually on the planes have 3 NECESSARY roles<br>
tanks, clerics, slowers.<br>
the rest, usually is filled with whatever damage/ puller you can get, at least in my experience.. and wizards are usually the last chosen, not because our DPS sucks or anything, but because thats ALL WE DO. all a wizard does is evac and nuke... escape(and no group wants to have to escape) and damage.<br>
<br>
to put it simply, being a level 60 wizard... i feel i am at a significant disadvantage finding a group simply because of my class... our damage should be better to make up for the fact that we have absolutely nothing else to offer other players in a group setting. the way things are setup, if a wizard makes a mistake and dies (which isn't too difficult in PoP lemme tell ya) it causes a buttload of downtime, need c3 etc.. its as if a healer died. if its a rogue, just rez and go on. mages and necros have pets to protect them.. enchanters can mez. if a wizard gets aggro, he dies. being a wizard isn't easy by a longshot.. concussion tends not to want to cast when you are getting beat for 300+.. and if adds arrive, the mobs don't like you nuking their buddies AT ALL.. and a 20 second root is no solace, either.<br>
<br>
im dependent on c3.. i need to find a bracer when i log on.. with my selfbuffed 1498 hp i can't afford to pull aggro in any group situation.. 60+ solo XP SUCKS ASS it's much better in a group, i am ALWAYS lfg, with 3 or 4 other wizards trolling the planes LFG along with me.<br>
<br>
my proposed solution?? our nukes should be much bigger, not as efficient, and faster casting. 900 mana for 2500 damage in 4 seconds at level 60 sounds more like the wizard i wanted to be.. not this 'little bit better than ice comet' crap.. or 20k plat for sunstrike.. which STILL is just ANOTHER nuke thats a weee bit better! the mobs get 10 times the hp.. the wizards get 1.2 times the nuke. its just not fair.<br>
<br>
i want the ability to do significant damage in a short time back.. wizards don't have that at higher levels.. manaburn is a joke... giant bane is a joke(2dots to do 2k damage is way too expensive).. TLs are a joke.. if i wanted to be efficient, i would have been one of those tree hugging hippie druids. i never wanted to be efficient. i wanted to blow some crap up, not put a chink in ubermob1's hide with my puny wizard ice spear of the solist.. NUKE came from NUCLEAR.. and there's nothing nuclear about casting my biggest nuke and having it do 3%, thats for sure. wow, i blew off a finger. glamorous, isnt it? oo i critted, i got his hand! :-P<br>
<br>
our DPS should be noticably better than normal to make up the fact that we have no other abilities to help out with. the fact is, it's not. our DPS is balanced with other classes.. but we can't buff, and we have no other perks in regards to other classes. no wonder people call us petless mages. they get a 2k nuke at 61.. at 62, we get a 900 something nuke. at 63 we get agnarr's thunder, but by then their pet kicks so much ass it's not even funny.. nor fair.<br>
<br>
i hate having to log on, knowing that somehow along the line i went from nuker.. to glorified rogue/ petless mage. <br>
<br>
so much for blowing stuff up<br>

Wizards, like many classes, do have problems getting into groups.  Bottom line is that they we are not a required class; we are an afterthought in most exp groups.  At level 60 at least you have the ability to solo, and solo rather effectively, which is something most classes dont have.<br>
<br>
I have many problems with your judgment of our classes.  We are all about mana efficiency and that is the largest advantage you can bring to a group, sustained damaged.  I was a little disappointed with the fact mages got a bigger, vendor bought nuke at 61.  Actually, I wasnt really satisfied until I worked up my AA crits.  You are really off base with the bane spells; 20pp is a very small price to pay for a 2k irresistible damage spell that is only used on raids anyway.<br>
<br>
My advise would be to stop trolling the planes where you will always be in competition with higher level wizards.  Use concussion early and often, should prevent most aggro concerns you have, especially if the biggest thing you are throwing at the mob is IsoS.  Work on your AA skills, which are truly awesome, and you will regain much of your satisfaction with our class.<br>

We snare, and root for crowd control.  We burn things fast to prevent whipouts on over pulls.  What other class can lay the beat down as fast as us to save a group on a bad pull?  Not only that but the few non-selfish can really help a group get set up, and where they need to be for exp, Invis, Lev...  If the group needs additional scouting, our eye line of spells, or vision enhancment spells can be useful.  I can go on and on about what a wizard can contribute to a group.  Sure if you are in a good group, your primary purpose is DPS, and possibly a snare once in a while to prevent a turning mob from running far, but the main reason most of us solo'd from 50-60 was because who wants to have to kill 24 mobs in the same time that it takes us to kill 4 mobs alone by ourselves.  With as fast as Solo quading, or swam kiting can be conventional groups don't make sense unless you have moved to PoP. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">I'm the fire starter<br>

<br>
They played a totally different game. For example: They quadded in times, when you would get more xp for the same mobs then nowadays. That means, they could keep staying in xp zones for 3 more levels, then wizards can nowadays.<br>
They were getting groups in Sebilis and other indoors zones, because everyone was in those zones and the people needed a wizard to evac/port out, after xp was done or for emergency. Dead was costly for other classes, so they wanted a wiz to prevent dead.<br>
<br>
All that got changed the last few months. As wizard lvl 50 to 60, you HAVE to do quad kite, but you get way less then the old wizards. So it will cost you more money.(although the ancient wizards didn't had kei, the old ones did).<br>
All the melee/hybrid classes can buy loads of better gear in bazaar to overcome the xp penalty. A wizard not, because the only items u can have to improve yourself are basically the FT items, which are expensive and u can only get a few points in this way.<br>
<br>
People don't want a wizard below lvl 60 in their group, because to be honest, those wizards are a joke with damage dealing. All melee/hybrids have access to such cheap GOOD gear, that they beat easily a wizard in an xp group.<br>
<br>
On the good side: IF you are in a GOOD guild, got ALL your lvl 60 spells, have max. 15FT on items and are 60plus, then yes, you will be a damn good damage dealer. Hehehe, good luck getting all those IF's. <br>
I totally agree wizards are broken and that is mostly the wizards between lvl 1 to 59! They have really crappy spells and no option to improve themself for grouping with items.(extra int/mana items are only usefull for solo, because in a good group, you don't get a break to fill up to max. again)<br>
<br>
Nah wizards need more mana regen. Wizards should have innate crits, that do 2x damage as MINIMUM(like heal spells, insane that those always do double hp). Our aa points in crit should make the spells better then 2x.<br>
<br>
Give us some bigger nukes, put long casting time on it, who cares! We want spells that can kill a mob just before he get enraged. We want to be able to finish a fleeing mob with just 1 nuke, instead of doing 3 a 4 nukes.<br>
Put very short range on bigger nukes, so they can't be used for solo. <br>
<br>
Why can't a wiz even cast an improved invis on someone else or a group? Why don't we have group EB spells?<br>
Why don't we have jinx or luck buffs. So targets rolls higher or lower with every damage roll check?<br>
<br>
Is it soo difficult to come up with some things to improve wizards?<br>
<br>
Bah, why am i writing this anyway, most of these expert wizards really think wizards are totally ok(from their lvl 65plus 30plus aa view) Most of these people hardly played any other online rpg/action game then EQ. I suggest, you play some muds and then you will see how BAD eq is balanced with classes. It's really insane, that loads of muds have more classes/spells/skills more type of mobs options and are still better in balance. It's really insane that these games only have 1 to 5 people in charge? <br>
<br>
Don't forget EQ is just a mud with as extra 3d graphics, too bad it's out of balance really.<br>
<br>
Sometimes i don't think OUR class stinks, nah i think the problem is, that HEALS are too efficient. Our stun line is basically not that usefull other then spell interrupt. I think the main goal of this spellline was also to prevent damage,but why waste soo much mana on a stun, if a complete heal is like 20x as effective?<br>
<br>
Verant made all the heals just easier, so the majority of the people would have a bit more action per hour. Too bad they forgot to increase the other casters to keep the balance.<br>

Maybe I'm an old wizard, but in July 2002, I was still level 55. A month later I was 60th with 23 AA points. Now I'm 65th with something like 55 AA points and FT15 and the works.<br>
<br>
Sure, playing a wizard isn't a walk in the park like some other classes I've played. But to say we're vastly unbalanced against other classes is exaggerating too. All classes have their pros and cons. In the end it all boils down to your social network, you could play cleric (example) and still lack groups and exp and gear, if your social networking skills weren't excellent or if you couldn't play the class. I'm not saying any of posters here can't play wiz, but I'm still wondering why some people say wizards are useless and can't get groups and and and...<br>
<br>
I think wizards are great and that's why my 60+ warrior and cleric are collecting dust. I guess it depends on point of view, some people will never be happy with wizards even if we got &quot;Death Touch&quot; as a skill.<br>

Wizard DPS is 90% dependant on your AAs. From looking at your magelo the reason I think you think wizard's suck is because your lacking alot of AA. You need SCM3, SCF3, and SCFM3 in my opinion to be a real wizard. How long will it take to get that? Awhile, but your 60 and you still got the ability to quad ME, The Grey, Othmir, and even Raptors for xp. I on the otherhand am stuck killing 1 mob at a time using 75-100% of my manapool for a measily 4-7% aa. In that same time you could complete 3 quads of toilers for equal and even BETTER xp. I'd suggest getting your AAs then re-evaluating our class <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amadalianytefrost>Amadalia Nytefrost</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I agree</span><hr size=1> I'm a 63 wiz, and I agree they are broken.  I've been saying this same thing for 3 years now, though the main focus will change from time to time, its always the same complaints.<br>
<br>
First, why are the spells we get from 49 to 65 all just basically the same as each other?  We get a 950 nuke in fire, then ice, then magic, then we duplicate our efforts and give us more lures that are one in each class.  <br>
<br>
This is good, this means I can nuke in variety, and I LOVE it, but the truly sucky part?  The part that makes me want to bury my very beloved wiz and start playing my monk more?  The fact that without at least 60+ aa, I'm under the mages, druids, and half the other casters in damage.  Why should I have to get 60+ AAs to be what a wizard is SUPPOSED to be?  I didn't get the faster damage spells I expected, I simply got more of the same.<br>
<br>
I've been playing since 1999.  I've only ever had one true main, my wiz.  She was the first char I ever made, and the one I'll quit EQ with.  Why can't we have 2 options?  One line of spells that are not as efficient, fast, HIGH dmg.  Then another that is better than what we have now, mana efficiency pretty much the same across the board.  We are never going above that 4.12 mark without crits, without AA's, without focus items.  It shouldnt be that way for a wiz, damage is what we live and breathe for.  We should be able to do it.<br>

(using ice comet as a comparison)<br>
<br>
to just give you a general idea of the point im trying to make, here's a little of the math. we can all agree that past level 49 any pattern that might have been established was thrown out the window. original eq only went up to 50 or so, as far as i know..so its obvious that verant when adding levels over 50 increased efficiency and lowered damage so as to not let wizards become too powerful, to prevent farming im guessing..<br>
<br>
either way, my point, when looking at the numbers, is OBVIOUS. an icespear wizzy, such as myself at level 60 simply does not have a significant increase in the amount of damage they can do in a short period of time. 44-49 was an awesome damage gain. <br>
49-60? crap unless you happen to have gss lying around. of those rare spells. additionally, at 49 WITH ice comet most wizards would agree that around this level the mobs hps start to go through the roof.. so ice comet is actually needed to be able to keep up. it's completely  irresponsible to change the short-period damage of a class so that people don't complain. our 50-60 abilities were designed JUST to keep up. until 60, we don't get any more powerful, just more efficient. 51+ is practically a nightmare for a wizard trying to find a group.. simply because our nukes don't pack much of a punch anymore.. we don't make the same difference in a tight squeeze, and it takes 3 or more nukes to kill a running mob, not one. <br>
<br>
60-65 contains much more of a difference in wizard ability than 50-60 does. as far as i'm concerned our spell book is about 5 levels behind what it should be at level 60. ice spear should be at 55... sunstrike at 58, and GSS should be accessible at 60, and 60-65 should be left unchanged. this is a HUGE deal.. the spells are not support spells for a wizard, they are what he is all about. wizards dont get any other means to deal damage.. the DD should at least be decent, and not cost an arm and a leg.<br>
<br>
my whineyness isnt over the alternate advancement...or anything else. i love being a wizard. it's just insulting that a mage can vendor buy a nuke(though its a bolt) that deals more damage than sunstrike, which costs at least 10k. sure it's less efficient and requires line of sight.. but to mages, it would be as if flaming sword of xuzl quadded,was permahasted, and vendor buyable.<br>
<br>
wizards have but one way to deal damage in a group..nuke. it has suffered, to be brought in line with other classes abilities.. which is wrong, because those classes have other useful abilities too.. abilities that the wizard doesnt have.<br>
<br>
we SHOULD deal more damage to make up for lack of versatility.. we can't tank, pull, heal, or buff. those are important things to a group. if im to want a person in my group who can't do any of those things, he better deal some BADASS damage.<br>
wizards damage from 51-59 is far from BADASS. soloing should be optional, not mandatory.<br>
<br>
the class is flawed.<br>

<br>
I'm not really sure of your conclusions about not being able to burn down things faster, I guess it's all really subjective in what you call &quot;significant&quot;. Seems pretty obvious to me that wizards are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> masters at burning things down, even post 50 - you may be disappointed that nukes didn't scale up from ice comet - but nothing is holding you back from using that old pos as long as you like, it's actually still &quot;ok&quot; until you get DoI at 57 anyway.<br>
<br>
Big nukes are fluff anyway, numbers mean nothing - it's all in the accumulation of damage done over time.<br>
<br>
Try levelling a wizard from 1-60 pre-velious, pre-harvest, pre-KEI, pre-familiar, pre-aaxp, pre-focus items. You have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nothing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to complain about, not a THING - you won't ever know what not being wanted in exp-groups is until you try that.<br>
<br>
Wizards today output massive damage in groups, true you need to have gear - but do you think that rogues or rangers just are magically infused with 100dps weapons, then you have another thing coming to you. I grouped with a warrior in PoTactics without aa-skills - she had about 65dps (windblade) in uptime, and this was with her behind the mob and not tanking. Another warrior (me) had about 100dps while tanking and dual wielding hard to get weapons (bloodfrenzy and blade of carnage) with 200 aa points and all SoL offensive skills maxed. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370955 target=blank>Master Aauminki Iceblade</a></big><br>Vazaelle Server</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midgetgod>Midget God</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 377<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/22/03 11:19 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the class is flawed</span><hr size=1> I think Aaumninki summed it up nicely. Even the draughts you get in the 50s are HIGHER DPS than Ice Comet. The weakest of draughts will allow 28% more damage than Ice Comet. That means you can deal MORE damage, quicker with them. In addition, those draughts are approximately 11%-12% more mana efficient. The spells at 60 are even better, what more can you ask for?<br>

fact: post 50 your biggest nuke doesn't dent a mob<br>
fact<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> efore 50 it did<br>
<br>
im not talking about DPS.. im talking about DRN.. damage right now!! (haha i made a new acronym)<br>
DRN was something wizards used to excel at.. great crowd control.. if the mob needed to die RIGHT NOW u could kill it RIGHT NOW<br>
<br>
at higher levels this ability is COMPLETELY destroyed..<br>
<br>
it was what set us apart from other grouping classes before 50, when a wizard nuked, a noticable chunk of life disappears. if you are melee, u notice.. its like dammit i just started hitting it and the wizzie killed it!<br>
<br>
ever hit a drolvarg in DL with an ice comet? thats what made a wizzy a wizzy, not watered down more efficient nukes.. i loved grinding through 49 :-)<br>
<br>
THATs what made wizards desirable in earlier levels..<br>
they no longer have that DRN post 50.<br>
<br>
the damage wizards due at high levels is more like other classes now, it's simply not a big enough number to make a significant difference in a mob's total hp. there are many reasons for this i know, but the point is, if the mob turns tell and runs, no more can a wizzy simply destroy it. they chisel at it and take slivers out just like every other class. we are more like rogues at high levels, methinks.<br>
<br>
post 50 we are all about efficiency..<br>
pre 50 we were all about DRN, ya don't gotta snare and don't worry if the cleric goes out of mana, if it happens just let the wizzy finish the mob and THEN we can med. <br>
<br>
we all know the game is a joke in a lot of ways. theres FLYS that can kill me in a few hits. oh, and i dont EVEN get me started on hamsters in the hole.. when i first saw hamsters attack i laughed my ass off.. until i saw they were actually kicking some serious ass. phear the hamsters. so much for feeling powerful.<br>
<br>
VI and SoE are not gods.. they make mistakes.. and the classes are not balanced in the least bit. for example.. clerics are WAY too over powered, the healing they can do with one mana bar makes me want to cry myself to sleep. they can crit heal for 15k... they have the monopoly on the group healing bit. everybody loves a good cleric. if you are a good wizzie, everyone gets jealous and tries to have you nerfed :-)<br>
<br>
they change the game in response to feedback rather than the actual problems. they seek to make a tolerable gaming environment rather than an ideal one..<br>
<br>
and when they nerfed manaburn.. they not only did what was in the patch but axed the crits. a manaburn crit was my dream... /cry<br>
<br>
the giant bane quest was broken forever.. now that its fixed, i've gotten to use it only on 2 occasions, sure i did 20k damage to velk and vindi each, but that 20k damage cost me over 200p in dots.. who's going to pay for that? certainly not me anymore.. cuz i can't TL people for money like i used to.. i have this CRAZY INSANE crackhabit and my stinking bracelet that i love so much disappears whenever i log off..<br>
<br>
and LEAVE IT UP TO SoE.. soloing wraiths in PoN is good clean fun, but if they get close or snare runs out your are a spot on the floor.(pray they dont resist your snares/roots, too) they hit for over 300. there's no way to avoid it.. if you solo them, you are GOING TO DIE occasionally. tis the life of a wizzie.<br>
<br>
being a wizard i think is the most difficult class there is. maybe ive been just approaching this wrong. maybe i should appreciate the greater challenge, for greater satisfaction at the end. hopefully it will all be worth it when i have that FT15 and that 18% crit rate. <br>
<br>
but of SoE... they love not the wizards.<br>
trust them not. the dark side of the force are they of.<br>

In all respects better than what a scaled up nuke from Ice Comet would be.

Even Sunstrike is more efficient than that and GSS / Ice Spear / Elnerick's blows it out of the ball park.

They stacked all the big blasts at level 60 for some odd reason, and left us using AE Rain spells to make up the bill.  Why its acceptible for me to do 1800 damage with a rain spell at level 52 but SOE is terrified to put a bigger single target blast at those levels just mystifies me and probably always will.  At least they could turn the rains into single target spells - this would require a significant boost in their power below level 50 of course.<br>
<br>
Overall though I'm very happy with my Wizard after level 49.  Once you get your draught spells, you are literally hell on wheels, NO other class can equal your burst power in damage.  I can unleash thousands of damage in a matter of seconds and with concussion can do it with a decent chance of little to no aggro.  I cannot think of ANY class that can come close to Wizard damage output in an emergency in the 50s, we are just godawful to face.  This damage comes at a price, its mana and aggro, but the fact is, no game could survive if we could do that all the time without any penalties.<br>
<br>
Yes, anyone can see how weak and pathetic Wizards are until level 20 or so, and how they really need work until 49, and honestly it wouldn't take much to do the job, but its damn well never going to happen, not in this game.  Verant designed a class that they didn't want to be able to do what it was supposed to.  Their concept of the class and their concept of the game clashed, and the class took it on the goolies in that exchange.  They've done a lot since release, believe me (I've played Grimstaff since June 22, 1999) and I've seen the changes.  It was just a sad, sorry class before they put in a few little things, and for the most part it often is for some levels because the little things were too high level to help them.<br>
<br>
But I can't conceive of anyone complaining too much about how we work in the 50s, you just cruise through damage.  Yes, we can't power out too much punishment compared to Mages, but here's something that will astound some Mages unless they think through and read carefully what I say here: Past level 50 Wizards offer enough other stuff that they don't have to outdamage Mages as much to be balanced.  By the time you hit level 50 you can hit things other classes can't with blasts, you are much MUCH more mana efficient, you have a host of stuns and other items to help out.<br>
<br>
Should Wizards be looked at more?  Absolutely, but there's just no call for using the word &quot;broken&quot; not even a little bit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morgreth>Morgreth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/24/03 2:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: because..</span><hr size=1> Heh. This is a funny post. Why? Because its obvious you dont know how to play the class, or understand your role in Everquest.<br>
<br>
You want a bigger nuke then Ice Comet? Why? So you can see some really big numbers? 2 draughts at level 51 &gt; 1 ice comet, and you can cast them faster than 1 ice comet as well. You also will have less aggro from those two draughts as well. Ice Comet really only has two uses: Nagafen and.... bixies. For everything else it just plain sucks. You go LoM too fast, and at your levels your mana regen sucks. So... you will actually wind up doing LESS damage if all you use is Ice Comet. Wizards are supposed to be smart, intelligent planewalkers that know almost everything there is to know. And we get the big ass nukes too. But we really dont get the great big nukes till 60, 63 and 65. When you have learned quite more about the class.<br>
<br>
Wizards are not push button robot characters whose only contribution is a big nuke. Our contribution is our intelligence, foresight, knowledge and the ability to do just about everything every one else can do. Except heal. But, since we are smart, we dont need to heal because.... we are smart enough to not get hit!<br>
<br>
So... learn your class better. And yes, I disagree with just about everything you said.<br>
<br>
Level 50 is not the end all be all of Wizards, level 65 is, untill they change it. When Kunark got released, the level bar was raised quite a bit for all the classe <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23771">Morgreth Arcane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

When I can't get a group for hours on end, and I can't earn enough exp solo to see exp bar move, wizzies are broken.  I'm plenty happy with my damage output, I just wish I could get a group to use it and earn some AA's.  Someone said the old timers don't understand.  (its true..i'm an old/new timer)  They have nerfed the exp from quads that you all enjoyed when you leveled.  Raptors are crap, can't do Chromatids in SF anymore, ME is usually to busy to be effective...ect...  What wizzies need are spells that make us wanted by groups.  Something we can offer that would make a group want us.  All classes can DPS, so thats not unique.  We need some sort of buff, or unique ability.  (evac is not unique...druids can do it..and they can heal..have better snare...can make it stop raining...blah blah blah)  I'm haven't stopped playing.  Not by a long shot.  But it sucks being alone all the time or being forced to only do guild groups all the time.  If something doesn't change, I may have to move exclusivly to my shaman..and least he can earn some exp and get a group.  How about this?  A new spell that lets us translocate/port people to OUR binds.  Its a start....<br>
