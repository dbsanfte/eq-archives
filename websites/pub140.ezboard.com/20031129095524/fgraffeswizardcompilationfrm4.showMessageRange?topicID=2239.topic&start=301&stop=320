Reply   I hate to bring this up...<br>

 I hate to bring this up because of the serious can of worms it might open, and it might *gasp* derail the thread.. but why not!<br>
<br>
Furor regularly 3 boxes by playing two clerics on raids - one of which he's levelled himself (Froglok) and the other has been a guild account since Velious I wanna say.. not sure about that, but he's had a major part in levelling that one post-60 with AA's. Has 80ish AA on one and 100+ on the other, with all the goodies (D.Arb, bestow DA, all the jizz). Great gear too.<br>
<br>
How bout it Sam? Using your rules that's still a &quot;legal&quot; setup. How would you go about beating him with 2 clerics? Just curious. <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Ya if he pays for the accounts and runs them at the same time himself on 3 computers (or in windows on fewer) is fair. He might win in that case, but he might not. Ill still rapture the warrior but I could not kill the warror easy unless I am able to rapture both the clerics, and that not easy before the raptures wear off on the warrior. If I can kill the warrior with no loss the clerics should be no problem. Basically I would have to instakill the warrior after I rapture him. I do about 5000HP in damage in pvp with a burn and then 3 lures is like another 1800. Not really up to the instakill Furor task yet, but by the time EQII rolls around I should be.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

Not to mention, scoring 800+ and 900+ dps with 2-boxing my chanter and wizard was ridiculously easy. Charm a mob, equip it and haste it, chain nuke with wiz and off you go. Only problem is, that doing that I managed to get AA only every 35 mins and spots were often camped.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">I can charm also, charm is kinda unfair and shouldn't count but if you can do it then so can I, I'll still out do you with the extra 3 wizards and 1 cleric.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<br>
PS. Wizards were single boxing, single nuking dark blue mobs to death when you were still trying to find your way around noobstarttown00. There are tons of mobs in game that have less than 9k hitpoints for wizards who are 59. And if you weren't first one with manaburn, someone most likely to beat you to 'your' server first, they just aren't bragging about it here, because they know how simple and meaningless such server first is. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">I did it mob after mob.... not just one shot and move on, and thats been nerfed also. Maybe server wide first to instakill 6 dark blue mobs in a row inside of one minute or something then</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

 I hate to piss on your little parade there Sam but in my AE groups I easily outdid your piss-poor 766 DPS, try 44k-77k, over 1 minute.<br>

It's all he has vs. all you have....don't fucking cry because you only have 1 character and he has 6. Don't whine and say it's unfair.<br>

I don't think people should whine that it's unfair either. However most of these people don't play on PvP, and aren't in a position to fear him. <br>

<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Ya I notice none has challenge my claim to the nuke/rapture thing heh... Right you have submitted items to lucy and Allak but did YOU kill the mob that had that item, by yourself, I kinda doubt it. Its everything you have in the game against everything I have in the game, ok you got items as part of a guild thats fine as they are your equipment, but to say YOU submitted items to lucy isn't right, because without 50 other people the mob would have killed you. <br>
<br>
Im just rating the best as to who has the most personal ingame power (i.e. you can only use accounts that you pay for), roughly based upon who has highest dps, who can kill the higher level mobs, who can win in duels/pvp, who just has the strongest toons basically.<br>
<br>
All the advancement you do is for the purpose of getting more exp and better gear, if you complete such and such quest or go to Plane of Time or kill UberMob001 its all for the same purpose to make your toon stonger with better gear or more exp. My point is that if you only have one toon, even if that toon has every AA point, and the best item in every slot, you are still less powerful in most every measureable way then my 6 toons.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

And if I use that 250 mins, I get total of 20 AA grouped compared to Sam's total of 6 AA. When I solo for 250 min, I get 9 AA compared to Sam's 6. So single boxing is at least 1.5x more efficient than 6 boxing when it comes to exp hunting.  <br>

That's the worst example of logic I've ever heard. So you're the 4th best, not because of your knowledge, any measure of skill, or any tangible deeds done, rather, you're the 4th best because you can press 2 buttons or trigger a macro that does it for you?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Im 4th best because I have (so far I am sure there are 50 or so multiboxers out there who I dont know about) the 4th strongest in game force that I know of.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
by your logic, you're saying that 6 pieces of lead are worth more than one bar of gold. GO GO Gadget logic!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">By my logic 766dps or 7.2percent of an AA per minute is way better then what you can do.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

Its less work to make conclusory argument then actually say something that has to do with everquest mechanics. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Stop using the thesaurus because you're hardly making sense.<br>
<br>
You know very little about the mechanics of everquest. You do know alot about macro building. Don't confuse the two.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">I know how to get more total exp points then you by X4 or X5, at a rate of like X3. Heh</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

When you've accomplished or been along for a third of the things that Furor has, perhaps THEN you'll know something about the mechanics of EQ. Until then, you're just a dreamer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">When Furor can beat me with everything he has in the game he has against everything I have in the game then Ill probably quit to lose to such inferior competition.<br>
<br>
Hey by the way when Furor 3 boxes his warrior and 2 clerics on raids does he get 3 X DKP?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
