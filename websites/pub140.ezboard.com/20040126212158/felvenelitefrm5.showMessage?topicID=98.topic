&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp i am sitting at a head of a master table. twin cream candles burn with a deviant grin at the base of a tall, slender and clear vase of dead red roses near the midsection of the table. atop a fading oak floor and then a furrowed red rug with golden fringe are four dark and ornate chairs with vivid violet cushions. the legs of the chairs are worn smooth and join the bloodsoaked carpet in dragon's talons clenching small, smooth spheres. i sit in one of these demoniacal thrones with arms splayed straight out in front of me, with my chin resting on my left, atrophied bicep. a tall glass of slender clarity sticks broken into my fingers as i stare at a solemn white feline staring my way at the other end of the vast table. she looks at me with a certain audacity. she casually glances into my deep, locked soul, as so many are able to do so easily; and I erratically discover the meaning of life. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp i am in a forest now. i am on my knees in the midst of a bamboo grove. all about me, bamboo pierces the sky. a light snow has begun to fall eternally. fallen shoots and leaves lay about me as more twirl majestically down from above. a deep blue seeps down between every leaf and every branch, as far as i can see through the misty snow. a full moon radiates above me, shining with a brilliant omniscience through the turmoil prevalent in every direction. i rise to a short hunch, a kind of stoop, and i cherish a small trinket which is unseen within the clutches of my body. i peer in every direction around me, as if i am eagerly looking for something. i glance in every direction several times but never cease to search. i make a pass behind my back and to my right and i see what my heart desired. a tall, slender girl is standing beside a bamboo tree, grasping it with her right hand. her hair is dark, long and is floating in the wind with a calm sublimity as if everything were beneath the waves. her deep, beautiful eyes contain the sadness of the world, but with a thirst for life which is subtle, and has been all but forgotten by everyone else. she peers at me with a faint allure which she knows i cannot resist. i lift my right leg from its cringed angle below me and take a step. my head is still turned to face her, but i move slowly away, never blinking. i take a slow crescent path through the fallen leaves and approach her from the side, forever will i be lost in her. the snow has begun to fall faster now, with an almost certain ache to leave the heavens from whence it came. still i cling to a small, unseen treasure. i am close now, just in front of her, with my frosted hands held tightly closed between us. i shake her gaze and stare at my sealed hands, and she does the same. i remove a finger and there is darkness within my hands. slowly, i crack my frozen fingers apart and reveal a warm, beating heart.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the forest floor falls away behind her and opens up to a boundless green field of faeries and sun. she watches me as i bound backwards in disillusion as the newfound utopia opens up before us. i glance at her and then point delightedly to the lands behind her, but she does not turn. the once warm heart in my hands is now dead and frozen and it falls carelessly to the forested ground and shatters into nothingness. the girl standing before me glances deep within my soul, so easily she does it, and then turns away and walks crestfallen into the land of living wonder.<br>

<br>
Illistyl was a hunter, and for two centuries, her existence had been as pure and empty as any predators. She fed when she was hungry, grew fat when food was plentiful and lean when times were hard. She held her territory against trespassers, but retreated from fights where she might be killed. And in this long and empty time she knew peace from the worries of her long existence. There were many months where she went without the burden of a single thought.<br>
<br>
But she could feel the seasons changing, and the beast within her knew it to be more than the turning of the year. She smelled the wind and was uneasy. She gazed up at the stars with her elven eyes and saw disorder. She slept restlessly, and her dreams were not visions of hunter and prey, but memories of the time before this time.<br>
<br>
Yet, her heart rejected the urges of her instincts, and she curled deeper into her empty dream if a simple, animal life. Let the stars fall into disorder; let the wind blow rich with strife. What could a beast do In the face of fate? Illistyl went on with her simple fantasy, heedless of more complicated urges. And then, one morning, she gazed into a half-frozen, burbling brook and told her reflection what she felt in her heart and knew to be true, “He has gone away.” The trees of the snow-covered forest rustled overhead, scoring her words. “You’ll not see him again.” Her eyes beheld the sun’s light off the crystalline ice, and she felt a grief that she had never known for more than two-hundred years.<br>
<br>
Illistyl dropped to the ground in silence, her silver armor glittering in the dawn sun. She was on her knees in the golden light and shadows and stared at her reflection in the water. “My dear, sweet ranger, I forgot tell you....that I love you.” Her own crystal blue eyes stared back at her as she ripped the tiara from its tangled nest of golden hair, seeing for the first time in decades a tear-streaked face. Bracing her hands in the frozen stream-bank, she sobbed, and burning tears mixed with the icy water below.<br>
