<br>
Just figured I'd quote this and say, this is true.  It's all perseption, same with wizards and any other class that is seen as below the number one rank in something.<br>
<br>
People have a mind set of why get the second or third best when we can have the best.  And when there are only 6 group spots, alot of people fall in the second or third best spots.  Now sometimes by necesity people will settle for second best but in pick up groups some spots people will never let a percieved second or third best class have a shot even though they can fill the shoes effectively. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1348<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 4:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> When groups start getting overpowered vs mobs they start moving from choosing primary classes to all-rounders.<br>
<br>
Did inner last weekend with a druid prime healer, worked perfectly and got more xp than if we'd had a cleric. This is one of the big problems clerics face - they can heal the best but often that healing simply isnt needed. And they cant solo.<br>
<br>
People arent dumb. We are right on the cusp of druids vs clerics prime healing balance atm. On PoV and under, druid is preferred for better xp/hour (esp. if you have a pally for resses and shaman rather than chanter). On Tier3+ clerics probably are still better no matter what, though even there druids can be preferrable in a strong group.<br>
<br>
This represents about as good a balance as is possible in this complicated game. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 6/11/03 4:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 8:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1>  Druids heal pretty well in Tier 3 as well, Tactics, HoH, BoT, the other extra skills they bring, drops the mobs quicker so not as much healing is needed.<br>
<br>
 Im not sure how the AE's are in elemental planes but Druids should be able to handle it depending on the group make-up. Clerics can make life easier with people who have less hp, so-so gear and if burn a little more than I should.<br>
<br>
 I think the poster a few post back was being a little unrealistic, in a pickup group a Cleric will be picked first over almost any class. People usually start by making the group with a Cleric because they think it will bring in the fastest exp, while it is possible it may, you can get exp as fast with a Druid healing.<br>
<br>
 Before the Mini-Ch went in and the PoP spells were added it was obvious that Druids needed an upgrade, now they can hold their own. It may be pointless to continue much longer, Druids have it in their mind they suck and no one will be able to convince them otherwise, just hope SOE does not listen to some of their insane suggestions before they realize how good  they have it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rexlar>Rexlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 9:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Since soloing was nerfed and we wizards are a good soloing class don't we need lots of stuff too?<br>

Tons of people played wizards for the ability to solo, do loads of damage, quad for xp, etc.  Now there's an overabundance of wizards making it difficult for all of us to get groups.<br>
<br>
Evidence to support this.<br>
<br>
PoK - This made our secondary ability, next to nukes, nearly worthless.  We were not compensated in any way.  I used to be able to get groups at times because people wanted to go somewhere to xp.  Not anymore, they just click on a book.<br>
<br>
Nerf of solo xp - They could have simply increased the group bonus.  Instead they chose to make soloing less attractive, even though grouping was already more attractive than soloing.  No doubt about it, xp in BoT in a good group was better than solo, and with that comes a chance at loot.  I would never pass up a group to solo, most wouldn't.   Is this change going to get us groups?  Doubt it.  Really really doubt it.  There's still too small of a percentage of core classes that are necessary for a group and too many filler classes.<br>
<br>
Recast time nerf - This hit us harder than any other class as we could use our flux staff to increase our dps.<br>
<br>
Horse nerf - As a soloing class wizards benefitted most from horses.  Because we needed models on all of us who had cheap horses could no longer use them for quadding/kiting.  And many of us can't afford 100k horses.<br>
<br>
No new pillar spells - Sure, we could still quad with our old ones, but by not giving us new ones they definitely made quadding less attractive.  Lots of wizards I know solo mobs now.<br>
<br>
Manaburn nerf - No nerf to death touch or lifeburn.  Hrm.  Man it sickens me to watch an SK in a group DT for 7k every how every often it is, and it's really often.  That ability is SIGNIFICANTLY better than my manaburn, and it's not nerfed.<br>
<br>
Ok, you can argue that there are some great enchancements we get from focus effects.  BUT....  how many wizards have ID4?  Or any form of anger item for that matter?  How many have MP4, preservation of xegony?  Etc, etc.  Not many.  The majority of us have been nerfed and screwed.  They want to dwindle our numbers.<br>

the retards that somehow think that they are trying to trim the wizard population.<br>
<br>
How often did wizards bitch about port beggars, then we get pok and you whine about not having people to port.<br>

Recast time isn't a big deal, its not a nerf, its fixing a bug in code.<br>
<br>
Horse nerf isn't a nerf, its fixing a bug, again.<br>

manaburn: play something past PoI and you will figure out why manaburn was nerfed, understand other classes and you will figure out why HT and lifeburn weren't.<br>

As many have said before it is perception, many think, yes we got to have a cleric, and will not try another healing, some are still stuck in the old school of thought about wizards. When you do get groups it is your chance to change this perception, show how useful you are and make them think they need your DPS. <br>
<br>
Personally I do not have trouble finding a group when I want them but I have spent a long time grouping as well as soloing, from time to time it may be hard to find a group but I think every class has those days.<br>
<br>
 I do not think all the changes were directed at any one class in regards to soloing, SOE for some time now has wanted people to group and it is about time.
