And then you tell me if you'd keep playing if the same happened to you.  WARNING: long and compliated, possibly boring post follows:<br>
<br>
There we were, happily ripping through the TimeB mini-ring events with two kill squads of 18 each.  On one side, you had Furor's team, on the other, mine.  We were to do the &quot;water&quot;, &quot;undead&quot;, and finally &quot;fire&quot; rings, while Furor's team was hitting the &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;air&quot;.  This was post-gflux nerf (removal from the zone).  It used to be, you could gflux over a wall and pull one ring to another.  Now, we couldnt do that.  However, we could still target and cast on mobs in adjacent rings.  To more accurately show you what I'm talking about, I offer <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://showeq.nothing-inc.com/~sparr/pop/potimeb.iso.jpg" target="top">this map</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> as a reference.  Notice the five brownish areas in the top picture, on the right hand side?  Those are the locked doors of the five ring events - we assume they open when all five are defeated.  Notice how close each area is.  Also notice the area just to the left of the 5 rings (past the locked doors), as it is important.  I'll get to that later.<br>
<br>
We proceed to defeat the water ring easily and start pulling undead.  Furor's team defeats the rock ring.  We defeat the undead ring from the water area.  Furor's team is pulling and eventually defeats the air ring from rock.  Get the picture?  We weren't killing the rings where they spawn.  So as we start pulling the last and most difficult ring, fire, we notice there's a problem.  The mobs split, and instead of spawning where the &quot;parent&quot; mob dies the split instead spawns inside the fire ring.  Lots of annoying pulling going on, and a few get stuck outside the locked door, in sorta no mans land.  We damage some of these mobs via spells.  The mobs summon some of us outside (past the locked door), to a place we can't get to.  Now, mind you, we didnt camp through walls, use horses, gflux or anything else - a MOB SUMMONED US.  After those mobs die, those people camp out (thus getting ported to the graveyard area, and then rejoin us later) instead of hanging out in that area past the locked door. More on this later.<br>
<br>
Furor's team kills Air.  We pull the last guard before fire boss, and as we're fighting it an &quot;undead protector&quot; spawns ON our main tank. Now if you've been paying attention, you know that we were in the water ring - not the undead ring.  You'll also understand that splits (even though this wasn't a split) don't behave this way.  For those wondering, undead protectors are the guardians of the undead boss.  They flurry for 1100 - same as Avatar of War.  Remember, we are already fighting a mob, and have 18 total people in the room.  It proceeds to kill us all one by one.<br>
<br>
How did the mob get there?  You guessed it.  A GM spawned it.  CONSPIRACY THEORY you say!  FoH are the biggest group of paranoid people to think that would actually happen!  Nope.  Bzzzzzt.  Wrong.  Furor had a talk for about an hour with the GM and later a developer as to what they had done and why they did it.  Their reasoning was twofold.  1) We weren't doing the events as intended, and 2) we had people in areas they shouldn't have been.  First, we weren't doing them as intended?  Every day, 1000x a day, people pull the mobs like we were - using either eye of zomm or proximity aggro to grab and pull them in.  Ever fought Hydrotha in powater?  I bet you pulled it away from its lair to seperate the adds.  Ever fought Tormax or Derakor anywhere other than their lairs?  Ever fought ANY mob where you aggroed it though a wall, targetted it with eye of zomm, or otherwise found some clever way to seperate it from it's protectors/adds?  Yep, you were cheating according to this developer.  Second, the issue with some people being where they shouldn't have been.  Uhm the mob SUMMONED them there.  They didn't go there using any sploit such as wallcamping, horsesploitz, gflux or the like.  I repeat, the mob summoned them.  Evidently we shouldn't have let it summon us. <br>
<br>
For these crimes, we had an AoW clone spawned on us intentionally with one sole purpose.  To kill the raid, and thus make us wait another four hours to try again.<br>
<br>
After 4+ years of developers watching our every move - from the first Vox/Nagafen kills, to Trakanon, VP, Kael, ToV, you name it - I can probably name a time where in some way, this exact same thing happened to us - either the zone crashed, we were mysteriously trained with mobs, or had them spawn on us, or something happened.  Then, the next day the zone is patched and we've found something different.  It's nothing new.  A few times we've verified through one channel or another the direct cause was a GM or developer shutting us down because we thought of something they didn't.  It's funny to hear from someone with showeq tell me how many devs are in the zone.  I remember once at Emperor, hearing that we had no less than 6 GMs in the emp chamber with us.  It's smart of them to watch - I don't blame them for that.  But to intentionally hinder us from defeating content because we were doing something they didn't think of is just absurd.  <br>
<br>
Now, let me turn full circle and ask the question again.  After enduring this kind of treatment, coupled with that message directly from SOE claiming we hadn't beaten the &quot;real&quot; Rathe, isn't there a point where you just say &quot;enough's enough&quot;?  The answer is yes. <p>Frozboz D'Sospes - Fires of Heaven, Veeshan</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=samdeathwalker>Sam DeathWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 521<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 1:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sam DeathWalker RoXoR's yur BoXoR's</span><hr size=1> Well very well written post.<br>
<br>
Humm I see why they nerfed GF.... Looks like eye of zomm/talon gonna be made to not be able to target mobs also.... I never did either of those, target a mob though the eye..... <br>
<br>
&quot;Ever fought ANY mob where you aggroed it though a wall, targetted it with eye of zomm, or otherwise found some clever way to seperate it from it's protectors/adds?&quot; <br>
<br>
but ummm lets see agro mobs through walls? I have never done that, yet you make it sound like a standard stratagy. Isn't an exploit something that reduced your risk to about zero, can the mob attack you through the wall? If it can't then you are attacking it from a spot where it cannot hit you, thats always been considered an exploit similar to a pathing exploit. Well if you can hit the mob with spells through walls and the mob cannot do the same to you I would surely call that an exploit.<br>
<br>
These mobs you attacked from an adjacent ring could they attack you without summoning you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, mind you, we didnt camp through walls, use horses, gflux or anything else&quot; - I don't know these are &quot;advanced&quot; stratigies or exploits? I'm not really sure what they are.... <br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know, I think that some might argue that these are clear exploits whereas others will claim they are clever stratiges.... I don't see where its so unbelivibly clear that VI is doing you wrong. <br>
<br>
Well I very seriously doubt that WoW is going to solve anything like this. Ya the GM killed your raid, I dont doubt that. It seems to me it comes down to; Could the Mob hit you where you were standing when you pulled it, if it couldn't then you are taking zero risk and thats an exploit, if it could well thats risk heh..... <br>

I am 100percent sure that showeq is consider illegal and that people who used it have been banned from the game. I don't consider it illegal cause its available to everyone but VI considers it illegal. I know that 1/2 the members of the top guilds on Sullon use it and if FoH or others use ShowEq then you have nothing to say, ruining a single raid wasting 4 hours of your time is a slap on the wrist if anyone at that raid was using showeq and giving information to raid leaders as to what to do or what to expect.<br>

Thats because you are a newbie Sam.  You have never taken part in killing something at the end game, all of your 'knowledge' is completely worthless because you have never stepped foot into an end-game raid.  You have less knowledge than most level 25 people I know, and certainly have no understanding of the end game. Your above point proves that you have never even gotten close to killing Emperor, and thats a couple expansions old now. It's content that was completed over a year ago, and you have no fucking clue what it requires.<br>
<br>
You are the very definition of Newbie. You are so ignorant, you can't even contemplate what you are ignorant about.  You make Valtser look like he actually has a clue what the hell is going on!  God damn I wish ezBoards had an ignore function. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derangedcreature>Deranged Creature</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 3:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FOH and others complaining about EQ......</span><hr size=1> Sam talks to much <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 990<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 4:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FOH and others complaining about EQ......</span><hr size=1> So Sam has never aggroed a mob and taken it away from it's spawn point for easier kill.

Made some of my questions answered.<br>
<br>
Aye I did the Eye of zomm trick before. Good place to practice is against luclin ( ok forgot name... the one that looks like a mini TiV ). Just summon eye, target him and pet class or... me send a pet to agro him. Usually you need a key to open but you can do without in here. Agro through wall via proximity, well uh... if you been in BoT this happens VERY often which is rather unpleasant.<br>
<br>
Sad to see how the devs simply destroyed the raid because FoH was not doing it as they intended... DOH. Blocked by other guild is one thing but blocked by the DEVS themselves is another. No wonder Furor and FoH are upset.<br>

<br>
As for the showeq thing - for one, that pic has nothing to do with it.  It's not my site, nor anyone in my guild's to my knowledge.  I've had the whole site bookmarked since PoP began, and use it as a reference when entering any PoP zone.  More maps can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://showeq.nothing-inc.com/~sparr/pop/" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> if you want to take a look at other zones.  Again, I have no idea who made them.<br>
<br>
As for the implication that 1/2 of FoH use showeq, well that's absurd.  I believe a handful do - maybe 2 or 3 - that's all.  Maybe no one does anymore.  Can't be sure.  It's not a topic of daily discussion. <p>Frozboz D'Sospes - Fires of Heaven, Veeshan</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=apollohades>Apollohades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 8:57 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> So Sam, how's about that apology to Furor? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://forcesunknown.homestead.com/files/ap-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Just seems odd that the files url has ShowEQ in its name, I guess just some random letters or something, where did that map come from anyway, is that some new VI product or something? I bought the Atlas but didnt see that in it. <br>
<br>
Yes I pull mobs all day long but not from spots where the mob cannot hit me. I pull with slow and if I dont run as fast as I can I die a few rounds later.<br>
<br>
I don't claim to have the slightest knowledge of the end game, but I have killed a lot of mobs, getting 6 toons to the level I have takes a lot of dead mobs heh, and I havn't yet had to pull a mob with the eye target (although I did use the eye to pull when you could use if for that). I use pacification to pull in crowded areas. <br>
<br>
I look at that map and wonder how does a mob get from one &quot;trial&quot; to the other. If you &quot;through the wall with eye&quot; pull from an adjacent room does the mob run through two closed doors to get to you or what? So FoH killed the mobs in the room they FoH were in by pulling one at a time and not by using spells through the walls to kill the mobs in the room that the mobs were originally in right? <br>
<br>
This is kinda like doing the Trial of Execution from somewhere outside of the trial room and pulling mobs one at a time to you from a safe spot outside the trial room.<br>
<br>
So you last 4 posters take the positon that FoH was doing nothing wrong and VI is clearly out of line.....?<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me make one statement. WoW will have nothing to do fixing a &quot;problem&quot; of this type. What game designer is going to leave a easy to beat high end encounter in the game, and what kind of game would it be if they did.<br>
<br>
And none of you have responded to the part about if the First Guild to do an encounter finds some simple way to do it the first time they try, should they be allowed through and then should VI change the encounter (or not change it and leave it trivial for everyone) to make it harder for others - is that fair?<br>
<br>
Its a public forum, I'll comment on anything I feel is of interest - if you disagree well go ahead. Im on a pvp server and my goal is to win at pvp, not to get into the Plane of Time, on a Blue Server the goal is to get into the Plane of Time. I'll still beat my oppenents in PvP even if I dont get into teir 4 ever, and thats my goal.<br>

<br>
You are the coolest person ever.  No, I'm serious.  I think everyone here acknowledges your superior knowledge of game mechanics.  Granted, this is mostly because you act a good deal like the child who makes up rules during a game and runs away with the ball if people don't listen to him, but I suppose you have to take your victories where you can get them.<br>
<br>
Grats on noticing the &quot;showeq&quot; portion of the URL that Froz posted.  No, I'm serious.  I've always been under the impression that PvPers are almost exclusively illiterate.  Thank you for proving once and for all that at least one &quot;omg die blubie scum&quot; elitist bastard has a modicum of reading comprehension.  Too bad that modicum failed you when it came to understanding why FoH left.<br>
<br>
We're very interested in hearing about how you wasted ten hours of your life gaining 1/3 of a level.  No really, I'm serious!  Most &quot;blubie cowards&quot; who &quot;couldn't pvp their way out of a paper bag&quot; are absolutely enthralled by tales of running to a zone, dying on the way there, killing things slowly and constantly looking over your shoulder for other players.<br>
<br>
One final note:<br>
<br>
