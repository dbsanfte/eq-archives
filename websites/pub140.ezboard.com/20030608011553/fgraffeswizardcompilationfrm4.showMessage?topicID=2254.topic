I have called technical support. I am fortunate, in that a human has actually answered the phone after a very short wait. There is a reason this person is being paid to do that job. I am not being paid to do that job. Therefore, I should respect his or her opinion.<br>
<br>
They may sound polite when they ask, but nothing they say is a request. To wit, everything that the technical support agent asks me to do is an imperative. I will do everything they ask me to do. I will not question the validity. I will not question their intelligence. I will not question their lineage. It does not matter that I do not understand why I am being asked to do this, because again, I am not being paid to do this, and he or she is. If the technical support agent thinks that my computer will work better if I stand on one leg while holding a walnut wrapped in tinfoil to my tongue, I will do so, because they are paid to do this, and I am not. It is not my place to question the intelligence of technical support.<br>
<br>
I will be courteous. I will be respectful. I will understand that this person is doing that job because they like to help people. I will understand that this person deals dozens of people every day, and will forgive them for not remembering me when I spoke to them for 30 seconds 3 months ago. I will realize that this person is helping me because they want to, not because of my stellar personality. I will, however, make every effort not to annoy them, because I understand that when I annoy them, it makes everybody's tech. support experience worse. Technical Support agents are people, too, and deserve to be treated as such.<br>
<br>
At this point, I have two choices: I can accept this creed, and do as my technical support agent tells me, or I can hang up, and call back when I am prepared to do so. If I don't like it, I can order a pizza, and forget about the computer for a night. The technical support agent can do anything he or she wants, because their computer is not broken. Therefore, I will try not to incur their wrath.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

The tech support person wants to clear as many calls as he/she can in an hour, because that is what their boss has the ability to track, and thus rates them on, which means they want to tell me to do something, hang up, and call again if that thing didnt work.<br>

<br>
There is an exception.<br>
<br>
Sometimes hardware is broken or setup incorrectly. Usually after some frustration I figure this out, and have no choice but to call tech support to get the thing replaced/fixed/whatever. Then I get quite annoyed. Tech support treats everyone that calls like an idiot. Not that I blame them for this, most of the people that call ARE idiots in respect to computers, but there needs to be a secret code to tell them I am NOT an idiot, and probably know as much or more than they do. This would help both of us, they would spend less time on the phone, could maybe point out something that is non-standard or screwy that may be causing my problem, and ultimately the whole thing would be resolved quicker.<br>
<br>
As an example, when my DSL service was installed, it didn't work. I could get a sync, but got absolutely no response of any kind off the DSL line. I knew for a fact that the problem was on their end, that they had hooked up the DSL line incorrectly. Despite this I had to talk to at least 3 people, 2 of which were complete morons, before they finally got a line tech to test the line. Then I had to REPEATEDLY tell them YES THE DAMN MODEM IS SYNCED, because they repeatedly tell me that they do not see me as synced. Finally, after hours of talking, they agree the line is incorrectly hooked up, and fix it in a couple days. This is why I do not agree, I'm sick and tired of being treated like a moron by tech support.<br>
<br>
Still I do agree that most people that call tech support know far less and/or are dumber than tech support and so for those people I do agree, just not for everyone. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=332154">Veridiac</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I'm not suggesting you give Comp 101 to people who think AOL is a processor speed. But if the person asks, you should have a reasonable answer prepared, like &quot;I just need to see that you meet our minimum requirements, it's a standard question.&quot; Since it only takes two minutes to explain how to find out processor speed anyway (tops), that should be enough to satisfy curiosity.<br>
<br>
That's not really what I'm referring to, either. I'm specifically referring to things that could cost significant time/money to do. For simple ISP related stuff, asking a customer to reinstall their operating system, switch around wires or contact their hardware vendor to get a replacement part, would fall into this category. The customer has every right to ask you to defend your reasons and I believe you should be able to present those reasons to the customer at a level they'll understand. At the very least, I'd be asking for some kind of justification if tech support asked me to do those things, and I'd be talking to someone's manager if I was rudely told to buy a new DSL modem (for example) and not ask questions.<br>
<br>
Just so you appreciate where I'm coming from, I do tech support for expensive business software and a couple hours of downtime can cost a customer tens of thousands of dollars. If I propose the customer take a couple more hours to check a million settings or their entire job setup, I better be prepared to explain my reasons to the customer, their boss, and possibly put it into writing which could be used against us when it comes time to renew the customer's million dollar contract. So that colors my attitude toward tech support a bit, I admit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxum>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Pics plz thx :(</span><br>  Posts: 2217<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/29/03 3:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2254.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Dalren, those are actual examples, not made up.

<br>
Until you have dealt with someone who decided, on the advice that their system was over-heating, to use a thin plastic bag full of ice and water as a heatsink, you have no idea of the stupidity of the average computer user. <br>
<br>
The aveage computer user thinks that if the &quot;TV doesnt show all their little pictures&quot; when they turn on the monitor, then their computer is broken(even if the tower isn't turned on). The average coputer user thinks it is a GOOD idea to spray windex into their CD-ROM, because that way the glass lens will stay clean, right?<br>
<br>
Spend 3 months working tech support, and you will start to be amazed that the human race ever survived discovering fire. Yes, people are that fucking stupid.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elissasilverrain>Elissa Silver Rain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.san.rr.com/brotherxaos/icons/button.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/29/03 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2254.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.san.rr.com/brotherxaos/eq/pinwheel.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>who you ask the speed of the processor and they respond &quot;it's AOL 8.0!&quot; Or people who can't figure out why their floppy drive does't work and it turns out it doesn't work because someone has shoved not one, not two, but THREE credit cards into it when they were shopping on the internet?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I can't speak for the person who originally posted those examples. However, being in the tech support field myself, I can assure you that there really are people that idiotic with computers/the internet out there. I talk to them every day.<br>
<br>
I can also assure you that 90% of the time, when a customer tells me he's a network engineer, and the problem is on our end, it's not.<br>
<br>
I've had to explain to so-called &quot;network engineers&quot; how DHCP works, the basics of firewalls, how to configure email  , etc. All things that they should know if they were truly network engineers.<br>

I also agree with Veridiac that people who know very little about computer show idiocy but are neither idiots nor stupid because they know things I bet you do not know.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Anyways, I had to set up a return on a machine that a customer did not want. I was told that the problem with the machine was that &quot;The overdrive on the machine does not work.&quot;  I laughed for awhile after that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=filanfyretracker>Filan Fyretracker</A>&nbsp;
