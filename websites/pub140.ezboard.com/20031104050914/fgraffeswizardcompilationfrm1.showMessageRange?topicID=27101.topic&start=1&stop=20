We could buy stuff in a centralized location from other players. But that's really the only good thing about it.<br>
<br>
For players actually selling stuff, the bazaar isn't so friendly. You must be logged in to sell stuff (Biggest problem), and if your connection goes wonky, you're booted from the game, which means you won't sell anything.<br>
<br>
I guess the devs took the easy route when designing the bazaar in EQ, because while some of it's features are awesome (item searches with filters!), you can't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>play</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the game while you're trying to sell stuff. Um, hello?<br>
<br>
<br>
So here's my suggestion: Revamp the bazaar; specifically the way traders work. There is no reason why players should have to sit online in the bazaar in order to sell stuff. In fact, there are probably a bunch of better ways to do it, but here's what I'd do:<br>
<br>
I'd add a new NPC to the Bazaar called the &quot;Bazaar Baron&quot;. The Baron would act very much like a bank, in that you would store the items you want to sell with him (8 slots), and he would &quot;hire&quot; (spawn) an NPC vendor which would sell your goods in the stalls currently used by player traders. <br>
<br>
The only setback to this would be that the Bazaar Baron would charge you for selling your items; something like 5 or 10% of your selling prices. So if you sell an item for 100pp, you'd get 90pp and the Baron would get 10pp.<br>
<br>
So how would this system be an improvement over the current Bazaar?<br>
<br>
1. You could <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>play</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the game while your NPC trader sells your items. This would have an added benefit of being able to sell items 24/7 (while servers are up), instead of only when you're not playing.<br>
<br>
2. You wouldn't have to have a character dedicated as a trader mule (free up a character slot).<br>
<br>
3. It'd cut down on SOE's monthly bandwidth costs, which in the end could reduce our monthly subscription fees, or use that money to fund further development.<br>
<br>
4. It'd be a low-profile money sink on the game, which could promote a healthier economy.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I've played SWG and the Bazaar system worked similarly to the one I described above. It blew the EQ's system away, and in fact is probably the best bazaar system in MMOs currently. <br>
I'd like to see something similar to it added to EQ, because it's much more fun to be able to play, and let the game systems sell items for you. <br>

Currently there are what, 150 traders in the bazaar?  If you could just hire an NPC to stand there 24/7 there would be MANY more.  I don't think the zone could handle that.<br>
<br>
Maybe the could tie the current bazaar interface into NPCs spread across the zone evenly.  You go right click on the NPC to display the current Bazaar interface in which you can browse items, as well as purchase items.<br>
<br>
I think it is a bad idea to let people sell items while they are offline though.  It completely removes any human interaction.  This is a multiplayer game, after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1579<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 3:28 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Time for a Bazaar revamp</span><hr size=1> I would love to see this implemented, as would everyone who doesn't want to have a second account for a 24/7 trader character.  The idea above is a good one.<br>
<br>
Another feature that could be implemented is sale by consignment.  A consignment feature would allow you to put items in your trader satchel then authorize other PC merchants to sell them.  You could set the price for the item and the PC would gt a standard percentage of the sales.  This would benefit everybody.  Of course you could remove the item anytime from the PC's inventory without penalty. <br>
<br>
You could do the consignment thing using NPCs, but it would be considerably more difficult to implement for VI I would imagine.  They'd have to change the way merchant inventory is viewed or create special consignment merchants to station at various locations on Norrath.  And consignment mercahnts would have to have a searchable inventory sort of like a mini-bazaar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etelka>Etelka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 642<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 3:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: new idea</span><hr size=1> Ealadan - with switching bazaar vendors to real NPC's you can easily end up with even less vendors. Toss one vendor in for each class or so, and another one for All/All gear (just thinking out lous a sec) can reduce the total amount of vendors from 150 to 15.<br>

There are a ton of different possible solutions, and I don't see any real reason to bring the amount of vendor NPC's up, instead of down. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~tom.van.der.veen/Sig-custom.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1580<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 3:38 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: new idea</span><hr size=1> There is also no reason to have an actual, multi-poly model standing there in a stall doing nothing except providing a place to click.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think it is a bad idea to let people sell items while they are offline though. It completely removes any human interaction. This is a multiplayer game, after all. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
uh.. ???  Do you stand there and watch the screen as people come by and browse your wares in Trader mode?  Do you chat up the other traders or something?  99% of the traders I see are AFK - they're not interacting at all.  The only difference between the current system and the proposed one is that one requires a constant internet connection, and the other doesn't.  I really don't see where human interaction comes into play, as I see VERY little human interaction in the current Bazaar.  Perhaps you don't use /bazaar or /trader, but do your selling/buying in /ooc and /auc?  Kind of confused here.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think lag issues in the bazaar are annoying as it is, and removing the 500 vendor limit, while being a &quot;good thing&quot;, would only make lag worse.  At the very least, I wouldn't mind seeing people become a generic &quot;trader&quot; model when they were in trader mode.  I'm not familiar with the details of the EQ graphics engine, so it may not actually be easier on video cards, but if it is, it might be an easy way to address at least one issue with the bazaar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syrne>Syrne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 4:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Aamen...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is the real issue here...are you having connection problems?

I think what he is getting at is the fact that it is kinda lame that you have to leave your PC running EQ to actually sell anything...  Sometimes, people do other stuff (gasp!) on their PC besides EQ.

These seem to contradict themselves.  My impression after seeing how stacked up people get already that having fixed sell points would reduce the total number of available spots to sell.<br>

<br>
On my slow computer (the old 1-box, now 2-box), the most lag I get is when I force the greatest amount of new rendering.  You can do this ad hoc by spinning in one place and having to draw all new people and a new background/horizon.  This is essentially what #3 is suggesting.  I do agree, however, the overall lag by cutting out travel lag would be less.<br>

What I mean is the zone should allow more than 500 traders.  That's a hard cap right now.  Fixed sell points would not contradict that if there are as many sell points as the cap.  Right now, the stalls are too deep and traders often layer themselves near the edges and corners.  If, say, each stalls is shallower and each has, 8 or 10 sell points in a grid (thus accomodating 8 to 10 sellers), then the whole zone will be more &quot;neat&quot; and we don't have to jump through hoops to get to the back ones.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.<br>

<br>
People come into the bazaar for various reasons, but cutting out all the trader's active lines would cut people's reason to be in there.  As initially stated, people would leave the area to play, not hang out afk while selling.  The server wouldn't need to transmit all that information every 6 sec.  They'd just store it.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to really increase traffic, add a feature to enable you to check on your trader while you're playing in another zone.  Or even better, a pop up to inform you if a particular item comes up at a particular price.  Ok, I'm going over the top now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1584<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 5:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Reading this thread, the cynic in me wonders if the bazaar concept didn't have the ulterior motive of enticing many people to buy second accounts.

While I think the idea is good and would help the players out a lot, many have mules or an account just for trading, implementing this would cut into profits somewhat. Maybe I am wrong but personally I know a few who are reluctant to get rid of a 3rd account because they use them to sell exclusively.<br>
<br>
 I would like to see a bazaar for high end good or a higher quality item, how many Crystal Covered Shrouds does one bazaar need? 35 =/. Maybe one for low to mid level gear, another for tradeskills and a final one for high end items. All and all I like the bazaar idea it has made a lot of things easier and enchanced my enjoyment with trade skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aerimusshadowborn>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 5:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This Idea</span><hr size=1> This is on the face of it a great idea its also not a new one though I suppose its easily obvious enough to have been throught up repeatedly.<br>
<br>
The best implimentation of this idea is the one where a fixed number of npc vendors sell players items I think.<br>
<br>
However 2 things are obviously not understood here.<br>
<br>
1) I think having actual players act as vendors was supposed to add flavor and variety to the concept as the people standing in stalls would be the same varied players you saw in normal everyday play. Of course alts with names like kmrt totally defeat this purpose...<br>
<br>
2) The items offered in the bazaar as many and varied as they are at any given time represent a fraction of the salable items on the market.  Implimenting this would allow all possible items to enter the marketplace at once within a searchable format.  If you don't see why this is a bad thing consider the price drop when the bazaar first came out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pickkpockket999>Pickk Pockket999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 6:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This Idea</span><hr size=1> They will never do this as they would lose the revenue from the many &quot;trader&quot; accounts people have purchased. I know quite a few people with a second account used just for bazaar trades.<br>
<br>
Throw in bandwidth utilization and I don't see why they would do this. Every single person who plays the game would have their Bazaar Baron active. That is ~ 1-5k traders constantly active. That equates to quite a large database of items used just for the bazaar. It would end up costing Sony more money to run the game without any potential upside financially. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27101.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=27101.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=27101.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=27101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=27101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
