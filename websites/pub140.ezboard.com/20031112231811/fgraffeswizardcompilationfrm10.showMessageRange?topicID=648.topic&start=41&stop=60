Whether or not people agree with every point in it, that is one seriously thorough analysis.  Well done.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, VI's already seen it.  :)  Want a chance to make changes before I mail it around?   <br>
<br>
The only change I'd really recommend is to touch up the colors in the chart at (home.attbi.com/~dmoen/fixwiz.htm).  It's a little hard to see who's who.<br>

(Disclaimer: This is NOT a promise of any changes!  This is simply an offer to informally pass around an excellent piece of work that's obviously been thought through.)<br>

<br>
New servers show up on an average of about once every 3-4 months, and that includes a rash of them that showed up not long after release.  There hasn't been a new one since the RPG one, and isn't likely to be one any time soon.  If anything the trend will be in reverse - fewer servers.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, it takes less than a week for the dedicated (psycho?) players to get a character over level 50, and to start getting the really nice gear on their characters.  How many months before the effect shown on the spreadsheets starts to take effect?  Once the twinks and gear problem rears its ugly head IT NEVER GOES AWAY.<br>
<br>
In summary: new servers is not an issue that has any basis for complaint.  If you really wanted, you could actually do a spreadsheet that showed where Wizards are actually at a disadvantage many levels vs other casters on new servers, but fine vs melee.  Then that melts away and the melee twinking puts them at a further disadvantage.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Armok, thanks for considering lower levels, but clicky gear isn't the answer, I don't believe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Don't tell anyone, but I'm<br>  a Gnome who worships Brell!!</span><br>  Posts: 872<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 10:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new server fallacy</span><hr size=1> Yer right, Grimmy.

Now that you have done the mathmatical research and shown others, they are getting more respect.&quot;<br>
<br>
I really don't want to hijack or derail this thread at all. But I just have to say that after several (hundreds?) wizards signed on to &quot;The Document,&quot; it's not quite true to claim that you guys got &quot;no love,&quot; Saradin. <br>
<br>
I signed The Document too, and like the VAST majority of wizards who regularly post here, wished you guys the best of luck in your very laudable efforts to improve the class. Yes, some of us had some criticism, but I think it's safe to say that most of us wanted The Document to suceed. I beg you Saradin, with all due respect, to remember that, whether The Document sways Verant or not. <br>
<br>
I am mentioning this because, it's very important that constructive criticism posted here, even outright dissent, to Armok's post not be construed as a desire to derail it. Surely there are zealots and idealouges among us. But there are many more Wizard intellectuals who want to see the class improved. Criticism is essential to any effort to sway the powers that be. Indeed, true support (not blind aquiecence) can't exist without it.<br>

(see quest robes here)<br>
<br>
As a user of a Velk robe, I can attest that it makes a huge difference in exp grind groups and even high hp mobs. I still do not do as much damage as tanks (see his analysis above which is very good by the way) but I do enough damage to make me an addition to an exp group.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, you take exp from a group, every class in the group has to make the group as a whole kill more mobs than they would without you and at least enough to make up for the exp you are taking.<br>
<br>
That is the basic premise of group desirability. Thus the desire of chanters and clerics because they speed up the pulls considerably and make up for even more than their share of exp they cost the group. By having a velk robe, my damage output speeds up the groups pulls to at least cover myself and sometimes a bit more.<br>
<br>
As the higher end game progresses, utility slots just cost too much in the way of maximizing exp so many groups go without an evaccer or utility slots. This holds true for all classes, not just wizzys. Anyone that does not make a group kill at least 1/6th more mobs over a given time, if they are the 6th member, are not necessary and will not be in groups.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of clickable items with decent cast times at all levels. Adding 35 dps to a 55-60 wizzy over their normal damage does not seem unbalancing given the DPS of other PCs and the limitations of a casting item (see above)<br>
<br>
For instance, making the casting time of the quest robes (enticement of flame 360 damage) a 10 second cast increases DPS by 36 but only if in a constant ngagement situation. I think it is fair and reasonable.<br>
<br>
As for the lower level items, just find out what the average DPS of warriors, monks, and rogues are. Compare to DPS over the long haul of the wizzy, then put an item in game that adjusts accordingly (just under warrior, monk, rogue)<br>
<br>
As far as sustained damage, that is what pets bring to other classes that make them desirable. A pet supplies the same damage that our click items would. Wizards are the only non pet caster group and during the original forging of the &quot;vision&quot; I think they underestimated people's innate desire to maximize gain vs. time and it would translate into desirability in groups.<br>
<br>
We will see what the &quot;vision&quot; holds. I am sure they did not realize that a 30 second cast time on a combat spell was a little silly and has absolutely NO use.<br>

Exactly how could this escape the attention of anyone this side of a striped-ass baboon?  Seriously, that's a clear and obvious truth, they didn't mean for this to make combat impact, they threw it in for us to have something to do with no mana - then made it so you can't meditate while its casting, negating its value. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucassiusruneblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cassius Runeblaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>I <3 Zealots</span><br>  Posts: 739<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 10:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> <br>
Well I certainly agree with most everything here. Its what I've been saying for a while, but never put the effort in to present such a well constructed argument. I take my hat off to you.<br>
<br>
With regards to simply lowering nuke costs, I'm a little warey. One of the distinctions of the wizard class is its ability to provide very fast dmg, and whilst you argue its useless, I'd argue it merely marginalised to an extent it appears useless. I would prefer they went the higher damage route as it prevents us from merely becoming second rate warriors or monks who stand further back and spam spells/robes non stop forever trying to chase max dmg.<br>
<br>
To wit, I want aggro to remain a governing factor. This has one beautiful side effect, as your guild/group mates become better equiped, you are able to scale with it and produce more dmg output as they will be better able to keep aggro. For this to work, we need to be able to do more damage in less time if we so choose, which I believe was the original balance goal.<br>
<br>
This leads onto another point, contrary to popular opininon, its really hard to deliver damage at maximum efficiency as a wizard especially on long uber mob fights where we are meant to excel. Concussion simply doesn't work against the majority of these mobs, and the number of times I've been quadded for 1000 when the main tank goes down because I've been trying to maximise dmg is unpleasantly high. If our dmg was more balanced, I don't doubt we'd notice this more. My point? That concussion is inadequate, we need something nearer evade in utility - spell casting subtlety is too little and too late. Or better yet we need an accross the board cut in aggro.<br>
<br>
Going onto the medding whilst standing topic, this is interesting as its predicated on whether or not horses are intended to have that behaviour, and following on from that whether they did it through desire, or 'oh shit we don't have a horse sitting animation'. It would certainly make a nice arch or class skill and actually would in some ways be in line with (un)holy steed as it wouldn't give a speed boost, but would work in all zones. I almost dismissed the suggestion at first, but then remembered the essential point. A wizard using clickey items doesn't tend to sit and med much anyway. Optimal use of the orb of torrefaction/vp robe/velk robe all require you to always use it if you aren't at full mana, and insert nukes as your clarity fueled regen permits. So in effect it lessens the value of the items, but ups the value of nukes as you can cast them more often. (Remember items tend to have superior ratios to nukes, but only if you aren't at full mana as they cast so slowly).<br>
<br>
I may have more thoughts on this tomorrow, but I hope some of this is well enough considered to be of use.<br>

Feel free to distribute the document in it's current form around the office. You can always put a pointer here for my updated public thoughts, and feel free to email me directly at:<br>

for less public discussion of the specifics.<br>
<br>
You are not the first to comment on the poor quality of the color choice for the web graphs.  I would strongly encourage you to download the excel worksheet for actual analysis. The graphs are easier to discern, and you can play with the source data and controls to play with other solutions.  I know, for example, that for your melee balancing work you produced a simulation for modeling melee damage which could probably be used for supplying better raw dps numbers than especially my interpolated values. However, the spreadsheet itself without the exposition is a bit, erm, overwhelming, so the two kind of need to go together.<br>
<br>
The text is a bit rough (I mis-spell separate 43.6% of the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but the essense is there and reflects almost all my thinking on the subject. For other, very insightful views on the subject, direct people to this thread, and for the thinking and numbers behind my research, view the class balance thread referenced in the document. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugallenite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallenite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 11:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> Apologies for taking up board space with this, but, dumb question:<br>

I'm a former @home victim, err, user, and it seems everything isn't fully up yet.<br>
<br>
I've already received an email from Scott. He didn't say a lot, except that they will be mulling it over in the near term, that they are aware that casters need help akin to melee, but that it will likely be sometime before they can provide any kind of feedback at all.<br>
<br>
Reading between the lines, even if they come to agreement on what needs to be done for wizards, it is unlikely that they would provide a wizard fix in isolation from adjustments to the other casting classes -- and frankly, wizards are the easiest of the lot to fix because of our relative lack of utility spells.<br>
<br>
I promise I'll keep you posted if I hear anything at all, but will only divulge details if Scott gives the OK. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Censor !!!</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1719<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/4/02 12:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> Gallenite: If you need a copy of the original petition for ideas and an idea of what it was about, e-mail Rombus or I and we can send you one.

I agree on most of your points. Your points about soloing and quadding are great. Just want to add that EQ is an MMORPG, meaning the ideal is to have groups and socialism not solo loners with no life but to get to 60. And for that matter, mages, necros, chanters, druids, shamans, can all solo inside a dungeon. And all of them, maybe with the slight exception of the druid, can do it better than us. So do these additions make us better for single soloing? Well maybe slightly, but then again a shaman with a pet is pretty damned good too. Does it make us better quadders? naw not really, not even the click items.<br>
You also addressed the issue of snares and evacs. Keep in mind our snare is AE, meaning we have to have high MR so not snare ourselves. Also the fact, rangers, druids, warriors, necros, sk's and bards can all snare. And they can do it either without mana useage, or can have some other benefit while snareing. Warriors can do dmg with the snare whip, druids and rangers have gaunts, necro's and sk's can do dmg, bards can still twist songs with it. So why does th ewizard have to be the only class to get shafted, having to snare and do no other benefit in that 2 some odd seconds? And if you think wizards shouldn't get better because we get ae, then so do druids right? <br>
But all in all, i agree Armok.<br>

Today, I'm halfway through level 27, Fine Steel/Darkforge/other gear, and I'll switch between my Mithril 2h sword and MoSS/MM Sheild for weapons.  <br>
All this without ANY twinking whatsoever.
