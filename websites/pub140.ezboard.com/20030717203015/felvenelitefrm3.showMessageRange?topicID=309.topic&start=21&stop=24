As I understand it he and Bush were both at westpoint at the same time (unless I am misunderstanding my source). Did you know he pretty much couped his uncle to get the power he has? did you know that the U.S. still unofficialy makes people disappear all the time? yes theres a law against it yes we are not supposed to do it but I know someone who personally in the last 5 years was in South vietnam making someone disappear.  He's a bad mofo and he has shared with me some things that would make your toes curl. He was quite candid with me about a lot of different things. IE. Alien technology that is being researched alien bodies what they look like etc etc also some of the missions and whatnot.  This guy was as straight faced and serious with me about the whole thing.  He also said that this is a dog and pony show put on by Bush to accomplish several things. <br>
A: Stimulate the economy<br>
B: Distract the American public from at home issues.<br>
C: puff the feathers of the USA to send clear message to other would be terrorist orginizations.<br>
...A few other things he said I cant remember cause I wanted to get back to the alien thing. <br>
<br>
Well this isnt really an opinionated post just info I have heard. It is wht it is.<br>

<br>
War isn't absolutely necessary, no matter how much everyone's been conditioned to believe it is by Bush/the media/others. Most of what I would like to say is well written in these two letters I read in a local newspaper's Letters section the other day. If you are eager for a war, then I suggest you read the second one especially.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>More inspection time is a sound investment</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
    President Bush has not made the case for war with Iraq. The inspections have just begun and need time if they are going to work. The teams have only recently reached full staffing levels and acquired high-technology support and intelligence cooperation from the United States.<br>
   <br>
 Mohamed ElBaradei told the Security Council he has seen no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons program, and he explicitly asked for several months, which he called a &quot;valuable investment&quot; that &quot;could help to avoid war.&quot;<br>
    <br>
Hans Blix has said his inspections of biological and chemical weapons disarmament should take a year. Recently, Iraq has agreed to a tighter inspection regime -- for example, allowing for the use of surveillance aircraft, including the U-2.<br>
    <br>
Unlike the previous round of inspections, the current group of inspectors has gained prompt access to sites. Even the earlier inspections succeeded in disabling Iraq's nuclear program and destroying 95 percent of its chemical and biological weapons.<br>
   <br>
 It is much too early to dismiss new, tougher inspections even if Iraqi cooperation is grudging. The weakest link in the war case has been and continues to be any alleged connection between Iraq and al-Qaida.<br>
    <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">CIA repeatedly has said that the two share only distrust: al-Qaida scorns Saddam Hussein's secularism, while Hussein stresses tight control by the state and would transfer weapons only under attack.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
    <br>
U.N. Security Council members are skeptical of the evidence presented by Colin Powell. A longtime senior member of the House Intelligence Committee who now serves on the Sept. 11 commission, Lee Hamilton, says the Bush administration &quot;will look for any kind of evidence to support their premise; I think we have to be skeptical about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
If Hussein does have weapons of mass destruction, he will have every incentive to use them, as CIA Director George Tenet warned Congress. President Bush has threatened to retaliate with a nuclear strike if Iraq uses chemical or biological weapons. Israel also has 200 nuclear weapons.<br>
  <br>
 <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">A nuclear war would bring the deaths into the millions. It also would create an explosion of shock and hate that would recruit a new generation of anti-American terrorists. Iraq poses no threat while inspections are under way</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
   <br>
 Wouldn't it be wiser to give inpectors a chance to find and destroy any weapons than to rush into a war in which Hussein might use them -- potentially prompting the United States or Israel to launch a nuclear strike?<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The real face of war is ugly, terror-filled</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
   As our country grows closer to war, I see two faces of battle - reason and reality.<br>
 <br>
  Here, I won't be speaking about the reason for war. Those are prejudiced and many. Instead, I want to speak of the chilling reality of warfare.<br>
<br>
   I am seperating the subjective rationalization from the objective blindness of its destruction. The truth is that bullets and bombs care not for causes, puffed out chests or fiery rhetoric. Their goal is to end life. Pain and terror will not hesitate to visit our loved ones when ordered to do so.<br>
  <br>
 My experience with war was ugly. Ugly like the Grim Reaper is ugly. The bullets that perforated my buddies' skin and ripped through their bodies had no conscience, no soul, and cared nothing for their lives. Their mission was simple; wreak havoc on the human body and make a heart die. If there was shrieking agony or fear as intense as a blast furnace, the weapons of war didn't care.<br>
    <br>
The reasons for war directed them there, and those reasons were of no importance to the bullets and bombs. The job of the weapons is simple: kill and kill often<br>
<br>
   If we go to war with Iraq, are those of you who are sending loved ones to the arena prepared for the midnight phone call? The call that says your loved one gave his or her life for...what?<br>
  <br>
 Is the cause important enough for you to go out today and buy a cemetary plot and then have to rely on the memories to bring your child to life?<br>
 <br>
  Are you prepared for your loved one to come home, not on a plane laughing, but in a cold, dark body bag? Maybe recognizable, maybe not. That's the chilling reality of war.<br>
   <br>
War is not like what you see on the silver screen.There is no crescendo of music or spectacular camera angles. War isn't sponsored by a soft drink company. There isn't the hero dashing through a barrage of gunfire to fall into the arms of his love.<br>
   <br>
 War is grimy, vulgar, gut-churning business. War is putrid garbage and the wail of a million broken hearts. There are no winners in war. Both sides lose. It's just that one loses bigger than the other.<br>
    <br>
I am not a smart enough man to understand the reasons for war. I see it as rationalized insanity. I hope we never end up there. But, if we do, I hope not one of you has a loved one in harm's way.<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
I underlined a couple of points I thought were important. In case some are unaware about the popular growing anti-Americanism in Europe, the US would most likely maintain a better standing in the world's eyes by not being so hasty in attacking a so-far non-aggresive  country. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=309.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=309.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=309.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=309.topic&index=24><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=309.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.threadControl?topicID=309.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=309.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=309.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm3>/OOC</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
