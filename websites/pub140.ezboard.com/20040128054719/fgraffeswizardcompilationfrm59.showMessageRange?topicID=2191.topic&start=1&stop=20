Odd.<br>
<br>
Zerlatik's Note: As many of us have left EQ in recent days to pursue other games, I thought I'd assist anyone heading out by providing some info on FFXI.  With any luck, having this as a device for comparison may also help liven up many of the old arguments about wizards in EQ, which seem to have devolved lately into shouting matches instead of any kind of constructive discussion.  Be advised that this post is rather long, you may want to read it in shifts or come back to it later after you've thought about something.  Also, when you're done, feel free to scroll back up to the top and see if you can spot your house from up here.  I welcome any discussion of the merits of each game, as well as any ideas you may want to present that might work in EQ based on what Square-Enix has done with FFXI.  I've numbered everything, and it won't hurt my feelings if you skip any sections that don't interest you.<br>
<br>
1. Release info.<br>
FFXI is scheduled for its North American, (NA from here on out), launch in Q4 of 2003 for PC and Q1 of 2004 for PS2.  Yes, it's a multi-platform launch.  Yes, players will be able to play on the same server regardless of which platform you choose to run.  The major holdup in production appears to be finding a NA distributor for the new 40MB PS2 HD.  Yes, that is a whole crapload of space for a console game, S-E took the multiplatform launch line that seriously.  Translation appears to be mostly complete at this point.  Beta testing on the NA version began a week or two ago, it's probably too late to sign up now.<br>
<br>
However, if you don't want to wait that long, (and you can read at least some Japanese), the game is out in both versions in Japan.  I will leave the logistics of the actual import process largely up to you, however <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ffxionline.com" target="top">www.ffxionline.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has a pretty decent guide to importing, which walks you through the actual setup and account creation portions of the game.  If you do import, you will need the following: a copy of the game, a Japanese language PS2 HD (only if you're using the PS2 version, and you may also need a Japanese language PS2), and possibly the Visions of Z(j/g)iraat expansion if you are interested in playing in any of the expansion zones, or questing for the expansion advanced jobs.  (Note that the NA version will ship with the expansion included, both versions, and the PS2 one will probably bundle the HD as well).  <br>
<br>
Importers will probably also need a Japanese address in order to register the product and get online.  As far as importers have seen, this addy is mainly for marketing purposes and doesn't serve any vital role unless you really dig junkmail.  Thus, some importers recommend falsifying a Japanese addy.  S-E does not seem to check the addresses beyond verifying that they could actually be in Japan.  A dummy address also has a slight advantage over using an existing addy in that you don't spam some poor homeowner or business with unwanted junkmail.  I'd visit the boards over at FFXIonline and ask one of the Japanese players to give you the addresses of the last two numbers on his street before it either dead ends or is crossed by another street.  Add or subtract 10 to this number, which should create an address in the middle of an intersection.  All junkmail thus heads to the dead-letter office, and you're now a Japanese citizen in S-E's eyes.<br>
<br>
2. Logging in and setting up.<br>
Quick plug again, if you imported make sure you check the guide over at FFXIOnline.com on the bottom left menu section, (follow the link above to the site), it'll explain it all.<br>
<br>
For the rest of us, the process will be pretty straightforward, like EQ, once you're installed and the hardware is up, you just register and create a character.  And here's where it gets really interesting...<br>
<br>
First off, you don't get to select your server in FFXI, the game randomly does it for you.  It gives preference to those servers which currently are low in population, which is kinda nice if you don't particularly care about where you end up as long as the latency is good.  Server populations are thus self-regulating, you don't end up with massively overcrowded servers or others where you can travel the entire world and not see anyone.  Thus, the constant crap we see about people plugging SZ on these boards because they want players for their side or the population's low are absent from FFXI.<br>
<br>
This does bring up a concern, however.  How do you play with friends?  S-E has solved this problem with a purchaseable game item called a WorldPass.  Each WP allows you to access 5 codes which are good for 7 days.  Getting one of those codes to a friend is up to you, but once they log on, they can enter that code and create a new character on your server.  The unused codes expire after a 7 day period, you can also only purchase one WP every 7 days.  WP pricing varies in gil (FFXI money), based on the population of the server.  If for some reason that server is low and not enough people have been randomly assigned to it, WPs will be dirt cheap.  On the other hand, if you're playing on a very popular server for some reason, WPs will cost you your firstborn.  Thus, your buddy has a vested interest in helping you out once you log on to his server, since it already cost him 1k of his hard earned cash to get you to join him.  WorldShifts and Server Transfers are not allowed at this point, and don't look to be on the drawing boards for any time in the future.  <br>
<br>
3. Will it play on my system?<br>
Short answer, if you have a PS2 and buy the game bundle, yes.  If you're the PC type, it's a little trickier.  S-E has released a benchmarking program which you can pickup <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.playonline.com/Download/FFXibench.zip" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Those on dialup, beware.  This is an 11MB download, so don't make any hard plans.  Basically, download it, unzip it, make some popcorn and cue it up.  What you want to pay attention to is the little &quot;score&quot; at the bottom right.  This is your benchmark, and it resets every time the program loops itself.  From what the FFXIOnline forums have discovered, any PC bench of over 1500 should be playable.  There's a full thread on this, with badly tranlated comments from S-E <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ffxionline.com/forums/showthread.phps?s=b09f5536805be9ca749fa75f5e670b20&amp;threadid=4307" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  To give you some idea, I have a P4 at 2.5 GHZ, an 80 GB Maxtor HD at 7200 RPM, 512 MB RAM, ATI Radeon 9000 (surprisingly, ATI edges out Nvidia slightly right now in the benchmarks), and craptastic 56kbps dialup, (not fiber optic, mind you, good ol' Tommy Edison copper wires here, speeds are slow as frozen crap).  My score was between 3900 and 4000.  Anything over 4000 is probably higher than anything the game is likely to toss your way.  If you've set up your rig to run Unreal Tournament at full resolution, you'll probably need a hardware upgrade to run this game sometime around the time Satan's feet get chilly.  Be aware that this game uses the same memory management system EQ does, so it'll take as many resources as you have available unless you tell windows to treat it differently.<br>
<br>
4. Graphics.<br>
You saw the benchmark program, right?  Well, that movie's pretty much a dumbed down version of ingame graphics.  Real graphics will probably be much better than the Tarutaru beach party blowout you just witnessed.  For one thing, probably not very noticable with those palm trees, trees actually resemble trees in FFXI.  No more of the elongated cones with spiky projections we saw as the standard in EQ.  Water also resembles water, and monsters aren't oddly formed polygon blobs.  In the first 30 seconds of play, you'll probably notice better graphics than 90% of EQ.  Early Japanese players reported spending hours just watching clouds drift by.  Character customization is a bit more limited than SoL EQ, since you don't have eye color, for instance, but the models themselves are more detailed.  From a distance, it's very easy to tell races apart.  Clothing is somewhat hit and miss, however, lot of the AF (epic quested) armor for each class is downright stunning, but there are other times when you wonder about decisions.  There's a lot more lace, ruffles, and frills than I was expecting armor to have.<br>
<br>
5. Gameplay, (A.K.A. the section you probably give an actual crap about).<br>
<br>
(a) East side v. West side.<br>
Rap music references aside, (henceforth referred to as that musical genre missing a letter 'c' at the front), there is a major difference in the feel of FFXI.  This is definitely an Eastern RPG.  You'll get the picture a little better later on, but the basic themes are pretty easy to spot.  Clothing is one area, but you'll also notice that characters have slightly larger heads, big eyes, and play tends to be focussed on party exploits and player status, rather than the endless EQ cycle of levelling and item acquisition.  How you interact with the world actually matters in FFXI.  Plus, there's the huge LOTR style cutscene that begins the game...<br>
<br>
(b) Order up!<br>
You're going to notice a big difference vs. EQ right off the bat... MENUS!  Yup, FFXI is a standard Final Fantasy game, in that menus drive most of the action.  This is fantastic for those of us who, like me, can't remember the keystrokes for their abilities or disciplines to save their lives.  Basically, if you're able to do it, it'll appear on the menu somewhere.  Menus are also grouped pretty intuitively, it'll be pretty obvious where your special attacks and spells are located.  Also, once you've targetted an enemy for destruction, your character will move into position and start hacking away without your micromanagement.  You can interrupt him to cast or order a special attack, but he can get by without you at least to a degree.  <br>
<br>
(c) Of ringtones and shells.<br>
Guilds are done differently in FFXI.  There are actual guilds in FFXI, and I'll explain them later, but guilds as we think of them are represented by Linkshells.  To start a Linkshell, you don't petition, submit a charter, gather your followers in one place, or any of the odd stuff we're used to.  Nope, you just visit a shop and buy a Linkshell.  Once you've got one and named it, you then can start cranking out LinkPearls, which you hand out to people you want to Link with.  Everyone in the link can talk with everyone else from anywhere in Vana'diel.  If someone in your link has done things that harm your Link's reputation, you can also Kick them, much like a chatroom.  The offending party does not have to be in the same zone, or even online to be Kicked, leaving no escape from judgement.  The Linkshell system does not seem to be anywhere near as complex as the new LoY Guild Management system of EQ.  On the other hand, it doesn't really need to be.  The guild aspect of EQ has been really downplayed in FFXI, to the point where you don't really need your Linkshell for much more than companionship or party recruitment, thus you aren't stuck with a bunch of morons you dislike but have to suck up to in order to complete anything.  <br>
<br>
(d) Hulk Smash!<br>
Monsters are really interesting in FFXI.  Not just because they look like the standard FF-style circus freaks, either.  For one thing, some of them are chained as far as aggro goes.  If you attack one, he'll call a few friends before charging, which gets you that monster and a group of his nearest and dearest.  Other monsters will pretty much ignore you completely as you kill something right on top of them.  Still others only 'activate' after you've done something else.  However, best thing about monsters in FFXI is that the spawn times are short.  How short?  Well, on nearly everything that isn't a Notorious Monters, (the FFXI version of uber mobs), once it goes down another one respawns somewhere else in the zone.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :omg --><img src=http://www.graffe.com/emoticons/omg.gif ALT=":omg"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   For Notorious Monsters, spawn times seem to be actually reasonable.  The longest I've heard about was a few hours tops.  Thus, no more week long camps for Vox/Naggy/Rage.  Lots of them are also single party doable.  You can even trigger lots of these spawns.  For instance, at early levels you start to accrue Beast Coins from mobs, at later levels you can hand these in for an encounter in the Burning Circle area, 100 coins can net your lvl 40 party two lvl 50 NMs to play with, or a single lvl 90 NM for your 60ish party.  The game gives you an idea of how this place works by giving players the opportunity to summon a free NM encounter during one of the missions.  <br>
<br>
(e) That's it, I'm bored.<br>
Class is handled in a new and really interesting way in FFXI.  It's a lot like 3rd Edition D&amp;D, mixed with a fair slice of 2nd Editions Dual-Classing rules.  Race in FFXI is fixed, however your job is not.  At creation, you start as one of the six main jobs: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, or Red Mage, (the big six).  However, you can change jobs at any time by visiting your Mog house in town.  Here's the good part, the game remembers your progress in each class, so you can switch back if you change your mind later.  Unlike EQ, if you get bored, you don't have to competely reroll, you can stay the same character, just a different job.  So, if your Monk gets sick of punching things, you can switch to White Mage and sit back and heal for a few.  <br>
<br>
At lvl 18, you gain the ability to quest for a sub job.  Think of this like dual classing.  As a sub job, you don't get the special 2 hr ability that normally accompanies that job.  Also, the max of each subjob can only be one half of whatever is currently your main job.  You can have more exp in that job, you just can't make use of it until you level up your main some more.  You level up subjobs by switching them to main job and gaining exp in that job.  You will only ever gain exp in whichever job is set as the current main.  <br>
<br>
At lvl 30, you gain the ability to quest for an advanced job.  Advanced jobs have skills that normally aren't available to the big six classes.  The basic advanced job list includes Paladins, Dark Knights, Bards, Rangers (hello tracking), and Beast Masters (here monster, monster, monster, come help daddy kill your friends).  The expansion pack adds a number of new jobs to this listing as well, which quest in the expansion areas, such as Dragon Knight (Dragoon), Summoner, Ninja, Samurai, etc.  The quests for each different job are given out in different cities.  Each quest is pretty epic in scope, but are balanced to be accomplishable without a massive guild, unlike lots of the quests in EQ.  For instance, the quest for Dragoon requires that you first dig up a dragon egg.  Quest writeups for this recommend bringing along only six picks to the area where you start digging, it's that common.  No 3 hr foraging runs and carpal tunnel inducing click fests.  From that stage, you have a series of dungeon crawls to reach terrain features and objects to power up your egg, resulting in a final battle with a dragon to finish off the quest.  But wait, you don't need to run an EQ style dragon raid where you spend weeks waiting to ambush the bugger and race other guilds to do it.  You know where the dragon is, and exactly how to trigger it.  Yup, trigger it.  You don't race another guild, you line up behind other players in the spot and wait your party's turn.  Only holdup in the quest line is however long it takes the parties in front of you to finish killing the mob so you can click on the door and be teleported into your encounter.  Best part is that if you screw up this final battle, you can rez up and redo it once you're ready for another try, instead of repeating every other step.  Also, (this'll be important later on), you don't become each job as soon as you finish the quest, it becomes a training option at the Mog House once completed.  So, you can always unlock it now, and then save it for when you really want to play as that if you aren't sure about starting over at lvl 1 now.  It is possible, though it'd probably drive you crazy and take forever, to get to max level in every single job in the game if you so desire. <br>
<br>
(f) My faithful mount, Warky.<br>
FFXI handles transportation differently than EQ.  Unlike the PoP system of teleporters or everyone's favorite game, &quot;bug your local wizard&quot;, you're pretty limited.  You've got boats, you've got airships, and you've got chocobos.  Boats and Airship travel isn't nearly as boring as EQ, however.  There are actual battles on the boats, usually as a result of someone fishing up something fun.  Also, should you complete the quest at lvl 20 for your Chocobo raising licence, you can ride one of the series famed Chocobos.  The little birds are handled differently than EQ's horses, however.  For one thing, they're rented rather than bought, (rent's cheap BTW).  You rent them at the edge of town, and they stay with you for much of the way.  They can't go into dungeons or towns, however, so you're limited in travel if you go by birdback.  Also, they tend to toss you off if they get too worn out, which can be annoying.  They also need to be fed, which brings up an interesting special feature of chocobos, they can dig.  Chocobos aren't very picky diggers, if you order one to dig somewhere, it'll turn up special items with the same regularity as it turns up food.  Location also influences what they dig up, dig next to a stream and you get water based items.  One caution however, is that Chocobos HATE fire, doesn't matter if it's player or monster based.  If they see fire, they'll toss you on your tukuss and run for it.  You also can't attack from birdback, although you can still target monsters to track them.<br>
<br>
(g) Moogles!<br>
Probably the most important feature of your gaming experience will be your Mog House.  This sucker sits in your hometown and is kinda like your own private kingdom.  It stores your items, banks your cash, allows you to rest up, helps mail things to other Mog Houses, etc.  It's one stop shopping for all your adventuring needs.  Some tradeskills also make use of the Mog House, and you can grow a number of items in your garden if you so desire.  When switching jobs in the Mog House, one caution is to make sure you unequip all the gear that can't be used in the new job before you make the switch and bank or sell it, as this gear doesn't equip over.  Also, as the name implies, the place is crawling with cute, cuddly, and thoroughly evil Moogles.<br>
<br>
(h) No, Charlie, they don't float.  Now get down here so I can rip your arm off.<br>
Jumping and swimming are virtually non-existant in FFXI.  Which sounds bad at first, but you don't really need either one of them to get by.  Most of the world is pretty smoothly rendered, unlike the jerky EQ terrain, making jumping unnecessary.  If you can't go over something, it's usually really obvious how to go around it.  There don't seem to be any places where swimming would be useful, either.  Jump does make a notable appearance in the game, however, as a special attack of the Dragoon.  Using Jump, a Dragoon can leap out of attack range of a monster for a few rounds, then come racing down like the wrath of god upon your enemy's head.  This is really cool to see in action, especially Taru Dragoons, just don't plan on attacking the ground to get over that next hill.<br>

(6) Spooooooooon!<br>
Remember earlier where I said the guild system was different than EQ?  Well, there are actual guilds in FFXI.  Unlike EQ these guilds aren't for learning jobs or socializing with whatever freakish family members your guildmates have dragged along to the party.  Nope, FFXI guilds are like tradeskill havens.  Each guild specializes in a particular craft, from Bonecrafters and Tailors to Culinarians and Blacksmiths.  Advancing within each guild is also very desirable, as the higher your guild ranking, the less likely you are to blow a recipe and the less restrictions you have on what you can craft.  As you level, your guild will give out quests to improve your ranking.  Some randomness is also involved in the crafting process, such that higher ranked players will have a chance to create exceptional items when attempting a recipe.<br>

Recently EQ music has gotten better, and in many instances EQ sounds were incredibly helpful and lifelike.  But in general music in EQ seems like just something to add to the ambiance, and sound effects are intended to be realistic.<br>
<br>
Music in Final Fantasy has traditionally played a far more active role in the game, significantly influencing the way one percieve characters, settings, and situations.  Sound effects tend to be imaginative and stylized.  I'm curious if you can tell whether this F.F. continues these traditions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=verylowsodium>VERY LOW SODIUM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 7:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An EQ player's take on Final Fantasy XI (Info Bomb).</span><hr size=1> Just not Final Fantasy without the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.students.sonoma.edu/users/w/walz/ffmidi/FF1prelu.mid">Prelude</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

<br>
(7) I'm with Stupid ====&gt;<br>
Faction within FFXI is more important than in other MMORPGs.  It actually has a point beyond whether or not that guard is going to welcome or attack you.  There are three basic factions: Republic of Bastok, Kingdom of San'Doria, and Federation of Windurst.  Each faction is chosen upon startup, and you're rewarded for choosing your racial faction with a special stat ring.  All factions have strong and weak points.  Windurst is the starting faction of the Tarus and Mithras, for instance, and they rock at crafting magic items.  Bastok is the hume and gralkas, and tends toward heavy industry, this faction has guns.  San'Doria is the elvaan homeland, and they specialize in swords and armor of all types.  Another important aspect of faction has to do with loot.  At the end of every week, conquest points for each faction are calculated.  If your faction has enough of them, you gain control of new areas of the world.  Fighting in a region your faction controls is very rewarding.  For one thing, you get guards.  Guards can save your butt, or buff you with special effects to improve your loot gathering abilities.  As PvP is currently unimplemented in FFXI, it's up to you to outperform other factions, rather than conquering them the old fashioned way.<br>
<br>
(a) Whatsa matter, Colonel Sanders?  CHICKEN?!?<br>
Rank within your faction has a point.  It directly effects how NPCs from that faction perceive you.  To improve your rank you have to do missions for that faction.  These differ from quests in that they're more covert in nature, and you can't repeat them.  You will know what rank you are within a faction most of the time.  Upon completion of the required quests, a giant message is displayed on the screen announcing a rank improvement.  Also, you have a bar near your stats that tells you how liked by your faction you are.  <br>
<br>
(b) I claim this land for Spain!<br>
To help explain rank and faction a little better, lets examine probably the best buff in the game, Signet.  Signet is recieved from any guard of your faction before you head into hostile territory.  Signet will last an extra hour for every rank you have within the faction.  What Signet does is increase your chances to gain crystals (the magic McGuffins of FFXI), and allows you to accrue conquest points.  Conquest points are what gets tallied for zone control at the end of the week.  You can also spend conquest points on special items as you advance in ranks.  Spent conquest points still count toward your faction's totals.  Conquest points may also open up new areas to shop or activate new quests.  Faction members generally like it when you help their cause.  Wander out without a signet buff, and you might as well not be fighting in that area as far as your faction is concerned.<br>
<br>
(c) We're on a mission from God.<br>
Missions are structured to be easily completed by players at or around those levels where you'd need to have the next faction rank. They start out really easy, and end up being pretty drawn out affairs.  Each faction has a different set of missions for it's players, however by about the 9th mission, they start to blur together to the point where the only major difference is who you have to report to in each stage.  Mission goals are almost invariably triggered as well, no more waiting around unless the mission specifically requires you to.<br>
<br>
(d) Hey, beautiful woman!  We don't take kindly to your type round here.<br>
While you want to advance your own rank, it behooves you to occasionally group with players of other factions.  The biggest reason for this is that quests and missions occasionally require you to visit other cities, and it's always nice if the guards have a reason to let you in.  Opposing guards, while not hostile enough to kill you, aren't really inclined to help out your sorry butt if something clamps down on it, either.  For this reason, you will occasionally want to group with members of other factions.  Just not too many of them, as you're not in it to gain their faction more conquest points.  <br>
<br>
8. Just Jack! /em waves hands near his face.<br>
Fame is another important factor in your success.  Fame differs from rank in that while Rank involves how much power you may wield, fame is how well known you are in the world at large.  Think of it this way: The Undersecretary for Defense is a pretty dang powerful man, but I couldn't name him if you paid me.  On the other hand, David Lee Roth is lucky if the checkout girl respects him, but most of us could pick him out of a lineup.  Fame is gained by questing.  Quests are given out in a similar fashion to EQ, you wander around and accost NPCs until they give you something to do.  Thankfully, unlike EQ, both missions and quests don't involve trying to outsmart the game designer by figuring out which questions about an important term will generate responses.  If you have enough fame and rank to ask about something, the menu will prompt you with the correct question.  An NPC who won't tell you jack about a quest at first will gladly cough up his life story for someone of enough fame and rank.  Apparently, you get different levels of fame for every town by doing quests there, whether they're your faction or not.<br>
<br>
Also most quests don't appear to require massive amounts of time and effort, (read giant camp fests).  For instance, I've mentioned the advanced class quests previously.  Now I'd like to mention the AF quests, which are like epic armors for each class.  The Black Mage AF hat quest, for example, involves a final battle with a NM.  Thing is, you don't need a drop from this monster, you just need credit for the kill.  This leads to AF alliances, where multiple Black Mages will party together to trigger the NM, wait for him to despawn, then trigger another one for another mage.  When the final monster for the alliance is triggered, he gets to be the proud recipient of a multi-nuke beatdown.  Everyone then gets credit and heads off to retrieve their armor.  Once they finish, the next alliance is free to head on in and do their battle.  Unlike the frustration many of us saw in Velious or Luclin armor quests, FFXI seems to be relatively peaceful by comparison.  The hardest part is finding the people to help with the quest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :grin --><img src=http://www.graffe.com/emoticons/leetgrin.gif ALT=":grin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
9. Dear God, what’s this I hear about a story?<br>
Yup, FFXI has a story.  It’s surprisingly a good one too.  Unlike EQ, there is no drop in NPC story element either.  Instead of surprise visits from Al’kabor and his gang of imbeciles, you have a well structured sequence of missions that lead you along the storyline.  If an NPC is important to the storyline, he or she’s in the game already.  Basically, a long time ago the forces of light used crystals to crush the forces of darkness.  After so many years of everything running smoothly, monsters have started appearing on the edges of populated areas.  On top of that, crystals are getting rarer.  So, to combat this, each empire in the old alliance is on a quest to grab as much prime real-estate as possible to help it gather more crystals and keep it from being overrun.  That’s the bare-bones of your backstory.  From there, it takes off in true Final Fantasy style so that you end up understanding every nuance of the story from age to age, and identify every major player in the struggle.  Square-Enix likes to describe the focus on the story by the line: “The players = the characters”.  This isn’t nearly as odd as it sounds.  What it means is that every player in the game is potentially important to moving the story along, and you feel that way as you play.  This game is crawling with cut scenes.  Every quest, every mission, everything has it’s own special cut scene.  Some have multiple cut scenes.  Acquiring cut scenes is sometimes more important that acquiring quest items.  S-E likes to take out all the stops in this area.  You know when the storyline has advanced, and you almost always gain new information to help make sense out of all of it.  The giant gaps we saw in the EQ storyline are largely absent from FFXI.  Also, the storyline has a definitive beginning and end.  Sure, not everyone is going to want to finish off the Shadow Lord, but the option to do so is there if you want it.  Granted, the game doesn’t end when you do it, but I’d still love to see the cut scene for that.  Shadow Lord isn't even the last battle, you can go on missions for two more ranks after that.<br>
<br>
10. Playboy bunnies would be proud.<br>
I mentioned crystals before, and how important they are in the storyline.  Well, the true significance of these things can’t be understated.  They’re used in everything.  A copper ingot for a particular quest has a recipe that involves a fire crystal and 4 pieces of ore, for instance.  Crystals come in 8 types, 4 common, 4 rare.  Fire and Earth crystals are pretty easy to find, while wind and darkness crystals might take some looking.  Nearly every combine needs a crystal of the appropriate type.  Which sounds bad, but you don’t have to master any skills to finish quests if you don’t want to.  Tradeskill items made with crystals are all tradeable, and can be purchased from other players.  Thus, if your talent act really needs that set of crystal drinking goblets, you can acquire them without mastering glassblowing yourself.  Remember the Signet buff from before?  Well, that little gift from your guards drastically increases your drop rates for crystals.  Another buff that the guards can give you is Crysta, which is better for gathering crystals, but at the expense of not giving conquest points for kills, it's also shorter in duration.  Depends on how long you expect to hold a piece of territory, I guess.  If your faction snagged a bit of ground by something you suspect could only have been an act of god, Crysta might be worth it, as it'll revert back next week anyway.  Other skills also help with this area, such as the Thief’s Treasure Hunt ability.  In fact, thief and ranger main/sub jobs are pretty common in groups hunting solely for treasure and crystals.  <br>

Yup, I'm either in the running for a &quot;Resident Novellist&quot; title or the sweet smack of the ban bat.  Either way, when you spend a week writing something, you're going all the way with it.  Incidentally, how's the paint on your house look from the top of this thread?<br>
<br>
11. We are an equal opportunity employer.<br>
Remember how I said that race was fixed, but class is not?  Well, the extent of this is such that any race can choose any class.  Granted, some of you are more suited to specific classes, but if you really want to be a Gralka Black Mage, you can do it.  Taru Dragoons are also very interesting to watch in battle.  Any Taru melee class isn’t likely to do a lot of damage, but there’s definitely something to be said for sucking with style.  Later on, you can correct a great deal of your racial disadvantages with proper gear upgrades.  You may never reach maximum levels as easily as other races, but you can become reasonably effective if you stay at it long enough.<br>
<br>
12.  Lions and Tigers and GMs, oh my!<br>
Square-Enix has gone out on a limb and stated straight up that there will be 24 hr GM support.  Full GMs, too.  Also, GMs are required to be bilingual, to apply you’ve gotta be fluent in both English and Japanese.  Not just spoken Japanese either, you need to know two of the three written forms in order to translate, the semi formal and slang styles.  If you can’t wrap your head around Hirigana and Katakana, they don’t want you.  Which means, you’ve probably got reasonably intelligent GMs.  We’re dealing at least with high school graduates here, and given the requirements placed on them, it’s probable that they can troubleshoot and problem solve at a higher level than the often simian EQ support.  If you can handle the language, it’s not a bad job.  Doesn’t seem to be inspiring a lot of complaints from the current crop of players, either.<br>
<br>
13.  The Black Mage vs. the wizard.<br>
Well, most of us are concerned with this topic, so I thought I’d explore it a little here too.  Black Mages seem to be relatively solid in terms of their role within a party.  I mean, they’re one of the big six.  Everyone in the game knows what they do and has played with one or as one.  They seem to have avoided the shaft of “master of arcane teleportation”, I’ve only found two spells in that line.  Dezone, which I think is an evac, and I believe there’s an evac to town as well.  FFXI’s spell lists are also pretty intuitive.  For instance, there’s Fire 1, which is a fire based nuke spell.  As monsters get more powerful with leveling, you get Fire 2 and 3, which are upgraded versions of this spell.  As you get new spells, you can easily tell what they are and what they do, before you send them down range on the monsters.  I don’t know as yet if they have old favorites like Ultima or Meteo, but my fingers are crossed.  Biggest complaint right now about BLMs is that we have too much mana, with Taru BLMs often over nuking during combat to avoid wasting downtime.  It’s a welcome change, from my perspective.  Also, those who sub WM for the extra mana are welcomed in parties as a backup healer for the group, so you’ve got options if the group isn’t mage friendly.  Strangely, some players report that BLMs are one of the holy trinity classes in FFXI, apparently it's hard to do without them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :grinyes --><img src=http://www.graffe.com/emoticons/yes.gif ALT=":grinyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(a) That old black magic...<br>
Higher level BLM spells are quested, similar to higher level wizard spells in EQ.  Some also drop from NMs in high level zones.  Difference is that you know a particular NM is going to drop a certain spell, and you can expect to get it if your the only member of your alliance who needs it.  Popular NMs also lead to many of these spells being auctioned off.  I think right now there are 8 rare BLM spells, with Quake being the rarest, simply because not very many parties kill that particular NM.  I haven't heard anything about the spawn times on these NMs, but I have a lot of hope that they aren't anywhere near as bad as the NTOV/Ssra/Seru/etc runs we've all grown to loathe.  From what I've seen of the quests, they aren't bad.  As I mentioned, no mob waiting on quests, so it's all a matter of finding some buddies.<br>
<br>
14.  For Dmitry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :dmitry --><img src=http://www.graffe.com/emoticons/dmitry.gif ALT=":dmitry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pointy hats.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  There, I’ve said it.  Cat’s out of the bag.  BLMs get pointy hats.  RMs get pointy cowboy hats, with pimp feathers.  I’ve seen the screenshots.  The Taru at least get them.  They’re big, tan, have just the right amount of curvature at the top, and ooze style.  If pointy hats are your cup of tea, this is definitely your game.  Remember kiddies, there’s nuking, and then there’s nuking with style.<br>
<br>
15. Buy my crap.<br>
Can't remember if I've mentioned this yet, but auction has been tweaked with FFXI as well.  For instance, you don't have to be physically present to sell something.  You hit the auction zone/house?, tell the barker how much to charge, hand over the item, and go about your business.  Later on, you get paid for it.  It's so clean and simple it almost brings tears to my eyes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that’s my two cp.  On a lot of fronts, it looks better than EQ, at least in terms of the experience I was expecting in EQ and found lacking.  There are other ways that it probably won’t live up to expectations.  For instance, the Link Shell system seems kind of a pale comparison to EQ’s guild management system.  However, I should mention that alliances seem to be maxxed for 18 people, which means most encounters are tuned to pretty small sized shell networks.   It’d also be nice if Chocos were a little easier to obtain/handle.  What’s up with having to get boat/airship rides?  I don't like the server selection system, not because I think it goes too far, but because I don't think it goes far enough.  I mean, if you were randomly put on a server every time you logged on, you'd have less trouble with uber guilds owning a server, or server economies being radically screwed over on some servers and virtually non-existant on others.  But, other than those, I’m not finding a lot to pick at.  We’ll have to see how it pans out after NA release, if it lets me down, I’ll be back.  <br>
<br>
I welcome your thoughts and comments.  My view's more than a little biased, so I'd appreciate someone coming along to poke some holes in it about now.  Also, could any of S-E ideas be workable in EQ to address some of the probs we've experienced?<br>

Ok, Whiz, here's the skinny if you didn't see it in the other sections.  S-E's trying to capture the feeling of other final fantasy series games by trying to convince you that your character is a vital actor in the big play.  The game is crawling with cutscenes, thus when your party or your character accomplishes something, you get immediate visual feedback.  Instead of the text prompts we got in like the coldain shawl line, we get stuff happening on screen to let us know what's going down.  Usually the cutscenes will leak out more details about the backstory too.  In addition, they've keyed everything so that you need to advance the story to gain access to certain missions or quests, making the game a giant playable story with multiple characters.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just one question: does the Summoner job get to summon Bahamut?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To be honest, Eamin, I don't know.  I do know that you only start out with one summons, and then have to fight your way up to the others.  You gain summons by tracking them down and beating them in battle.  I know for sure that you can get Ifrit, Shiva, Titan, Leviathan, Garuda and Ramuh, just not sure on the others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It sounds pretty cool, but... It also seems like something I would rather play single-player...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, Nadiar, if single player's your thing, I'd wait for FFXII, which is scheduled for release next year and will be the next in the single player line.  Playing this is kinda like playing any of the Tolkein online games, it allows you to interact with other fans of the series online and do the kind of stuff you've always wished you could do with other people watching.  Thankfully, it appears to be better than most of the LoTR or Wheel of Time MMORPGs.  It's like playing regular Final Fantasy, but only controlling one character at a time, with your friends on the others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I also have a question. How is the sound and music?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, Goladus, I can sort of answer this, I'm not sure how important music is as far as introductions and such, but I do know who did the music and how well it seems to be done.  Nobuo Uematsu, who composed much of the series is playing a more limited role in this one, he's moved from composer to producer of much of the music.  S-E's got Naoshi Mizuta doing most of the music and almost all of the expansion tracks.  That said, S-E appears to be pretty confident on how it was done, because they've released soundtracks for both the main game and the expansion pack, and neither seems to be doing poorly.  Here's a link to a review of the music for you to look at: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/music/reviews/f-ff-ffxiost.shtml" target="top">www.gamesarefun.com/music/reviews/f-ff-ffxiost.shtml</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Well, not really.  You're all basically warriors of light, the main difference is going to be your faction, which plays triple duty as nation, ideology and worldview.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And does it follow the classic 8 element system found in most of the FFs (Fire, Ice, Thunder, Earth, Wind, Water, Holy, Shadow)? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yup, those are the crystal types.  You use each of them to create items and infuse weapons with abilities.  4 common types, 4 rare, I forget exactly which is which though.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, you might get a kick out of this too.  You have weather effects, and they each play a role in the gameplay.  For instance, the summoner quest requires you be present in a specific area during a weather effect.  Also, if it rains, for instance, water elementals start spawning in the zone.  I would suspect spells and such work differently in different weathers, but don't quote me on that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eaminwhitefalcon@graffeswizardcompilation>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br>  Posts: 7455<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 3:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An EQ player's take on Final Fantasy XI (Info Bomb).</span><hr size=1> !!!!!!!!!<br>

HOT DAMN! ÜBER! I guess that would be a reason to diversify your elemental attacks as a Black Mage, eh? You could use Thunder on water elementals during rainstorms, and Water on thunder elementals during lightning storms.<br>

Sometimes when it butchers your post because you forgot a slash or forgot to uncheck &quot;Use Emoticons,&quot; when you open it up to edit you'll find all kinds of HTML comments like EZ CODE START BOLD.
