My best suggestion would be to be a good playing wizard and impress the people that your grouped with.  That way when they see you shout for a group they might say .. Oh! He is a good wizard.. you guys want him? <p><img src=http://dups.50megs.com/dups2.jpg>

From this perspective, a dead class of any kind cannot sustain damage.  That goes for casters, and melees alike.<br>
<br>
So the argument that a caster needs to be balanced against a melee + healer is way off the mark.<br>
<br>
A melee class that doesn't take damage can sustain damage output indefinitely.  <br>
A caster class cannot.

Saying casters are unbalanced from a melee perspective is only valid if the melee isn't taking any form of damage...otherwise, any arguments fly out the window.  Certainly though, rogues, rangers, monks, etc. will do more damage than a wizard (or any other caster, for that matter), but they can't do it as fast as we can.  It's like trading 1 dmg/sec for 500 seconds for 400 dmg in 1 second and more downtime.  Just depends how you look at it...there's a slight difference, but that comes with doing all the damage all at once.<br>

That some classes solo well is a Mere side effect.<br>
<br>
Now in a group, when was the LAST time you ever heard of a Melee call for downtime because he was Forced into it through the game mechanics (Twink or Not doesn't matter).  The people that Manage the mana call the downtime, it's THEIR downtime that drags down the entire group.  When was the Last time you saw a Melee have to sit out a fight while everybody else does their Job?  Never seen it myself.  Yet I see Wizards sit out fights all the time(Myself Included) why?  Because for whatever reason we Burned all our mana in the prior fight.  Melee in a group has no downtime, whether that be Rogue, Warrior, Monk - the 3 Classes that have NO mana have no downtime in a group.  Any downtime there is imposed upon them BECAUSE of the casters running low on mana.<br>

Seriously here, when you are in a group situation you need that tank as much as he need thats healer. You said it yourself in your post - &quot;Know how to avoid stealing aggro from tank&quot;. So basically in a group situation, you need more than that tank. Plus, if there is a warrior/paladin/sk in group you can bet that the rogue and monk are doing this famous &quot;non-healing damage&quot; too.<br>
<br>
And some people seriously under estimate tanks. At level 30 my Monk was in Cured Silk. Because of hunting in CC he gained enough money for Silver Chitin Handwraps and other nice goodies (on his own, I might add). By level 34 he could solo the whole Pit area, take care of the wanderers, and look for more waiting for the Pit area to respawn. He could do 2-3 fights before he would have to bandage up. Bandage trick + mend = 90+ health. Downtime = 1-2min. Rarely had to sit down and regain health ...just when adds came and FD failed more than once.<br>
<br>
I would like to see a Wizard do that. XP beat quading because downtime so small, fights were about 45 seconds each, and dungeon xp modifier on top of that.<br>
<br>
Be a level 30 something Wizard in EQ's present day with 'other's hits' turned on and embrace The Matrix™. And no, I am no longer a level 30 Wizard but I do have a few alts and having knowledge of the Wizard class I know what we can and cannot do.<br>
<br>
Trust me, there is plenty of 'why'.<br>

Therefore a Wizard's downtime is dependent on his mana total and ability to regenerate that mana.<br>

A warrior's ability to continue combat is based on how much damage he can withstand, a wizard's ability to continue combat is based on how much damage he can inflict.<br>

Editing this post because obviously alot of posts came in as I was posting mine, and Dryfft seems to be under the impression I have a reading problem.<br>
For clarity's sake, am I the only person that has Aggro kited and/or fear kited outdoors WITH a goddamn group?  YES, as a WIZARD I have been the factor that allowed a group to function OUTDOORS without a goddamn fucking asswipe healer.  Granted, the holy trinity is far easier, it is capable of getting the phat lewts and exploring the deep dungeons, but Wizards CAN and DO lend ALOT to groups and people whining and moaning about damage numbers and data crunching need to look at the big picture and get their heads out of their asses, or start a monk/rogue and shut up.  Slowly, Wizard DPS is being given enhancements, I for one have faith that Planes of Power WILL address alot of these concerns appropriately.  For now I am content in AOE groups, raiding, and OUTDOOR grouping on my horse with Mana Robe, familiar, Focus Items, KEI, PoTG, and any other mana regenerating effect I can cultivate.  Oh, critical strikes own. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uravilicuslolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravilicus LoLF</A> at: 4/10/02 12:20:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udryfft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dryfft</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 253<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 1:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Ravilicus,<br>

<br>
It seems a lot of people's comparisons are made with a monk with a fungi tunic.  A fungi tunic is rare to say the least.  I will probably never have enough pp to even think of buying one.  So while that is an example, it's not really enough to be a basis for comparison.  And even if wizards were made to be as powerful as a twinked tank, than we're putting all the people who are new to the game (ie, un-twinked) and play a tank at a disadvantage.  Now they need to be twinked to keep up with the casters.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we don't need balance, but some people seem to be really irrational when discussing this.  The fact that we can deal out damage so fast DOES make a difference.  The fact that we can root and/or attack from a distance without taking any hits does make a difference.<br>
<br>
Think about it.  If a wizard could put out as much sustained damage as a tank (or tank with healer), and solo well, and quad kite, and port, and bind, why would anyone play a tank?  We would just have groups of 6 wizards all rooting and nuking.  There are other factors aside from sustained damage that need to be considered.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I have played two characters into their 30's, a shadow night and a wizard.  I have not noticed much, if any, difference in the availability of groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saradin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1649<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 2:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> But just to answer soloing since so many Wizards do it...<br>

<br>
Pre-50 you are 100% wrong. Twink or non-twink, you are wrong. Any melee who has done their research and saved up for the right gear and armor will out perform a Wizard easily.<br>
<br>
A twink... well let us not even go there. Let's just say all the manastones, horses, siw, etc. still will not keep you in the running. Not when they are taking on reds in LOIO and other places regening with their fungi tunics and wielding some pretty damn fun toys themselves.<br>
<br>
Post-50 the gap closes quite a bit. But SKs, Paladins even (mostly in undead places), Rangers, and most definately Monks will give Wizards a good run for their money in low 50s. At around level 60, good gear, maybe aaxp (depending on class) a melee will either match or regain the lead.<br>
<br>
SKs, Paladins, and Monks are awesome dungeon soloers - which means... dungeon xp modifier. Just by level 40 my Paladin friend was doing anywhere from 600-900dmg in procs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> alone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> against the undead - in a grouping situation making the fights last oh... 10-20 seconds.

<br>
I have a level 45 bard.  His gear is hardly uber - heck, I don't have complete lambent on him, I own one peice of singing steel (boots, Lev effect) and I'm wearing Mithril pants and a Sarnak Emblazoned Tabard.  Weaps are a Symphonic Saber and a D'Zok Wristsnapper.<br>
<br>
At level 45, I'm having trouble with my favorite soloing spot - because of all the competition with the 50 to 55 druids and wizards.  What's that again?  I'm soloing him in spots where casters five to ten levels higher are getting xp.  And while the bard isn't quadding, he doesn't have downtime either.  (In case you're wondering, I'm fearkiting at the Combine fort in DL.)  The songs I twist are Snare, Fear, and Haste songs.  When the mob turns into a runner I drop Fearsong and twist in Healing, and am full health before the fight is done.  Please note here - NO damage songs, all damage is melee.<br>
<br>
So, if you think wizards are balanced - or any casters for that matter - then tell me how a barely-twinked bard can nonstop kill blue through yellow mobs with no downtime while wizards and druids kiting four at a time have to stop and rest in between.<br>
<br>
Note, also, that this is in a soloing situation.  If you want to talk about grouping, ask yourself what a bard brings to a group vs. a wizard.  Ok, now stop laughing.  You KNOW the bard isnt' AFK for more than two minutes, tops, any zone I have any business fighting in at all.<br>
<br>
Yes, bards are generalists while wizards are specialists.  I still claim the comparison is valid, as I'm talking about all casters, not just wizards - and Druids have the same problems grouping that we do.<br>

I think mana regen should also take INT in account.. with 200 int you should regain more mana than with 150 int.. and basic mana regen at 100 int. <br>
So if you regen 10 mana per tick with 100 int, you should regain 15 / tick with 150 and 25 mana with 255. <br>
<br>
face it, to do equal damage to a warrior DWieng Centi weapons we need all our pre 50 spells increased by 50% in damage. We will never be able to outdamage someone with really uber tradeable weapons (like the reaver) Verant is just not able to do so <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umarttog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marttog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 327<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 2:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> I was in a group in Seb the other day with a rogue that just plain put me to shame.

<br>
As far as soloing.   <br>
<br>
I remember a time in my 20's I happened to be sitting next to a necro that had same level as I and was soloing the same mobs as I.   He would kill 2 in the time I killed one then was ready for a second.  Sure, I would kill them faster than he, be he was far out pacing me over time.<br>
<br>
I have, even post-50, been out paced by monks, SKs, and even warriors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=liquid>Liquid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 2:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Your bard comparison is a good one.  But I'm not saying that no balancing is needed.  I'm just saying that all the other abilities that wizards/casters have need to be taken into account.  Many people here seem to not be doing that.  Dmg/sec is perhaps the most important, but it is certainly not the only thing to consider.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the necro soloing example above... remember that his pet was taking 50% of his experience.  So he wasn't really outpacing you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uharmonieofbristleb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harmonie of Bristleb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 3:08 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Here is why I say wizards (and Casters in general) need &quot;Balanced&quot;<br>
<br>
Scenerio 1: (from my wizards view) My wiz is level 40. she plays with the same 6 ppl all the time(War, War, Chanter, Cleric, Shaman, Wiz) Her role as snarer/evacer/Damage Dealer is secure as long as we fighting blues.  When we were in 20's we went to Nurga and were fighting pretty much nonstop I finally gave up casting because all that happened was I got resist messages.  I would spend the night practicing conjeration, nothing else to do<br>
<br>
Now that we are over 35 we mostly fight blues so that isnt so much of an issue, But still when we have a big pull, so I burn down the first 2 or 3 as fast as I can, then I med thru the rest and the next 2 - 3 pulls after.  We are currently in Droga (at chief) and our biggest pull to date is 8,  The melees .. they get to (have to) keep fighting and Im out for the next 5 min or so.<br>
<br>
Lastly parse the damage done by either of those two warriors and compare it to mine.  They are moderately twinked, some cobalt/crusty.  Im moderately twinked but no flowing thought items (Doh!) or other things that improve my casting efficiency (rt click nukes, etc)<br>
<br>
Scenerio 2: (from my clerics view) Im playing my cleric (lvl 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and we have a group composition that often goes like this - Dru 51, Monk 50, SK 41, War 46, Clr 48. Mag 37.  But not all are available any given nite.  If we have 4 of the 6 we play. Who should that 5th or 6th person be.  We get better xp leaving that spot empty (or adding monk/ rogue) then we do adding a wiz.   Also a chanter 52 sits beside us for clarity/haste and occasionally mez  - efficiency goes way down when we put chanter in group but we do sometimes for safety.  (I'm not implying that a live chanter isnt an asset to a group... however, a permanently AFK chanter does not pull thier own weight) <p><font size = 3><font color = #0000FF><b>Harmonie Moonsong <BR></font>

<br>
Seems like a proper comparison.  Now for the drastic imbalances that have caused this whole stink:<br>
<br>
Heals do not get resisted<br>
Heals are WAY more mana effecient than nukes (think Cheal and celestial elixer)<br>
Heals draw very little aggro<br>
You cannot &quot;heal&quot; mana (necros can twitch at a horrid ratio but only healers are going to get the twitch due to previously stated effeciency)<br>
melee damage is a high % of what our nukes do in the same timeframe (melee can dish out quite a lot of damage in 6 seconds) <p><b><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68788'>Oxoxo Xoxox</a></b> Sorcerer<BR>
