<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*****And for the love of all that is good, please read all of this before posting?  A lot of the responses I'm seeing seem to argue with me as if I'm saying that the flag requirements are good as they are and shouldn't be changed. THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  I agree that as they are, the Flag Requirements SUCK.  Which is why I've also come up with suggestions to make the flag quests FAR easier to complete.  Thank you.*****</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I don't think there are many people that would disagree with the statement that getting rid of the flag requirements on so many zones is a BAD idea.<br>
<br>
I believe it was said best by Krilen in the main thread posted by Rombus: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Removing flags does not make content available to more players, it removes content from ALL players.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There are 3 types of players to consider.<br>
A) Casual Gamers<br>
B) Mid-range Guilds<br>
C) Top Tier Guilds.<br>
<br>
Casual gamers will have a terrible time getting into the planes.  Lots of casual gamers are still stuck at the PoJ trials.  I believe this is the area SoE is trying to address.<br>
<br>
Mid-Range guilds may have trouble with the Trials, but after some work and raids, shouldn't have too much of a problem with them. And the Key quests were a really good idea, and it shouldn't be scrapped. The key quests are perfectly balanced now that getting a key flags 6 people at once.  THE perfect dungeon for Mid-range guilds in my opinion is the Temple of Solusek Ro, and that is what I feel the Key Quests should work up to.  It would be an Ending, rather than the key quests just stopping.<br>
<br>
High End guilds are the most hindered by the flagging process.  One person misses a raid because his leg was crushed by an oncoming vehicle and now they'll possibly have to wait weeks to get the flag again, not to mention drag all the already flagged people through again.  This is the other area SoE is trying to address.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">The way I see it: </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Remember! Flag quests flag your GROUP too!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">First of all, for the Mid-Level guilds.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
I believe this group would be the easiest to please.  I think they would agree that the Plane of Tactics, Bastion of Thunder, Plane of Nightmare B, Crypt of Decay, Plane of Torment (I can't say I recall a PoTorment Key quest, but I think there is one, if you have information about it, please post it) and Halls of Honor key quests are well implemented (well, make Perillium Ore and Agony Mephit Heart droppable) for mid-level guilds to accomplish.  <br>
<br>
Create a key quest that allows entry into the Temple of Solusek Ro requiring drops from each of these zones, and it would be an awesome reward for mid-range guilds, requiring around the same amount of effort and dedication that high level guilds require to enter this zone.  This zone is already set up to be the perfect End-zone for mid-level guilds to shoot for.  Wrought with difficult mobs, highly challenging...  And the mini's respawn fast enough to not be a major conflict with Top tier guilds.  This flag quest doesn't need to flag the group like other key quests depending on difficulty.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondly, the Casual gamer:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
A Key quest for plane of Valor/Storms. Something that can be done by a group of level 55's in cloth and fine plate. Even. I suggested a quest requiring 4 ground-spawns on 30 minute timers from PoKnowledge, PoTranquility, PoInnovation, and Podisease.  The Innovation and Disease pieces requiring fighting to the spawn point.<br>
The Crypt of Decay key can be soloed with enough effort.<br>
As for Bastion of thunder, faced with a complete removal of the key quest entirely as the alternative...  Perhaps, decrease the drop rate of the Bone, Beards, and Sashes slightly and turn the quest into 2 different ones.  After handing in the storm giant head to Askr, you only require the 2 Esoteric Medallions to gain entry to Bastion of Thunder.  ALTHOUGH, handing in the Bone, Beard and Sash combination will allow you access to BoT, but with a penalty of some sort.  As to what this penalty is, I don't really have an idea. <br>
PoNightmare B is a boring zone. Casual gamers have no need for it.<br>
Making Perillium Ore blocks and Agony Mephit hearts droppable would help casual gamers gain access to Halls of Honor while still retaining its level of difficulty. In addition, regarding the Mephit Heart, removing the ability to see invis from many of the mobs that populate Plane of Nightmares would make the Mephit caves more popular place to hunt.  Again, when faced with the alternative, this becomes increasingly appealing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">As for Top Tier guilds....</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
This is where it gets difficult.  And this is the Idea I'm most proud of.  Backwards Flagging!!!<br>
In addition to the regular flags you would receive.<br>
Killing Mithaniel Marr flags you for Halls of Honor (Aerin'Dar), and all the Halls of Honor Trials (HoHb)<br>
Killing Terris Thule flags you for PoNb (hedge event).<br>
Killing Bertoxxulous flags you for Crypt of Decay (Grummus).<br>
Killing Saryrn flags you for PoNightmare B, and Plane of Torment (Saryrn).<br>
Killing Agnarr flags you for Bastion of Thunder (Askr's quest).<br>
Killing Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek (need both) Flags you for Plane of Tactics (behemoth).<br>
Killing Rallos Zek flags you for Plane of Tactics, Vallon/Tallon Zek (makes sense since you fight them anyways)<br>
Killing Solusek Ro flags you for Halls of Honor, Halls of Honor Trials, Plane of Nightmares B, Plane of Torment, Crypt of Decay, Crypt of Decay basement, Bastion of Thunder, Mithaniel Marr, Saryrn, Bertoxulous, Karana/Agnarr, and Temple of Solusek Ro.<br>
**Note, there's no good place to stick the Carprin/Ultor event, so if you can't kill Sol Ro yet, you're still stuck having to do this to gain access to the Basement**<br>
<br>
And there you have it.  Once a guild gets to the elemental planes, they only need to kill Rallos Zek and Solusek Ro to get a new guildmate up to speed.<br>
<br>
All these changes can be implemented without interfering with each other. And it solves a lot of problems.  If you spot any glaring holes in my logic, I only ask that you come up with a logical way to fix it rather than just pointing out that I'm a blind idiot. &gt;;p <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0000;">S</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF1D00;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF3A00;">g</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF5900;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF7600;">X</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF9400;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFB100;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFCF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFEC00;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:ECFF00;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:CFFF00;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:B1FF00;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:94FF00;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:76FF00;">N</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:59FF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:3AFF00;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:1DFF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF00;">l</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF1D;">f</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF3A;">l</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF59;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF76;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF94;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFB1;">,</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFCF;">N</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFEC;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00ECFF;">k</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00CFFF;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00B1FF;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0094FF;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0076FF;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0059FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:003AFF;">o</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:001DFF;">f</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0000FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:1D00FF;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:3A00FF;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:5900FF;">6</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:7600FF;">5</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:9400FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:B100FF;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:CF00FF;">D</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:EC00FF;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00EC;">g</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00CF;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00B1;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0094;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0076;">B</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0059;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF003A;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF001D;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0000;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Maybe the respawn time of Rallos and Sol Ro would become a bit more of an issue since those 2 would become the more contested bottlenecks, but in most cases that could be worked around. If you would want to do it perfect, I'd say also recude the respawn of those 2 from 3 to 2 days, but that's about the only thing I could find. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~tom.van.der.veen/Sig-custom.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lysandorverantics>Lysandor Verantics</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Samadhi owes me<BR>a neato title</span><br>  Posts: 814<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 7:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> /agree <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tigertailz>tigertailz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 482<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 7:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Create a key quest that allows entry into the Temple of Solusek Ro requiring drops from each of these zones, and it would be an awesome reward for mid-range guilds, requiring around the same amount of effort and dedication that high level guilds require to enter this zone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The first group doesn't like it for two reasons. The other didn't have to work to get in these zones and they don't want their hunting spots crowded. The second group is really happy of course because they will finally get to hunt in these zones. I am not flagged for any zones except PoNb and I kinda don't like the idea of opening these zones up. I liked the idea of people actually having to work to get into zones with better exp/loot. Now the zones are going to be full of people that didn't want to work for their flags or didn't actuallt work hard enough. A good thing about it is that the tier one zones will now be empty and I will have less competition for my hunting spots. I can see the logic behind this move by SOE, but I think they need to rethink this one. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://img.ranchoweb.com/images/nattikfrostreaver/yodasig.6236527.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aphasiaandesite>Aphasia Andesite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 9:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I disagree</span><hr size=1> <br>
I think that the strong influence of high end players on this board is making the discussion lopsided, as people who have spent hours and hours on flags dont want to see their work and their private hunting grounds get crowded. <br>
<br>
As someone in a small guild, I like the freeing up of new planes. I like being able to hunt with all my guildmates, not the half of them who are flagged. I like being able to see new zones. Maybe the half my guild that has pretty much quit will come back and play again when this goes through. <br>
<br>
Why am I posting this? I know I wont change you guy's opinions, I just fear that a SOE person is reading this and taking notes, and I do not want them to get the feeling that we all agree.<br>

Even if you don't have friends, PoS and PoV are easy to get. PoJ trials are ridiculously easy if you are in level range you should be to advance in PoP.<br>
<br>
Quests/flag to PonB, CoD, HoH, BoT are easy and doable even if you are in small / casual guild.<br>
<br>
Tactics and Torment I don't know about (personally just killed the flag mobs).<br>
<br>
Looks like most of the people who gripe about the access to those places are too lazy to do the quest or PoJ trial and feel that they deserve to get there without any effort, because they paid for the expansion. These are the same people who whine about VP being keyed, ST being keyed and VT being keyed. The concept of putting some effort in to get rewards just escapes those people.<br>
<br>
Or they are people who are too low level to survive PoJ trial, which is clear indication of leveling up some more before progressing. But why don't these people compain that one needs to be 46 to enter planes? I mean, if I had 20th level toon and bought the expansion, shouldn't I deserve access to everywhere too?<br>
<br>
Simply put, those flags they're opening are to places where 99% of people who had any effort could get easily, the recent &quot;flag whole group when doing quest&quot; made it even easier. I for one don't understand why people like to have stuff handed on silver platter and like the removal of rewards in game. Why play the game where there is nothing to accomplish / aim for?<br>

Opening up the planes simply exacerbates the situation its not about the raid mobs its about xp spots I think. Guilds will simply permacamp the spots and switch out members with a alliance of other guilds on thier level. Thus sony will dump the flagging system and the players will retaliate by iron fisted control of the &quot;good camps&quot; P. Either way its a lose lose deal for all involved. Its about getting some decent xp and a roll on some items in the playtime you have available. Sony looks like teh win for removing the flags and players that can handle the camps look like assholes for ignoring the 50 velks geared people lfg at the zoneline irregardless of class.Getting into the zone preflag removal will look easy compared to getting a group irregardless of the class. <br>
   Unless the xp modifier is ramped up and the loot tables are  <br>
 heavily revised for pre pop zones to include specs and runes and comparable armor and items to POP zones there will be DRAMA P. Reitemizing old quests that require a group + would be a good thing. By reitiemzing I do not mean drops like the advanced magic manual which is craptastical when compareed to say a fluted scorpion stinger for 5 k in the bazaar P. Need versus want is not a viable argument either no people may not need x item with x stats but its a carrot to play and pay. When you reach a point ingame where you need to do the worst timesink ingame for months &quot;plat farming&quot;<br>
to purchase something thats a marginal upgrade at best you dont't really have any incentive to play or pay. <br>
 I will wait and see what sony does at the moment it appears that things are F____D up sony can't fix it and the more they try the worse it gets &gt;<br>

Maybe pov/s but that's a stretch.  AT LEAST put a level restriction on entering them unless you do the quest.  Level 46 characters in BoT are a really, really bad idea.  I'm not flagged for all of the zones they are opening.  And I really would like to see them all, but not like this.<br>
<br>
I thought the flagging idea of PoP was one of the worst ideas, and just kept the casual gamer out of the good places.  But as time went on I realized that it was one of the best ideas.  You really feel like you accomplished something when you finally get your pov/s flag from the trials.  Or go through the quest to get flagged for BoT...<br>
<br>
Now my question is, since they say they will reward those who already have the flags...What are they going to do for the people who have all but one piece for a flag?  Just say &quot;Oh too bad you were too slow,&quot;  or will we be able to finish the quest and get whatever reward they are planning on giving? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarinthus>Xarinthus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Slightly nuttier than<BR>a Planter's factory</span><br>  Posts: 1640<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 1:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree.</span><hr size=1> tigertailz and Gwideon, I ask that you please elaborate on your opinions.  Why do you feel creating a difficult quest to enter the Temple of Solusek Ro is a bad idea tigertailz? What if the quest didn't flag 6 people at once like other quests and required every person to farm the items?  Would that be a balanced alternative? I was hoping for logical debates so that my ideas could get more refined.<br>
<br>
And Gwideon, why do you like the idea of all these planes being opened? You're in the minority, but I would love to hear your opinion because it seems a lot of people are afraid to speak up if they like the idea of flag requirements being removed.<br>
<br>
Do you find that my ideas on changes to the flagging quests aren't enough?  <br>
I want to add a quest to bypass the Exe trial.<br>
Make the Block of Perillium and Agony Mephit heart droppable to make HoH much easier to enter.<br>
Break the Bastion of Thunder quest into two parts to make it easier for all.<br>
Perhaps upping the spawn rate of Diaku Raiders, OR remove their ability to summon.<br>
<br>
Would these changes be enough? If no, why not?

My guild on Vazaelle was once quite a small guild, but we sat down, made a list of things we wanted to do, and did them as a team.<br>
<br>
We have, for instance, one day a week that we work on epics. It's not such a big deal any more, but having a systemic approach to it meant that, lo and behold, we got them. When PoP came out, we did the same thing with the PoJ trials -- we organized nights and kept at it ALL night until we got folks through.<br>
<br>
If your guild hasn't got links to all the GROUP GROUP GROUP flag quests on its board and aren't working, individually and as a group, on getting these pieces done (you don't need to pass the trials to get into Crypt of Decay, btw), I do not believe it's because of Verant holding you back, it's because you guys couldn't bother. It sounds insulting, but it's not: These quests are just that easy.<br>
<br>
The only POSSIBLE bottleneck I could see for small guilds getting into higher planes is the PoJ trials, but as I see unguilded necros in the post-PoJ planes on Vazaelle, I'm gonna have to guess that pick-up groups work even for non-wizard/enchanter/cleric/warriors, all of whom can pretty much just sit in PoJ and go through a million pick-up trials until they're flagged. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz_toon.gif" height="104" width="390" alt="stats" border=0></a>

Thing is, what will be the reward for all those players who got themselves flagged?  Maybe it will be worth the while.  Assuming that they are being screwed over by this is not necessarily the case.<br>
<br>
BTW I am a &quot;casual player&quot; - and I have lots of friends thank you very much.  Not having friends is not the problem of the casual player.  I could have gotten flagged but chose to do other things with my time.  <br>
<br>
As to a bunch of gimp players, trains, KC8 or whatever iteration now.  I always laugh at these comments because it just sounds so elitist.  But I had been hearing the same kind of complaints about at least HoH and PoV for a long time now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarinthus>Xarinthus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Slightly nuttier than<BR>a Planter's factory</span><br>  Posts: 1641<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 1:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree.</span><hr size=1> Urge, I find you're quite mistaken. For any guild that's made it to the elemental planes, there is no reason to exp in PoTactics or BoT or HoH... but I assure you these zones aren't Empty, and that &quot;Not many people exp there&quot; is incorrect.<br>
<br>
Tactics is quite a popular exp place.  Halls of honor once they remove the summoning mobs will once again be popular, and making the quest easier as I have suggested would help get more people in.  The same goes with Bastion of Thunder.<br>
<br>
These three zones are VERY easy to train. Have you ever zoned into Plane of Tactics with a few Diaku's walking back from the Zone out past the Graveyard?<br>
Have you ever zoned into halls of Honor with a 20 mob train at the entrance?<br>
Have you ever zoned into Bastion of Thunder with one of the Wing named waiting and standing in the graveyard?<br>
<br>
Making these places easier to access is good, but removing the flags altogether hurts more people than it helps.<br>
<br>
As for a Key quest to enter the Tower of Solusek Ro, why would it piss you off so much?  They would still require killing Rallos Zek in order to challenge Sol Ro. And no mid range guild is going to be able to do either of these things.  The bottleneck into the Elemental planes will remain unchanged.<br>
<br>
Have you ever done any of the key quests?  Have you ever considered doing all of them?  Do you realize how long and difficult it would be to complete every single key quest for every member of a mid-range guild AND complete this new quest requiring farming item drops from PoNb, PoTactics, HoH, BoT, PoTorment, and Crypt of Decay?<br>
<br>
Right now Mid-range guilds cannot progress to past BoT, HoH, PoTorment, CoD and PoTactics.  Tower of Sol Ro would be a great end of the line raid zone for a mid-level guild, and wouldn't really interfere with the high-end guilds that go there for flagging purposes or what not.  Remember, you can't click out of Sol Ro Tower, so no crazy trains.  And it <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> be a reward for lots of hard work, patience and dedication.  Near the same level as what I'm sure you put in towards getting flagged the normal way.<br>
<br>
Compare this with my backwards flagging idea, and I think you'll find it's very fair, while still retaining its difficulty.<br>
<br>
&lt;==EDIT==&gt;<br>
Alright Lunal, thank you for leting us know your opinion, and I apologize if things I said in my original post offended you.<br>
Okay, make the PoD larvae pieces droppable as well.  That will allow people to buy their way into Crypt of Decay. (and 5 of their friends)<br>
Making the Perillium Ore and Agony Mephit heart droppable would pretty much make it possible to buy your way (and 5 friends) into HoH as well.<br>
Bones, Sashes, and Beards drop and are open to people to come and loot all the time.  EXPing in Postorms until you get all three won't be to bad.<br>
No one hunts in Plane of Torment.  But if anyone has info on the PoTorment key quest (if there is one) I'd love to look into it and find ways to improve it for casual players.<br>
And I also already suggested a key quest to bypass the Trials to enter PoValor/Storms <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarinthus>Xarinthus</A> at: 5/11/03 1:53:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12714<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 1:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I'm for opening up the zones because it will save me time and allow me more places to xp.
