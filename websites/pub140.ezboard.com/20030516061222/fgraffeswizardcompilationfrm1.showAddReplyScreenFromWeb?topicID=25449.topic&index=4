The Spoiler:<br>
<br>
For the non-believers, the idiots, the copycats, the curious, and the unorigionals: how to solo PoF, for dummies.<br>
<br>
The hardest part, far and away, is the break in. I had to practice it a few times to get it right, and if you want to give it a shot, do the same, and come prepared, if you don't have Nexus Gate, bring a CT wand. There are 3 ways to break into fear; 1) a WW break, 2) a kite break, 3) a stealth run. Incidently, to save yourself unecesary pain and deathtouches, go stunting in PoF when the golems are not up. Draco and CT are easy to work around, but they tend to attract visitors, which moots the effort of soloing PoF.<br>
<br>
#1 I spent alot of energy learning how to break WW with consistent results. You're looking at having to cope with as many as 5 mobs doing it properly, and more if you screw up, one or more of these mobs will be a scareling. Get levitate and SoW up, invis, and zone in, hang a 110 degree left and head down to the wall, start from here, don't feel obligated to do it all in one run. If you can finish a mob and you're in a situation that is tighter than you're able to handle gate out, come back and start over. Chip a fairly reliable safe hole one mob at a time. Nothing in PoF hits particularily hard, if you've got an Aego doing this it's not a big sweat. What will kill you is when you let a scareling hit you and it procs you, causing you to bite off more than you can chew, scarelings come in fast, and you can't always hear or see a new one coming in time to deal with it before it creates a problem. But, when you get into the grove of doing it a few times, it tends to click together pretty well. But shit happens, and if you chew a proc into the middle of all hell, and it breaks lose, dip into tactic number 2:<br>
<br>
#2 North Wall (if you don't know what specific area I'm talking about when I say &quot;North Wall&quot; this thread's not particularily useful to you) is a beautiful place, it's just a tad out of the way from zone in. If you break WW, it's almost worth the trouble to get to North Wall anyways, if you bugger up a WW break, you don't have the option, you're going to North Wall. If you forgot to SoW and levitate yourself, you're already dead. Without pulling the tents, make a wide lap around the hill (skip this if you're not coming off a failed breakin), you've alredy pulled most of the mobs in the area by screwing up, just makes sure you get the rest. You won't have any trouble outrunning anything here, the scarelings will keep pace if you circle too tight, just use discression, grab more and more of the trash between you and North Wall by running continuous loops. Your eyes, and ears, have to stay open. You don't need to have something charge you head on and stun you. Once you get it done to the firewall, and have a nice big clusterfuck of a train following you, loop back again, and head for zone in, when you get there, make sure the mobs stay close enough that they don't &quot;lose aggro&quot; and wander off, which tends to happen if you build a huge lead (you'll have to play around to keep ahead of the scarelings while keeping close enough to the rest, drop a bonds of force *NOT ATOLS*, on them and they'll drop down to around the same movement speed as the rest, if you can). Once you get to ZI, make like the gingerbread man and run run as fast as you can to North Wall, bind yourself (you should have bind loaded ahead of time, if you don't, or want more spells up, get the scares snared and you'll can get enough distance to load it when you run to ZI the first time), and head back to ZI. Gate to North Wall, and gate out of the zone.<br>
<br>
#3 I'd heard if you took off from ZI towards the tents you could make it to North Wall without aggro, I could never get it right myself, and always ended up reverting back to a very messy #2, since I'd start in the middle of everything, but when I went and cleared through here, I think I saw what the other person saw, and I'm fairly sure it can be done. This is a bit too spoilerific to hand out mind you, so it stays with me <br>
<br>
If you're sitting at North Wall with no aggro, congrats, you're through the hardest part. Your spell lineup should include the following: ice spear, root, atols, and an out-of-zone gate (tox for example), there's no excuse to not use harvest really, but you don't need it either. There are 2 glare lords which path through the safe area between you and the firewall, and they will aggro on you. You can wait for them, or deal with them as they come, it's no matter, just keep in mind you're going to have to do 2 of them off the bat. Glare lords are simple to fight, they have a pet that you can one-shot with sunstrike, cast an easily resistable mana drain (actually, it might not even be a mana drain, it never landed on me once that I noticed, I'm just guessing off the name), an AE dispell, and run at jboot speed. It doesn't matter how much stunning you throw, you could throw one in a summoning-mob style lockdown, but it's difficult to do with these, with the statics it's easier, you're probably going to end up buffless. Snare the lord and pet, take out the pet, and chew through the lord, keep enough distance so that if an AE dispell goes off it's not going to take the snare off it or its pet. Since the first of these you are going to be fighting at NW I'll plug about NW now: from the first tree towards ZI to about where the fire wall curves away there's a safe area you can kite in, it's hard to describe, but if you take a few minutes looking at pathing when you are sitting at NW, you can figure it out, it's not alot of space, but it's way more than enough.<br>
<br>
Clear out the phobos / nightmares / phantasms up to the glare lord structure. Scout around with an eye of talon until you find something you can solo pull, pull it, the farther you break in, the easier it is. There's one scareling that roams through this mess as well, and I do believe a wraith, though I saw it there on my practice run and never had to kill it on the clearing. The phobos are medium MR, and nothing special. The nightmares run at jboots speed, and cast a PB blind AE, that's easily resistable (and that shouldn't be hitting you anyways), that they'll cast even when you're not in AE range. The phantasms have a big hitbox and cast a small (52?) point lifetap. It's annoying to quad because the Phantasms and Nightmares occasionally pause (the different runspeed of the nightmares is easy to deal with, I'll get into that later when it's more relevant), and you haven't dug a very big hole in the plane yet, I found it more practical to do solo pulls. If you've got a velk/rend/whatever robe finish off the mobs in flee mode with it since it's more mana efficient, the difference it creates with running phobos that you have to deal with the hassle of breaking roots and whatnot these days with ice spear and crits hardly makes it worth the extra effort. <br>
<br>
From here on in, clearing PoF is 75% chore, 25% hard. Start working along the wall towards ZI, try and take most of your pulls back towards the NW area to avoid complications. The first area you'll go through is what looks like a &quot;gap&quot; in the mobs on the way to NW, just previous to it, start here and weed out the mobs that roam through. You'll be clearing through spiders (ice immune, dd proc), shiverbacks (not ice immune, even though I thought so for some reason, dd proc), decrepit warders (one of these roams in from the tent area, and usually will be out of site, he has a habit of wandering in and biting you on the ass, keep an eye out for him) and you'll pick up scarelings. When you do get a scareling, and you will get a few by accident, take it and whatever else you got to the area you cleared past NW, atols the scareling, and gate out of zone (if you ever have too much, or an innapropriate glare lord add when you start clearing the phobo area, do the same thing, btw), wait a minute, and gate back. The mobs will wander back, but the snared scareling won't budge an inch until the snare fades. Dispatch him, and go back to whatever you were doing. You can start quadding at this point if you feel confident, triple if that's all you can safely pull, it still blows away the efficiency of singling, but if you get too complex you often end up wasting time, keep it simple. The scarelings run at jboot speed, proc a shadowstep effect on you, backstab, and have a massive aggro radius. They also path in a unique manner, much like the robes in ME. If you &quot;lose aggro&quot; on a mob and it wanders off, the mobs it comes into proximity with will not chase after you, but if it comes in contact with a scareling it'll run across the zone to find you, much like robes will do this when you park one of the trap adds in ME (which won't chase if root breaks once you are a certain range away or more) and the rest of the mobs will pass it by. If you see a scareling sitting buddy buddy with another mob, you can single pull it by walking into its aggro radius, you'll be too far from the other mob. <br>
<br>
Work your way through this section of mobs up to the tents and over to the terror house, there'll be a nice barren stretch of land between where the dense section of mobs was and the house. Now this particular house has 4 fiends (nothing special) in it. It's a pre-canned quad kite, dispatch it. If you didn't aggro and clear most of the scarelings from that section at this time, you will pulling the house, so keep an eye out. After you've done this move up to the section of wall where you break WW, you'll have to clear out a warder. You're now sitting on your abscond point, switch abscond with your out of zone gate, it's faster to cast, saves zone time, and a longer run back. Make sure you have your options set to build a cache of the zone data, it's not a huge zone, you'll fly through the reload time. Quad through the shiverbacks, fiends, and ammies (medium MR on the warriors, high on the knights (these were a bitch back in the day, you had to snare them, run in with a tash stick, run out and refresh epic, and repeat until tash landed, and then move in and cram ice spears and draughts between markar's, while holding the gap over with tishan's), knights also have a very weak pet and cast very weak shadowknight spells, though their DoT can add up). An odd note about the fiends: the ones with the &quot;male&quot; graphic, either because of a pathing bug, or some twist of coding, &quot;lose aggro&quot; and stop following you if you get too distanced, the distance for this is just over your normal spell range. Of course, when they do this they taddle on every mob they see, and they taddle in turn, which can cause adds, and they'll reaggro if you get back in the range. The &quot;female&quot; ones, however, path normally, /shrug.<br>
<br>
Clear about as far to your left as where there'd be a straight line if you drew from the top of Fright's hill to the outwards edge of the ZI hill and up till a large distance to before the gold tower, in addition to the ammys, shivers, and fiends, you're going to get into roaming Turmoil Toads ( jboot speed, cast fear), a house with boogymen in it, and if I do remember, you start dipping into Samariahs and Worry Wraiths (tash, charm, sow speed, high MR, pet, other misc ench spells, including rare dispells) at this point. I don't recall what speed the Samariahs run at, they're faster than Fiends, they're the same speed as Ammies, and Shiverbacks, which are normal speed, so I suppose the fiends are particularily slow, anyhow... when you're mixing quads in this area you'll notice that the mobs are going to have different run speeds, there are two things you can do to compensate for this: number 1 is to use bonds of force on the slower ones and atols on the faster ones, but this can be difficult to do, and is a wasteful annoyance, number 2 is nailing all 4 (or however many you're towing) with atols, letting the faster ones get a few feet ahead, running straight past the mobs until you're a safe, but not overly large distance away, and pillaring, run past them in another straight line, when pillar repops, cast it, once you find the center of balance doing this it's simple, and you'll always hit all the mobs. If your kite involves toads or another casting mob, you're going to have to screw around a bit more, but if you're reasonably competent you'll be able to tinker out something that works for you. The wraiths, as I said, are very high MR, and run at SoW, their spells tend to bounce (the odd time, they will land something because of tash, but no big deal, when you're charmed nothing will attack you, including the wraith you'll lose aggro on any other mobs that are outside aggro radius when the charm breaks, however). Toss on a range 3 item and open with Atols before they aggro (you'll nail the pet this way, odds are you're going to be trying several times to land it on the actual wraith) and keep running ahead (if I haven't mentioned by this point that you want levitate and sow up the entire time you're clearing the plane, for the puprose of outrunning adding scarelings, gorgons, wraiths etc, I just did), you'll have no trouble keeping your lead with levitate and the wraith sporadically casting (if you hear, and don't look, because the spell graphic looks the same as charm, it start to cast dispell, run the hell out of spell range if possible), once atols lands, blast it. The pet will eventually find you, deal with it as you wish, or just pop an abscond, either will have the same result.<br>
<br>
Once you've cleared the dense are before the gold tower get along the zone wall send an eye over the small hill and inside and target one of the two scarelings, bind sight on it and run yourself towards the tower and when you see the scarelings take off click off bind sight and head in the other direction. There are two in the tower, but I got 3 on the pull, results on how many you'll get probably won't be consistent. With this done start clearing the area up to the zone wall, and keep to the right of dread's hill, the gorgons shrine, and the FF house. This area's another area, much like the one by NW, that looks empty at times, and occasionally floods with roamers. You'll be dealing with wraiths, boogymen, gorgons (jboot speed, cast a PB AE long ass stun, in the same fasion as nightmares, warders, etc cast their PB AE), turmoil toads, and frightenfingers (cast conflarigation, ice comet, entombment, atols, force strike). You've also cleared all the scarelings in the plane by this point (unless you went through an area not bumping into a scareling that paths through it). This particular section isn't horribly quad friendly because of the mixture of mobs in it, use your discression. When you fighten fingers, instead of bothering with the hassle and mana loss of stunning (when the RNG lets them, they can chew into you), put on the range 3 item, snare them, and run out of spell range, tap on whatever reasonably fast casting nukes you're using until it begins casting, wait for it to go off, and run away from the finger, repeat this. You'll seldom, if ever, have to deal with conflag or ice comet doing this.<br>
<br>
With that clear run back towards the ZI somewhat and start clearing the graveyard area, be wary not to pull the tentacle tormentors (and if you do, run ahead, keeping out of spell range, abscond, and re-pull). This is section's male and female fiends, ammys, wraiths, deal with them. When that's done go to the gorgon shrine, there will be 2 facing the wall and 1 on the backside. For whatever reason, if you pull the front ones, the back one will not aggro. I tripled this set. When you're done with this, clear the ammy knights on Fright and Dread's hills, I quadded them, but I don't recomend it, it was a major, major, pain in the ass. Abscond split them, kill them, and move on to the frightenfinger house. There'll be one glare lord inside, target him with an eye, equip a range 3 item, pull him and stay ahead (he'll far outrun the fingers), by the time you get reasonably close to ZI, snare him and immediatly pop abscond, deal with him. Go back, pull the house again by snaring one of the fingers, then snare another immediatly, then run the unsnared one towards ZI and repeat the same as you did with the glare lord, whittle the house down this way. With the house down, clear whatever's left up in the plane, minus the glare lord and tent structures (you'll have to go back for Terror's knights).<br>
<br>
Split the tents like you did the finger house. The tents cast an AE dispell, an 8 point DD with a large knockback component (have it so the way the tent is facing is not some place you don't want to end up), and a small lifetap. Treat the glare lords the same way, but pull your focus together and do it right, because if one gets a dispell off and hits your SoW, you're going to have a fun trip jumping off the tops of hills all accross the plane trying to get a big enough lead to get atols off with some leeway and (or) abscond. The lords and tents have a tendancy to warp to you and wreak havoc the way the structures they're embedded in are set up, make sure there's a clear path between you and any mobs you're going to aggro, so that they hoof it, rather than take the VI-can't-figure-out-how-to-code-mobs-to-run-around-walls express.<br>
<br>
So now you're looking at a clear plane, minus the temple. When you're doing the temple, pick off the glare lords first... and figure the rest out yourself. Pulling it intimidates so many people, but it's so god damned easy, if you actually go out and get to this point, and can't figure out how to pull the temple yourself, you leaned way to hard on this spoiler to get to where you are.<br>
<br>
That's that.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous odds and ends:<br>
<br>
My gear (www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...m=111704), switching in BD bracers, and a diamond ring when it was appropriate) is above and beyond passable, but it's not stellar compared to what it could be, or what alot of people have, the AA's (you'll notice that they're not as productively spent as they could be... I had a thing about getting Sage) contributed more than it, minus perhaps the aspect of FT8. To go and do it the only big helps will be any flowing thought you can scrum together, a velk/rend robe, or THO stick, a creator dagger would help immensely, your epic, a and a flux staff. Your resists should all ride above (and your MR well above) 100 self buffed.<br>
<br>
Nexus gate will keep your death count to 0... though I never died as is. If you don't have nexus gate, you're somewhat likely to end up with a CT wand at some point, and if need be, you can pop it to bail yourself out of something you can't handle. Of course, if you're getting CT wands, you've done the break in, and other than the break in....<br>
<br>
It's easy. Use C3 if you want, the plane take a good while longer than 12 hours to repop now, you're going to clear it either way, and it's your sanity, not mine.<br>

We work very well together and handle 10-12 mob kites all the time.  With me, 57 wizzy, taking out casters first and foremost (yes, I keep a stack of peridots and skin buffed memed when we have casters nearby), then the druid and I will follow the same path and cast our AE side by side.  Some peeps think we are nuts (probably right), but we kill more together and use less mana on those ridiculous kites with our style of lunacy.  I'm just curious if we could do it in PoF.  Like some feedback before we go do our general thing and jump in both feet first.<br>

Took 4 level 65's and a few lower levels to get us to the west wall to recover corpses. I then suggested we bind and the north wall any my pard said no way he is ever coming into that zone again. LoL.<br>

If you read these guids it sounds possible but forget it you have to do everything very very perfect one slip up and you is dead and your body is almost impossible to recover without substaintial help. <br>
