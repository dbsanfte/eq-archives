Even in this place, his wounds still plagued him.  The bright specks of eyes he had seen so many times before glimpsed into view startlingly near to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blahg, my son.  At last you return.  Why have you forsaken me so?&quot;  The dark form of Brell stood before Blahg.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry, my father.  My mind has been clouded, and I have evaded you out of a fear that I could not aptly carry out your will.  I am sorry I have failed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy, my son.  If you were weak, I would not have chosen you to be the first of my reborn Kuhn'Tcha Moreia.  You must return, to take up your swords against all that is evil.  There is a dark force building, if it not stopped soon, all will be lost, and Tunare's realm shall be the first to fall under its dark influence!  If she falls, I fear we will not be able to stand before the minions of evil.  A great war is coming, and you must proudly carry the standard of the UnderMountain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But...  I am not well, my lord.  My wounds from battles long past still have not healed, and I fear they are tainted.  I have become weak, and my mind tells me that I cannot go on any longer.  I am weary, and I wish only to be with my friends and family before I die.&quot;  Saying this, pain wracks his body, and Blahg falls to his knees, trembling.  If only the Elven Elite were here now, they could help him, if they'd have him back.  Alas, none other than the Moreia could enter this sacred place.  If Blahg died here, what would happen to his soul?  Would it ever find its way to the great Dwarven City of Light?<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not die here, Blahg, nor anywhere I hold power to prevent it.  Rise to your feet, my child.&quot;  Brell knelt next to his fallen champion, touching him gently upon the face.  His rough skin caught in Blahg's beard, and he let some of his essence flow into the battered warrior.  &quot;I have removed Innoruk's curse from your blood, Moreia.  Stand, and go forth to help in this almighty battle.  We must prevail.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Blahg awoke, vaguely aware of the tree branches around him.  He had came here to lie down and pass into the next world, only to forget that if he let his guard down, Brell would surely find him.  With the taint gone, Blahg's mind quickly cleared.  What had he been thinking?  He had given away his best shield to a young warrior, and a mace to a promising healer.  He had come here with the intention of forsaking all that he stood for.  Surely this must have been Innoruk's doing.<br>
<br>
As Blahg walked back in the direction of Kelethin, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.  The voices were gone!  No longer did he hear whispers of looming defeat.  Oh, but would Innoruk and his minions pay for this trickery.  No one made a fool of the Moreia and lived very long.  The Lana'Ch'Graokh roared to life, and his wounds closed slightly.  A few days and he would be ready to once again join the Elven Elite in battle.  How could he have ever abandoned them?  The remembrance of his dear friends forced him to a rather loud sprint.  As he rounded the corner, he tripped and went shoulder first into Debba and Lenian, knocking them both to the ground.  The sight of their faces confirmed his decision to return as correct.<br>
<br>
Later, after many drinks in the guildhall, he fell asleep against a lumbering ogre...  er.  Elf..  to dream again of the horrible future that is his charge to prevent.<br>
