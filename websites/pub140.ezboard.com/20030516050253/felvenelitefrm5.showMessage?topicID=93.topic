<br>
The heavy logs in the fireplace blazed. Candra seemed to enjoy the warmth that suffused the room and the flattering glow cast throughout it. The warmth of the fire was welcome, yet the doors leading the balcony stood open, allowing the breeze off the harbor to play with the floor length drapes. <br>
<br>
“So, you’ve spoken with Seyah?” asked Galant. He brushed a speck of lint from the crystal-covered shroud that dressed him and smoothed his hands over the glittering blue fabric.<br>
<br>
Candra watched him fussing with the collar. “That robe is hardly worth worrying about, Galant.” She stood and walked over to the open balcony doors. “Just because you think it’s expensive doesn’t mean you should wear it. But then again, some people’s taste is all in their mouths.”<br>
<br>
Galant sat speechless in the face of her rebuke. Usually she treated him quite graciously, even affectionately, but at times Candra seemed to forget that he was her husband’s closest advisor and treated him as merely another underling. The high elf cleric of Tunare decided to ignore her comment.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure she’ll be pleased to hear of my want to join the Elven Elite,” he said.<br>
<br>
Candra turned her back on him and gazed over the harbor. The wind played through her long, raven hair.“You think so..?”<br>
<br>
Galant stuttered, but could think of nothing to say. His color rose in consternation. This woman confounded him. Just when he thought their friendship was solidifying nicely, she turned cold and condescending. And if Galant was going to stray from his rewarding loyalty to Galain, he had to be sure of his new ally. Otherwise – unless he was sure of Candra and the rewards of pursuing her cause – the risks were not worth his while. He had been witness to a rare display of Galain’s temper. He remembered too clearly the terrible force of nature the magician could be, wielding fire and ice, and commanding creatures of devastating abilities. The very thought of having the attention of that pet made Galant blanch. He suppressed the images in his mind and concentrated instead on Candra. In the breeze of the open doors, her white gossamer gown seemed to be one with the long, flowing curtains. Galant could imagine that she stood naked among the billowing draperies, the sea air caressing her exotic body – he did imagine it, in fact, much to his annoyance.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t answer my question,” he said crossly.<br>
<br>
If Candra heard him she gave no indication and continued merely to gaze over the harbor. Galant resolved to wait her out. He refused to nip at her heels like some yapping dog. If she didn’t value his contributions, then he would leave her to her own devices soon enough, and the loss would be hers.<br>
<br>
As he waited, Galant noticed a strange charm on a chain lying on a round table beside his seat. He remembered having seen Candra wear it before at High Castle, before she and her entourage had left the Champions of the Light. He could picture how it had laid on her chest....he shook away that image as well. Galant turned and leaned towards the necklace. It’s large enough to have something inside, he thought, inspecting the sparkling piece of jewelry from a short distance.  Candra might have forgotten his presence, as little notice as she paid him. Slowly, Galant reached toward its mithril chain.<br>
<br>
“I saw Seyah this very evening,” Candra said.<br>
<br>
Galant jerked his hand back so quickly that he cracked his elbow on the arm of the chair in which he was sitting. Tingling pain shot up his arm, but he managed to steady a candle which had begun tottering dangerously.<br>
<br>
“Seyah seems very...” She turned away from the open doors, but still didn’t look at Galant. Her chin was raised as she stared at some intermediate midpoint and studied the issue. “Burdened. Yes, burdened.”<br>
<br>
Now her gaze locked onto the High Elf’s. “Can you imagine the weight she carries on those noble shoulders, Galant?”<br>
<br>
Galant lost himself in those compassionate, violet eyes. He couldn’t quite follow her train of thought, but didn’t want to admit to such. “I...yes, I....suppose so.”<br>
<br>
“Something moves through the shadows and threatens the very guild she is sworn to protect. Whatever mystery has overtaken the Phantasmist Sparke’s sanity, the one rumored to have done much the same to Aryllyian’s mind, has given the lady many worries.”<br>
<br>
“I’m not familiar with the intrigues of the Elven Elite, though I’ve heard murmurs of its problem’s through various contacts in the Gathering.”<br>
<br>
Galant hoped his hint was subtle, but at the same time he wanted to make his point known. Like Candra, he was a former Champion of the Light. Unlike her though, he was currently without a guild to support his ambitions. The cleric lived vicariously through his master, the enchantress’ husband, Galain Sila’Rim though few knew his true surname. To them he was Galain Whitegloves, a name that hinted to the hands clean style of battle of his youth. As Galain’s attaché, Galant served with unwavering faith and loyalty, trusted to handle the most intimate details of the magician’s life, from business and finances to the secrets behind various intrigues. Until now, that is. Candra’s scheming lured him away from that path, enticing him to join her in the shadows. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 2/17/03 7:40:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/4/03 9:46:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eden444/images/candra_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dangerous Liaisons</span><hr size=1> The enchantress tempted Galant with something that Galain had already refused him – the opportunity to join forces with the Elven Elite. The cleric’s lord had deemed him not ready to submit himself before the guild’s officers. Galain required the cleric gain more than a few blessings before he would sponsor his application. Eager to make his way towards greater adventures and far too impatient to be put off, Galant was at a loss about his course.<br>
<br>
Candra made it easy for the cleric. She approached him with an offer to make his want a reality, but like most devils – and Galant was certain he was before one, in this case a succubus – her assistance was not without cost. In return for her “kindness”, Galant agreed to spy on her husband’s activities away from home. Guilt and regret immediately set his heart, but were not an adequate team to displace his ambitions.<br>
<br>
“The problems of the Elven Elite now bleed into the halls of the Gathering,” Candra explained with barely suppressed emotion. She closed the balcony doors. “Can you imagine her embarrassment, Galant? Her guild’s dirty laundry put out for public display.” Again her eyes held him.<br>
<br>
Galant wetted his lips. “Yes, I...yes.”<br>
<br>
“Then you can understand my delay,”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I suppose I can,” Galant emerged from his confusion as the conversation returned to familiar ground.<br>
<br>
Candra slowly crossed to the fireplace to stand in front of its glow, bask in its heat. “I’ve promised that you will be among the Elite soon enough. Be patient, my friend. Have faith in my ability to make good on my word.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not a matter of faith, my dear Candra.” Galant rolled his eyes. “It’s a question ‘when’?”<br>
<br>
“In good time,” she replied quickly. There was a warning in her soft voice. Candra took a seat on the end of the couch closest to Galant. She placed a finger on his knee. “Once matters within the hall are tamed you’ll have exactly what you desire and more..”<br>
<br>
Galant tried to keep up with her, but there were her eyes so close, and her finger tracing circles on his knee. He suddenly remembered another reason for his visit tonight and consciously sharpened his focus, “There’s also the matter of your bill here at the inn, Candra. I’ve receipts from everyone from the tailor to the jeweler. And you’ve gone through a case of champagne!”<br>
<br>
Candra cringed and smiled sheepishly. Galant thought he might have seen a hint of blush in her cheeks. She squeezed his leg and rose from her seat. “They do call it room service...”<br>
<br>
Galant sighed. “Please try to control your impulses, Candra. Your husband’s funds are not limitless. Platinum is not something he can summon from thin air.”<br>
<br>
“Now, we can’t have that, can we? I’ll control my impulses, Galant,” She said, running her fingers through his hair, “if you control yours.”<br>
<br>
Galant’s mouth went dry. Candra walked past him and began to put out the few candles that gave light to the room. When she was finished she opened up the double doors to the bedroom. Galant’s round eyes followed her every movement.<br>
<br>
“Why does my husband not come to visit, Galant? I’ve barely seen him this past week. Is he growing tired of me?” Candra leaned her back against the doorway.<br>
<br>
Galant’s eyes quickly adjusted to the increasing darkness. He followed fingers of moonlight that moved through the white draperies to shine over Candra. Her beauty was always such a breath-taking event. His tongue felt like a thick brick. “I...certainly not...., uh, Galain, that is...he’s been incredibly busy with his exploration of the Planes.”<br>
<br>
“I see,” Candra said wistfully. “I’m just not that high among his priorities.”<br>
<br>
Galant was unable to turn away as she sauntered away from the moonlight and into the darkness of the adjacent room. With barely any motion at all she slipped out of her gown and, naked, beneath the sheets.<br>
<br>
“I miss him so,” she sighed. “And Galant, do let yourself out.”<br>
<br>
As if in a stupor, Galant rose and went to the door – the other door, the exit. Not until it was closed behind him did he manage to swallow the lump in his throat. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 2/4/03 1:09:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/17/03 7:35:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eden444/images/candra_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dangerous Liaisons</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The City of Men - Freeport, Antonica<br>
<br>
Lobby of the Freeport Inn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“May I get anything else for you, M’Lady?”<br>
<br>
Candra raised the glass of rich, red wine and wet her lips, then deigned to acknowledge the smiling young man. “Not at the moment, thank you.”<br>
<br>
He bowed and backed away, as pleased as if she’d handed him a 10-platinum tip. Candra, ensconced in the padded armchair in the common room of Freeport Inn, was holding court, of sorts, as various servants saw to her every need.<br>
<br>
“What’s the point of having servants around,” she wondered, “if they’re not performing the menial tasks that make them feel so useful?” It was a situation that left everyone rewarded, not the least of all Candra. She was in her element with others fawning over her, and it was a pleasant and innocent enough diversion from how she’d been spending most of her time the past few days – gathering information and none of it too awfully helpful.<br>
<br>
A soft sigh breezed past her lips as she tracked the various intrigues playing out for her pleasure. She considered the Warlock PuppetM and his discovery in the Plane of Nightmare. An unknowing thrall was witness to his good fortune and through her eyes Candra watched and mused over a method to make that fortune her own. Then, naturally, her thoughts drifted to another name considered noble among the denizen’s of Neriak – Vhaerun. She pondered the house’s resurgence and how lending it an assist could benefit her own agenda. Then, there was the matter of her husband’s own explorations into the unknown.<br>
<br>
Candra raised a hand to her neck, slid her fingers along the chain to the charm that was never far from her. Galain seemed to take such pleasure in seeing her wear the piece. Candra, in her own way took comfort from the soft metal resting near her heart. Despite Galain’s obvious affection for her, however, the magician remained wary. Candra didn’t expect him to turn over all his fortune over to her – not that she would quibble if he did – but she did want more of his time. If that attention did not materialize, and soon, she might be forced to take stern measures. She wondered if he actually considered himself strong enough to resist her charms...perhaps he was. For now.<br>
<br>
Galant, on the other hand, was a clay pigeon Candra could pluck from the air whenever she pleased. She left him enough free will that he could imagine he was independent, and watched in amusement his noble struggle between his loyalty to his Lord of the Deeps and the Lady of Mysteries. Candra knew there was less of conscience and more of weather vane to Galant’s dilemma. Whichever way the wind blew, there would be Galant.<br>
<br>
He was the reason why she had ventured down to the lobby of the Freeport Inn in the first place. The cleric had sent word via messenger that he had news to report to her. He insisted on meeting her face to face and Candra consented to that arrangement after briefly considering the matter. She glanced across the room and was completely unsurprised to see Galant walking through the lobby doors precisely at the scheduled time.<br>
<br>
Candra rose to greet her visitor and completely ignored the employees of the inn who scurried away in every direction, each fearful that she or he had somehow offended the elegant guest and was personally responsible for her departure.<br>
<br>
“Galant,” said Candra, taking a friendly, familiar tone.<br>
<br>
The cleric’s expression remained unchanged, neutral. “M’Lady.” He wore the same crystal-blue robe she did not like at their last meeting. It was typical dress for a cleric of his Blessing, and bad taste was hardly a sin.<br>
<br>
Candra, stunning in a green velvet gown, took her guest by the arm and led him to the stairs. “I took it upon myself to wait for you personally – how very gauche, I know – but none of my servants made the trip with me, and I’ve had no time to interview any of the locals.” She kept up the patter, quite innocuous talk to any within earshot. Galant did not contribute to the conversation or attempt to address Candra’s rhetorical questions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bubbling over with personality, this one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Candra thought wryly, but wasn’t that the case with most High Elves? As she turned the key to the door she was tempted to tease him with the idea of seduction just to see some type of reaction from the elf, but decided against it. There was little sense in jeopardizing future gains for such petty gratification at this point.<br>
<br>
Once inside the comforts of the luxurious suite her husband’s funds provided her, Candra turned on Galant with a generous smile. “So, tell me of this news, Galant.”<br>
