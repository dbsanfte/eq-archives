Micron just released their quarterly report and posted a 6% loss because of: &quot;a glut in the chip market&quot;.  Whether or not their lying out their butts to cover bad management, the RAM market seems to be more affordable than it was last time I checked.  So, if you've ever dreamed about playing with all models on, full clip plane, socials, etc., and your MoBo supports more RAM, now might be a good time to get a stick or three.<br>
<br>
Checking on DDR DIMM's, I noticed that while the 1 gig sticks were still not under $200 each, the 512MBs and below were falling.  I picked up 2 512s for a grand total of $130, which is only slightly more than I paid for one stick the last time I upgraded my RAM.<br>
<br>
If you're watching your wallet, check the prices for the next two weeks, they should start to work their way down.  Once you notice them rise slightly again, make your move.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, if you get nothing else out of this, at least you'll finally be blessed with the full Luclin models view of gnomes in plate helms.  &quot;Luke, I'm a perfect 1/8th size clone of your father...&quot; /em heavy breathing<br>

<br>
Motherboards that support DDR memory will use PC 1600(200MHz bus), PC2100(266MHz), PC2700(333MHz), or PC3200(400MHz).  If you get memory that is above what your motherboard supports, your system will GENERALLY be able to run it at the lower speed without any problem.  This means that if you buy PC3200 now, you will be able to take that same memory and use it in your next computer(saving you the expense if you do the upgrade yourself).  There is also very little difference in pricing between the different grades of memory, so why not go for the higher end?<br>
<br>
To give you an idea about what we will be seeing in memory going forward, this may give you some idea.<br>
<br>
All AMD Athlon XP systems will run at LEAST with a 266MHz bus(133*2).  And for a while now, AMD has been selling a 333MHz(Barton) version of the Athlon XP(which is 166*2 if you do the math).  The lastest officially run with a 400MHz bus(200*2).  Looking forward, the Athlon 64s look like they will be set to support 333MHz memory, although that may change since the Athlon 64 isn't due out until the end of August or September.  If you go with the higher end memory, you will make life easier on yourself since the difference is only $5 to $10 US dollars in price for a 512 meg stick of memory.<br>
<br>
Now, if you think, &quot;My 512 megs is enough&quot;, think again.  I look at the memory usage of the various programs I run, and I see EQ taking 524 megs of memory just for itself(I have 1 gig of memory in my system).  With 1 gig of memory, you can run EQ, Windows XP(Or Windows 2003 for that matter), a few web browser windows, and various other programs in the background and STILL have no problem swapping.  Also, if you go to 1 gig of memory, you will find you load times, and zone times will generally improve a LOT if you are on cable or DSL.  <br>
<br>
Current prices from Pricewatch:<br>
512 megs PC2100 memory: $50<br>
512 megs PC2700 memory: $55<br>
512 megs PC3200 memory: $66<br>
<br>
In MOST systems, you can also run things a bit faster, so even if your CPU is sold as a 266MHz version, you can often run it at 333MHz without a problem as long as your motherboard, CPU and memory support it.  The more recent Athlon XP 1700+ are known to run without a problem at over a 400 MHz bus speed(200*2).<br>
<br>
If this has inspired you to upgrade your system now, from a LOT of experience, the Asus A7N8X Deluxe motherboard(version 2.0) with a RECENT Athlon XP1700+ can be run with a 400MHz bus(200*2).  If you go with this combination, the top line should start with an AXDA <br>
the bottom line of the chip markings should start with: JIUHB 0306<br>
Anything higher(such as 0307, 0308, etc...) are also good since they are later models.  My own is a 0310.<br>
<br>
I accept no responsibility if you decide to overclock above the specs, but there are thousands of people who have been overclocking their Athlon XPs.  Just be aware that if you run with a higher bus speed, you will probably want to lower the multiplier.  Here are some samples of how this works:<br>
<br>
133*10=1330<br>
133*11=1463(Default setting for the 1700+)<br>
133*12=1596<br>
133*12.5=1662<br>
Note that a 1.46GHz Athlon runs at around the speed of a P4 1.7GHz, so don't let this bother you.<br>
<br>
Now, bump the bus to 166MHz(333MHz effective speed)<br>
<br>
166*10=1660<br>
166*11=1826<br>
166*12=1992<br>
166*12.5=2075<br>
<br>
Now to bump the bus to 200MHz(400MHz effective speed)<br>
<br>
200*10=2000<br>
200*11=2200<br>
200*12=2400<br>
200*12.5=2500<br>
<br>
At 166*12.5(I have the older version of the A7N8X in my box, so can't run at above a 166MHz bus), my CPU is running a consistant 54 degrees C, with 85 degrees being the max the processor is rated at, so this is no problem.  This is with the fan that came with the boxed version of the Athlon XP 1700+.  With a better fan, or more cooling, I can easily get this down under 50 degrees.  With GOOD cooling, a number of people have gotten the same CPU to run at 2.4GHz.  With the newer version of the motherboard, I would PREFER to run it at a 200*10.5 setting since the higher bus speed would improve overall system performance.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I went a bit off the original topic, but I hope this may help someone out there.<br>

<br>
But remember, RDRAM requires that you buy the sticks in pairs, so you will have to buy 2 * 512 ($190). I do see on pricewatch that 256's are going for $47, so figure $188 to do a complete swap of memory on a four slot board to put one Gig in there.<br>
<br>
You can mix and match the pairs though, you can buy (2) 128's and (2) 256's etc.<br>

Going to DDR=$130 for memory, $130 for the motherboard, and you get 1 gig of memory and a motherboard that can accept more DDR memory upgrades in the future.  If you really wanted, after spending THAT much, you may as well just go to an Asus A7N8X deluxe motherboard(Nvidia chipset, not crappy VIA), and get an AMD CPU you can overclock to 2.1GHz for only $60 and you've just gotten a whole new machine.<br>
<br>
That's the sort of thing that makes so many people just get a new computer.  Motherboard+CPU+memory=$300 for 1 gig of memory, and if you know how to overclock, you can make that $300 worth of parts be as fast as a $600 investment.<br>

Ya price is dirt cheap and even 1.5 Gig is dirt cheap at today prices. <br>

I doubt you have to run out and buy today though, even assuming there is a glut who is going to cut production and why, and who is going to increase demand and why? Seems any glut going to continue for the near future.<br>

<br>
1) Make sure your motherboard can report CPU temperatures.  Asus motherboards all come with temperature sensors.<br>
<br>
2) Unless you really know what you are doing, avoid CPU modifications.<br>
<br>
3) Unless you know what you are doing, do NOT increase the voltage to the CPU.  One common overclocking trick is to up the voltage slightly once you've hit the limit to what your CPU can do without upping the voltage.<br>
<br>
4) Unless you know what you are doing, make sure you overclock slowly.  If your CPU is certified to run at 1.46GHz(Athlon XP 1700+), then go upwards from there, test it slowly, 1.5GHz, 1.6GHz, etc.<br>
<br>
5) Compare the CPU markings to those posted by others in places like the www.amdzone.com forums.  If others have a CPU that came out at roughly the same time as you, chances are you can run at similar speeds, but keep in mind rules 1 through 4.<br>
<br>
6) Common sense applies.  If you take a CPU that's rated for 133*11, you shouldn't expect to be able to run at 200*11 without SERIOUS cooling.<br>
<br>
7) If you really really want to push the limits of what your system can do, be ready to replace the CPU and possibly the motherboard.  Extreme overclocking, where you boost the voltage, and use things like water, ice water, or liquid nitrogen CAN break, and when it happens, things can get messy.  Needless to say, overclocking in ANY way voids your warranty.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, anyone should be able to overclock at least a little bit, running a 1.46GHz at 1.6GHz without any other modifications is pretty safe.  Always test a system at it's default settings before overclocking as well.  If your system isn't stable at the defaults for the CPU and memory you have, overclocking is a bad idea.<br>

OH OH Hey! I just remember i found a program called Tweak XP, even without knowingmuch about computrs you can really make yours fly! Seriously, it enables a lot of speed options that are turned off by defult in windows XP, and you don't have to bea tech junkie to work it.<br>

One last thing to throw at you all. If any of you noticed windows really slowing down, pop ups that come fro no where, and just sluggish performance, their is a heavy good chance that you have some spy ware installed, Spy bot will get rid of that for you, it works great and can innoculize you against future installs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ()<br>

Whether or not their lying out their butts to cover bad management, the RAM market seems to be more affordable than it was last time I checked.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not to side track much from the thread but I live in Boise Idaho were Micron is headquartered and I worked there tell I got layed off during the big lay off that happened last january.  They are not lying and they have awsome management and the analysts out there thought microns losses this last quarter were going to be MUCH larger then they were.  So Micron pulled off a much better quarter despite the 6% loss then everyone else thought.<br>
<br>
Part of the reason there is such a glut in the market is Hynex.  Hynex in Korea has been the bain of the ram market for years.  They are constantly losing money and can't even aford to upgrade there equipment and are well over a few billion in debt.  But because Hynex is such a large employer and dosn't want a lot of there people being job less they keep feeding government subsidies to hynex to keep it alive even though it will never make money.  That and all the banks over there that have cash in Hynex keep giving it loan extensions because thay have so much money invested in it that they don't want it to go under no matter what.  That company is a money pit.  Hynex in a sad attempt to make money keeps flooding computer chips into the market thus hurting the market and causing economic trouble over all.  Though I guess you could say its good for those wanting to buy memory.<br>
<br>
Normaly this crap dosn't happen because if a company does bad and can't hack it, it sells its stuff to the better companys and the dead die off and the strong survive and the market grows for the better.  But sence Hynex is being kept alive its like a cancer that festurs instead of being amputated so good stuff can take its place.<br>
<br>
Micron has gone to the government a few times about this crap and so far things are looking good.  Currently there is something in the works to put a LARGE terrif on all of Hynexes products and Micron will supposedly get the money off the terrifs as pay back for all the crap Hynex and the Korean government is doing.  This is stuff I've just gotten from the news so im not disclosing any thing Micron ever told me while i was working there.<br>
<br>
Heck our governemt gives money to the Korean government quite regularly to help there people over there I guess as some sort of agrement because we have so many bases over there and basicaly keep north korea from crossing into south korea.  At any rate the US goverment gives Korea a lot of cash and the Korea Government uses it to help their economy and thus uses that cash to keep the dying company hynex afloat so that those people wont be out of work.  And as long as that company stays afloat and dosn't die, it hurts all the american workers in the same buisness over here.  Thus our own government is hurting us and our economy.  Kind of funny that the US government in a round about way is helping to keep korean employees with jobs yet companys over here in the same market are hafting to lay people off.<br>
<br>
Normaly when a buisness does bad it dies and the economy survives, not with Hynex. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerlatikflaimweaver>Zerlatik Flaimweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 12:20 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sam is a fruit.</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the head's up, Artillus.  I was kinda holding off my optimism until I had some kind of confirmation.  I live in Salt Lake City, and it doesn't look like Micron is going to open their Lehi plant no matter how much the State of Utah offers to subsidize, so it looks like this glut thing is a pretty solid lead.  <br>
<br>
Question for Targonis, though.  I have an ASUS MoBo, and from what I've read in the manual, I'm only supported for: &quot;up to 3GB system memory using 184-pin unbuffered non-ECC PC2700/2100/160 DIMMs.&quot;  Now, the two extra 512s at PC2700 I ordered are already in the mail, so it's probably too late to change my mind right now, but if the prices on 1 gig sticks do fall more by around the beginning of next year, should I upgrade to full capacity using 1gig sticks at PC3200?  Because, from what I got out of your post, my MoBo should support it, just at a lower voltage, and I can then canibalize the parts when it comes time to upgrade the MoBo.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, I agree with what Targonis has said about the Asus boards.  I have one now, and from what I understand, every single one ships with the Probe program, that tells you straight up how hot every component is running on the board.  I haven't figured out the fan controls yet, but I shouldn't have too much trouble figuring out how to optimize based on the temperatures.  <br>
<br>
Despite what Sam said, I probably would go with upgrading now.  The economy may not get markedly better, but it's always surprised me before by dropping to levels I didn't think were possible.  I guess the reverse could always happen, too.  Besides, if you do buy too early, and chip prices keep falling, you can always upgrade the whole shebang later on at a cheap price too. <p><center><b><u>The Man's Prayer</u></b><BR>

Also this isn't the first time the Korean chip makers have flooded the market with chips.  I'm guessing they think that even though there lossing money by the truckloads that if they can manage to drop enuff people out of the market and drive them out of buisness they will be the only ones left and thus corrner the market and manage to make money then thus being able to get out of debt.  Heck thats about the only way they will ever get out of debt and maybe not even then.<br>
<br>
And sence Hynex has an almost limitless cash flow from their governemnt and such (cough i mean the US government) they can keep the market going to hell for quite some time.<br>
<br>
Hynex is the third largest producer of memory world wide.  Micron is the second largest and samsung also in Korea is the largest.  Samsung dosn't have many problems because they don't specialize in just memory like micron and hynex, they have many other operations that they make more money off of while the market is doing bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=targonis>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 792<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 11:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sam is a fruit.</span><hr size=1> On the Rambus vs DDR issue, there is a trade-off in the use of the Rambus.  Sure you get better sustained memory speeds, BUT, it has a much larger delay on the initial memory access.  Also, most of the Rambus vs. DDR issues were back in the day of PC1600(100*2).  With DDR speeds up at the 200*2 and beyond level now, even the sustained memory I/O speed benefits that Rambus used to have are all but gone.  Because of the price vs performance, as well as a LOT of legal battles, Rambus has lost the favor of Intel a while ago.<br>

I honestly don't see much of a need for more system memory beyond one gig at this point, and by the time you need to move beyond that point, we will probably be looking at going to a 64 bit processor like the Athlon 64 anyway.  Or you can just go with three sticks of memory for 1.5 gigs, which will cover you, even if EQ 2, Horizons, or whatever you plan to run sucks up more than we have.<br>
<br>
One nice thing in Windows XP is that the task manager will let you see not just which programs you are running, but also how much memory each one takes up.<br>
<br>
When you run out of physical memory, that's when it becomes an issue with more helping your performance.  If you zone, and even after you are in the world, the game seems like it's &quot;stuck&quot; for a few seconds, and you can hear(if you listen) your hard drive churning like it's loading something, that means that your computer is using your hard drive for additional memory because you've run out of regular memory.  Or if you do something, and out of nowhere, for no reason your hard drive begins to go crazy like you are trying to load something or save something, that's a hint you need more memory.<br>
<br>
AntionidesRZ, if you didn't run into a slowdown in zone times and general load times from going to 512 megs after being at 1 gig, are you running Windows 98 or ME?  Here's some extra info on the memory issue for &quot;how much&quot; you are using.<br>
<br>
Windows 95, 98, 98SE, and ME really are variations on the same OS, just newer versions, with more of the code running in 32 bit mode.  At heart, 95 started as a mostly 16 bit OS with a good number of routines being 32 bit.  As a result, the way these operating systems access memory will be a bit limited.  Sure, Microsoft got better, but the overall design of the OS has limited things a bit.  As a result, if you go over 512 megs of memory, you won't get the maximum benefit of your memory.  The benefit to running one of these is that the memory taken by the operating system will only be around 60 megs of memory, so if you only have 64 megs or 128 megs of memory in your system, it will run.<br>
<br>
Windows NT was Microsoft's first attempt to make a fully 32 bit OS, with none of the old 16 bit junk from the Windows 3.x days.  Sure, many things were better, but it had limitations.  Windows 2000 picked up where NT left off, bigger and better.  If you have less than 128 megs, forget about running Windows 2000, and really, you want at least 256 megs of memory to make a Win2k system run decently.  512 megs or above, unlike the Win95/98/SE/ME systems CAN be taken advantage of by the system.  Windows XP really takes the best of both worlds between the two OS types.  Good games compatability as well as being fairly solid as an OS.  256 megs SHOULD be the minimum you will want to run Windows XP with, simply because it's a bit bigger.<br>
<br>
There's also an issue that many people don't know about in their system.  In the BIOS setup, there is a setting called the AGP apature size.  If you set this to the lowest possible setting, it will turn the feature off on most systems.  Now, for what this is.  This specifies how much system memory your AGP video card can use for textures once it runs out of on-board memory.  This is why those with 8 meg AGP video cards can often play(slowly) games that say they require a 32 meg video card.  I tend to run with an apature size of 128 megs or 256 megs.  Most people DO see a benefit to using it, but in cases where there are problems with a computer system's AGP implementation, turning the AGP apature off(to min setting), will avoid problems.<br>
<br>
Now, if after reading this you look and find your AGP apature was set all the way down you decide to turn it on, there is one more setting you will want to look at.  Under memory settings, there is normally a setting called &quot;By SPD&quot; for the memory configuration.  This setting is VERY VERY bad to use if you have more than one stick of memory.  Pretty much all DDR memory modules have a configuration on the memory stick and it's called the SPD information.  If your memory sticks are even SLIGHTLY different, the SPD data will make the system access the second stick the wrong way, and crash to desktop is a common result when playing games.  Your solution is to NOT use By SPD.  Optimal is one of the settings that will generally be safe as long as you have all sticks the same general type(PC2100, PC2700, etc...).<br>
<br>
So, it's not just OS+applications(including games), it's OS+applications+AGP apature in use going over your physical memory that can cause the issues.  This is also why it sometimes MAY solve the Bazaar slowness problem by going to a 256 meg video card.  When your AGP card has to use main system memory, it's obviously going to be slower than using the memory on your video card.  <br>
<br>
And(sorry, I can't seem to shut up tonight), there's a final issue that will impact things.  There is a difference between Pentium 4 systems and AMD based systems that involves how memory is handled.  On AMD systems, the CPU(processor) to northbridge uses the DDR technology to transfer data.  On P4 systems, Intel uses what is refered to as a quad-pumped bus, where the system pushes more data per clock cycle.  As a result, the overall system bus IS a bit faster on P4 systems, but things end up balanced, AMD better in some situations, the P4 better in others.  <br>
<br>
What, you may ask, is this DDR thing people keep talking about?  DDR stands for double data rate.  The simple explanation is that, if something is running at 100MHz, it will be able to transfer TWICE as much data per clock cycle, in this case 200MHz.  133MHz becomes 266MHz worth of data, 166MHz becomes 333MHz, and 200MHz becomes 400MHz worth of data transfered.  Intel came up with the idea of pumping four times the data per cycle.  To address this difference, Nvidia was the first to allow a system to access TWO sticks of memory at the same time which Nvidia refers to as dual banking, to effectively double the data rate to the memory.  So on an Nforce-2 chipset based motherboard, it gets a lot more data going to the memory.  Other chipsets have started to come out with this, but it's still the same memory sticks.  PC2700 memory is still 166MHz DDR(meaning 333MHz), and you get an effective 666MHz worth of data throughput if you use the dual-banking feature.  So, if your motherboard supports this type of memory access, two sticks of memory will give you a bit better system performance than a single stick(so 2 sticks of 256 megs is better than 1 stick of 512 megs).<br>
<br>
Ok, really done for the moment, I'll check up on the thread again tomorrow.<br>

This is my case atm, i got 2 sticks of 256 GB DDR 2700 memory running in dual chanel mode.<br>
My question is: what will happen if i buy another 512 GB stick and put it in the middle bank? Is it a good idea, will dual chanel remain enable for the 2X 256 sticks only, or be totally disabled?<br>

<br>
I remember on my A7N8X Deluxe, I believe it's bank 3 plus either bank 1 or 2 will make the board run in dual bank mode.  At least, from what the manual had said.  If that's the case, it may ALWAYS run in dual bank mode for all three.<br>
<br>
Bangkirai, this discussion has been staying fairly well on topic until your post, so please edit it to stay on topic.  There are a LOT of people out there who have been looking for a solid discussion on these things that doesn't get TOO technical(I avoided going into HOW the data rate gets doubled in DDR for example).<br>
<br>
For those buying a motherboard, I hinted that there are a few different revisions of the A7N8X Deluxe.  The original, the 1.01, and 1.02 versions will NOT be able to hit a 200MHz(400MHz effective) bus speed.  I bought mine the moment it became available, so it's probably a 1.01, and I can't get the CPU bus to run at over 168MHz.  The 2.0 version which is what you SHOULD get will hit 210MHz or above without a problem.  I've been toying with just spending the $130 or so it costs and upgrade this one, then pass my current down to build a new machine. <p>Targonis Manastorm<br>
