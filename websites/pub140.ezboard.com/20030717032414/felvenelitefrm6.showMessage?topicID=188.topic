Many will ask why a troll would want to come to the mighty Elven Elite. Well sit back and listen to the story of my life.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a young troll and a follower of Rallos Zek other trolls always believed that the smaller races were weaker and had no business roamin the lands of Norrath. Me on the other hand always like the little elves for some reason and this all came to a head one day when me and my troll friends were wondering around the swamp outside the walls of Grobb. Some how a young wood elf had gotten lost and wondered into the swamp and just happened to run into our gang of trolls. Well my friends started pushin him around and beatin him up finally I had enough I got mad and stepped inbetween them. I told the young elf to run as fast as he could I would hold these guys off as long as I could. Well I fought as long as I could and held them off just long enough for the little elf to get out of the swamp. After they had beat me down they ran back and told everyone that I was helping some little puny wood elf and so I got exiled from Grobb. My mother and father packed me some food and clothes at least and told me to leave and never come back.<br>
<br>
This comes to the second part of my story. I had never been outside the swamp so just like the little elf I had saved from his death I was lost and wondered up on a house. I was tired and couldnt travel anymore. So I went up to the door and knocked. To my surprise the door was opened by a elven man. He was a mighty warrior and shouted for his wife to bring his swords there was a troll at the door. His little elven wife screamed as she tossed him his swords. All I could do was grab mine from my packs to defend myself. I fought with all my might but the mighty warrior was to much for me. Just as he was about to kill me a shout rang out from a small boy &quot;Father stop&quot; and to my surpise it was the boy I had saved in the swamp a few days before had found his way home. He jumped infront of his father. &quot;Father no this is the one I told you about the one who saved me when I was lost.&quot;<br>
As soon as he heard this he dropped his swords shouted for his wife to get some bandages and food and to also clear off the extra bed. He picked me picked me up took me inside his home. As soon as I was well enough they as me of my how I had wondered out into the Greater Faydark. It was then I told them of how I had become exiled after me saveing there son.<br>
It was then that they decided to take me in. During the night time while all the other elves were sleeping the mighty warrior would take me out to the forest to hone my skills and during the day in the basement he lady would teach me lots of things inculdeing the elven language. When I had gotten my skills up the mighty warrior told me of the Clan Crushbone and if I was ever to be accepted by the people of Kelethin and Felwithe I must go into the castle and kill Lord Darnish, Emerpor Crush, and the evil Ambassador DVinn. They pack me lots of food and gave me weapons and armor. It was then that I was taken to the castle entrance. He spoke with me and told where they all would be. So I traveled inside I fought and fought till I got to Lord Darish I slayed him no problem at that point I thought this is going to be simple. Next was Emperor Crush he wasnt a problem. Then last but not least was Emperor DVinn this was a battle I was almost not prepared for after along fight and lots of blood shed DVinn fell. To prove to the people of the elven cities I brought along the black heart from DVinn. It was then that I was allowed to roam into the elven cities.<br>
So that brings me to today I am here to ask acceptance to the Elven Elite as I was brought up by wood elves and I am really a elf at heart.<br>
<br>
OOC. Hope yall enjoyed the story. I have worked up my faction to Dubious to both cities and plan to keep working on it. My elvish is up to 94 now. Edited I made my 52nd season tonight.<br>
