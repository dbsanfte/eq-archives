Rather than casting a DS on the MA so that every time they get hit, damage is caused, but one that every time they hit they do more damage. This would be separate from weapon damage calculation. Just flat replace Okiels with these. Use the same times, etc.l. as the okiels line and make them stack with all DSs. 2 points a hit is actually pretty damn good -- and 6 is even better. at higher levels make group versions, and maybe a level 64ish AE version. This is definately a buff, but it's the kind that is right along the lines we intend -- damage output.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I LOVE this idea. I've recently had a heightened interest in wizard balance, specifically groupability, since the release of PoP. I have been trolling and trolling thru the endless posts on this issue and this I think is a diamond in the rough. Lets start with the rules.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The rules:<br>
1. No Buffs (I am assuming targeted Buffs and not self Buffs)<br>
2. No Pets<br>
3. No changes to our nuking ability<br>
4. No changes to our current AoE spells<br>
5. Our new ability can't allow us to raid better<br>
6. Our new ability can't allow us to solo better<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
OK OK OK so this BREAKS rule number one, but the beauty part is it BENDS rule number 2 in a clever way, by giving us a means of melee based long term DPS solution.  It reminds me of Lodoss Wars when the wizard cast magic on the warriors sword, that's pretty sweet roleplay wise I think, and its not degrading to us like a pet would be. /em shivers at the thought of having a pet.<br>
<br>
Rule number 3 is left fully intact, as well as rules number 4 and 6. I've come up with a solution to rule number 5, and consequently to the reason for rule number one, which is being bugged for buffs is annoying and not why we play wizards, it is simply this: Make it like Boon of the Gauroo, horrendous recast time, making it a melee buff reserved only for the MA or main damage dealing melee. This eliminates the chance of us becoming &quot;buffers&quot; (in the sense that we would be reserving mana for a secondary task, which would only take away our nuking power and generally piss us off) AND makes it non-overpowering in a raid situation, as we would ONLY be casting this on the MA to further maximize his agro.<br>
<br>
Now lets talk about some reoccurring issues people have with wizards as they currently are. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, here is a quandry, many people (mostly non-wizards, but also a few wizards have expeseed this opinion) do not readily see the advantages of grouping with wizards. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We need more perception of our contribution to the group and a lot of people run /serverfilter and /showspelleffects so we're invisible.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Keeping a heavy damage dealing class like a wizard balanced is hard.<br>
<br>
If they do significantly above average damage, why would they group?(1) Every individual added who does less damage per hour than the wizard lowers the groups average DPH, plus adds coordination friction.(2)<br>
<br>
Verant solved the problem for Rogues by requiring the Rogue to be behind the target -- requiring a support infrastructure of some kind for the Rogue to keep up her DPH. Either fear/hate kiting of some kind, or a tank healer combo in order to soak up the damage.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
As far as the first issue, if this buff resulted in the melee in question not only physically SEEING a buff on him. He would be sure to appreciate the wizard more when he sees the significant increase in his OWN dps, much like melee /drool over being hasted now. And as far as the second issue, every melee keeps their OWN hits on, they GET OFF on it, I know I do when I play my SK:P<br>
<br>
The last issue is the key issue tho and I like thinking about this buff from this point of view. This buff does for us, what making BS only work from the back did for rogues, gave them a highly desirable group DPS that is MUCH less effective when soloing. This buff REQUIRES not only a melee to cast it on, but a melee that can also endure the damage, or requires a healer class to keep that melee alive, like the BS change for rouges, it not only promoted the rogues groupability, but created an even greater need for the core group unit. <br>
<br>
I don't even think I need to mention how lame it would be if a wizard used this buff on himself:P<br>
<br>
So in conclusion I'd like to iron out details and polish up the edges of this already great idea that Ennya has brought to the table.  <br>
<br>
1. The spell could probably easily be coded into the game the same way bane damage works on weapons now, an increased amount of damage based on fire, ice, or magic damage.  There could possibly be highend &quot;bane&quot; type versions of this spell that would have to be quested also.  <br>
<br>
2. As stated previously this spell would be balanced like Boon of the Garou in that it would only be viable to cast on one group member. And only need to be recast a limited number of times. Therefore minimizing its effect on our manapool, which In my belief should be left over for doing as much nuking as we can possibly do without stealing agro. (besides isn't that the game we wizards play?)<br>
<br>
3. The idea had also been raised that perhaps instead of making a whole new spell line, they could just adapt the Okeils spell line to become these. I embrace this idea whole heartedly, and only add that they would need to extend the line to include more powerful versions more viable to the higher end game.  <br>
<br>
4. Parity is needed to balance this spell, parity in levels, and in power. There should only be one type of magic, if we continue to encourage the idea that the Okiel's spell line should be altered to become this new type of spell, then we have an easy job, because the parity in levels is already there, AND these spells are already exclusively fire based we only need to add more to this spell line at the higher levels, possibly changing the new okeils spell to be targetable, and have this effect instead of the DS aswell. If there were fire based, ice based, AND magic based versions of these spells, there would be too many spells in the line, and if there is more then one viable version of this spell in any given level range, we will find ourselves constantly memming all the different versions and buffing everyone, and that would get pretty lame in my opinion. <br>
<br>
<br>
That's all that I've come up with on this idea so far, any input on this, criticism, suggestions, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to add a quote from Jarnin that summs up my feelings exactly.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All I want is something that will have me desired in a group. I don't want to &quot;beat out&quot; a class for a slot in a group. I want people looking for specific classes for specific reasons. So far, the only thing carrying us is our damage. Apparently many wizards feel that isn't enough.<br>
<br>
So again, I leave it up to others to come up with the ideas I can't. The ideas that will gain some attention, and will be so good that SOE can't ignore them.<br>
<br>
Good luck all. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
A point to add about the spell lineup. It's actually criticly important that the damage is applies AFTER the initial melee damage calculation the way a damage shield is. For most classes, it's not a hige difference, but for a rogue, even a shift of 1 point on the weapons effective damage can be huge, and bane type adds before those calculations. (Whay an LSoEE was so powerful, for example. it's effectively a 21/29 weapon.)<br>
<br>
Also, I really dont mind the share teh wealth idea, perhaps if it's sold like this:<br>
The best version of Ennya's Elemental Enhancement ( *smile* ) is from a wizard. It's the most efficient, cold based, has the highest damage potential, and lasts the longest. 2ndary version would be poison based, and be necromancer, then disease and shaman, Mage and fire, and lastly, enchanters would get a magic based version.<br>
<br>
Additionally, recast I think shoud be instant, just make the spells mana intensive based on it's DPS output -- as good as our most efficient DDs, unless in a raid setting where it can be even better.<br>
<br>
Suppose:<br>
<br>
Level 4: lasts 1 minutes, uses 20 (30?) mana and does 1 point.<br>
Level 16: Lasts 5 minutes, uses 100 mana (120 maybe), does 2 points.<br>
Level 34: Lasts 5 minutes, uses 200 mana (180?), does 3 points.<br>
Level 49: Lasts 10 minutes, uses 400 mana, does 3 points.<br>
Level 54: Lasts 10 minutes, Group effect, uses 700 mana, does 3 points.<br>
Level 58: Lasts 10 minutes, Single target, uses 400 mana,  does 4 points.<br>
Level 60: Lasts 10 minutes, Group effect, uses 700 mana, does 4 points.<br>
Level 63: Lasts 10 minutes, Group effect, uses 1200 mana, does 5 points.<br>
Level 65: Lasts 15 minutes, Group effect, uses 2000 mana, does 8 points.<br>
<br>
Note: Should also add to agro generation of the person it's cast on.<br>
<br>

It had just occured to me that bane damage would have been a simple way to code it in. The only thing I'm curious of about your way Ennya is if it is one of those things that could be coded in as things are. Cuz we know they (verant, sony, whoever the hell) don't like doing things that involve much if any rewriting, or adding of code.  Perhaps another way to do it would be making it a proc buff much like SKs can buff themselves with alifetap proc and then these proc buffs would last for the durations you give in your above post?  The idea of giving other classes different lines with the other resistance checks is interesting. I had thought about whether or not arrows or throwing weapons could/should work with this also. But I decided it was one of those details that doesn't need to be mulled over really, because in the end this is all rhetorical anyway. /sigh I'd just like to see if we could come up with one fantasy spell in this whole forum that maybe people could work together and all agree on, instead of bicker and fight over. I figure we have more of a chance getting a spell that the wizard community can atleast agree on; getting some kind of notice. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=176149">Pidd of the Nexus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/dbzgnome/images/piddsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/adkinsband/OPA.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/butterflysedge/ff8anigifs/mini_vivi.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ennyaorcsbane>Ennya Orcsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/12/02 4:36 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Take a second look at this.</span><hr size=1> A DD proc would be a fine way to implement it and well within the code. <p><image src=http://www.webhazard.net/images/Vote-Sig/ennya_kiel.jpg><BR>

Of course, if I had my way, the level cap would still be 60 and PoP would have focused exclusively on challenging, engaging and unpredictable raid encounters, while simultaneously revamping underutilized and NEVER-UTILIZED zones for pre-60 and AA exp purposes.   I'd rather run through the maze and press the lever hoping for the occasional food pellet to come down the chute instead of running on the gerbil wheel for hours. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fizziisotope>Fizzi Isotope</A> at: 11/13/02 6:15:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=altruxquestmaster>Altrux Questmaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 627<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/14/02 12:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Take a second look at this.</span><hr size=1> i would like to see a spell line (hell change the al'kabor spell line to this) that did the following:<br>

I think a  &quot;wep proc&quot; buff is a good idea, but the damage and for sure the mana cost was way off in the post before... 2000m haha um no.<br>
<br>
I think our familiars should spell cast.  <br>
<br>
I think a chanter rune for 1500 vs a epic for 800 sux.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is groups want casters that can buff.  If we want groups, we need a buff line of spells.<br>
<br>
Oh and just remove MB from the game along with lifeburn thax.  a 7,000 pt nuke for 4,000m with no crits is useless.<br>

I have every root .. there are tons of them... none work much better then the level 4.  Hello Greater fetter breaking in 5 sec.<br>

<br>
Problem with any of those improvements, Fizzi, they ALL make us better at soloing. So does that yalp spell. The only way we can get better at grouping / raiding is spells we just can't use soloing. That means long cast time nukes -- which wold be largely useless on raids unless it's a boss mob. <p><image src=http://www.webhazard.net/images/Vote-Sig/ennya_kiel.jpg><BR>

The words in this topic clearly show that I am not the only one that believes it to be so. With the introduction of PoP and to a lesser extent Luclin our usefulness has dramatically declined. Our translocation and porting ability no longer competes with druids alone. But this is only the smallest of problems I have begun to see. Recently I have had the opportunity to raid and have found that the wizard class is not a vital aspect of any raid I have been on. Sure, we throw out a lot of damage but to avoid aggro we have to wait and generally get off one nuke, maybe two before the mob is defeated. Only on bosses  can we fulfill our full potential of damage. We should have options instead of sitting and waiting for the 40% of health to drop. I love the idea of adding dam to the main tanks but is it enough to make wizards a viable choice versus other caster classes?  No, I dont want to be best choice just a viable one for raids and when groups are looking for more. Instead of telling you what I dont want let me throw some brainstorming your way and see what more knowledgeable people think. <br>
<br>
A nuke spell cast upon the main tank that is held until the tank first hits the target and is unleashed upon the target.  Aggro of spell stays upon tank. I know, sounds like a breach of eq law, but it is certainly inline with giving the wizard more group, and raid viability. This would allow increased aggo on main tank and allow more to join the fray earlier. The casting time could be enormous to ensure that it used only once per mob, perhaps only once per two mobs. <br>
<br>
A mini evac spell that pulls one target to location of caster and removes aggro from that individual. This could be abused so its mana cost, recast time or casting distance should reflect this, however it should have a fast cast time or it becomes near worthless in saving a party member.   This could be invaluable if one member of the party pulls more than the party can handle. Perhaps a simpler version of this would only reduce the amount of aggro the target currently has. This would be similar to the concussion spell, but for group or raid members. <br>
<br>
The ability to channel mana to another caster. This sounds counter productive to the wizard, but I am talking about group and raid viability and am interested in aiding the party as a whole. Sometimes you wish the (insert caster class here) had one more spell to give. No, I dont want to be a mana pool for the other casters, there needs to limits imposed so it is used only in emergencies. <br>
<br>
Well, its 2 am and my brain is mush, that is all I can come up with on the fly but will put much more thought into it and get back to you. If any of these reflect spells of other casters it is unintentional, I am, always have been, and always will be a wizard. My knowledge of other casters is incomplete and their spell lists vast.  But what is certain, when raids or groups are forming I want to hear, We could really use a wizard as opposed to Okay, we will take you if we cant get a (insert any other caster class here).<br>

<br>
enchanting weapons with elements sounds like a magician or enchanter thing.  Instead I always thought that Wizards should get cold based slow/root (based on Elnerik's entombment of ice)  level 44 is just root.  level 52 adds 30 percent slow with the root.  level 56 is 40 percent slow with the root. level 60 is 50 percent with slow.  65 gets you 60 percent slow with root.<br>
<br>
Now before you all bite my head off and saying shaman and enchanters will throw fits, let me explain some rules about these.  They will be cold based first off so they run a different resistance check.  Second, they also have the persistent root check to see if they break which means when root breaks, slow breaks.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I think it may not add much desire to the wizard as a slower, but if you can get DPs and have a hard time finding a slower, the wizard could do in a pinch. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/theharters/OcularisSiggie.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
&quot;Also, I really dont mind the share teh wealth idea, perhaps if it's sold like this:<br>
The best version of Ennya's Elemental Enhancement ( *smile* ) is from a wizard. It's the most efficient, cold based, has the highest damage potential, and lasts the longest. 2ndary version would be poison based, and be necromancer, then disease and shaman, Mage and fire, and lastly, enchanters would get a magic based version.&quot;<br>
<br>
This idea sounds more fleshed out.  Of course I think the enchanters should get the best version, and the spell line should be available to them at lower levels then the other classes. less mana, longer duration, more damage etc. as Enchanting is their specialty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lornick65>Lornick65</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 12:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> idea</span><hr size=1> An idea just struck me... why not give wizards a buff line that adds XXX amount of damage to single target DD spells?

If the lvl 65 version add 350 damage to each nuke, someone  would get the idea to load up their lvl 1 nuke and do 355 dam for 5 mana 1.5 sec cast.
