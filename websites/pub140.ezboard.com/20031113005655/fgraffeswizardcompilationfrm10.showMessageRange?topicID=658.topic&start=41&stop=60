The DPS figures melee classes are fond of quoting always include misses and hits for low damage. The damage output does fluctuate a bit, but over time is remarkably constant. By contrast, mana classes are fond of quoting their <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  theorhetical</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> numbers (ie: 230 dps from sunstrike, which assumes zero fizzles and resists, and ignores the recast delay). All I am asking for is that we compare apples with apples where possible. Show me a log where a wizard does 13800 dmg in a minute (using sunstrike, and without crits, please) and I'll eat my shorts.<br>

For conventional groups, the wizard is dependent on both the tank and the cleric to be able to do his damage. For AE groups, we need a healer as well (though you generally don't need a tank). To make the claim that melee damage must be somehow fractionalized when comparing it to wizard damage is not a fair and accurate comparison. Soloing is a different situation -- but when I want to play by myself I'll play Wizardry 8, thanks. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A> at: 2/6/02 12:50:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 3245<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 2:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> First off, Glin, sorry to hear about your retirement.

Wizards, the class, the people, the ideas, whatever... are not broken!  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it when people say this, it drives me crazy.  No, we're not broken at all.  We need some tuning in certain areas but we are absolutly not broken.<br>
<br>
People keep saying that SoL was just another melee spinner.  Guess what, you're not looking hard enough.  IMO this was a great expansion for casters.  Yes, there are new melee weapons and armor but why wouldn't there be?  There were new caster robes, spells, and weapons in SoV and that was a &quot;melee&quot; expansion.  <br>
<br>
What did we get in this expansion?  Let's see... FT stacking which was awesome.  TONS of new caster items that absolutly own.  Yes, believe it or not there are a TON of new caster items that blow stuff from high level SoV encounters away.  The INT/WIS softcaps were lifted partially and 200-255 INT/WIS raises our mana pool by a bit (approx. 319 extra mana at 60).  We also got a ton of new buffs to assist us in our endevors and expand our productivily.  <br>
<br>
Wizards (more than most other classes) also seem to be in the spotlight lately.  I've been asked to join random groups constantly and guess what, AE is the new thing that everyone wants.<br>
<br>
I was in a group yesterday in Plane of Growth.  It was composed of 2 very well equipped level 60 Warriors with SoDs, Primal, North stuff... a 60 Monk w/ some of the best equipment available to them, a 60 Cleric, a Level 60 Rogue w/ Myro Dagger etc, and of course me on a 60 Monk with some of the best equipment avail.  It was actually kinda funny, we were getting all of the experience... until two more guild Wizards showed up and grouped with a Rogue.  At that point we stopped getting EXP and the Monk in our group made a funny comment.  He said &quot;man, the Wizards are here... so much for getting EXP exclusivly.&quot;  Sure enough we didn't see much EXP after that reguardless of how hard we tried.  <br>
<br>
When we go to Ssra or Akheva the Wizards always form a group.  4 60 Wizards, 1 60 Mage, 1 60 Druid... other combos come around occasionally obviously, but for the most part this is pretty solid.  We always get the EXP because we're able to deal FAST HARD HITTING damage.  Yes, there is no argument from me that our long term damage dimishes but that's not our role.  In an EXP group I can contribute as much as a Rogue as long as I have c3 (or c2+gob) without the use of my Rend Robe.  <br>
<br>
Also, as a previous poster said, the new Luclin mobs have very high AC and a lot have curses which reduce attack or attack speed among other things.  This seriously hurts the melee classes.  9/10 named that we do have Wizard EXP written all over them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Do I think we're perfect?  Nope.  Do I think we're broken?  Hell no.  Do I think we need work in some areas?  Yep.  Do I think we own in groups?  Kinda.  Do I think we suck in groups?  Absolutly not.  Do I think we need improvments in group desirabilty?  Yep.  <br>
<br>
Soloing - We rock.<br>
Raiding - We rock.<br>
Grouping - AE grouping we rock, normal grouping we're good.<br>

It's all about the midset you have really. <p><br>

While I usually have a great deal of respect for you and your opinions, I have to disagree here:<br>
<br>
Saying a velk / VP robe is 'required' in an experience group is just plain silly.<br>
<br>
Last night I was in seb for about 4 hours, made a half yellow bub in 55 with the following group:<br>
<br>
59 Paladin<br>
56 Cleric<br>
57 Enchanter<br>
56 Druid<br>
55 Wizard (me)<br>
56 Monk<br>
<br>
I had c2, 54 familiar, and epic as my only mana regen buffs.<br>
<br>
The melees are outfitted pretty well for their level, mostly Skyshrine armor and good weapons.<br>
<br>
We did perfectly fine holding down the experience, pulls were constant, and I never ran out of mana for any significant period of time.<br>

I get a bit aggressive in my commentary when presented with claims about wizard damage that the facts simply do not support. My core assertion is that wizard damage has not kept pace with melee damage, and mudflation has made for a rather bleak situation, especially for young wizards in the level 20-40 range. I actually agree with Rombus' main point, that wizards are not broken, but could use some tweaks to bring them back up to the group performance level they should be at.  Wizards <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> great on raids, but not so much so that it justifies hampering them in conventional groups.<br>
<br>
Wizards are one of the most fun classes to play in the game. Rombus related a situation where he was playing a well equipped monk and found his group was losing kills to the wizard group. They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> tried</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to get a kill but couldn't. If you think about it, there's not a lot that a melee class can do to increase their damage output. Once their group and equipment is set, their damage output is pretty much determined by the dice gods, and there's not a lot they can do to change it increase their output. Wizards, on the other hand, have complete control over this. Just having control over when and how hard to nuke means you are constantly making decisions in combat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualedar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aledar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 3:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> Etnu, dunno if I was clear enough on it before, maybe not, but I'm definitely looking more at a high-end point of view.  Face it, I do most of my grouping within Recon, and report what I see.  Your results will vary with level 52 warriors using Wurmslayers and Cane of the Tranquils, of course, plus whatever falls in between.  Point is, for the most part, all wizards are pretty much equal in damage output.  There's some variation, but not a whole lot, relatively.  Melees are very gear dependant.  We'll outdamage those with &quot;lesser&quot; gear, but those with the best to chose from will outdamage us over time.  But in exp groups with those in my guild, there's no way in hell I can outdamage a warrior, rogue, monk or ranger... SKs and Paladins are rather out of reach, hell, Bards can probably outdamage me overall.<br>
<br>
Also, moving through a zone to a raid target is a bit different from your average exp group.  Your PoG yard trash is inherently different from your most popular pickup group spots - mushrooms in FG, spiders in Velks, etc.  In other words, easy mobs that you can literally pull nonstop.  In such situations (which most exp groups strive to emulate), there will be pretty much no &quot;recharging&quot; time for us.  Moving through some hard yard trash is different.<br>
<br>
Take NToV a couple of weeks ago.  I was in the wiz-heavy group.  16 named mobs, 14 we got exp from.  Problem is, that was ALL we got, with a couple exceptions - two baby drakes (where our guild policy is &quot;hit F8 and keel at will&quot;), and two Vulak guards while half the guild was dispelling and working out loot.  So during the entire clearing, I got just over a blue of alt exp.  Many offtanks got 2-3 yellow.  And it's not like we weren't trying, we just couldn't regen mana fast enough to keep up with the pulls, so our damage suffered as a result.  Same result for Ring of Fire; we don't really get any exp on waves 3-5 except the boss mobs, which we always get.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, we were messing around with the Arch Lich the other day.  Eight guards right outside him, all yellow cons, we got most of the exp.  The fights were long enough, though not too long, and spaced out enough for us to regain mana.  Hence, exp for us.  Similar things happen with the elder thought horrors around Overfiend.  It's *all* about how fast stuff is being pulled, and how fast they die.<br>
<br>
Like I said, we're situational.  I provided a few examples above for our strengths and weaknesses.  The problem for your average level 53 wizard looking for a pickup group is that the &quot;perfect group&quot; that most people strive to obtain are our weakness, and people notice before long.  Is the difference as bad in the low 50's for similar equipped characters?  Not that much.  But the damage difference can get out of hand with a few melee gear improvements, and as a result, people seem almost afraid to group wizards because they might be less efficient.  Sometimes, people just take the whole max/min thing way too far... but sometimes, the gap really is too big to justify if other classes are available.  It's not *all* because of our decreased efficiency in situations, but it does play a part, be it directly or indirectly.<br>
<br>
It's almost funny, in a way... one of the &quot;required&quot; classes for most Kunark groups, the cleric, is getting left behind as well, at least in the high-end game.  Monks with top of the line gear can just totally shread through most level 45 mobs for exp... one in my guild took out 3 blues at once the other night, only lost 2 bubbles of life in the process.  A monk/shaman duo is just sick now.  And as your average armor keeps getting better and better (your average player seems to have a good deal of Thurgadin armor or equivalent these days), shamans are taking over cleric spots.  Even chanters are getting to be dead weight compared to bards in a lot of spots.  Players are getting to be more &quot;uber&quot; than Verant ever imagined they would, IMHO, and Verant is forced to make changes as they go along.<br>
<br>
In the end, I do enjoy playing my wizard now.  Casters are getting some good stuff in Luclin (though the most helpful, like Flowing Thought, is still pretty much exclusive to the larger guilds).  But there's definitely some parts that need some tinkering to iron things out, and I think that exp situations need a closer look. <p><a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/profile.php?pid=119">Baron Aledar Boomcaster</a><br>Sorcerer of <a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/">Reconstructed</a>, E'ci<br><img src="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~bwa/kerasig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomish Advocate</span><br>  Posts: 4818<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 3:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> your average player seems to have a good deal of Thurgadin armor or equivalent these days<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Rombus, I have to disagree. You guys really need to start qualifying statement, as this simply is not true for wizards below 50, and arguably below 56. Crits and AA are all really good things. But you have to remember that there is a substantial portion of Wizards who havent seen that stuff yet.<br>
<br>
I am level 51, and I can tell you SoL didnt change my wizard's life one iota. I do have more to look forward too now, I will grant you that. But don't pretend that is a watershed for wizards the realm over. <br>

Every wizard isn't like the wizards you guys hang around. Come back to the sub-50 game for a sec. Spend a few days in Paw, in Sol B or in Cazic, and talk to the wizards there. See how much the game changed for them. <br>
<br>
Every wizard isn't casting Sunstrike<br>
Every wizard isn't wielding an epic<br>
Every wizard isn't 55 with access to AA<br>
Every wizard isn't getting invites to AE groups<br>
<br>
I am very happy for wizards who DO fall into the above catagories. But you can't act like your experience is true for &quot;wizards&quot; as a whole. Avoid the generalities, they don't help any of us get any clearer.<br>

<br>
For the average person grinding exp from 51-60, damage output really isn't an issue. As you may or may not be aware, I regularly group with 6 different rogues from 56-60 with epics and mostly skyshrine or better armor. I have no real trouble keeping up.<br>
<br>
In this same situation, if the melees were all using North wing weapons / armor, tunare daggers, etc., would i be able to keep up on exp grinds? hell no.<br>
<br>
BUT:<br>
<br>
People decked out in that gear are spending the majority of their time raiding. Would you say that wizards aren't keeping up on raids? I certainly wouldn't.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you have your fair share of the wizard 'toys' that put you leaps and bounds ahead of melees that don't have access to primal and ntov loot.<br>
<br>
The weapons / armor that the majority of the melees you group with are designed to be used when fighting mobs like vulak, AoW, tunare, etc. - certainly not frogloks.<br>

Well DPS figures been around for a long time, and he was getting along fine before he turned &quot;Other Hits&quot; on.

I might feel differently if I wasn't in an uberguild, but I am, so there you have it.  I have a lot of fun being a wizard and I get a hard on every time I'm in a wizard group KSing melee groups whenever we feel like it.  I chuckle when I show up to a raid and melee groups actually invite me (they use to not do this).  Gimme C3 and a target and I'm a happy camper.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that I think wizards rock for everything BUT standard grouping (meaning non-AE grouping).  We suck in standard groups at least when you look at the math.  My only suggestion is that you either a) get involved with raiding, and/or b) focus on getting into AE groups, and/or c) do explorative single group raiding (i.e., dungeon crawling) with friends in challenging areas for grins.  I find all of those options quite fun.  Sitting in some corner killing single mobs will get real old no matter how high your DPS is. *shrug*<br>

I was just pointing out that the &quot;average wizard&quot; is a highly morphous entity. Sometimes he's level 60 with epic and hanging out with people who do NToV regularly. Sometimes he's level 34, learning to quad ulthorks. Sometimes he's level 51, trying to get into a group in KC instead of going to kite in CS.<br>
<br>
The &quot;average wizard&quot; has never been successfully defined, and unless VI wants to step in and help us actually define that person, I think talking about the &quot;average wizard&quot; is a bad idea. &quot;My experiences, at level X with gear Y and in zone Z&quot; is a much better way to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 415<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 4:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's depressing</span><hr size=1> Glin, I feel your pain.<br>

&quot;People keep saying that SoL was just another melee spinner.&quot; - Rombus<br>
<br>
Well it was. Don't get me wrong familiars are great, but compare the ease of getting a Centi LS or Str of Grodan compared to a FT item. _Anyone_ can get great melee weapons that goose melee dph, but FT items? All nodrop and super hard to get.<br>
<br>
FT stacking only matters to someone who can actually GET more than one FT item<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Yes for the few Wizards who can put together an aggregate FT15 that's really great. But most won't ever and those that do are in the endgame, whereas the melee boosts are much easier to come by and easily available at much lower level.<br>
<br>
Don't misunderstand me, I have no problem with items being hard to get, but anyone can see that FT is the only thing that increases DPH for a wizard. Weapons do it for melees. And the weapons are _much_ easier to upgrade than it is for casters to acquire FT items.<br>

But do note that<br>
<br>
49 Familiar = FT 1<br>
<br>
54 Familiar = FT 2<br>
<br>
60 Familiar = FT 4<br>
<br>
We can't both think familiars are so-so and be wishing we had more access to FT items. The coveted seventh shawl gives the same mana regen as the 49 familiar everyone thinks is so hum-drum.<br>
<br>
While I want my damn focus items, and am going to stick my foot up the ass the next person who tells me I can get a +Divination item, I think for the vast majority of wizards (not the two percent who are in NToV, of course), familiars are far more useful than they're normally made out to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=658.topic&start=121&stop=135>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=658.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=658.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=658.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=658.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=658.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=658.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> -
