Of the two things, I think Verant would be more inclined to remove some of the prohibitive cost (the reagent and mana cost) than to make it more flexible (leave the body, affect higher level targets, etc).<br>
<br>
Part of the reason I don't think they want to mess with the level cap is the absurd system they use on the planes, where monsters are grossly underconned and thus would fall within the realm of Disintegrate.  Now, the obvious answer to this is to raise the 'level' of the monsters so they CON more rationally, but Verant likes their uneven consider level of creatures so much they barely even bother to defend the way its implemented. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=swipey>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/02 7:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> &quot;I can see why you'd be outraged and filled with contempt for the idea (rolling eyes). &quot;<br>
<br>
Thats the part that prompted me to ask if you were trolling.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I mean, gimme a break.  How many threads are there on this very board where Wizards are outraged and filled with contempt about what they feel are their class defining abilities getting farmed out to other classes? <br>
<br>
How many Wizards are outraged and filled with contempt about ANYONE else getting nukes that even approach Wizard nukes?  Look in the Polls section and you'll see one about giving TLs to druids, in which over half the respondents reply in the maximum negative to the idea.<br>
<br>
If you don't understand why someone might possibly get a tad outraged at a suggestion to farm out their class abilities to others, then you're either truly obtuse, or you are being intentionally obtuse in order to get a rise out of people.  And since I don't think you're truly obtuse, I'm supposing you're some kind of troll, at least in this thread. <br>
<br>
<br>
What you proposed was 90 pick skill for a 20 wizard.  90 pick is what a 17 rogue can get, so you're proposing to give wizards a rogue ability at -3 levels, but with NO need to practice it, or carry/equip picks. <br>
<br>
Is it outrageous or contemptible, then, to turn the tables and suggest giving access to certain wizard spells to other classes, but only when they are 3 levels higher than a wizard needs to be to cast them?  And to not require some of the hassles required of the wizard to cast the same spells?<br>
<br>
The knock spell you suggest is straight out of D&amp;D, so I will suggest another ability from D&amp;D :<br>
<br>
Rogues can cast spells from scrolls.  It would take a skill check (skill raises like any other trade/rogue skill, ie with use or training), but no mana, and would consume the scroll when attempted. Oh, and the rogue would simply HAVE to be at least 3 levels higher than the level of the spell.<br>
<br>
It would take a 52 rogue to cast Ice Comet (49) off an Ice Comet scroll, or a 22 Rogue to TL someone to Nexus.<br>
<br>
The balance factor is the fail chance (as much as 5% if skill is maxed, more if it isnt) and the fact that the scroll, often costing -several- pp from a vendor, is destroyed, succeed or fail.<br>
<br>
<br>
How about it?  Outrageous and Contemptible?  Does it offend you that I would even suggest such a thing?  Be honest now...<br>

Hmm, yeah I see where there's a rational comparison there.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should try this: Rogues get the ability to teleport to Nexus, but they can't do it until a few levels after Wizards, and it costs the Rogue something it doesn't the Wizard... hit points maybe.  That's a better comparison, something useful in a limited sense, but nothing to get screaming mad about, and more limited than the Wizard ability, at a later level.<br>

<br>
The point of the previous suggestion was not to start a debate about exactly what would be a &quot;fair equivalent&quot;, but to illustrate a case of one's class abilities being given to other classes that would hit closer to home for (and not benefit) Wizards.  <br>
<br>
Wizards seem to be VERY concerned with their nukes, deeming that they should not only be larger, but also be more mana efficient than any other classes nukes.  Being &quot;Masters of Arcane Direct Damage&quot; is what they hold as their &quot;class defining&quot; ability.<br>
<br>
Most old rogues I know never asked to be &quot;masters of situational melee damage&quot;, though.  They made rogues not so they could do L337 damage while grouped, but instead they made them so they could creep around, get into places others could not (despite traps or locks!) and steal stuff.  Verant, though, never seems to have paid much attention to that motivation.  There are what? less than 10 locked doors in the entire world (some of which lead nowhere), still fewer traps (some of which are not disarmable), and actually stealing anything is a no-no.  But still, the skills associated with this vision of what a rogue is are considered &quot;class defining&quot; by a lot of rogues.<br>
<br>
After someone gets a &quot;knock&quot; spell, they may well start lobbying for a &quot;detect traps&quot; one, a &quot;super Invisibility&quot; that is as hard to see as sneak/hide, and maybe even a &quot;filch&quot; spell that simulates Pickpocket (But don't worry rogues!  Its 3 whole levels less than your Pick Pocket, and costs an eensy bit of mana!)<br>
<br>
<br>
So you say its nothing to get screaming about, but I say it is, because if it gets done, it establishes a precedent of farming out even the few, weak, rogue class defining abilities to other classes via spellcraft.<br>
<br>
It just seems funny to me how willing some people are to farm out OTHER classes class defining abilities while simultaneously guarding their own class defining abilities very very jealously.<br>
<br>
Is that a little morte clear to YOU?  (Rolls eyes)<br>

PS just to argue ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  a closer equivalent would be to allow rogues to cast ANY major spire TL/Portal (NK Gfay, Tox, DL, Nexus) since there are about 5 zones (not 1) where lockpick is needed to access portions of them, and the picker can get others (not just himself) into them (hence TL or Portal, rather than just a self-gate)  And I'd stick with having to have the scroll, and perhaps add a small hp cost.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=swipey>Swipey</A> at: 10/23/02 5:23:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 6207<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/02 7:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> It couldn't be all ports, just the one, because of how incredibly limited the utility of Lockpicking is.  Further I never suggested this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>should</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be done, only how it could be done in a way that wouldn't hurt a Rogue, because they'd always be superior and not cost mana to do so.<br>
<br>
If I'd made Everquest I would have made the game without classes and used a similar skill/spell type of system as Elder Scrolls: Morrowind.  This allows you to build spells - if you are smart enough to learn them, powerful enough to be allowed by the guild to know the basis of them, and rich enough to try.<br>
<br>
The thing you have to realize though is that Rogues aren't Rogues in Everquest, they are Ninjas, or assassins at best.  You can't call upon other games' definition for the class, because they just don't apply here.<br>
<br>
When I made my rogue, I wanted him to be like Garret in Thief (HIGHLY recommended game) but I knew better, there's no way in Everquest you'll be able to climb a wall, sneak past guards, pick a lock to a chest, steal the widget and knock something out from behind, dragging the body to cover so you can make your escape.  Everquest doesn't have a clever enough engine and the game can't sustain the 'chest full of treasure' concept because of camping.<br>
<br>
You have to admit that just about every fantasy game in existence has knock and disarm trap type spells in the repertoire, but that's balanced by other factors (such as the ones I suggested, in addition to making Rogue type characters a much more feasible and useful class without killing things).<br>
<br>
The thing is, the fact that there's so few locked doors that are even worth unlocking really should give you a hint to how immensely minor something like this would be.  Your desire is to defend what makes a Rogue a rogue, but picking locks and disarming traps isn't what MAKES you a Rogue in Everquest.  Rogues in Everquest are sneaky murderers, your pick pocket ability is even nearly worthless.  Giving up a marginal and as you admitted nearly insignificant ability in a poorer, more limited form to another class wouldn't even cause a hiccup to Rogues.  I mean you are aware Bards get both skills right?<br>
<br>
But the discussion is moot... it won't happen and even if it did, it would mean nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=swipey>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/02 11:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Bards have always had something of a roguely air about them.<br>
<br>
And it is valid, IMO, to bring up other sources than just EQ when talking about what people want or expect in the game.  Who ever heard of &quot;orcs&quot; or &quot;halflings&quot; before tolkein, and especially before D&amp;D?  Both those are quite obviously source material for norrath, even if it is officially uncredited.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would LOVE to see a non-class based or only inclination based game where all skills are available to all characters, with enopugh development.  At its most basic (I alluded to this in another thread (or maybe earlier in this one!)) one that had only 3 skill trees that were not mutually exclusive.<br>
<br>
Physical, Arcane, and Religious.  At character creation, each player ranks these three, 1 to 3, in the order of his characters inclinations toward them.  <br>
<br>
A classic big, dumb warrior type would have Physical 1,  Religious 2, and Arcane 3.<br>
A classic bookish, indoorsy wizard type, Arcane 1, Religious 2, and Physical 3.<br>
And the classic &quot;cleric&quot; type, Religious 1, Physical 2, Arcane 3.<br>
<br>
How these work is as multipliers on the cost of developing skills in each tree.  A big, dumb warrior learns physical skills easily, but bookish ones are very hard.  Not that he cant learn them, they just take 3 times the effort as an equivalent physical skill.  He is naturally athletic, but gets restless if he has to sit still for hours on end reading some boring ol book.<br>
<br>
A slightly more complex system would involve ranking each area 3, 6, or 9, and then, within each area, having strenghts and weaknesses represented by modifying the area ranking by -1, +1, or leaving it alone, with all -1s needing to be balanced by +1s.<br>
<br>
<br>
A Big Dumb Warrior might distribute his physical rankings as follows :<br>
<br>
Overall : 3<br>
Strength (2)<br>
Finesse (4)<br>
Endurance (3)<br>
<br>
Whereas a rogue :<br>
Overall : 3<br>
Strength (3)<br>
Finesse (2)<br>
Endurance (4)<br>
<br>
<br>
Arcane could be split into the basic casting skills, <br>
Abjuration<br>
Conjuration<br>
Divination<br>
Enchantments<br>
Evocation<br>
<br>
But I would probably try to limit it to 3 subs as well.  Perhaps :<br>
Evocations (making things go boom!)<br>
Enchantments (Changing existing things properties)Conjurations (making useful things out of nothing) <br>
<br>
Wizards : Strong Nukes, weak pets (or none!), mixed utility<br>
Evoke (2)<br>
Enchant (3)<br>
Conjure (4)<br>
<br>
Mages : Great pets, OK nukes, mixed/weak utility<br>
Evoke (3)<br>
Enchant (4)<br>
Conjure (2)<br>
<br>
Necros : Great Pets, Weak nukes, middling utility<br>
Evoke (4)<br>
Enchant (3)<br>
Conjure (2)<br>
<br>
Chanters : Ok pets, Weak Nukes, Great utility<br>

I dont know how I'd split up Religious stuff.  Maybe Blessings (buffs), Wrath (attacks) and Healing (heals, duh!)  Maybe? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 6217<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/24/02 11:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Religious stuff would either have to be based on general ethos (good, evil) or on the 'deity' worshipped, so you would have different kinds of spells available to you based on your deity.  Religious could actually be pretty regimented simply because they are part of an organized religion.  An alternative would be simply to have healers, and leave the religious stuff out entirely - it does make some people pretty uncomfortable and you can have the same feel to the game without it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 9851<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/25/02 4:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Hmmm. I actually sent in a different version of a knock spell in a request from the Developer's Corner. I got back an e-mail saying what a good idea it was, and that it might make it to Test after Luclin. At which point, of course, said spell guy was gone.<br>
<br>
My thoughts when I sent it in: There aren't enough locked doors in EQ. Not only is it implausible (&quot;come on down and BUST RIGHT INTO MY LAIR!&quot;), it devalues rogues being something other than backstabbers. If you wanted a lot more locked doors in the game, you'd also want everyone NOT to be held captive to one class. (Brell knows we get enough of that as is.) So give wizards a Knock spell that would unlock, say, bard-unlockable doors, and maybe with an upgrade to let them unlock, say, 200 level doors too.<br>
<br>
I like Grim's idea of pegging the level to higher than an equivalent rogue's skill (well, it's essentially the same idea, just facing the other way).<br>
<br>
I'd also have a mage-summoned Skeleton Key line that worked the same way. (No drop, probably.)<br>
<br>
Of course, if VI did this, it would HAVE to go hand-in-hand with tossing in lots more locked doors, including in old world content. Anything else wouldn't be fair.<br>
<br>
(And, for the record, the firepot room, the Nexus and PoK represents a much bigger daily hit on wizards' secondary abilities than a Knock spell ever could. Unclench.) <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz_toon.gif" height="104" width="390" alt="stats" border=0></a>

<br>
for the most part, all skills are available to all people of all classes (with VERY few exceptions, like only theives can backstab, only barbarians (the warriors of DR) get  combat disiplins (called dances), ect )<br>
<br>
but the learnign rate and effictivness is  different for all classes<br>
all skills are divided into types:<br>
ARMOR, WEAPON, MAGIC, LORE, SURVIVAL<br>
<br>
things like swimming and climbing would be in survivial<br>
carving and other 'tinkering' and music type skills are lore<br>
armor, weapons, and magic are self explanitory<br>
<br>
like moon mages (closest to wizard) are:<br>
primary: magic<br>
secondary: survival, lore<br>
terteriry: survival, weapon<br>
<br>
while a ranger would be<br>
primary survival<br>
secondary lore magic<br>
tert weapon armor<br>
<br>
and my favorite, warrior mages (imagine the nukage of a mage and the fighting ability of a ranger and the defense abilities of a shaman, while it may sound over powered it isn't because of serious evasion and armor penalties)<br>
primary magic <br>
secondary weapon lore<br>
tert survival armour<br>
<br>
skill system rocks, its text based though<br>
<br>
characters are SO different, there are many weapons types, and you gain skill individually<br>
<br>
and its exact oposite of EQ in the skill system, <br>
<br>
there are no level caps on skills, insteead of getting general XP to get levels, you get so many skill ranks in certian skills (depending on your class) then you get a general level<br>
<br>
its a neat game if your into text based <p>&lt;h4 align=center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/l/l/llid/EQ/Altrux-sig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

<br>
The reason those verisons have a higher cap is because they are limited to only certain targets.  That is the advantage VI gives to spells with limited target subsets.<br>
<br>
What is the level limit upon Disintergrate anyways?<br>

How about.... letting a dropped key exist for every locked door?<br>
<br>
that would make rogues / wizards (with knock spell) etc very useful , but not essential (e.g. u can spend the time to get the key drop... )<br>
<br>
of course that would be major zone design issue heh /shrugs <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=falkmoonelfwood>Falkmoon Elfwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/31/02 7:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE</span><hr size=1> <br>
