Have had them blatantly spot me quadding and have them run over and try to steal my mobs.  Then of course when they fail they just run their pulls through me and charm one, leaving me to die in a matter of seconds since the bard himself has no actual aggro control and any PC nearby is in risk.<br>
<br>
Then the other day in PoN I had a 4 pull about 25% down in health already and a bard runs up and tries to make off with one of my spiders.  Then upon failing promptly go and get a few more spawns and come train me.  When asked why he did it he said I shouldn't squeeze him outta his spot, he was fighting there.  So I guess the 10 hours of quadding I did before he showed up didn't count, hmmm, k.<br>
<br>
On the Solusek Ro server I have yet to see a decent bard do this, and I have gotten into the habit of petitioning as soon as I see one since I'd just have to do it later after I get trained and/or die from them.  Of course it takes the GMs like 3 hours to show up and the bards usually leave after numerous people bish them out.<br>
<br>
So Just say NO to Swarm kiting.  Should be (and has shown itself to be) treated as nothing more than starting a train.  Don't have to nerf it, just have to actually give warnings to the dumbfawks who average more PC deaths than mobs killed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=absolutemaster>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/29/02 8:07:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: swarm kitting</span><hr size=1> Boofuckinghoo. Wizards and druids quad-kiting are just as bad if not worse then bard swarm kiters. NEWSFLASH every non quading classes have the same beefs with quad kiters, and frankly it is pure irony that a quad kiter is complaining that another class can do it better. For one it is much harder to get level 60 as a bard and requires quite an amount of skill to manage swarm kiting properly. Compare that to the little risk generated with quad kiting.<br>
<br>
Bards can only swarm kite once in a while because charming costs mana, which bards regen at an excruciating slow rate. There is no such restriction for druids and wizards, the downtime is much shorter.<br>
<br>
And as for the swarm kiting manaless dot thing you are talking about, the bard doing it is a moron. That takes forever to kill and he would pretty much be better off just soloing them, not to mention he would be at a high risk from needing to be so close to the mobs.<br>
<br>
Again, like I said in another rant about bard kiting before, I have been run over by wizards and druids quad kites much more often then I have been with bard swarm kites.<br>

<br>
Swarm Kiting... well... I know that playing a bard well, and to me that means the ability to twist songs and melee, is very difficult.  A bard that can play 1 song or twist two and melee is not difficult... I have seen bards twist 5 songs and pull before.. now that I feel is a good bard.  So, in order to swarm I would assume, not having played a bard myself I have to assume, would require a player to be excellent in that class.  This is a rare few.  So, let them be.<br>
<br>
The problem I have is this, their ability to kite this many creatures simultaneously.  Our AoE spells, the Al'Kabor line I believe, used to be able to hit a huge number of MoBs.  This was nerfed because &quot;Wizards are too powerful&quot;.  Now they hit a max of 5.  If our, yes I play a wizard, power was too great because we could AoE more than 5 creatures then wouldn't that apply to Bards as well?<br>
<br>
I do not want to see Bards nerfed.. I want the complement wizard spells re-instated.  I want to AoE more than 5 MoBs at a time.  If it is ok for a Bard to kite more than 5 then it should be ok for us.<br>
<br>
Now, my wizard has always been my favorite class.  I have played him for over 3 years now.  I am not, by far, the best Wizard.  I have not dedicated countless hours to the game, I have a job and friends that require an inordinate amount of time (damn RL)  :-)  So, if I have errored a bit in this post be gentle.  I welcome a good debate on these issues.<br>

<br>
And yeah, I've had my group in PoN trained by quadders much more often than I have been trained by swarmers. Most people hate quadding wizards, because half of them are retards who don't know how to quad properly, and end up training groups in the process. And being trained by 4+ mobs who hit for 260+ each really really hurts. <br>
<br>
To summarize: There are assholes in every class. Don't call for nerfs because of the actions of these select few. Remember the uproar Manaburn nerf caused?

I've seen it done alot and I've even duo'd with a bard while doing this. Honestly, if you're in an open zone it's pretty fun.<br>
<br>
All things considered, it's not very often that you see this anymore especially under the circumstances described in the original post. The problem with it was nailed by Absolute Master in subsequent posts which is that if they do it manaless it really does take an insane amount of time. Bards getting their mana back takes FOREVER. If they use mana to do it and they charm swarm then it gets done pretty darn fast. However, they won't be doing that again for like 4 hours (or something equally ridiculous. I don't remember their mana recovery time exactly. It's for-freaking-ever though).<br>
<br>
Moreover, while on the odd occasion you see it there might be a pang of jealousy there is nothing to get worked up over here. In fact, bards can solo stuff WAY faster, more efficiently, and with less risk than swarm kiting. If you take a look at the most powerful and skilled bards around you'll find they aren't doing this that often. When they do I'll wager it's mainly for a laugh or done out of boredom.<br>
<br>
At first blush, this may seem very unfair and &quot;unbalanced&quot; but again I think it's rare. If this were happening with the frequency of quadding then you might have a point. Until then, this wizard won't worry about it.<br>

You were the one that came here to call the original poster an imbecile. Ok. You're a fucking moronic jackass then. If you believe even for a second that bards don't have an extremely valuable role in raids then you're off your nut. In fact, there are some mobs that you don't even want to consider without a bard (silencing mobs come to mind). The role of the bard is as versatile as it is essential to many raids, and a well played bard is absolutely invaluable. Thanks for dropping by, misreading the post anyhow (it was a fucking rant you dimwitted fucktard), and then further displaying your own ignorance in all it's splendor by attempting to backhandedly diminish the role bards play in raids.<br>

With a full set of toilers you start singing invis roughly 1-2 seconds after the mobs start squishing your pet.  <br>
<br>
Bards are an extremely versatile class but our abilities are fairly weak overall.  Sure, we can swarm-kite for maybe 40 minutes but our mana regen blows.  Pre-PoP we only have a 30% slow, plus it has a dot component and a long recast delay.  To provide effective CC we have to give up one song per mezzed mob and we really can't handle more than 4 although everyone has probably ghetto-mezzed 5 in a pinch.  I can't begin to describe how fucking annoying twisting 4 songs constantly is; those of you who've played a bard above 30 know what I'm talking about.  Bard melee is pure crap, bard AA is arguably the worst in the game, and druids and wizards hate us for swarm-kiting.  Yeah, we have decent manaless dots...with IM3 and a good instrument.  Bard AE songs are even nicer but they still aren't overpowering (have any bards out there with extended notes tried AE kiting?).  Get this through your head: BARDS ARE NOT OVERPOWERED.

Wizards, in a raid situation, output more DPS than any other class (Barring Rangers in all of three or so fights). Bards are very often shoved back into the Cleric group to play the 32 mana song mixed with Amplify. Is this all they can do? No, but on many raids their other abilities are next to useless to the raid whole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=biralanvox>Biralan Vox</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/31/02 3:46:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Swarm Kiting</span><hr size=1> ! <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=182384">Biralan Vox</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
A lot of bards find this thread interesting. I consider myself a very good swarm kiter. I would like to offer a few observations:<br>
<br>
A good Druid, Wizard, Necro Quadding or pulling 1-3 can certainly stay up with my kill ratio, some I am better than, some are better (kills per hour) than me. <br>
<br>
In terms of that kind of success (in upper levels), outside, and with only certain kinds of mob, that is the only place bards really shine. Their other value is as support to a group (sometimes very valuable--sometimes soso), we can kinda solo singles fear kiting, and do a little better with our 'chant' series of single mob only dots, but we can't approach other classes.<br>
<br>
The days of upper level (45 or so) bards Charm/swarm kiting 20+ groups should be over. The lvl 37 charm that works on up to 52 lvl mobs usually lasts a minute.  Using it with that large a group is a waste of time (mob dies while charmed--no exp, 60 mana, 360 sec regen time, gone). Effective 'swarms' are now in the 3 to 6 range. If you see a bigger one, the bard has probably screwed up and is just trying to pair the number down because he's not getting exp charming, or he is getting very slow exp chanting and at a high risk.<br>
<br>
The bad thing about a bard swarm is, only one mob (the charm) usually has hard aggro on the bard, if a (pick class) runs his quad or fear kite near the bard, all but the charm may aggro on the bypasser.<br>
<br>
Pets of any class have a tendancy to run and aggro swarms, the bard can try and fix this but usually fails and there is a ClusterF that may appear like the bard deliberatly trained someone.<br>
<br>
Not making excuses, but running at full speed, using the pan back view, not everything is easy to see or is as it appears on screen, when swarm kiting, I have pulled my swarm away from a seemingly unknowing runner only to have them 'disappear' and reappear somewhere else. I have also accidentally run someone over. But then, its been done to me by just about every other class (maybe not Clerics and Chanters).<br>
<br>
Bards usually stake an area, seemingly large, which they run their swarm around in, the number one cause of a zone threatening blowup is someone else running their pull or quad thru it, especially a pull. There is a very high aggro factor to a charm whopping on another mob, someone using a snare or other low damage/aggro pull will run by a charm battling mobs and their pull will stop and start whumping the bard or the charm and the puller starts oocing Ks, Ks! I have had my group of for in ME added to by at least three other pullers and what was a managble kite becomes a death run of 10 to 20 mobs to the zone. Only those watching from a distance find this amusing.<br>
<br>
Pick a forum, any class, and you can go there and find your class and most the others, bashed, because someone is envious of what u do well, or they have been abused either deservably or not by someone of that class.  I have people pull from my swarms all the time, usually it is 'to help' or an accident. Who cares? If theres plenty of mobs, just get sumore, if not, find another zone or live with it.<br>
<br>
Every forum gripes about being nerfed. Every one of them. And complains any upgrades were useless, and x class, who was overpowered before, is now even stronger. <br>
<br>
I thought a single group of wizards taking down a dragon was neat. Probably would have been nerfed at some point, but a few bad apples monopolizing the scales on some servers, and poof, there's an uproar about money grubbing wizards holding everyone else hostage.  <br>
<br>
Are there bad bards who abuse their gifts, oh yeah! Ditto for every other class.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deamereq>DeamerEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/1/02 2:18:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Swarm Kiting</span><hr size=1> Well, I happen to know for a fact there is a macro program used for swarm kiting.  There is no pet involved and you only need to watch your screen to make sure the program didn't crash on you(which it does quite often).  <br>
<br>
I know someone who does this in the Grey all the time.  There is rarely anyone in that area so, there is no one to /petition him even if they did figure out he wasn't 'at the wheel'.  <br>
<br>
Basically it just runs you around in a perfect circle and dots the shit out of everything in range.  Wanderers will eventually get caught in his 'trap'.  It takes a VERY long time to kill just one mob, but the fact that it's virtually risk free is why I don't encourage it.  <br>
<br>
My 3 highest (50-57) characters are beastlord, warrior, and a cleric.  So, my opinion about being able to take down multiple mobs at the same time are....well you can probably guess. <br>

And swarm kiting is a WHOLE LOT OF XP at one time, maybe twice in a row if you're lucky, and then a WHOLE LOT OF DOWNTIME.

<br>
When my Druid twink was level 45, quadding the spirocs in Timorous Deep (Sharing the treehouse with a group and 1 other kiter). A bard comes in and starts swarm kiting under the birdhouse, basically took all the mobs from at least 9 players. There was nothing we could do at that point as he was /ooc ing.. If you touch any mobs that I've aggroed or damaged it's KSing that all mobs were a FFA. Response from us and the groups that were there was PNP and it stated that you may not Monopolize a spawn.<br>

The most inconsiderate 57th level bard you have ever seen was in ME.  I and 2 other wizards (and a druid)  alll in our 60s were near toiler hill and we each kept getting trained or a few of his mobs scraped off on us as he would selo's speed right through us to agro another mod.  It was insane.  At first we each though he just sucked as some bards do  (sorry, deal with it - there is a reason bards have a bad rep) at knowing how far away to stay from others when he swarm kited.<br>
<br>
While we all OOC'd our &quot;Yo dude back off/please dont train/please watch where you are going&quot; he actually got worse.  Even the lower level players just there for the goranga groups were getting killed.  It became a fight for our lives as he agroed the entire toiler area AND much of the sourrounding areas then brought them all back to the corner behind the hill and let em go at eachother.  Coming back over the hill every so often to agro any new pops right out from under us, training us if we were solo'ing or kiting anything that he wanted.<br>
<br>
On the one hand it was an impressive feat.<br>
On the other hand he was monopolizing 1/4 of an entire ZONE and training/killing players on purpose.<br>
<br>
I and the other wizards started talking.  It seems he had done this before and always left before a /report /petition brought anyone and everyone was sick of it (and him).  Well the druid and all us wizzies started gathering trap mobs.  Each of us pulled a train at the same time you would not believe and ran straight to the tip of the hill and we absconded at the last second settig a wall of mobs who would stick there for a few minutes.  It was breathtaking to see and amazing that it worked.<br>
<br>
We juuuust ran back in time to see him re-grouping his toilers and shoot over the hill.  His death was almost instant and the entire zone cheered when he started cussing. Now I am fully aware that I broke all sorts of rules, and that sony could get on me for what we did but I honestly feel this was warrented.<br>
<br>
A good bard, who knows his stuff is an awesome player and an increadible grouping partner, a bad bard or inconsiderate bard can ruin a camp through not undrestanding what happens in his wake.  An asshole Bard who is training EVERYONE on purpose can almost shut down a small zone entirely and cause a lot of deaths.  I feel no guilt at all.<br>
<br>
Oh and the next time a bard monopolizes the birds (as is clearly NOT supposed to be done)?  I suppose you COULD Just shoot your atols in the middle of the mobs and grab 4, start nuking and ignore him.   If everyone did that at the same time he'd get the message and 0 mobs to boot.  I suppose... heh Im not SAYING you SHOULD.... just that you could if you all acted together.<br>

With some of the better zones getting a bit crowded, swarm kiting can actually lower player faction a lot. The swarm kiting bard takes the mobs away from other people and that simply doesn't sit well. It's happened to me and I was not happy. <br>
<br>
And since you can't really claim a certain spot and the mobs for yourself, not much you can do, except try to either take them back of get in a pissing contest with the bard.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=132459"> Daamij 60 Sorcerer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dryfft>Dryfft</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1335<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/27/03 11:28:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=113>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Swarm Kiting</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Twas more interesting to watch another person in camp there, go log on their level 65 bard, pull the iskar master from the chessboard island, kite him to the birdhouse and let the swarm kiting bard hit him on accident (the bard who pulled the iskar warrior had a vial of swirling smoke). <br>
<br>
Needless to say, the swarm kiter died rather fast.<br>
