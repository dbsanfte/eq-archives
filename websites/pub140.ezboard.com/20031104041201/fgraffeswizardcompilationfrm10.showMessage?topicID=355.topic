This is unfortunate, as I think either wizards should get lower resist to all their spells (the Lure line is ok but they are such mana pigs as to be unusable), faster natural mana regen rates (like troll HP regen but for mana) or proportional damage (a spell that DD’s for say 30% no matter MOB level).   I don’t think any of these changes would make a wizard irreplacable, and clerics and chanters pretty much are already so spare me the spam about wanting to be Uber.  Useful is the goal (please see my post under Rants entitled “/feedback” for my views on class balance.<br>
<br>
 I’ll reserve judgment on this Teleportation direction until they implement their new “vision,” but I’d venture to say no one ever rolled up a wizard thinking “oh boy, isn’t it gonna be sweet when I can port people all over Norrath and the planes at will!”   This is pretty much akin to giving Mages weak pets (I know they are not but humor me) and then then Verant saying “we think there are two things mages do, summon pets and cast utility spells (coldstones, summoned weapons, etc.) .  We are going to beef up utility spells as we think this is where the class is headed.”  <br>
<br>
I think if druids never had ports, as should have been the case, maybe this ability would be something to get is in groups, but it isn’t the case so I’m afraid it’s pretty ho-hum.  Think about it, how many times have you heard the following: “Paying for TP to [Misty],[Lava],[Feerot]”?   Ever hear anyone say “Gee, can anyone TP me into the maze in Cazic?” Or when you do port someone, when they pop at the destination they immediately ask “do you know where the druid circle is from here?  I’m lost.”   Not to mention a “sow” either side of a port, and maybe a camo is always much appreciated.  We aren’t even close to druids at TP’ing.   IMHO Call of the Hero was so wizard, not mage, they should have named the spell “Screw Wizards.”<br>
<br>
So what would really define the wizard class IF all we had to work with was the teleportation concept?   Presuming we have seen the last of damage upgrades/refinement (I urge we have), I would like to see teleportation be made offensive rather than merely travel (ports) or defensive (evacs) only.    What do I mean?  OK, I haven’t thought this out yet, but something “like” any of the following:<br>
<br>
Set Teleport.  A wizard should be able to set one TP, much like an individual bind site, of their choice.  Make it subject to certain zone limitations (and yes, include the planes).  Make it expensive to cast (in mana, if not regents).  This would make us more useful in staging uber and planes-level battles.   Notice it’s not like CoH exactly, as the wizard needs to set the spot, return and port with the group members. <br>
<br>
Create Self Evac.  Have us able to imbue a single gem or item with a right-clickable personal evac.  Make it only function if the person is grouped with you (otherwise it’s just a money maker).  Make it no rent.    <br>
<br>
Teleport MOB#1.  Why not?   Don’t make it erase or reduce aggro, just TP one MOB far away in the same zone, enough to zone the party , get an evac or heal off.   Used with mez it eliminates an add you may never be ready for.<br>
<br>
Teleport MOB#2.  Set a TP point where you are fighting and be able to “port” a single, pissed off mob to the spot to fight it.   Make it visual/tight range castable only, but this would allow a wizard to scout a little ahead and be an effective puller in dense zones with high aggro radius.   <br>
<br>
General.  It also wouldn’t hurt to have us capable of setting multiple self bind affinities, have our evacs cast slightly faster than a druid’s (and/or more reliably), as being masters of something should mean you do it better. <br>
<br>
Note none of these are as imbalancing as returning a character to life with 90% experience or wiping aggro or speeding mana recovery.   None of these would make wizards irreplacable, but would make them wanted again maybe.   Any of these could be nerfed or worked with a bit to still render a useful class ability without destroying the mythical “balance.”    <br>

Let's face it, wizards are SUPPOSED to be good at gathering knowledge/knowing where things are, so as long as the mob is in range, being able to summon it to the wizard SHOULD be a spell we get.<br>

My fellow wizards and I have come up with a great idea for a spell that fits along our lines as the &quot;Masters of Transportation&quot;, according to Absor. This spell would make use of our translocate abilites to send people back to a bind point. We think it would make us very useful in groups if we could send NPCS back to their bind point, thus removing agro. This would be helpful in overpulls and make us true masters of teleporation of not just people (and none of us want to be a taxi). If this does not fit along with our description, please explain why. We would be willing to accept any limitations of this spell so that it would not be abused in any way. Basically it would restore a mob to his/her bind point, removing agro, and prevent the group from taking the kill. The spell could be resisted and not castable on higher level epic mobs, such as Lady Vox (example: it is clear that everyone is going to die so a wizard simply banishes her back to her bind point - I understand how this could be abused). We feel this spell would not add any new abilities that would unbalance us, and are willing to take any limitations on this spell so long as we get the ability. We can already translocate people, why not Npcs?<br>

Teleportation as a weapon makes no sense to me.  The idea of porting a mob to your location.  Has so many problems with it.  This spell would have such aggro on it that it would be pure suicide to cast.  Higher level (i.e post 50)  mobs can gate.  And this spell would aggro those mobs surrounding the mob after it gated upon casting.  Bringing all those mobs onto the wizard.  The idea of setting a teleport location to port the mobs to still does not take into account aggro.  &quot;Letting the wizard scout for a bit.&quot;  A wizard is not designed to scout.  If this spell is cast at one mob surrounded by two other mobs you will aggro those other mobs also.<br>
<br>
Wizard DD is so difficult to balance because VI set themself into a trap.  Since all the other classes have DD and DD spells &quot;stack&quot;.  You can not just increase the damage done without looking at the effect of 6 wizards in one group.  I know a 6 wizard group happens less than an orc pawn surviving a week in Crushbone, it is still possible.  Then you also have to look at the possiblity of wizards KSing.  Increased damage has too many pitfalls.  They will take our spells in a different route. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uniudar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niudar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/8/01 2:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yawn</span><hr size=1> When I started the Wizard Class so long ago I was under the impresstion that we would always outdamage anyone but that is no longer true. . the other day i found out druids get a biger DD for less mana at 56 and what do we get 658DD's all the way to 60. .sure we got lure spells but they dont deal near enough damage for the mana cost, Our epic *POS* and other stuff that gives us something witht he effect of a DD are too damn rare unlike other classes. . druids got there ES arms. . shammys got there bracer. . and now that VI wont give us our damage they giveing us the masters of TPin crap i feel yet again i am gettin shafted. . all of the time i spent playing a wizard is a waste. . gusse i should make a warrior that way i can feel realy wanted in a group unlike ohh only a wizard is lfg gusse we are forced to take him crap.

Teleport mob#1 sounds good to me. Teleport mob#2 however is just too complicated with too many obvious abuses. Rather i'd like to see Teleport mob #2 changed into a higher level upgrade of #1 which would clear agro. These spells would obviously need a high recast to balance them (45 to 60 sec) but could be an interesting addition to the wizard's arsenal.<br>

RESPONSE: <br>
<br>
First, let me school you a bit on responding courteously to someone’s post.  First, attack an argument as aggressively as you want, but never the person making the argument.  In formal debating it’s called an “ad hominem” attack, and it isn’t allowed.   <br>
<br>
My point was that Verant, by the most recent statement THEY made regarding the wizard class, is clearly going to focus more on the wizard’s teleportation abilities than their DD.   My opinion only, but I wouldn’t hold my breath that Verant is going to make any substantive changes to our damage capabilities from here on out.   Sure, they may be tinkered a bit, with but they won’t meaningfully change.   Again it’s just my opinion, but it’s supported by Verant’s recent statement and their past practice.  As to what your “guarntee” is supported by, I confess I’m utterly at a loss. <br>
<br>
Also, you should have been able to figure out that I wasn’t agreeing with Verant’s concentration on teleportation at the expense of DD.  In fact, I believe it’s a ripoff, and I said as much in my post.   HOWEVER, being realistic, I’m trying to put down ideas that work given that’s where THEY (and our class) seem to be heading.  I think working creatively with ports could make us more group-worthy.  Giving us more destinations isn’t going to do anything for us.  Traditional travel ports are sometimes a necessity (to get to certain planes) but are more often a luxury item before, or after, a raid.  I don’t know about you, but I want to have fun in a raid and contribute, not just be a designated driver.   <br>

<br>
RESPONSE:<br>
<br>
You say it makes no sense but then go on to talk about aggro.  Aggro is coded.  Verant has, and could, reprogram aggro (witness a few patches ago they tinkered with chanter and cleric aggro).  Also, as you point out, many times MOBs “gate” back to their spawns.  Sometimes this is not by design but just through weak coding (e.g., level 40’s spirocs in Timorous Deep, when severely wounded, will “gate” back to their spawn points).  Theoretically these MOBs are about as aggro as they can be when they gate, it’s just that they lack the health to do anything about it.  They do not aggro nearby full HP MOBs, however, and there is no reason to assume this couldn’t be programmed into the spells I suggest. <br>
<br>
As for your assertion that a “wizard is not designed to scout”, I heartily disagree.  With our sight spells and powers of invisibility, we make excellent scouts.  I have often scouted an area for my party.  This is not to say a wizard needs to pull, but I don’t think the idea of porting MOBs is inherently “un”-wizard.   Someone else suggested Call of The Hero is a summoning spell.  Whatever.  You could make the argument that our ports are summons of a kind, and an Eye of Zom is a summoning as well.  I don’t think we need to get hung up on the semantics of a fantasy game world.  Point one is “can it be programmed?”  Point two is “would it be more fun for wizards?”   I say “should be” and “would be.”<br>

RESPONSE:<br>
<br>
For the most part, I have to say “huh?” to this paragraph.  If you are reading this, please give it another try.  I simply cannot boil it down to an actual point.  If your point is that Verant is resistant to changing our DD because of KSing potential, that’s pretty weak.  KS’ing worked at level 15 in North Ro Derv camps, it’s quite another matter to KS in Sebilis.  Besides, KS’ing a summoning MOB is pretty well near suicide.  Your second point (I’m guessing here) about the fabled “6 wizard group” being unstoppable is pretty weak as well.  I doubt you can even find 6 wizards willing to group at any time on any server.   If Verant simply adds a few more destinations to our port list there won’t be 6 wizards playing on 20 servers.<br>

I still think this is the type of creativity Verant should be using to make their changes.  Grouping is about battle, and without changes to our class that serve our group’s effectiveness IN battle, wizards will become merely the toll collectors of Norrath.   <br>

as for the agro, i dunno bout u but its probly gonna be bout the same as chain nuking a few times when a mobs at 70% or so. sure ull get whacked or summoned then whacked but if ur tanks are good tanks they will be able to get the mob off you, just dont sit down any time soon<br>
<br>
as for summoning a mob from its bind point to u, and agroing others, well yeah, but hell just send a drood to harmony them, or pick a mob thats not shaking hands with his best friends. its not really hard to figure out what to do<br>
<br>
and personally, i have tried to ks in sebilis, karnors and a few other high lvl zones, its not really possible if u manage to nuke hard enough to get enough of the kill u will die loosing any xp gain and alot more<br>
they have nerfed casting dmg vs melee dmg   melee dmg counts ALOT more for a kill than DD, a grp with 2-3 tanks will take a kill from a grp with 3 wizards chain nuking no resists, also tested in sebilis. out of 10 kills the wizard grp got 1 and lost one member for doing so<br>
<br>
im usually a pescimist to the core of my black deranged wizard heart, but i am hoping desperately verant will do something, GOOD, for wizards dd, i dont care if mages get it to i dont care if necros get it, AS LONG AS IM WANTED FOR A GROUP <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nezander>Nezander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/8/01 7:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Offensive porting</span><hr size=1> I have to say that I agree with Covenant here 100%.

Sadly, based on Graffe's news message, I think my assessment of the end of the &quot;damage&quot; adjustments is probably more right than wrong.  While I don't expect offensive porting necessarily, at least they are addressing our low &quot;usefulness&quot; quotient.<br>
<br>
Even if the adjustments are favorable, I guess I'm still a bit frustrated that the class has been so radically reconceived.  We've come a long way from the physically weak, scrawny beings of immense magical prowess we were advertized to be.  Based on the old D&amp;D wizard model (which let's face it, was the Verant blueprint for EQ), intelligence casters all represent fragments of that class.   Verant just separated out the schools of magic any SSI wizard could have access to and created necros, enchanters, magicians and wizards therefrom.<br>
<br>
Who would have thought the EQ wizard would ultimately be built upon the old &quot;Dimension Door&quot; spell?<br>
<br>
I think this change better be good.  Damn good if not semi-uber.  If not damage it better be 75% as good as clarity, mez or rez.  Of course it won't be, but is should be.  We've walked the walk.<br>

<br>
Cov you raked me over the coals for stating it was obvious that you did not think your ideas through.  Since you are so found of quotes here is one for you.<br>
<br>
Cov stated:<br>
&quot;So what would really define the wizard class IF all we had to work with was the teleportation concept? Presuming we have seen the last of damage upgrades/refinement (I urge we have), I would like to see teleportation be made offensive rather than merely travel (ports) or defensive (evacs) only. What do I mean? OK, I haven’t thought this out yet, but something “like” any of the following:&quot;<br>
<br>
I appolgize for agreeing with you.<br>
<br>
The idea that teleportation can be offensive is illogical.  With the new teleportation the wizards have become the merchant navys of Norath.  Meaning all we do is ship &quot;merchandise&quot; across the world.  As of Thursday Graffe stated that VI is working on making wizards more group friendly, without increasing damage.  Thats what I was stating in my &quot;DD&quot; paragraph.  <br>
<br>
We are fighting for the same thing.  But we are apporaching it from two different sides.  I would like to see the wizards do more damage, have teleports to all the zones.  But I don't see it happening.  I see VI coming up with new ideas that many of us have not even thought of yet.  For all we know at this point the information leaked out to Graffe could mean that we are getting a Cha buff.  I honestly don't believe VI knows what wizards need to become useful.  Take these new Trans.  Why did we not get a Trans to WC, that is my biggest request.<br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucovenantu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Covenant U</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/14/01 10:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teleportation As Offense</span><hr size=1> Again, this isn't what I wanted (creative teleports) but damage is a dead-end with Verant and up until today they made porting sound to be the &quot;direction&quot; the class was headed in.<br>
<br>
Simple math: port related changes = increased group effectiveness.  I simply tried to bridge the gap,  suggesting a way they could use ports to increase our desirability for groups.   <br>
<br>
The game is filled with illogical things.  For instance, what the hell does enchanting have to do with speeding my mana recovery?  There is nothing inherently &quot;enchanting&quot; about that (enchanting metals and weapons and screwing with NPC's minds), yet if clarity never existed and someone suggested one class get such a line of spells it would be viewed as preposterous and unbalancing.  Or bards, why can they play a fucking instrument while running full speed and you and I can't cast a single spell. Or why at level 50-whatever we get some crappy summoned sword with 60 HPs?  I mean WHAT?  Either we summon or we don't. It's like they had a spell to fill and thought &quot;gee, anything else would be useful or open up a canof worms, so let's just put in another toy spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could go on and on. <br>
<br>
So I have no grip on why this is so illogical to you.  It's a game thought up by people like you and me, with pretty unclear and illogical rules.  It's also a software program too, with kludges and quick fixes galore.  I couldn't care less what they do, I just wish they'd do it.  And quickly, I think we're all losing patience.  The lastest quote on the main board is in keeping with all the smug pretension that VI is famous for.  <br>
<br>
No offense meant to you, I just think my ideas are as relevant given what they said as many others.  You clearly have a right to disagree.<br>

and as for the inconsistencies, verant has more holes in their story than a swiss cheese block in the chitari home city. they cant make anything &quot;seem&quot; right even for fantasy. <br>
