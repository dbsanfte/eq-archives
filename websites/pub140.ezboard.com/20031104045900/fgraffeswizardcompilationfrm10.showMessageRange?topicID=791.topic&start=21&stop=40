I would like to think that I give the players around me a more accurate perception of what a wizard can actually offer a group.  I do think that that is really the main problem in the game; that the perception of class X has little value.<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with the person that said that its NOT ok for a wizard to be OOM after killing a few mobs fast.  Your arguement to support this was that these situations don't happen very often.  I have a couple of responses to this.<br>
<br>
First, even if you don't get into the situations where a quite mob kill is required very often, in the rare times it does happen and your wizard comes through to save the group, you have shown your value.  If that 1 pull out of 100 goes bad and you save your group from a CR, thats well worth it.<br>
<br>
Second, if you are finding that your group is never getting into those situations, your group is not performing to its maximum potential.  I do realize that many players would rather just stare at their screen and take as little risk as possible but the fact remains, your group won't be doing as much as it could.  Quite simply you can handle situations with a wizard than without. For many people, myself especially, taking on these situations is where the fun is at and I think it seperates the mice from the men.<br>
<br>
So my advice is to get your group to learn how to survive these situations and perhaps the perception of wizards will begin to change.  I know I have never had a problem with wizard perception with anyone that I have played with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siryakk>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/15/02 11:23 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perception</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First, even if you don't get into the situations where a quite mob kill is required very often, in the rare times it does happen and your wizard comes through to save the group, you have shown your value.

<br>
Here is a question.  If that wizard was doing 50% more damage per hour, dropping mobs faster, having higher mana on the other casters, would that 1 in 100 bad pull become just another pull?<br>
<br>
Wizard fast damage isn't fast enough.  How long does it take for a wizard to burn down a L 60 creature -- 20 to 30 seconds?  A pull where people are alive for 20 to 30 seconds after things go bad isn't a bad pull.<br>
<br>
Evac is a better tool in that situation, if things are really bad -- it only takes 8 seconds for evac to work.  And a pull where nobody dies in 8 seconds is also not that bad of a pull.<br>
<br>
Heck, most PoP mobs can't be taken down with a manaburn, let alone normal chain nuking.  How often do you manaburn in an xp group?<br>
<br>
Make manaburn more usable, and then you have an arguement.  Ie, how about a manaburn that doesn't use your mana, just does damage based on how much mana you have?  Or, a manaburn that does damage based on your mana capacity, irregardness of your current mana level, then drains your mana?<br>
<br>
Then, you could burn down 1 mob every 2 hours, saving the party, and at the same time mantain a decent DPS over the rest of the 2 hours.<br>

<br>
the wizard spires were great places to sit and socialize with other wizards who are there medding and healing back up also after getting a gate off from zone wherever<br>
<br>
the role of being the public transit for the world of norrath was an invaluable social base for us.. most of the groups and raids i've experienced in this game has come from this base<br>
<br>
with the add of scions and the PoK books the effect on the social and support base of the wizard class is much akin to your major city's mass transit organization going bankrupt because sony just built a super highway through your main service area <br>
<br>
this of course lessens your support and opportunities wich as a by product puts more relience on partnering or soloing and the such wich leads to the other topics involving availability of wizard content and spell discussions on damage and such that were created for the grouping wizard in the first place<br>
<br>
wizards are fine in groups.. have been if you play em right.. it's more of a loss of support and social structure wich directly affects experience group support and opportunity wich affects other's that is the root of the wizard groupability issues IMO<br>

People want to be able to SOLO better. hmmm then why the hell would you want to play an ONLINE game. Getting in groups is dependant on making friends that know you and your style of play. I'm 60 and have been for a few months now and have NEVER soloed, never quadded. How many wizards can say that? Not many cause most are complaining about not getting groups and wanting better ways to solo. If you want to solo, play a console game that puts you in front of a television with no interaction with anyone else. If you want to group, get out and meet someone else in the game instead of staying to yourself and quadding anything that moves.<br>
  My regular group consists of a warrior, chanter, rogue, druid, wizard (me), and another friend that wants to come along (usually a shaman, another wiz, monk, cleric, or another warrior). Oh yeah, a dire charmed mob is usually helping us also <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We all aren't the mighty level of 65, but we kill pretty damn fast and we enjoy the experience of being grouped.

read it again<br>
<br>
i'm saying the basic socialization and opportunty base for wizards has been seriously undermined<br>
<br>
no groups = more solo / partner = more need for solo based spells<br>
<br>
it's cause and effect<br>
<br>
and yes.. i can say i didn't solo to 60, and yes.. i can say i don't quad for exp as i have pointed out in other posts here<br>
<br>
unfortunetly your group of regular friends generally end up joining guilds that have a policy of isolationism so there just went your friends list at least<br>
<br>
imagine being a new wizard coming up through the ranks now<br>
<br>
you have no social contact anymore via transit system<br>
exp nerf have left many zones we used to exp in empty<br>
<br>
just to name a couple<br>
<br>
it's a much different world than when we came up in and not friendly to the LFG wizard.. hence once again the solo aspect wich then leads into content availability wich leads into...  well you get the idea<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> sony needs to change it's policy and provide more solo ability to wizards or better access to our higher nooks.. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What does solo ability have to do with better nukes? Wouldn't it make more sense to replace better nukes with more group friendly spells?<br>
<br>
Verant has already stated that balancing involves 3 things. A) Soloing B) Grouping C) Raiding. The trick is, if you increase a wizard's power in one field then you also increase our power in yet another. <br>
<br>
Giving a wizard better solo abilities such as stronger roots in order to root nuke, higher mana regen, more efficient nukes, well that also rolls over into grouping <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raiding better b/c you can root park easier, nuke more often, and again nuke more often.<br>
<br>
If they give us easier access to our better nukes then theres yet another problem, b/c not only do you increase raiding dramatically our grouping situation becomes a whole lot easier, and not only that soloing is now even easier with our better nukes.<br>
<br>
So your statement of <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> sony needs to change it's policy and provide more solo ability to wizards or better access to our higher nooks.. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> cannot be done. It is makes us too powerful in all 3 areas of what the designers see as most important parts of balancing.<br>

<br>
and no.. i'm thinking of every wizard.. not just those in the same guild who only concentrate on the 60+ aspect of the game<br>
<br>
common.. the light blue nerf alone is harsh.. think back a couple years and erase all the people and groups and raids you got into because of porting<br>
<br>
erase alot of the people you grouped with in exp zones cause those people just arn't there anymore<br>
<br>
i personally can remember like 50 or 30 when the majority of game content that i could do as a wizard then when there just were no groups was light blues<br>
<br>
that's all gone<br>
<br>
it's a different game than it was.. those aspects you mention from sony need to be looked at again because the group/social base we used then to get where we are and what we have just isn't like it used to be.. i can't imagine in today's eq starting a wizard and going at it now<br>
<br>
what is already ingame isn't unbalanced.. if it was it wouldn't be there to begin with for the wizard class and not all of it is for balance like you say but more for the policy of keeping that monthy subscription fee coming from ultra rare evercamp<br>

<br>
we've shot the bigger, more efficient nukes horse in the head 100 times.<br>
<br>
lets consider what they did for clerics, when clerics were in the same rut we're in.<br>
<br>
how about another self buff, short duration, low mana cost, overwrites epic, cabbage, and about any other minor mana regen buffs outside of the enchanter clarity/kei line.<br>
<br>
this buff would add some mad AC (like 600 :P ), some mad haste (max), and some mad proc (200+ damage, frequent, and stun/interrupt), on top of a standing mana regen to make up for meleeing.<br>
<br>
also, a summon flaming sword, one thats wieldable, not the pet. statistically, 1hb, with stats comparable to the clerics hammer.  this too could proc.  maybe the buff procs the stun/interrupt, like clerics got bash, and the summoned sword proc's for 200+, better yet, it taps mana, that would be sweet<br>
<br>
no way others couldnt perceive our involvment and contribution in groups, then. <br>
<br>
obviously, we'd not be able to solo this way any more effectively than we already do, and for raids, we'd be more effective on the main encounters just nuking.<br>

With 110 + all i get are reposes from mobs and I hit almost null.<br>

<br>
um.. 950 hp's buffed up, 533 ac buffed up.. making us anytype of melee isn't even viable.. my sk in his 20's had better hp/ac than my 60 wiz<br>
<br>
i don't champion new larger nooks.. these spells are already ingame.. i'm just pointing out that the erosion of our social base and limitation of our ability to locate and find groups is prolly the driving factor of why people think we need bigger nooks.. because we are more dependant on solo now than we ever have been before<br>
<br>
these spells are already ingame.. just make them more available is all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Only when tanking or getting hit by ripostes. So, there is no need to up our ac or hp.... just up our 1hb and 2hb to more respectable levels and give us a proccing hammer or dagger. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harvestofsouls>Harvest of Souls</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/02 5:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We always find away</span><hr size=1> i die in like 11 melee hits.. up close to a mob is not where i want to be even if i did someday get 1hb over very bad skill<br>
