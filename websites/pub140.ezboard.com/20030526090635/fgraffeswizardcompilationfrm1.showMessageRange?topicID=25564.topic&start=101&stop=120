<br>
While I agree it was not originally intended, I think VI's goals changed when DAoC was launched. I think KEI being available for low levels is now intentional.<br>
<br>
My evidence is only indirect - the lack of a nerf in 2 years and the introduction of MGB with the same problem. While I perfectly accept that they can take an inordinate period of time to fix old bugs I would have at least expected them to design MGB with this bug in mind.<br>
<br>
I am never suprised when they fix things that are overly powerful though as KEI on a lvl 1 obviously is; I was not really suprised when they fixed horses in the old models (though I objected to the method they used) and I was not suprised when they stopped affliction haste working on charm/slow/malo etc (both after a long period).<br>
<br>
I would also not be suprised if they stopped kei on low levels though I think they would be very brave .. they'd lose many more customers than they'd gain and you'd have all the usual complaints about SoE 'only wanting people to play longer so they get more money' and 'the ubers have taken advantage and now the casuals get hurt' yadda yadda. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=niinjaturtle>niinjaturtle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 6:34:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wowexpress.com/dreadscale/kan2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> not exploit<br>

<br>
I am of two thoughts on this.  In many ways it is too powerful, but only in theory.  A solo caster, still has the down time like a melee as even with KEI you get hit.  So the down time at the lowest levels then becomes equal to melee is based on HP regen.<br>
<br>
Mid-level (abt 15 to 40 ish) it changes the dynamics of the game just a bit.<br>
<br>
Now when compared to a twink melee with an insane AC, and yes 2k HPs without Aego ( it is not that hard to do)  KEI on the casters then brings some balance back to the game.  <br>
<br>
With unlimited mana from KEI at these levels means you really do not learn mana management, but lets be honest here, mana management is not a big deal anymore.  <br>
<br>
THe more important thing people learn is aggro management, since essentially you can nuke/ heal non stop with the mana regen unless you draw aggro.  <br>
<br>
I for one use KEI on my alt casters since they cannot be twinked real easy at lower levels.  My melee alt, is a Rallos Zek worshipping ogre,  by level 25 he had over 2K HPs with his gear.  Hell at lvl 10 he had well over 1k HPs.  <br>
<br>
TO ME ALL KEI IS ANOTHER FORM OF TWINKING A CHARACTER. <br>
<br>
For this issue I am not going to say or even claim to know what VI and now Sony ever intended with the level restriction on buffs, being able to cast group buffs on lower level players.  Once they come out and say it then fine I will abide by whatever they state.  Until such time I will continue to use KEI on my baby casters.<br>

Contrast that with 18 months after the group buff bug being introduced then adding the MGB option too. And we are now 18 months further on again. I'm not denying SoE do take a long time to address bugs sometimes, but I still say 3 years with no nerf is about as strong a form of indirect proof as you can get, *especially* when you consider SoE much more quickly nerfs bugs that benefit a player than one that dont.<br>

As it stands, he is calling fair play with unbalanced abilities exploits under the definition.  Class and PvE balance is Verant's responsibility, and no player is cheating by using the abilities given and intended for her to have.  In contrast, when we talk about &quot;what is exploiting&quot; we really mean &quot;what actions can you take that are cheating, and how do we know that they are cheating?&quot;<br>

In my opinion, all of these are cases where someone has an unfair advantage as a result of something other than cheating.  If you are playing the game fairly, but you have better friends, better gear, or are on the good side of a poor verant balancing decision, you are not cheating.  <br>
<br>
My previous claim went unchallenged, so I assume we all agree that the point of this is to determine what actions are &quot;cheats&quot; when we try to determine what is an exploit.<br>
<br>

Not an exploit unless you are twinking. If you are twinking it is an exploit. However there are limits now to prevent the most extreme cases of this, and in my experience the advantages aren't quite as big as people seem to think. In any case it is a very non-serious exploit.<br>
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Let's consider two warriors.  <br>
<br>
Hanz is a level 20 barbarian.  He has worked hard for his banded armor, +2 agility earrings, and he has completed a langsaxe quest and purchased a centi shortsword.  He's doing okay, when he can get a healer and maybe a few others to group up, and they tear up mammoths, or smething.<br>
<br>
Franz is a level 20 barbarian.  He wears a fungi tunic, RBB haste, he has some awesome weapons which I forget the name of, and a stack of crimson potions.  He started his character recently, and is passing through on his way to solo in permafrost.<br>
<br>
Franz has an unfair advantage; he met this chick at the DQ who is really cute and when she heard he played eq, she set him up so they can play together, as soon as he levels up some.  He has better gear.  He intends to use it.  The developers never intended for a level 20 warrior to have that gear.<br>
<br>
check, check, check - definition matches - definition is wrong.<br>
<br>
Franz is not CHEATING.  Okay, so he has better friends than you do, that's not fair, tough.  EQ and life are simply not fair.  Unfair is not the same as cheating, and the whole point of the discussion was to define what is cheating.  It seems that the &quot;unfair&quot; test in the definition is failing us, here.<br>
<br>
I hope we all can agree that if an act of playing by the rules is never an exploit, in the sense of the word that we are trying to define.<br>
<br>
(ps: All those &quot;the act of&quot; phrases are in there to please Goladus's grammatical sensibilities, and to make clear what I mean when I freely interchange the noun and verb.)<br>
<br>
(pps: I have proposed measures that would balance the playing field between Hanz and Franz, but I would never agree that Franz is cheating, nor would I consider it acceptable to start banning people who twink.)<br>

I would think is should be.  As has been said I think we are confusing something that is merely unbalanced and something that is exploitative.  <br>
<br>
For instance how is just sitting in the Nexus when an MGB KEI goes off an exploit?  I guess you could stand and run screaming towards the south tunnel so as not to be in violation.  What if you are akf?  <br>
<br>
Another example.  I was afk with my level 6 wizard in PoK and I came back to find someone had cast Temperence on me (800 hp plus ? ac buff).  I was one happy wizard!  I used it to hunt down yellows solo in Shadeweaver's Thicket - was I exploiting or was the guy who cast it exploiting?  I can guarantee that having 800-odd hps at level 6 is unnatural.<br>
<br>
I suppose in both instances the 'right' thing to do would have been to avert my eyes and click that offending buff off so you would not be in violation.  But honestly how many would click off KEI or Aego or something like that voluntarily?  I bet only a small minority could do that when push comes to shove.  And frankly they shouldn't have to - its Sony's responsability to make sure such unbalancing things can't happen imho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12279<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 7:44:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=114>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> The vast majority of people under 45 seek out an enchanter and pay them money to buff them and have to drop their groups to do so.<br>

<br>
Based on your explanation of the scenario, Franz IS exploiting and the definition is right.  Why?  Because you describe the advantage as unfair.  Just because someone has an advantage doesn't make it an unfair advantage.  Having friends is not in itself an unfair advantage, having friends that give you gear is not something that was unintended.  However being able to equip yourself with high level gear at a low level is also not intended.  So how is this dealt with?<br>
<br>
1.  Abilities are limited by level.  A hill giant will smush a level 20 twink almost as fast as he'd squish a level 20 non-twink, because defense skill is limited.<br>
<br>
2.  Most of the really powerful items now have recommended or required levels on them, preventing their use at lower levels.  Thus one can suggest that items that are currently not restricted do not generally grant an unfair advantage.  Any advantage gained through twinking is a fair advantage.  Personally I think giving equipment to alts is a mild exploit, but most other means of obtaining high level equipment at low levels is an intended part of the game... to an extent, an extent which is enforced with in-game rules.  The Fungi Tunic is probably the most extreme example.  At worst, it's a grandfathered item that really should have a required level on it, but they don't add because they're not totally evil.<br>
<br>
The difference between high level buffs and item twinking is that the level restriction on items works.  The restriction on buffs does not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nicolheartsbane>Nicol Heartsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 949<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 10:28:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=116>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.hiwaay.net/~kostrom/erudite.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> Goladus: &quot;Based on your explanation of the scenario, Franz IS exploiting and the definition is right. Why? Because ...&quot;  and here you describe how it is an unintended and unfair advantage, which is how we tentatively defined it.<br>
<br>
Dude ... we postulated a tentative definition and now we're examining whether the definition works, or at least that was what I was doing all along.  It comes up with the wrong conclusion; consequently, it does not work.  You cannot say &quot;Oh, but the definition is right because it says that is an exploit, and it is according to the definition!&quot;  That is circular logic.  I already covered showing that the definition says that is an exploit, so you don't have to go through that again.  The problem is that it is not, therefore the definition is wrong.<br>
<br>
The point I just made is that your working definition would support the banning of any players who benefit from poor balancing decisions on the part of Verant staff.  It must be modified to account for the difference between cheating and not cheating.  If you can't make these small adjustments when the definition is shown to be in error, then ... I guess you will keep repeating the same mistakes.<br>
<br>
The actual line from the rules of conduct does account for this important distinction:<br>
<br>
12. You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game &quot;/bug&quot; command or via the eqtesting@soe.sony.com email address.<br>
<br>
Our use of &quot;exploit&quot; is slang shorthand for, as Verant puts it, exploiting a bug for unnatural or unintended benefits.  As stated there, 'exploit' is a simple English word, correctly used, which means &quot;to take advantage of,&quot; with pejorative connotation.  Obviously, this says &quot;DON'T CHEAT.&quot;  <br>
<br>
If we come up with a definition of exploit that differs, then either it is WRONG or you are making up words for something completely off topic and irrelevant, and you might as well call it gimboling, in honor of Lewis Caroll.<br>
<br>
You are gimboling if you purposefully arrange to benefit from an unintended situation!  I'm sure we can all agree that gimbolers will reach higher levels faster without ever learning how to play skillfully, and I would hesitate to group with them;  However, they're not going to get their accounts suspended for gimboling, because neither the EULA nor the rules of conduct place any prohibitions against gimboling.<br>
<br>
Of course, we all want Verant to take actions to maintain game balance, but a point I must stick to is that game balance discussions are not the same as discussions about cheating/exploiting, even if they may overlap in specific cases.<br>
<br>

<br>
Rather than having a spell check it's recipient, it checks it's target.  On a single target spell, this is the same thing, but on a group spell, it needs to be treated as 6 buffs being cast at once.  It should bounce off those not of the correct level, and stick to those that are.<br>
<br>
Basically, the check should happen when it tries to go into your buff box, not when you try to cast it.  Currently the logic says &quot;ok, target is greater than 45, allow the cast&quot;.  Better logic would say &quot;Ok, I'm trying to recieve a buff that's too high, reject it.&quot;<br>
<br>
While many of you may hate Anarchy Online, their spell (nano) system rocks.<br>
--You must have sufficent skill (not level) to cast most spells.<br>
--You can buff your casting skills and thereby use more powerfull spells.<br>
--Buffs take up storage space on the character, Higher level buffs take more of this space.  Gear, which requires skill level to equip, can modify how much of this storage space you have.<br>
--Buff partical effects are persistant... every few seconds a buff is chosen randomly, and the effect for it is displayed.  My personal pet peeve in EQ is that I should be able to tell before I hit something that it's bristling with spikes or covered in flames....<br>
--Buffs look at the recipient. If one person lacks the NCU or in a few cases level for a group buff, it bounces off that person, and sticks to everyone else<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope Sony is paying attention to it's competition as it develops EQ 2.  DAOC and AO in particular have a great many gameplay features that blow EQ away.  One thing I love about AO, I must mention in passing... Their pet pathing made EQ's look pristine and logical, in a recent patch they actually fixed it.  They didn't do this with a crappy spell like Summon Companion or making it warp or something else equally hackish... they fixed it with AI.  If a pet encounters an obstacle in it's path, it attempts to JUMP over it, and if that don't work, it goes AROUND it, OMG OMG....  It's thinking like this that will, with some polishing on their network code and a few other tweaks, send companies like Funcom to the top over Sony if Sony continues in the same vein that it has shown with EQ.<br>

But there are two different opinions:<br>
<br>
1.  Unfair advantage<br>
2.  Unintended glitch in the game.<br>
<br>
Both have to be true for it to be an exploit.  I will agree that a third point:  That the player is cheating, is necessary if you are defining the term exploit as a verb.<br>
<br>
Whether or not something is an unfair advantage will no doubt be disputed, and thus whether or not something is an exploit will be disputed too.  However, the definition helps us to break a situation it down into simpler components and analyze each one individually.  Instead of arguing broadly about whether or not is an exploit, we can break it down into an argument about whether or not it is unfair and unintended.<br>
<br>
There is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> relationship between unfair and unintended, but I believe it is indirect enough so as not to be &quot;circular logic.&quot;  The game will never be totally fair, and they &quot;intend&quot; a ceritan degree of unfairness.  However I don't think it's reasonable to think that they intend &quot;incredible&quot; or &quot;gross&quot; unfairness, and any situation that can successfully be argued as grossly unfair will also likely suggest that the situation was also not intended and is thus an exploit.  In contrast an extreme, unintended bug won't necessarily be unfair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1709<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/03 1:56:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Based on your explanation of the scenario, Franz IS exploiting and the definition is right.

<br>
Unfair compared to what.  Just becase something is unfair dosn't make it an exploit.  Acording to in game laws and mechanics it is perfectly fair.  Acording to the other guy competing with said player for groups it is unfair.<br>
<br>
Saying that becase so and so has better then me is unfair is very libralistic and not an exploit.  Now if they had equipment on there character that was no drop fromone of the planes that that character can't go at there level and there character isn't some character thats been deleveled then yeah that would be cheating and exploiting.<br>
<br>
Now heres anouther twist, earlier I said that getting buffs on low level characters was an exploit but I'm going to change that and say that it Isn't an exploit becase it isn't a disiplined offence of in game mechanics.  BUT it should be an exploit becase its a work around.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I think our definition of what an exploit is should be any act that uses game mechanics to give the player an advantage over other players or NPC's <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">that can be considered grounds for disiplinary action by verant employess. </span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Example training, player uses the game mechanics of how mobs work to kill their competition.<br>
<br>
Now some exploits have allready been outlined for us not to do like training.  Others we are supposed to use common sence on.  If it is a borederline grounds for disciplinary action thing you will normaly be warned first by a guide/GM if they see you doing it. <br>
<br>
A lot of exploits fall in the using pathing to your advantage to get easy kills of mobs catagory.  Wich everyone who pays attention to things should know is an exploit, sence verant has taken disiplinary action against exploiters taking advantage of said things in the past.  If people don't know this they will learn as soon as someone reports it or cetches them doing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1166<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/03 2:35:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> It is worth pointing out that casting clarity or temperance on a level 8 has almost all of the game changing/breaking effects of casting kei or aego, that's a big reason why it's hard to see those as such an ebil exploit. It has a shorter duration sure, but I bet you if the grouping code had been fixed at Kunark you'd still be seeing people selling clarity in PoK given how quick it is for low levels to move around with books right now.<br>
<br>
With that in mind it would appear some here would really like buffs to have a built in 'recommended level' such that aego gave 25hp to a lvl 1, 50hp to a lvl 2, 250hp to a lvl 10 all the way up to 1100hp to a lvl 45+. I personally experienced the green/blue/yellow/red con armor system in DAoC and such and found it very dull. I'd argue arranging buffs like that too would sacrifice too much fun at the expense of some 'vision' but I accept people have very different views of twinking and such.  I'd much prefer a good item sink or decay system stopping the average low level getting overly powerful gear than level restricted stuff myself, but I know that couldnt be done in EQ.<br>
<br>
This board appears quite 'old school vision' in outlook but it is worth pointing out that this board and others like it are hugely underrepresentative of the player base as a whole though. SoE has to try to keep the unspoken masses happy too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25564.topic&start=141&stop=152>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=25564.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=25564.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=25564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=25564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25564.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25564.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
