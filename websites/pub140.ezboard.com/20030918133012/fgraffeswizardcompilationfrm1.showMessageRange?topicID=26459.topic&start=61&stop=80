<br>
From most people I talked to who are flagged for all these zones...the biggest gripe is they don't want their exp spots to turn into another KC.  Like someone mentioned in another post...I think a level requirement for the planes would actually be a good idea.  <br>
<br>
For people without the appropriate flags for the zone:<br>
<br>
Lvl 46+ for Tier 1<br>
Lvl 60+ for Tier 2<br>
Lvl 63+ for Tier 3<br>
<br>
If you have earned the flag for the zone through regular means (quest, killing the mob that gives you access to said zone) then the level requirement wouldnt pertain to you.<br>
<br>
I don't think that's too outrageous of an idea.  Tier 3 zones werent designed with a level 46 player in mind...so why should they have access to those planes?  <br>
<br>
I don't reallly exp all that much, so opening the planes up isnt a huge issue for me as far as exp spots being taken away goes. Regardless, it's almost a slap in the face to people who died over and over and over learning these mobs and getting flagged for the zones...I hardly doubt the &quot;reward&quot; will be worth the effort we put in to getting flagged for all these zones.   <br>
<br>
The only problem I can forsee with this that will involve me are people being where they are not supposed to be during the RZtW encounter.  But I thought of a semi-ok solution to that too.<br>
<br>
If a guild is doing the RZtW  script....as soon as the 2 triggers are killed, anyone not flagged for tactics (by quest or by killing Behemoth) and NOT in the raid that killed the triggers...should be given a 2 minute warning and ported out to PoTranq.  Also, people without the proper flags for PoTactics and not in the raid shouldnt be allowed to zone IN after the 2 triggers are killed....until the guild who triggered the event fails or succeeds.  <br>
<br>
Anyone with the appropriate flags can zone in and out as they please....such as it is now.  And you'll be less likely to hear &quot;Train to zone!&quot; when your raid is at zone in buffing up for the next wave.  <br>
<br>

Shouldn't have much to do with it.  Being lvl 46 or 63 or 65 does should not give you access to a flag zone, actually killing mobs or questing (hence the name EVERQUEST) should get you access.  I personally like the idea of flags and linear progression.  If you dont want to spend the time and effort to advance, then you don't.  Dumbing EQ down to the least common denominater is not the answer and that is all this patch is.  <br>
<br>
If you wanted a PoV/PoS flag, all you had to do was pass the trials.  BoT flag is not that hard either.  HoH quest is not exceptionally difficult and a family guild can do the PoNB flag pretty easily.  CoD flag is not tough to get and flags a whole group.  I think SoE's response to the whiner should have been &quot;You want more access, then suck it up and do the damn quest&quot;.  The only flags that i dont know a quest for is PoTactics/PoTorment.  I think most casual players could casually get by without those 2 zones.<br>

I think restricting the content in such a large percentage of an expansion was a silly idea to start with.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
The only thing restricting access is lack of teamwork, personal motivation, or both.  Large guilds can succeed in killing boss mobs that flag for access.  For members that miss the kills they can still advance by being piggy-backed in a raid.  For smaller guilds access is available through QUESTS.  IMO the only problem is that the quests don't give the complete flag, only access to the next tier.<br>
<br>
The only zones of the expansion &quot;restricted&quot; to any great degree are the elemental planes, because they are the END GAME zones.  I.E. There are no zones harder.  I.E. You should NOT be here unless you are capable of some serious butt-kicking, and even then you should expect a great deal of challenge and risk.<br>
<br>
Whether the quests to get flagged are too time consuming or difficult is another issue altogether, but there is no valid arguement that supports removing the flag requirements altogether.  Doing so introduces more problems than it solves, and devalues the entire plotline PoP has.<br>
<br>
Level has NOTHING to do with flags and zone keys.  Anyone can get level 65 and tons of AA without any effort other than time spent exping.  Also, if a lower level person faces the challenge of getting a flag and manages to gain access to a &quot;higher tier&quot; plane, so be it!  It isn't as if they will have much luck finding groups until they level up anyways.<br>
<br>
The best solution has already been illustrated.  KEEP THE FLAG REQUIREMENTS FOR ZONE ACCESS.  However, make all alternative flagging quest items DROPPABLE, and/or make higher tier bosses back-flag the character for previous flags needed to reach that boss.  Make the quests provide the same flag that killing a boss provides, so that the character can continue their advancement to further planes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heofmanyfals>HeOfManyFals</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 462<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/03 10:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The only thing restricting access is lack of teamwork, personal motivation, or both.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You call it personal motivation, I cal it recoignition that it's a goddamn game and there is sunlight outside my window.<br>
<br>
We aren't going to agree on this.  If seven months working on flags to have half a guild ready for HoH and a third of us ready for Tactics is your idea of fun, knock yourself out.<br>
<br>
PoP has done a wonderful job of chopping up just about everything other than raiding guilds.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravilicuslolf>Ravilicus LoLF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 665<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/03 10:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> I think we agree that PoP flagging and access is inadequetely implemented in it's current state, we differ on which solutions for this we feel are reasonable.<br>
<br>
I don't think access to all flag/key requiring zones should be given to those that don't work for those flags/keys.  There should be means to get all flags through quests that are balanced in difficulty with the other method of getting flagged- Success in challenging encounters.  I feel that successfully completing quests is every bit as noteworthy as participating in a raid and helping to slay a boss mob.  If the drops needed for these alternative quests were DROPPABLE, they would then become a natural part of the player economy and be used in trade just like all farmable items are.  Anyone with any motivation whatsoever could then progress, especially if they made the flag gained by the alternative quest identical to the flag gained by killing the bosses en masse.<br>
<br>
Yes, changes need to be made, but the combination of changes to alternative quests, lowering the requirements for &quot;piggy backing&quot; unflagged raiders in a raid, and back-flagging upon successfully defeating a higher tier boss all would provide a more reasonable and balanced solution than simply removing flag requirements altogether. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bangkirai>bangkirai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/03 10:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> I am in elemental planes.<br>

A lot of people i know, that are in the elementals feel the same way. They are just TOTALLY sick of this stupid flag system. So yes, a lot of people love it, that part of the flags are removed.<br>
<br>
This allows people finally to invite non-guilded friends into a nice xp group in other zones then pov/pon/pod/poi.<br>
This allows people to make 2 a 3 group &quot;raids&quot; and try some tougher zone.<br>
This means, no more guildtime wasted to reflag 1 to 3 new members in tier 1 zones.<br>
<br>
Nah, i really love the change. Beside, there are more then enough xp spots for everyone.<br>
For the people that think they get trained and such. Well if you are that good, then fight your way further in. There is no way, that you will be trained then, because a pickup group will hardly be able to get very far in higher pop zone.<br>

Kill 1 stage, move to the next, etc etc.   Good idea for multiple reasons, also bad for others.  However not allowing people who paid for content to not get access without being in leet uber guild A is a bad idea.  <br>
<br>
I think they could of used a better system for progression over the current one.  Worst part about it is as guilds in say Elemental planes have to recruit they now have to go back and reflag every app to get them to their level.  Instead they should of gave guild leaders for example the right to tag/flag people so they could join them instead of having to go back and reflag people.   Just 1 idea, im sure theres better ones.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andraelarcaneumrunner>Andrael Arcaneumrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Hand Of<BR>The Cabal (tm)!!!</span><br>  Posts: 1816<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/03 11:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(its a) game and there is sunlight outside my window.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
On the PvP servers, there's one guild on each server that controls all PoP content and ultimately, the end-game.  Seeing these zones open up is a nice first step in helping to even out the battlefield, but it's still not enough.  I think they should open up *all* zones on the PvP servers and get rid of *all* key quests.  Otherwise, you have a situation where one guild can effectively keep all other guilds out of higher-level planes while at the same time XPing in &quot;safe&quot; zones, getting much better equipment, and getting light years ahead of everyone else.<br>
<br>
To me, that's not really a level playing field.<br>
<br>
I don't care about more crowded zones--there are enough zones with enough content for me to play in regardless of whether or not BoT/PoV become the next Karnor's Castle.  And as levels &gt; all, I'll be able to find a group and focus on getting more powerful instead of having to go through the ridiculously time-consuming key quests.  For the vast majority of people who play Everquest (read: people who play less than 10 hours a day), the key quests are just frustrating barriers.<br>

I think it is ruins the whole reward system of PoP, which I rather liked. Yes my wizard is in an uber guild, but when I am not raiding, I like to play with my friends that are not flagged everywhere and whose gear is not top notch. I play my 55 warrior (only PoS/poV flagged) all the time and the change will certainly open up a lot of possibilities for my warrior and my friends, but I would rather have worked for it. Since the change to the quest keys we have been working on getting our core group keyed for everything.<br>
<br>
As Whiz had mentioned repeatedly, the quests to get into the higher planes are EASY. There is no farming greenies, you get exp at every single camp even if you are level 65. Since the upped the key piece drop rates, none of the quests is particularly a time sink.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, once the dust settles, the people who are getting all the free access to these zones are just going to have another thing to complain about. Just because you can get into a zone does not mean you will get a group, or even if you will be capable of hunting there. It doesn't take long to figure out that a group member is not pulling their weight, partucularly when the mobs hit for 700+ and have 40khp. The harder the zone gets, the less likely a group will just fill a spot with any random person. If you can't keep up with heals/nukes people will remember. If you are a mana sponge for the healers, people will remember. Darwinism takes over in the higher level zones, if you are not up to par with what people expect, you will soon find yourself not getting many group invites.<br>
<br>
In the end, I think this will hurt the mid-level people who have earned Tier 3 the most. It is their hunting area that is being opened to the masses. This will hardly affect the uber guilds other than making back flagging easier. <p><div align="center" class="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial">

I think the flagging system is a terrible, guild-breaking idea.<br>
<br>
I understand a lot of the concerns that have been put forth, but I have a different perspective on things.  I am the leader of a mid-tier, yet ambitious, guild on the Saryrn server.<br>
<br>
The problem that we face is that because of the massive XP and loot opportunities that present themselves in these PoP zones, a lot of people simply don't have the commitment to stay with their guilds and work hard to get these things done.  There is a huge temptation to simply ditch the people alongside whom they've fought for months, join quote-unquote &quot;uber&quot; guilds, and get coddled through the flagging process.<br>
<br>
I've got nothing against hard work, but it's not difficult to see how dangling the proverbial carrot in front of the noses of people who are struggling to advance might induce them to cave.  If the flags are removed on some of these zones, then, yes, you might have a couple people along on missions that probably couldn't survive the flagging process, and might not be as 'l33t as others.  However, you have a team, a guild, and a family there that has been able to remain intact.  You don't have friends being tempted to screw each other over for a better chance at phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Since this is, after all, a game, I can't see the logic in anything that tears people apart and causes less fun to be had.  If wanted that, I'd just hang out at my workplace a little longer every day.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my lowly perspective on the matter.

its good for the reason that it will open up some more possibilities for exp for off peak players who cant get into flagging groups.<br>
i do believe they should limit the flag removeal to just PoV , PoS , BoT and maybe one or two other zones , but if they are gonna do it like they plan then make certain zones have min level requirments.Also its a fairly good idea cause now maybe some of the prices on the stuff from some of these zones will come down.<br>
its a bad idea for a few reasons, its gonna be train central and there are gonna be alot of flashbacks of KC. And then your gonna have a sheet load of zerg squads that are full of morons.<br>
alot of the high end guild are gonna be peeved cause of the time and effort they put into flags and such and that understandable, but theres really only one thing you can do about it.... get over it<br>

This is WHY I want the Tower of Solusek Ro available for a key quest. For the mid-tier guilds to shoot for.<br>
<br>
And about the key quests?  Honestly. If you're complaining about them, have you actually tried them?  AND once you complete it, they flag the 5 people in the group with the person that finishes the quest!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Crypt of Decay: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Kill Larvae from 4 different areas in PoDisease. These larvae are easily kitable and don't summon, I believe they're around level 53.  Each larvae is a PH for it's respective camp's Named larvae, and if you're keeping the spawns down, the named will usually spawn within a couple hours.  Collect the 4 different Larvae Flesh from the named spawns of the different camps, then hand them in to that Ogre guy wandering arouns PoDisease, Grimror I believe his name is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Halls of Honor: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Collect a solid block of Perillium from PoInnovation (it's rather uncommon and no drop, I'm suggesting upping the drop rate and making it droppable), <br>
<br>
an Agony Mephit Heart from an Agony Mephit in PoNightmare (This is actually a rather tough piece to get, and I'd like it to be made droppable.  In addition, removing the ability to see invis from the surrounding Slarghilugs and Hobgoblins would allow the Mephit caves to be a more common hunting ground)<br>
<br>
A Crystalline Spider Brain from PoValor. I've seen this drop many times in exp groups that are hunting in the upper wasteland.  Not a hard piece to get, and the exp is great. I think this piece can remain no-drop.<br>
<br>
Turn these things into some guy in PoV with a flask of water, and you get a box of souls. Now go to PoJustice and wander around looking for Tormented Souls. there's 3 of them.  They're level 53 or something so probably a bit tough to solo, but not hard to round up a few friends and take out.  Kill them and a Soldier of Marr should spawn.  Give him your box and he'll return it with his soul inside.  Do the other two Soldier of Marr the same way, and you now have 6 people keyed for Halls of Honor.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Plane of Tactics: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> In the Desert in Plane of Storms near the giant encampment, kill everything in sight.  Good exp, and the scorpions drop Fluted Scorpion Stingers. quite decent range items.  Doing so gets more Diaku Raiders to spawn.  These Diaku Raiders drop a Quarter of a Diaku Emblem.  Collect all 4 quarters by doing this for a few hours of really decent exp, and bam. you have 6 people flagged for PoTactics. (I've suggested making the Diaku Raiders kitable just to make this even that much easier)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bastion of Thunder: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Collect a head from any of the giants in PoStorms. they rot often. give it to Askr.<br>
<br>
Collect a Beard from the Giants on the Coast, collect a Sash from the Giants in the Forest, and a Bone from the Giants in the Desert.  Get a bag from Askr, but these pieces in and combine.  These pieces rot all the time, and all you need to do is wait for them to be called out to the zone, or look for groups killing these mobs and hang out by them asking if they have any extra.<br>
<br>
Collect 2 Esoteric Medallions from any 2 out of the 3 clans of Giants. The Esoteric Medallions drop off of the Named giants.  These are actually quite difficult and require a mini-raid (or one group of highly skilled) to take out.  The mini's drop 3 Medallions each, and 2 Mini's per camp means 6 medallions.<br>
<br>
 (These are a bit hard to acquire for casual players, and I've suggested that the one quest be turned into 2. One way to complete it is just with the Head and Esoteric Medallions, and the other just with the Bone, Sash, and Beard. But would need to lower the drop rates on the Bone, Sash and Beard a small amount to account for this and make it fair)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Plane of Torment: </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I've been told there isn't one.  One should be implemented.  If the person I've talked to is mistaken, then please if someone knows could they post the specifics here?<br>
<br>
These quests are easily completable by Casual players, all the while receiving exp for doing it. No hunting greenies.<br>
<br>
I've also suggested a fairly easy Key Quest to bypass the PoJustice Trials.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I ask you.  Would these changes be acceptable to keep your low/mid-level guilds together?  Remember, you flag 6 people at once! One group each collecting a piece each would be able to flag 36 people! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=friswizard>FrisWizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/03 2:01 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> N<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You call it personal motivation, I cal it recoignition that it's a goddamn game and there is sunlight outside my window.<br>

We aren't going to agree on this. If seven months working on flags to have half a guild ready for HoH and a third of us ready for Tactics is your idea of fun, knock yourself out.<br>

If this unkeying had been done 3-4 months ago, we'd all still be playing.  I'm sure you're all happy we quit, less lag for you etc., but when that sort of thing happens enough, even the raiding guild members with oodles of time to play and guildmembers out the ears will start feeling repercussions. <p><b><font color="red">The Inimitable Fris Elleffgee</font></b>

Players like you and your friends that left EQ are who I'm trying to think of by making the quests really easy.<br>
<br>
The Mid-range people are who I'm thinking of to not have quit the game just like your friends did, by keeping the Key quests in.<br>
<br>
The High end people are who I'm thinking of when I added the backflagging specifics. This also indirectly helps the Mid-range people by not needing to remove the flags to help high end guilds get new members flagged.<br>
<br>
I DON'T want to see people getting upset and leaving EQ.  But I just can't forsake all the mid-range guilds to the casual players that want to get into new planes without putting any effort into it.  And as for your 2 groups that wanted to get Larvae to get Keyed for CoD, getting 2 of each piece now gets both groups flagged, since the key quest flags by group, not by person as of a few patches ago.<br>
<br>
If my changes are implemented, you'll be able to buy the Larvae flesh in the Bazaar and get people flagged for CoD that way.  Isn't that enough?<br>

A lot of us in mid-sized guilds put in a lot of work to get our entire membership flagged for these things.  We may not be able to progress to the elemental yet, but at least we have access to some nice xp zones without fighting the hordes of morons who inhabit other zones.  Many of us do xp in Tactics/Decay.  If you dump in 40 more people into these zones it most definitely does affect us.<br>
<br>
Level 50 beastlord twinks don't belong in the mid-level planes.  How many emtpy level 50-60 dungeons are there in the game now?  All of our old hunting grounds in Kunark and Velious are ghost-towns.  And now they want to make it even worse by letting everyone and their twink into the planes?  That's just stupid.<br>
<br>
While they are at it, why don't they just open up VP, Sleepers, VT, the elemental planes, and the Plane of Time?  Oh, and every level 1 melee should start with Seru bane and Shissar bane weapons. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61177">Gherad</a>            <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72580">Peleg</a>

3) Planar Progression.<br>
<br>
Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a roadblock for some guilds, and some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want players to play with their friends and guild mates.<br>
<br>
To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br>
<br>
Bastion of Thunder<br>
Plane of Tactics<br>
Halls of Honor<br>
Plane of Nightmare<br>
Plane of Storms<br>
Plane of Torment<br>
Plane of Valor<br>
Crypt of Decay<br>
<br>
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to everyone, and should allow most guilds to travel and adventure together. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Initially, our guild, Dragons Fist resented the gaps created between higher level characters and lower level characters with the release of Planes of Power. However, we began to look at it differently, we started to look at it as a challenge for guilds which have been together for a long time to come together and play as a team. It also allowed us to figure out who were the loyal supporters of Dragons Fist, our online family. I believed it filtered out the so-called &quot;leeches&quot; in the guild. Leeches are the people who used our resources to get what they wanted then moved on to another guild to try to get other things that they wanted that our guild could not provide at the time.  We do not want those types of players in Dragons Fist anyhow and many of those people are asking for re-invites since we are Planes active now. <br>
<br>
Dragons Fist Officers decided not to venture into the Planes of Power realms until at least 80% of its active players had the ability to venture into that realm. Many of the higher level characters waited patiently as lower level characters caught up. That is true loyalty amongst friends. We learned to play together and acquired the skills necessary to take on mobs that hit you for 700 plus together. <br>
<br>
I do not believe it's a good idea to open the flood gates to Planes of Power zones to unskilled players. The flag requirements provide a test of a player's skills to work as a team and to be prepared for encounters that are in the next steps of progression. <br>

<br>
And it's not just here -- on Graffes -- but everywhere players post about the game.<br>
<br>
Now players as a general rule have always been fairly whiney, at least - as a group. Whats facinating about this issue is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gets something to whine about.<br>
<br>
Frankly - it's message board Nirvana.<br>
<br>
As for how I feel about it: It's a mixed blessing. I am proud of my flags. Executioner was tough at my level, but doable, though - in fairness - I have never lacked for friends. My fondest memory of the Executioner was how we were ALL low on mana when we defeated the fourth wave, so our RANGER (MT) Kited the Executioner around the room until we were good to go. I knew we had won the very instant the shaman landed slow, but that's EQ for you! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I even got the kill shot.<br>
<br>
I am about an hour or two away from CoD flags (alt quest) and am seriously looking forward to nosing around in there with one of my regular crews. For me, flags are an acomplishment that brings FUN to the game. The fun of overcoming challenges, often against long odds.<br>
<br>
I mourn that many of you will never know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> feeling in EQ. Judging by some of the posts above, it's doubtful you will even miss it.<br>
