by Eanin Silverhawk<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare comforts me...Tunare comforts me...&quot;  In the temple of Tunare, Eanin had learned the &quot;thousand prayers&quot;, an old ascetic discipline of the Koada'Vie.  Spoken over and over, the words slip under thought, and enter into one's heart in a form of an eternal prayer.  Always to busy in his life as a paladin, his life as a slave had given new meaning to this practice.  In the Mines of Nurga, the thousand prayers had sustained him, distracted him, and kept him close to his god.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am your god now, whelp...&quot;  Klurgg - bitter taskmaster in those mines.  What were they after?  Salt?  Iron?  As long as it wasn't stone.  On occasion, Klurg would force them to dig with their hands, until they were bloody and numb.  &quot;Picks are a privilege&quot;, he used to say, and one earned that priviledge with one's labour.<br>
<br>
Eanin had learned to speak the thousand prayers under his breath - even to think them, and merely mirror them with slight movements of the tongue.  But on this day - the day of his salvation - he was sloppy.  The dust, whips, and clanging machinery had made him forget to lower his voice - to merely mouth the words that rolled over and over in his heart.  He and Klurgg had begun badly - Eanin had been proud, haughty, and had forgotten the difference between the exclamations of the voice and the exclamations of the heart.  He stood up to Klurgg defiantly, and Klurgg had taken special pleasure in breaking him.  But Eanin had learned his lesson quickly - even quietly.  Klurgg may take his body, his voice, even his spirit.  But his soul would remain in the care of his god.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let her comfort this!&quot; screeched Klurgg - the goblins of Kunark had a special way of shrieking, an hysteria seemed to be permanently imbedded in their voices.  Again - beating number five hundred, perhaps? - Klurgg laid into Eanin with his usual sadistic pleasure.  First the whip, of course - a lash to the back of the ear, then the back, again, again, on the arms when Eanin rolled over to protect himself, and the face when he was covering his body.  This time, the whip was followed by a pipe, and that special insanity reserved only for goblins and the damned overcame his captor.  Eanin felt a familiar crushing, and darkness mixed with light in his brain.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOO THIS!&quot;, screamed Eanin, tearing his voice in a way that would leave him unable to speak for months after.  There was no need to sound any alarm, as the screech itself was louder than any possible contraption.  The blood fury of Klurgg was replaced with an equally mad terror, and seemed to leap into the face of the young paladin.  His hands leapt to the throat of his master, and choked him with such force that whether death came from the crushing of his throat or the breaking of his now elongated neck would always be uncertain.  Eanin looked straight into the eyes of his dying lord - light - bright, animated life - then darkness - and in that darkness, a revelation.<br>
<br>
There Eanin grabbed his pick - his privilege, as it were.  A smile overcame his face, and he swung with a force that would have easily wedged the weapon in the walls, had Eanin not suddenly received the accuracy of the greatest swordsman.  One goblin after another fell - first to the brain, then the throat, then the chest.  Some were decapitated by the force of the blows themselves.  Others were simply dismembered and left to die.  And there stood the young paladin, clothed in a blood soaked rag, standing with the blood and brains of his enemies dripping down his face.  And he was happy. And free.<br>
<br>
For he had seen something in those eyes - the eyes of Klurgg, as he would repeat to himself later.  There was madness, lust, exultation, terror, horror, life and death, all within an instant.  And within Eanin's eyes were mirrored the same passions, always exactly the reverse of what was in those hysterical eyes.  And in those passions -no, in the mixing of those passions - Eanin had seen a god.  Brighter, more clearly than the most frantic prayers, pilgrimages, and rites of Tunare had ever shown him.  Not the fear itself, nor the glory - but in that juxtaposition of one upon another, Eanin had seen that truth that lies behind mere meaning.  Tunare, and her ways, were merely the ethics of fear, of safety - pathetic, weak - compassion, justice, humility.  But in that fear, he had seen his own exultation, his own lust for blood, and glorification in his own strength.  Fear and power, pain and glory, dejection and triumph - in these Eanin had seen a god who lay beneath the images of mere thought.  There, he found his truth beyond comfort.<br>
<br>
And so Eanin Silverhawk stepped forth from the mines, a blood-soaked avatar of war - a paladin of Rallos Zek. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/oceanussilverfist/eanin.htm"><img src="http://oceanussilverfist.homestead.com/files/eaninp3.jpg" border="0"></a>

Paladin I see you brother, are we a house divided or a house united?<br>
<br>
Do you follow Rallos Zek's light path of protection or the dark path of destruction?  Both are true ways to worship the Dark Lord of War.  Both paths will lead to me at some point.  One as ally and comrade one as bitter foes.  I look forward to seeing you again brother, I had wondered what fell forces had taken you, I am pleased you have come out of it stronger.<br>

<br>
Hatred oozed from his body and his mouth as he mocked her Goddess and her.  To the dismay of those around her, Slaini remained calm as she tried to bring him back from the darkside.  As his insults grew in intensity, she resolved herself to helping him come back to the light of Tunare.  Many offers from those around her to help her rid the land of this Paladin, turned quasi-Shadowknight, twisted by the torture he had endured at the hands of the Goblins.  She maintained her demeanor and asked that those around her not engage the Paladin in battle.  <br>
<br>
As they departed company, Slaini promised to remain his friend and pray for him.  Inspite of his mocking of the Goddess Tunare, Slaini knew in her heart that she must work with this Eanin to try and bring him back into the fold of the Elven Elite and once more into the light of Tunare's embrace.<br>

<br>
OOC:  Eanin and I had a war of words near the gate in Freeport, a chance encounter.  While we were conversing, a crowd gathered around us and some even played along.  I received many tells asking if I was alright and if I needed help.  Many there were ready to battle Eanin right then and there.  I told them that all was okay and that we were just roleplaying.  I was honored that so many stood up to be counted during this ten minute exchange of words.  I also had a great time roleplaying my Cleric, in her attempts to bring Eanin back to Tunare. <br>
<br>
&quot;Eanin, I still have several pairs of Rallos Zek's gloves.  He must be very forgetful, in that he leaves them everywhere.

Aryllyian handed the boy his helm and gauntlets as he rushed by and headed for the stairs.  The somber look on Aryllyian's face spoke volumes and the page scrambled to stay out of the way.  Taking several stairs at a time, Ary bounded down toward General Jyleel with urgent news.<br>
<br>
Aryllyian pushed open the door and averted his eyes in the custom of the Koada Vie.  Even in times of dire urgency Aryllyian understood the need for custom and courtesy.  He was a child of the court of Felwithe and Ary understood the history in such customs.<br>
<br>
Jyleel turned and smiled.  &quot;Aryllyian Wyndreaver...&quot; Jyleel noticed Aryllyian's hurried look.  But decided to continue with pleasantries.  &quot;Aryllyian..it is good to see you. I cannot explain it..but you remind me more and more of your mother every day.&quot;<br>
<br>
That comment caused Aryllyian to smile a moment.  And Jyleel continued. &quot;She was so very tempremental. Once you possessed the quiet resolve of your father, as you age, you are more...well.. expressive...&quot;<br>
<br>
Aryllyian thought for a moment and remembered his rantings and ravings over the loss of Sir Eanin and Later Lord Aeadien.  It was Aryllyian who violently urged the Council of the Koadie Vie from its incessant posturing...to action.<br>
In the end, despite the protests of many, the Koada Vie declared a quest to recover those Elven Elite who went missing...and Aryllyian personally took up the standard,and declared a Holy Quest to recover his friends and mentors.<br>
<br>
All was in order, scouts and rangers were sent, bards were sent to the four corners of Norrath begging info.   Much later and under rather confusing circumstances Lord Aeadien returned, somewhat bruised but still alive, to resume his missions from Kethelin...<br>
<br>
The whereabouts of Sir Eanin were never revealed until recently.  &quot;Master Jyleel..&quot; Aryllyian bgan.  &quot;It seems that our knight of the Koada Vie, Sir Eanin...has been..ahem..delivered to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Sir Eanin Silverhawk?&quot; replied Jyleel, &quot;This is very good news...&quot; Jyleel smiled broadly and continued..&quot;Our mother is wise and comforts us...She has given us back our Son..we should count ourselves as fortunate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My Lord&quot; Aryllyian countered, &quot;Eanin has left us. He is the scorn of our mother and he is among the multitutdes of Rallos Zek.  He wears black armor and speaks with the tongue of a heretic. I regret to say it..but he renounces his oaths to the Koada Vie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jyleel was visiably shaken by the news.  Aryllyian could barely conceal his rage. And Jyleel took long moments to stare at Aryllyian and judge his words with wisdom.<br>
<br>
&quot;He wanders Norrath bathed in the vile stain of the blood god..spitting and spouting obscenties against Our Mother and Goddess Tunare to all that will hear it.&quot; Said Aryllyian in a bitter tone.<br>
<br>
Jyleel turned away from Aryllyian and looked skyward...as if silently asking for guidence.  Aryllyian understood the gesture and left the room.  Again he understood the value of such ancient customs. Outside the door, Aryllyian remembered his oaths and repeated them to himself often. He awaited news from Jyleel and prayed to Tunare.  <br>
