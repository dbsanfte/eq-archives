I was racking my brain about the seeming wizard problems, trying to find a logical explanation for this other than: &quot;Verant hates us&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've noticed that most wizards are fairly formulaic.  We all wear roughly similar equipment, because we all go for roughly the same goals on item attributes... we all have 200 int within a few points... we all belong to a community which already developed a pretty clear opinion of the best ways to equip and play a wizard.<br>
<br>
Is it possible that the thing behind this is that only a few wizards (or none?) have figured out how to do it right?  What if everyone's missing something about how to set up your wizard to be effective, and that's why Verant isn't fixing anything: because nothing's broke, just undiscovered...<br>
<br>
<br>
Do our problems go away if we max our int to 255?  What about other stats - even from Verant themselves I've seen conflicting answers on the true purpose of some stats like dex and agi... and we know they don't keep up in internal wizard mechanics well... does some &quot;non-caster&quot; stat actually help us in some way?  What about hp/ac?  Is it possible that the formula for group effectiveness involves getting lots of both and being an overnuking powerburner who can take hits?<br>
<br>
The above are just random last minute thoughts, I doubt any of them are it.  But I just want to know - in the past, have people scientifically tested wizards this way to determine that there's not something we're missing?<br>

We inflict damage with DD spells (in talking high lvl mob encounters and such).  Adding dex/agi/XXX stat wont help us do that better.  Its all about having 200ish int, and adding +mana gear.  Why?  To have more mana!  More mana = more nukes.  Well the HP thing is nice too hehe, fully buffed i have 3750 hp, that helps alot with the AEs, but again it comes down to staying alive to nuke more.

<br>
I know the obvious thing is that dex/agi/hp/ac/etc are secondary if not useless to us, and the only thing that matters is 200-ish int and +mana (and +resists in some situations)....<br>
<br>
The question is - has anyone actually tested other possibilities exhaustively, or did those rules come out of the blue long ago and nobody ever tried anything different?<br>

First of all, would that be possible (I think it would), and maybe there is some unforseen mana increase - though I doubt it.<br>
Also, what about Charisma? I have often wondered if this may help root hold. Could somoene answer that question? I have also heard rumers of wisdom affecting how well you resist charms/fears/etc - though MR is most definately more important. Still, you have a point. Why doesn't a lev 60 with tons of Caster equip mess around a bit with their stats? Might be interesting to see a 200 wisdom 200 int 200 charisma wizard at work....<br>

<br>
unlike most D&amp;D based games where increasing a stat by a couple of points meant something significant it means absolutely shit in EQ.<br>
<br>
10str in EQ gives you nothing other than allowing you to carry 10 more stones of gear. In order to see a significant increase in damage (if melee) class you need to equip around 70str.<br>
<br>
<br>
EQ stats are pathetic. I would like to be optimistic about them, but quite frankly Verant did a really poor job coding them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Monk used to go hog wild for AGI and DEX. They could care less about them now. Now all they care 'bout is AC, HP, and Resists ...oh and Haste (#1 actually).<br>
<br>
Wizards are always trying different combinations. It is not the stats that make the Wizard ...it is the player. Though the player is also in constraint of his/her spells. And unfortunately I cannot say that I like the spell system in EQ. It is too simplified. I am used to games that challenge my mind into thinking of better combinations, but when you think EQ 'combination' is not exactly a term that is used. Not with spells at least, but stats... sure, you can combine different things. Now whether those combinations actually do something different for you I would have to say no.<br>
<br>
One person said they conducted a test w/ a Monk that was STR crazy, one that was AGI and DEX crazy, and one that was AC crazy. Did one excel over the other? Nope, they basically did the same. Even when they dueled each other at same level and same weapons level, they were even. So yeah, technically you use the word combination with stats ...but that does not mean you are achieving true combinations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In my eyes, EQ really failed in its stats and spell systems. Of course do not let me sway you from your journey if you truely feel like there is a better answer... <p><p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#0066CC">Saradin</font></i></b><br><hr><br>

<br>
Hmmm. Int and Wis for the proper casters are useful.<br>
<br>
Str to a limited extent is useful.  I will do more damage with my SK if my str is buffed up with steal str and syphon str, only by a few points, but it does go up.<br>
<br>
Its really sad that charisma means nothing to an enchanter for charms.<br>
<br>
It would be neat if Charisma helped a charmer, while lowering charisma helped for Fear spells.<br>
<br>
This is all just more proof that EQ succeeds despite a totally poorly designed set-up.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, games will come out to improve this set up.<br>

Paying 12pp+ for those Peridots? Invest a little plat in some +Cha items and watch the price go down to 10.5pp. The savings add up fast. If you're indifferent to the merchant, 105 Cha should be enough to get the best prices. If you're Apprehensive you should shoot for higher than that.<br>
<br>
I've always wondered if Stamina had some hidden effect, since it's listed as a primary stat for Wizards. Either that, or everything but Int is so useless that the extra HP is the best thing for a Wizard...<br>
<br>
I receintly got a chance to sit at the controls of a Druid a couple levels below me. He can channel spells while getting hit like no man's business. Also, he can channel after moving pretty often. If I even look at my arrow keys I get interrupted. Does his high Stamina have this effect, perhaps? I would agree that it's probably AC for casting through melee attacks, but when moving? I think a couple newbie Wizards keeping track of channeling success with max/min Stamina would make for an interesting read... <p>Zwobu &lt;Trade Foundation&gt; Innoruuk<br><img src="http://patriot.net/~josh/zwobu.jpeg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saradin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/1/01 10:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stats.</span><hr size=1> perhaps 'useless' is too strong a term<br>

STA affects how long you can stay underwater<br>
gives you HPs, and<br>
more of it allows a warrior type class to swing a heavier weapon more w/o losing STA (after 100 STA you no longer lose STA, DEX, and AGI when your stamina bar runs dry)<br>

If you were around about a year ago, Verant told us explicitly what all the stats did as they frankly got sick of all the bitching...<br>

Channelling isn't affected by anything appart from channeling skill. If the druid could cast through more often, it was probably down to superior ac.

Those who put most of their points into dexterity and agility would claim they didn't hit for as much but hit more often and got hit less.<br>
<br>
Then we found out that dexterity has nothing to do without how much you hit and agility has only a minor effect on AC.<br>
<br>
I've since learned the only thing that really matters is level.  People who spend days trying to get that +8 str +8 dex item might as well just spend it levelling and worry about their stats more when they're higher.<br>

As a wizard now I've exceed 200 intelligence.  Now all I worry about is looks.  I'm going for the non-robe look since seeing the same robe geometry on everyone is boring.  <br>

I do channel through beatings regularly. I noticed, tho, that back when I was a level 34 Wizard and I got a level 30 mob beating on me I was less likely to channel than the level 32 Druid that I was teamed with. I was able to root them after a couple tries and move away, but he'd get it first time almost always. Aslo, if I move a little bit in the middle of casting I'll probably get interrupted, but if he moves a little while casting he'll probably still cast it. At least, that's how it was back in our low 30's.<br>
<br>
It's not that he could channel and I couldn't, it's that he was better at it.<br>
<br>
Oh, you know how you have to turn a little bit after you've stopped running or just wait a second before casting so your spell won't get interrupted? He's never had that problem. <p>Zwobu &lt;Trade Foundation&gt; Innoruuk<br><img src="http://patriot.net/~josh/zwobu.jpeg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucastaa123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Castaa123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/1/01 3:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stats</span><hr size=1> Ouch!

AE, multi nuke, and other strategies are likely the doorway to much greater success for wizards. <br>
<br>
From the beginning, Wizards and Wars defined the baseline for the 3 prime classes, fighter/healer/caster.  When Wizards extreme powers in beta were cut back, fighters moved to the front.  Also, looking at the stats on how many people primarily play what classes, fighters chars are the vast majority.  Thus, fighters need healers and vica-versa, leaving a very small minority of casters having to beg around for group members.  This means we ended up having to group on their terms.  The best way for fighters to group and hunt has been tested and firmed up over the months and years.  Now, perhaps we have all lost the ability to think outside the box. <br>
<br>
Sure, some encounters clearly require tank-based single target approaches.  But other approaches have also become proven. Many guilds and groups before us had tried and tested numerous approaches to things like Vox in order to learn what would take her down, and what wouldn't.  Mass AE pulls in Seb, Karnor, etc.  have also proven to be hugely successful. <br>
<br>
All this suggests that there are likely other ways we can apply our skills and spells to new situations and combinations. Certainly Warriors eventually discovered the whopping benefits they recieve from having a Shaman in their group using certain spells at specialized times. Similarly, we are probably missing some combination of abilities and tactics simply because many of us have succumb to the insistance of the melee-class world that we are only useful in the ways that they dictate, or in the false belief that everything new has already been tried and discarded by someone before us. <br>
<br>
One reason many such explorations are likely to be pushed down before birth is that even here among your fellow wizards, many of them will ridicule and rabidly insist that anything that does not seem possible to them is impossible--that anything that does not seem normal to them is useless. Still, there are pleanty of others who would support thinking and wondering, new trials and experiments. We can only hope that those who find revelations bother to return to these pages and share them.<br>

It's just not gonna happen.  Here's why:<br>
<br>
If they did that, there would be absolutely <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason - none whatsoever - to play anything other than an Erudite as a wizard.  You'd be utterly foolish to choose otherwise in that situation, whereas now, pretty much any other race is still a viable base race for a wizard.  As it is now, the Erudites already have a huge advantage, since they can reach 200 INT far more easily than the other races, letting them wear that much more +mana gear.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can point to Ogres as having the highest STR of any of the warrior races and say that that makes them the &quot;perfect&quot; race for a warrior, and that you'd be foolish to choose any other race for a warrior, but warriors are FAR more dependant on equipment than is a wizard - the big difference with them lies in armor and weapons, not in base STR...<br>
<br>
Now I stated that they aren't going to be doing that for non-L60 players, but when Shadows of Luclin comes out, they will be allowing non-level-based advancement...  Perhaps that means that SoL-enabled L60 wizards can increase their INT soft cap?  Who knows.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zestifan>Zestifan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/01 7:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A different thought on wizard problems</span><hr size=1> They're hinting at some type of specialization or skill-based increases for high level players in Luclin.  I don't know if you have to reach 60 or not to do it, but most likely you do since they're not raising the level cap.<br>
<br>
Too bad this isn't like in Diablo 2 where a sorcerer can specialize in ice, fire or lightning or a mixture of all three elements.  A soloer mainly goes after ice and grouping sorcs will generally do fire with a little ice and lightning thrown in.  That flexibility meant that alot of sorcs had varyings strengths and weakness and ways of fighting.<br>
<br>
The ideal magic system to me would be skill-based where you *chose* a primary casting ability and a lesser secondary.  Like primary=nuking and secondary=summoning or primary=nuking and secondary=mind control.  Your title would be named after your primary ability.  Besides higher skill you'd also have a bonus attached to your primary.  Your primary would be 75% better than your secondary.<br>
<br>
What I like about UO is while the magic system is the same for everyone, you can choose to raise or lower skills through practice.  If you decided you wanted to learn a new combat skill you could let one skill atrophy and build up your new one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvikano.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vikano</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/01 4:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> dex uses</span><hr size=1> Dex does seem to affect crit hits for warriors. Was grouped with a dwarf warrior who was hitting for crits maybe every 4 or so shots. It was insane. As a group we asked him how he was managing it and he said it was because he kept his dex up very high. This isn't a study, but if he knew what he was talking about (and he was landing crits way more than any tank I've every seen) dex affects crit frequency.<br>
