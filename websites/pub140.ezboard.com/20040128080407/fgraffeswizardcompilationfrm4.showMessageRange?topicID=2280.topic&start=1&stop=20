Officials at the Pentagon don't think that's very likely however, announcing a couple of days ago that a U.S. military presence in Iraq will be &quot;significantly longer than anticipated&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for credible evidence that Iraq had the WMD's which we all suspected they had, but our administration insisted <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for an explanation of how the very credible intelligence U.S. officials couldn't risk sharing with the American public has apparently vanished into so much smoke now that the biggest part of the war is done.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for our soldiers to stop dying, in ones and twos, sometimes threes and fours, every day.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for the U.S. to take more than a half-hearted step towards giving Iraq back to the Iraqis; but once again, with Jay Bremer cancelling a congress of prominent Iraqi figures to discuss a future government last Saturday, this doesn't look too likely in the near future.  (The congress was held, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>without</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> U.S. supervision.)<br>

<br>
Why did we fight this war? Because Saddam was an evil fuck, and even if he doesn't have WMD, the only reason is because of the sanctions -- fact -- and we would never have been able to lift the sanctions without Saddam gone -- fact.<br>
<br>
What the fuck is so hard to understand about this? The real reason for the war, for me, in the end, had little to do with what Saddam had. It has to do with what Saddam clearly WANTED to do, WOULD do, and was only STOPPED from doing because of extreme and continued efforts by the outside world, efforts which as a necessary consequence brought great suffering to the Iraqi people. <br>
<br>
Saddam gone, sanctions lifted, Iraqi people happy, or they will be once the smoke settles. I am not happy that our troops are still there, or that they're still dying, or that it appears our government pulled a fast one over us with their specious &quot;evidence&quot;. But to claim you don't have a &quot;good explanation&quot; for why we fought this war, either means you aren't as clever as I give you credit for -- which I doubt, you're quite clever -- or you're lying. You may not agree with the reason, you may think eternal sanctions really were the way to go, but the explanation is solid and defensible, and good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pedidustyboots>Pedi Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 966<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 11:04 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grimstaff, now I'M waiting</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/leopa_panthera/misc/thompson.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=claudshadowflare>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Has Eddie Murphy's<BR>taste in women</span><br>  Posts: 3744<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 11:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grimstaff, now I'M waiting</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why did we fight this war?

We can trim off the last part of that quote since it really has nothing to do with the first part- just aiming for completeness here.  Saying &quot;Saddam was a bad guy&quot; is absolutely meaningless to me.  There are lots of bad guys in the world, but I don't see us in those countries.<br>

So, why do you personally care so much about Saddam being gone?  Do you really believe he was an earnest and sincere threat to you?  Or is there some sudden burst of magnamity here for the Iraqi people that 2/3's of Africa, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Iran, etc. etc. don't qualify for?  The Iraqi people are happy?

<br>
Considering the MASSIVE cost of this war and the more than 300 soldiers that have died as a result, I don't think the means justified the ends.<br>

Sorry, we can't trim the last part of what I said just because it's convenient to your argument to do so, because I'm not just saying he was an evil guy. He was an evil guy who, I have no doubt, wanted to kill Americans. And he would have done so if he had the means. And he didn't have the means only because the world watched him like a hawk for 12 years, at great expense to us and with very negative effects to his people. And we would have had to keep watching him, and his successors, forever and ever. And this is an unacceptable stalemate, at least to me, because I don't like like forcing people to suffer because their leader is a bitch. So it's not that's he's an evil guy, it's that he's an evil guy who, there is no doubt, would have done us ill if he'd had half a chance, and the cost of continually denying him that chance was too high for the Iraqi people to forever pay.<br>

You're saying that if we had lifted the sanctions and ignored him completely, he never would have either covertly or overtly attacked his neighbors or the U.S.? I find that an extremely optimistic (and unrealistic) viewpoint, one too dangerous, I believe, to indulge in.<br>

Fuck the cost, first of all. If I have to pay an extra hundred bucks in taxes this year because of the war, I have no problem with that. Second, 300 deaths is an insanely small cost compared to the number of deaths that could have happened. I can't see how it could get much smaller. And how many people died each year from the sanctions, how much misery did the sanctions inflict, and I'm not even talking about how much misery and death Saddam himself inflicted.<br>

You missed the point.  It would be more credible if we were truly trying to change the world; this noble &quot;we got an evil person out of power&quot; stuff might hold up if we approached other people similar to Saddam.  Last I checked, most Americans didn't give much of a shit about who Charles Taylor was.  (Hint: Another very bad guy warlord who funds much of the rebel operations in Africa.)  Saying &quot;we did it for the good of the Iraqi people!&quot; doesn't hold much weight when we can turn a blind eye to the Liberian people.<br>

<br>
So now our rationale is &quot;hey, at least we're better than Saddam&quot;?  We KNOW he was a bad guy.  When the hell did I ever suggest we take him out for beers and smoke a few Cubans with him?  Shooting civilians at anti-American rallies doesn't do too too much when you're trying to raise Iraqi public opinion.  (Yes, public opinion and the resistance are pretty closely linked.  The less they like us, the more likely some of them are to support opposition fighters.  Not because they want Saddam back; because they would want us out.)<br>

<br>
Yes, you don't mind the extra $100 dollars in taxes, however you were behind this war from the beginning.  You might not view 300 deaths as a large cost, but I view it as 300 people that wouldn't have died had we not lauched this war- not to mention the estimated 4,000 Iraqi civilians who died due to the war.  (Yes, Saddam probably would have killed more, but I really don't think we should be judging ourselves in terms of &quot;hey, we're better than Saddam!&quot;)<br>
<br>
That 4,000 figure is an Amnesty International estimate, take it for what you will,  they are certainly a liberal organization but they strive hard to get their facts straight.  U.S. officials refuse to make an estimate, saying any deaths were accidental and therefore a collateral damage estimate isn't necessary.  No, I'm not making that up.  So much for magnamity.<br>

You seem to be under the impression that not only did Iraqis not know about these torture chambers, but that we'd be better for the Iraqis than any attempts at government they can set up in the short term.  Saddam's gone, and more than likely dead.  The torture chambers don't get used anymore.  I really don't think people in the Middle East buy that we're doing this purely of our own magnamity; we have our own interests involved here.  They are not obliged to kiss our ass because we decided to topple our government.<br>

c) Well, the Pentagon did say they expected to be out of Iraq within a year.

<br>
I guess I'm confused about what your alternative to the whole mess would have been. You don't approve of taking Saddam out by force. You don't approve of lifting the sanctions while Saddam was in power. Were you kind of hoping that Saddam would just magically disappear, or were you satisfied leaving the sanctions in place and letting Saddam continue as he was? The sanctions inflicted terrible misery, I wouldn't support any idea that allowed them to continue.  <br>
<br>

<br>
What the hell? I'm not trying to be noble, I'm trying to be practical. Saddam hated us, and, left alone -- and this is what makes him unique for the most part, at least it distinguishes him from some warlord in Africa -- could and would undoubtedly have developed and distributed sophisticated WMD in ways harmful to us. The only reason he didn't was because we contained him. But containment, ultimately, wasn't the answer, it was going on too long and at too much cost to the Iraqi people. So we did what we should have done 12 years ago, went in and took him out. <br>

Bullshit. If I give one homeless guy on the street five bucks, it doesn't mean I have some secret motive because I didn't also give five bucks to homeless guy number two. What you said doesn't make sense. Nor am I turning a blind eye; I myself posted an article on this board a few weeks back about horrible shit that was happening in Africa, and I support those in the UN who say that we need to send more peacekeeping forces to Africa to enforce a very much needed peace. <br>

I think this is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exactly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> how we should be judging ourselves. How do you think we should be judging ourselves? We killed 4000 civilians.

They probably did know about the chambers. I was trying to make a point. And I don't recall ever saying that we know better than the Iraqis how they should govern themselves. In fact, you may recall a very long thread a couple months back where I argued with Grimstaff and Torcer for like five or ten pages, that we need to include the Iraqis at every single step of this process and get the hell out of there as soon as we can after making sure the new government won't immediately start persecuting people en masse or collapse on itself.<br>

Did I say Grimstaff wasn't a dick? He is a dick. But as for &quot;just wait and see, everything's going to turn out fine&quot;, if I recall, he usually uses that line when people try to stay stuff like &quot;It's been two months three weeks five days and three seconds since we took Baghdad why are we still there we're never leaving and the Iraqis will all turn into terrorists because of it wtf&quot;.
