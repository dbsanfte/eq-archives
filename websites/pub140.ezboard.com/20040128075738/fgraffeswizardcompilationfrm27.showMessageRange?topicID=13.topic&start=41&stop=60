i have sunstrike land consistantly for 1k or more on fully buffed druids. Other night I took out best pally on server fully buffed WITH a level 60 cleric in 7 casts, 3 sunstrikes 2 lures.  She had Aego and fully buffed- you do the math.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of the posting- yeah Acil was pretty good with spamming the golem wands. As far as solists- crap. Sunstrike good. Each time i cast it on Acillamen his shield went away, so i'm sure it did a bit more than &quot;jack&quot;. Most fights i've ever had with him were either me getting stripped and killing him in 3 shots, me dying, or him running out of golem wand charges and zoning. Woot new CT :P<br>

Been having alot of problems with the melees in my guild(most have at LEAST 5k+hps unbuffed, and almost 180+all resist).<br>
<br>
I read up on these tips(thanks for the great post) and have been totally recking havoc since then.  Still have a bit of problems with some of them, but lets just say the line of people waiting to step into the arena with me has gotten very very small =))   Thanks again PvPing is a very refreshing break from all the raids.<br>
<br>
Also as a Small note, anyone who does beat me instantly gets to have a nice taste of MANABURN.  Yes I do save this only for those who kill me =) <p><marquee width="50%">I got more juice than Zeus, Slinging lightnen trying to frighten!</marquee>

Read and Learn (EDIT 11/29)</span><hr size=1> Actually BRDs are kind of an odd class to fight.<br>
<br>
In retrospect the only class capable of  consistently killing a bard is probably a WIZ becuz we're the only ones with fast enough, and reliable enough nukes.<br>
<br>
Granted &quot;killing&quot; a bard is damn near impossible....in my experiences they are more annoying than anything else...<br>
<br>
They usually just kite with you with annul song.....- wow I sit and click some Jboots and that solves that....like I said annoying - not really a threat...<br>
<br>
So they actually have the gonads to attack you?  Good.....use your fastest casting spells - you will usually get a nice handful of them off before they break epic rune....and once you land that one that hurts they run......if timing is good u can usually get &quot;one more blast&quot; before Selo's takes them away...<br>
<br>
They Selo, they regen, they return......<br>
<br>
BRDs take too long to kill us - especially with Epic + Yonder.....but on the flipside its a timing issue with our ability to kill them (barring Manaburn/a lucky crit).<br>
<br>
A few tactics to try - all have worked....<br>
<br>
Try using that long cast time spell - I seem to be able to channel Ice Comet over 50% of the time.....IC hits a BRD and yeah yer taking that chance of &quot;big damage or no damage&quot; - but with BRDs you HAVE the time to take chances on stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Another tactic is to simply use that 3.0 sec Draught.  Almost a guaranteed hit every time - only problem is not a large chunk of damage taken.....which gives THEM time to just annoy you more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think I've died once to a BRD in all my EQ career and it was cuz we were both at 5% life and I thougt it would be kewl to try and win this one out ya know?  Shock of Lightning got interrupted and I died..blah.  <br>
<br>
Anywayz - like I said - BRDs arent a real &quot;threat&quot; per se - they are just annoying becuz to them - almost NO class is a threat becuz of Selo's + Regen + tracking.<br>
<br>
Of course there is the occasional &quot;wild hair&quot; but for the most part this pretty much sums up BRD vs WIZ PvP. <p>"Those that can, do.

The only way you'll kill a decent bard is indoors - they really are limited there, and even with the best weapons in the game they still can't melee for shit. <p>Master <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29571>Velael</a> Fef

Read and Learn (EDIT 11/29)</span><hr size=1> I would answer the SK question - but with the recent changes to resists - I need more experiences agaisnt all classes before posting some good tactics.<br>
<br>
PRE-patch it was still hard to say.  The SK that stands there and tries to debuff you / LT you is a dead SK.  The SK that bashes/melees/HTs you has a chance.  Keeping up epic + Spellshield is kewl tho cuz usually they break thru epic skin and get excited and pop HT only to have Spellshield eat it.<br>
<br>
Usually I just run around and yonder/Draught or Yonder/Lure.  If I see them casting - use a big boom.  They're stupid for trying to cast ANYTHING on you.  Engulfing Darkness?  Big deal - if you are tactically using yonder/Draught as a means of doing damage - who cares about being snared anywayz - yer yondering as a means to gain distance.<br>
<br>
Anywayz - like I said, too hard to really post some tactics since new resistance changes - but I imagine playing the yonder/nuke game still works and if they stop to cast soemthing, you can stop to cast the big boom.<br>
<br>
Manaburn works too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>"Those that can, do.

Read and Learn (EDIT 11/29)</span><hr size=1> Hey just commenting a bit on the wiz vs bard (though i've never played a wiz, i did play a 60 bard bluebie but dueled alot before i came to SZ and made my chanter)<br>
One thing that can be effective that alot of people dont do against bards is dispel.  I know if i land a pillage or recant on bards it will strip their MR songs + selos, and the first thing they will try to put up is selos giving you 3s against them with no resist songs.  I normally tash and mez but obviously you cnat do that.  Alot of bards will go with only like 100MR because they have 2 stacking MR songs, so you might land a lucky root and then they die.  If you have an instaclicky dont wrry about their dispells and by the time they realize it isn't working they'll start doing drive bys, as i said dispel them and nuke or root.<br>
Gl though, btw any tips on a nonrapture chanter with no pet up killing a wizard with good MR?=P  Short of using 200pp for a stack of rune 5s<br>

<br>
IMO best line up is: Telecope, See invis,Jboots, chill sight,Ultravision, PR flower, resitant, Elemental, Shield of the arcane, Manasink, Shield of the Magi. U click telescope and See invis So u have 2 free slot u can dispell. Then if U get snared, U can dispell it right away w/o having to strip all your buffs (as u would have to do with your setup) I also have horse and Run 3 so dont care much for Jboots, bu this way, with Jboots of top, I can dispell snare right away =)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wizard: With the new PoP spell, wiz versus Wiz has become more then just who has the most HP and who casts the 1st Lure. <br>
IE: If I'd take Lightadam for example, who has about twice my HP unbuffed, I can't just lure him, cause even if I get 1st cast, he can waste me in no time. he also has way better spell then me. so the trick is to not let him cast right?  Telekin is useless versus him since he resist it all the time, so all I can do is cast Draugh of Thunded and Lure of ro, depending what he casts and all.<br>
<br>
Shaman: Those are a pain IMO. the one I fight have more then 5K HP. If they have the AA root and the Mini pet whatever it's called, you are pretty much dead. so to Tassaddar, Kylt and Ramic, I say Manaburn cause there is no way in hell I can kill them on on one with AA root and mini pet up. They have more HP then our rogues =/  And damn You Kylt for your HP over 6.2K buffed!  if I had KEI, I wouldn't of got KS'd by Smilo ^_~<br>
<br>
Druid: Lure, Lure, Draugh of Thunder, lure = down Unless They have a bugged horse and shout in Zone &quot; haha You gimp, you can't kill me&quot; duh, I can't kill u if from 1 feet away, Im OOR of spell cast huh Gideaon.<br>
<br>
SK : Yonder + levit + lure all the way with some draugh of thunder.<br>
<br>
Bards: huh...  if the bard is smart, u cannot really kill him cause he runs too fast! so Know your spell effects, and avoid their songs.<br>
<br>
Mage: haha if U have a horse, Dispell the pet, then run away.... far far away....  then come back, and watch the mage cry as he goes down , seeing that his pet will be too slow to come to the rescue.  Or U can just Nuke the mage to death, while tanking his pet , putting your back in a corner, so it does not interrupt u.<br>
<br>
Pally: Avoid the blade, Yonder, Lure are your best friend. If u know that pally has weak MR, be a meanie and lure him down to about 1 1/2 bubble of HP, and Telekin him, then lure once more. So he can't use LoH ^_~<br>
<br>
chanter: Rapture is a biotch...  So again, draugh of Thunder and lure or draugh of ro, depending on resist.<br>
<br>
Warrior. Lure then down.... if u have the mana. 8K HP to lure down can be a biotch <br>
<br>
Ranger: Hide behind trees and stuff to avoid the arrows, cause AM3 ranger hurts!<br>
<br>
Rogues: Just lure them down, should not take long =/<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note that I don't have most of my lvl 63-65 spells, otherwise Tears of axywhatever would be fun to play with, along with SoS.<br>

Being in a PK guild for sometime now I am constantly at war with someone.  Let me first say that i am a 55 wiz with 10aa's.   My primary place to PK is GD, KC, DL, VL, and HHK.   Here is my buff line up:<br>
<br>
telescope<br>
shifting sight<br>
chill sight<br>
jboots<br>
shield of magi<br>
Familiar<br>
PoM flower (or elemental shielding spell)<br>
PoM flower (or resistant skin)<br>
Manaskin<br>
c3 (when able)<br>
gmr (when able)<br>
levi or dmf<br>
<br>
For spells i use:<br>
Lure of Flame<br>
Ice Comet<br>
Tishans Discord<br>
Anull Magic<br>
Root<br>
Yonder<br>
Gate<br>
Harvest<br>
<br>
I always click off telescope and shifting sight for dot slots.   Always leave at least one open slot for WD it can kill you straight out.  It is nasty.  Ok, now that you are buffed it is time to fight.<br>
<br>
vs Druids:  Let me first say these guys are pretty nasty.  I usually open with dispell (druid w/o buffs is a dead druid).  By now if the druid is smart he has landed WD.  Anul yourself.  Now commence the beat down of a tree hugger.  Biggest thing vs a druid is to NOT chase him, unless he is almost dead.  If you chase him there is a good chance you will just lose him and that is what he wants.  I just wait where i was or hide somewhere out of sight and spam my IC key until he is in range (he will be tracking you).  Needless to say dont let him gate (this is where stun comes in.<br>
<br>
vs Melee: Yonder, Lure, Lure, IC... pretty easy, it is a good idea to dispell warriors because it is a bitch to lure down 6k hp if he has aego.<br>
<br>
vs Paladins:  Not worth the time and mana.  Honestly.. they can out heal your nukes, if they have loh up you are screwed... only way i ever beat paladins is if i can land bio orb on them and then i get a few good IC's off and lure them mid heal.<br>
<br>
vs Shadow Knights:  They are extremely easy, follow the yonder, lure, lure, IC.  Dont let them get within mele range because the easiest way to ruin your day is for them to chew through rune and pop HT.  If you are snared it isnt a big deal, yonder takes care of that.<br>
<br>
vs Clerics:  Again not worth the time or effort.  I usually dispell them down to nothing and gate.  At least i have the satisfaction of wasting their peridot.<br>
<br>
vs Shamans:  If you can blind them you will win... if not they are going to go defensive and heal themselves.<br>
<br>
vs Enchanters: If you sneak up on them you will win.  If i land an IC before he knows what hits him i can finish him with a lure mid tash/mez.  Enchanters have very little hp. On the other hand, if they sneak up on you you may be in a world of trouble.<br>
<br>
vs Mage:  Run off and root pet.  Return to nuke down the mage.  Very easy tactic and always works.<br>
<br>
vs Necro:  Same tactic as before, run off root pet and return to nuke the necro.. I like to nuke, yonder, yonder and then start spamming my IC button so i cast as soon as they are in range.  Remember that splurt can be anulled.   You can always leave splurt on you for about 30 seconds because it does about 20% of it's damage in the beginning of the spell.  Other then that Necro's are really easy.<br>
<br>
Well I hope that that helps you.  If you have any questions send me a tell on Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

<br>
Druids will range-ES you you down.  It'll bypass your epic/skins and eat at your crappy hps.  They'll stay at max range and dance.  They'll outheal any nukes you DO happen to land.<br>
<br>
Pet classes will put the pet on you.  Assuming you have a horse, you're outdoors, and you can channel through the pet (quadding bst/mage pets are tough to channel through) you might be able to get away...and right into the Shaman's big DoTs, assuming they didn't DoT you while you tried to debuff pets.  Or you'll walk into FoT from the mage.  The BST might be doable if you can catch him and get him to stay in range long enough to actually cast on him.<br>
<br>
Ice Comet?  In PvP?  Hihi 90 pts of damge.  IF you can get off that long-assed spell.  Draughts?  Worthless in &quot;even&quot; PvP due to resists until level 61+ draughts.<br>
<br>
UskeRZ, tell me - how are you going to blind a shaman of approx even level to you?  Orb him and watch it bounce off his MR?  <br>
<br>
Maybe people play differently on RZ, but most of those &quot;tactics&quot; simply won't work against a player with a clue.<br>
<br>
You vs Rapture chanter = your_death<br>
<br>
Why?  Resists and the 66% spell nerf.  They don't have to Tash you to Rapture you and their gear will give them decent resists vs Draughts.  You tag them twice for ~900 damage they've got you locked down.<br>
<br>
Melee = yonder lure lure IC?  Dude, who are you fighting that they've got that few hps?    Even low-end 50 SKs have over 2k hps and that ICs not even worth the paper it's scribed on at that level.  You'll need at least 5 Lures to drop him, and that's with him not-tapping and with your taking big melee damage from him.  With Warriors I hope you have a LOT of mana.  A 3k warrior will take 6-7 Lures and they're not going to just stand there and let you cast on 'em.  One or two bashes and you're dead.<br>
<br>
Rangers?  They'll out shoot you at range and get better crits to boot.  Give them AM3 and you're best off finding a good place to hide and hope they don't track you.<br>
<br>
If your tactics work on RZ, maybe I should switch servers 'cause they sure don't work on SZ.  =/<br>

People dont wear BD gear for fear of it being ganked.  90% of mid 50 pvp have resists in the 90 - 120 range because of this.  Sullon Zek has no fears of anything being stolen.  So unlike SZ we run around half naked until we get a coveted set of thurg armor.   Anyways, to make a long story short go back to your pussy no loot server, and dont comment on what you have no clue about. k thx~<br>

<br>
Casting Winds of Gelid in the n00bi3 grounds and being able to kill them all isn't exactly what I call &quot;PvP&quot;.<br>
<br>
Nor is Sunstriking down a level 30 &quot;just becuz&quot;.<br>
<br>
In any case - to address the recent posters - ya my tactics have drastically changed since the ORIGINAL post was written.  Notice the date eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
However, there are still a lot of things I still use like potions..I'm a huge fan of potions.  I spend all my plat on em cuz they make the difference.  Sure I may hafta blow 5 charges of stinging wort to kill that level 65 WIZ (I'm only 60), but hey, I won't be on a corpse run, I won't possibly be corpse camped, and I get to gloat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
In any case tho - most of my buff lineup/tactics are the same.  However now add in Manaburn (when to, when not to), of course updated spells, I think I only made a couple of buff lineup changes (Jboots, AoN, Eye of Inny)...<br>
<br>
I'm too lazy to actually update this post - however after re-reading it I feel most people will still walk away and have learned alot - not only by my original post, but also by the people who have shared their knowledge here within.<br>
<br>
See ya on the battlefield....<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just for you Aamdir I edited my buff lineup that I've been using since they changed the resist tables.<br>
