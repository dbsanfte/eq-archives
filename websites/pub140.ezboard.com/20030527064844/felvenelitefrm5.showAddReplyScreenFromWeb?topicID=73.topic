I've been scribing the story, but like any history, it's hard to explain anything without going back to the beginning.  Then you have to decide what the beginning is. Don't know if this is really it, but it's a start.   Long, long ago....<br>
/ooc<br>
<br>
<br>
Seyah shoved open the guildhall door, and entered the large common room.  It was empty, but a fire in the grate crackled a warm welcome.  Setting her pack down, she walked into the kitchen to see if Laenyel had already arrived.  She was looking forward to seeing her old friend.  In their youth they had been inseparable, but their diversity of professions had taken them to different parts of Norrath of late.   Laenyel was often away on quests, or looking for the rare ingredients for his recipes.  Seyah followed the creed given to her by her trainer, &quot;Go where you are needed&quot;.   For a cleric, that often meant where the battles were the fiercest, and lately that had been on Kunark.  It was not a very hospitable land, for a Koada'Dal. <br>
<br>
No dragoons here, Seyah reflected with satisfaction.  She made herself a cup of tea and picked up a scroll off the table to read the latest news while she waited for Laen.  Hearing the guildhall door open several minutes later, she looked up in anticipation, but was disappointed to see not another high elf, but an armored ogre coming through the door.  After so many seasons on Kunark, she had learned to tolerate almost all races, including the giant stupid ones.  Many were allies, and this one was even a guildmate.  She knew of Krushh from her fellow cleric Jiori, who fought with him often.  Still, she wished they would bathe. She could smell him from across the room.  Lifting her fragrant mug of tea to her face, she resumed her reading, hoping Krushh would pass through quickly and let the air clear.<br>
<br>
Instead the stench grew more pungent.  <br>
&quot;Jiori, cum wif me,&quot; said Krushh, now standing quite close.  <br>
<br>
A common error.  She and Jiori looked very similar, but there the resemblance ended.  Jiori was brash and irreverent, drank with dwarves and associated with ogres. Seyah was a lady, and much preferred the comfort of her own language and customs.  She avoided non-elven races when she could.  Hoping to get rid of him quickly, she answered him in elven. Perhaps the strange language would serve to point out their differences.  Jiori always spoke common. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not Jiori&quot;<br>
<br>
The massive ogre frowned, and scratched himself.  &quot;Go now, Jiori&quot;, he said.<br>
<br>
Irritated by his continued pollution of her air space, she fanned herself with the scroll.  Ogres were very thick in the head. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm NOT Jiori&quot;, she repeated.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the guildhall door opened again, and Laenyel glided in.  &quot;Laenyel!&quot;, she exclaimed.  Seeing her, he crossed the room toward her, wrinkling his nose at the smell then raising his eyebrow in a mute query.  <br>
<br>
&quot;This ogre thinks I'm Jiori.&quot; she told him.<br>
<br>
Laenyel was skilled in many languages.  He turned to the ogre and inclined his head, then began a guttural conversation.  Krushh turned to listen, then gesturing at Seyah, replied to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told him Jiori was not here.  He notices you are a cleric, and wants you to go with him.&quot;  Laenyel smiled faintly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drat it, I was looking forward to one of your feasts!&quot;  Seyah was pretty certain Krushh couldn't understand elven now, so she continued to speak to Laenyel in their childhood tongue.  &quot;And he smells!  Where is he going that he thinks he needs a cleric?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again Laenyel turned to translate, and the ogre replied to him.<br>
<br>
Laenyel said, &quot;He wishes to travel to Guk and slay frogloks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell him the frogloks have done me no harm, and I can't imagine he needs help to gather his supper... nevermind, I'll tell him myself,&quot; Seyah declared impatiently.<br>
<br>
Turning to the ogre, she switched to common tongue.  Pointing to herself, she declared &quot;Me no barsh fuud for Krushh!&quot;<br>
<br>
Krushh's frown lightened when he realized he could understand now what Seyah was saying.  Then he smiled, revealing sharpened teeth.  Seyah recoiled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;No barsh fuud for Krushh,&quot; Krushh declared happily.  &quot;Cleric fuud.  Undead&quot;<br>
<br>
Gritting her teeth, Seyah struggled with her inner turmoil.  On the one hand, he smelled bad and he was an ogre and she really would like to have a peaceful feast with Laenyel.  On the other hand...her eyes lighted as she thought of the thrill of crawling through a dungeon, something she never got to do on Kunark. Lower Guk was the home of her sworn enemies, the loathsome undead frogloks, as well.  And a warrior to heal!  It was but rare that she had had a warrior to practice her spells on.  She realized that both Laenyel and Krushh were staring at her, and she flinched slightly.  <br>
<br>
Turning to Laenyel, she asked, &quot;Will you come, Laen?&quot; It's been so long.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Laenyel nodded and said &quot;Better check with your friend, there.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Krushh had been watching their exchange, and as Seyah turned to him, he nodded at her.  &quot;Boom good.&quot;  He waved his hands to indicate a spell being cast.  He frowned, scratched himself, and spoke to Laenyel again in ogre.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Seems he's afraid of porting, but knows it's faster.  He's ready to go now.&quot;  Laenyel informed her.<br>
<br>
She thrilled to the adventure.  But the stench.  Something had to be done.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wouldn't he like to bathe before we depart?&quot;, she suggested.<br>
<br>
Laenyel chuckled. &quot;If there's a word in ogre for &quot;bath&quot;, I don't know it,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Seyah turned to look at Krushh again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Krushh bath&quot;  she said in common.<br>
<br>
Clearly he was puzzled.  &quot;What &quot;baff&quot;?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Water.  For dirt.&quot;  She mimed washing her face.  Krushh watched her intently.  He shook his head, deciding whatever it was she wanted was obviously not that important.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Dirt give AC&quot;  he declared.  &quot;Go now&quot;<br>
He turned to Laenyel, clearly steeling himself for a painful ordeal.<br>
<br>
They ported without incident, and ran across the dry grass toward the Innothule Swamp.  She could tell by his twinkling eyes that Laenyel was laughing at her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you laughing at?&quot; she queried, reverting to elven again.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are going to asphyxiate, between the swamp, the dungeon, and that ogre you've hooked us up with,&quot; he replied.  &quot;You'd better pray for rain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Immediately she sent up a prayer for rain, though she doubted it would be answered in this arid clime.  Soon they were squishing through the swamp.  Krushh paused, looking in the water.  Suddenly he grabbed up a froglok tad and quickly stuffed it into his mouth.  Seyah looked away.   &quot;Wizard hide Krushh?&quot; the ogre asked.   Despite herself, Seyah was impressed.  This ogre had some sense, to know that an invis would help them get to Lower Guk faster, and to know that Laenyel could cast that spell.<br>
<br>
Soon they were on their way again.  As they went past the guards of the door to Upper Guk, Seyah had an idea. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell him the way through the temple is faster, Laen,&quot; she said.  &quot;Tell him no tiny ladders this way.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Laenyel translated, and Krushh, nodding, followed the two elves to the right. Seyah plunged into the aquaduct that led to the temple, her two companions swimming behind her.  A few turns later and she crawled out triumphant on other end.  As Krushh climbed out behind her, their eyes met briefly, and she realized that he was definitely not your average stupid ogre.  Krushh looked down at his armor, rinsed of its grime.  Laenyel climbed out behind him, grinning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmph!&quot; grunted Krushh, giving Seyah a calculating look.  &quot;Baff.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/useyahmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeyahMT</A> at: 7/31/02 8:14:03 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
