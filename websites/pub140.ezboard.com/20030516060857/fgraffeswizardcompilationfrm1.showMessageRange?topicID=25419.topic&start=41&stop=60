<br>
Personally I have had some of my most fun in EQ dueling folk.  My last duel was my lvl 24 SK versus a lvl 27 rogue in my guild in Karnor's Castle.  The skeleton adds were fun - we'd kill the blasted things then go back to our duel.  He would go stealth mode then make strafing runs at me while I swung wildly at everything and bashed him when he did make contact.  Was a hoot!<br>
<br>
Anyways, I totally agree with the pvp concept on blue servers.  But there has to be rewards for good pvpers and consequences for griefers as has been stated.  Its not like there aren't ways to grief people as it is, ya know.  &quot;OMG they horrified our clerics!!!!&quot;  I think weeding out the griefers could be a nice side benefit to developing the pvp concept fully.<br>
<br>
BTW I remember the monster experiment that they tried very fondly.  I wish they would re-implement that!  Yeah I know it was uber-exploitable, but see my statement above about weeding out the griefers.<br>

It looks as if VI put a lot of thought in the current system.  In the case of a lot of people their first experiance with an MMORPG was loggin onto UO as a n00b, trying to learn the lay of the land and all of a sudden your dead....most left and didn't come back after that.  <br>
<br>
I am still trying to understand the scope of the animosity that I have seen from some of the zek server players and the so clled &quot;carebear&quot; servers.  I have heard it said that the zeks were placed in game to protect the blue servers from those very types of players.  Of course irregardless the griefers will find a way despite the rules.<br>
<br>
I agree that pvp is tied to roleplaying which in all honesty is something this game sorely needs.  There should be a way of rewarding roleplaying in PVP while at the same time punishing those who seek to exploit the system to gain amusement at another's expense.  <br>
<br>
Here are some ideas:<br>
<br>
Faction PVP:  Simply make it legal for you to PVP a opposite alignment person in you own home city.  While playing my SK I would often go through Third Gate and there would usually be a Mage parked in one of the distant mansions killing an NPC.  Under this system just by walking in the zone makes him a target.  This system could be confusing in areas like West Freeport where good and evil alignments can walk safely.<br>
<br>
Zonewide PVP:  This would be great for events.  Instead of leaving your guild to join a guildwar guild.  When the event starts a zonewide message would go across the zone.  If you don't want to get PKed get out.  Some kind of warning could be worked in as well. Wars are fine and good but on a side note they generate way too much lag.<br>
<br>
Controlled Zones:  Similar to the player enforced zones on the Zeks.  Some zones would be labeled good neutral or evil.  Evil would include all the evil cities, Nektulos forest, Feerott.  Would be fun to see all the zones adjoining Cabilis PVP...this would make hunting in Kunark very interesting.  Good zones would be all good cities, Greater Faydark, Qeynos Hills, Butcherblock Mountains, Misty Thicket.  Keep the existing cap on PVP intact though although it would be interesting to see another pvpstandard for those under level 10 that can only attack those under level 10.  In some of the disputed areas you could have battles to determine who controlls the zone, maybe whichever side has the most kills gets control.  <br>
<br>
I personally think the designers should have paid more attention to the cities.  Back in the old days people used to raid cities for fun.  What if there was a quest or item based reason to do so? Only in Velious do you see anything resembling this anymore.  <br>

<br>
Again the REASON people play on a blue server is to play against the GAME, not other players.<br>
<br>
If you want to play against other players.<br>
<br>
1. Go to the priest of discord. You will become a player killer on a blue server, thus you can PVP all you want against other players on a blue server. The SEVER LACK of Player killers on blue servers SHOWS that the majority of players do NOT want to engage in PVP.<br>
<br>
2. PVP is already implimented on BLUE servers. If you want to fight, go to an arena.<br>
<br>
3. If you want to fight anywhere, make yourself a player killer and kill other player killers, or get in a guild and do a /guildwar.<br>
<br>
4. /duel people. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=554190">Gemlin - 65 Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I like killing high end content without worrying about watching my back. If I want to play on a PVP system, I'll just log on to Sul/Ral Zek servers and have a ball.<br>
<br>
-I would severly be against any implimention of a player killing system. This would lead to other guilds trying to take out your clerics before you could get to raid zones, or killing another key class. <br>
<br>
-DO What I do, if your in a Player killing mood, start dueling people, or Log on to a ZEK server. Thats why verant gave you choices on servers, you can create more than one character.<br>

PvP is poorly implemented and a lot of the fun and satisfaction actually comes from enforcing server &quot;standards&quot; such as LnS, which are not VI implemented.  Sure shit happens and people break the &quot;rules&quot; but generally speaking they are followed fairly well and though the losing guild is usually pissed as all hell, life goes on and they leave.  <br>

  <br>
(just to restate, the question is, &quot;Why is becoming PvP-enabled (PoD) on a blue server such a PERMANENT choice - and would there be any problems/abuses if there were a relatively simple way to toggle your PvP status off again?&quot;)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. Go to the priest of discord.

I think your conclusion is somewhat unsubstantiated here.  Many people on blue servers enjoy PvP action - but I would wager that it is the PERMANENCE of making the choice to &quot;go Red&quot; on a Blue server deters a lot of people from doing so.<br>
<br>
I personally play mainly on a Zek, and although mass PvP at a high level can get very close to greifing (long-term CCing of an entire guild is the equivalent of cock-blocking on blue servers), casual PvP action is actually quite fun.  And if I'm not mistaken, that is what Nextonex is looking for.  A simple way to temporarily dip into the PvP world without having to change servers or start an entirely new character from scratch on a Zek.  PvPing against friends is half the fun, anyway, and unless you can convince them to make toons on a Zek too, you'll never be able to run around WK or some other non-Arena zone with a dozen friends all duking it out.  (Arena zones are VERY limiting in terms of PvP strategies, and facing multiple opponents makes things a lot more interesting/fun).  <br>
<br>
On a side note: Nextonex, I liked your idea of making people in your group/raid immune to AoEs in PvP.  Would be a nice change on the Zeks, too, although I'm sure mass PvP would turn into Rain city pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just my 2cp.<br>
<br>
Edit  -  although it's not really on-point to Nextonex's question, with respect to Gemlin's concerns about people running in and dotting someone, and letting them take an exp death, or more people training and justifying it with PvP as an excuse:  currently, the majority of people (on Tallon, at least) are pretty good about PKing.  If someone is engaged with a mob, they'll wait until it is dead before attacking.  If accidental exp deaths due to PvP action do occur, most people (guilded, anyway) will arrange for a rez for the victim (90-96%).  <br>
Realistically, griefers are griefers:  changing the PvP system on blue servers won't make non-griefers into griefers.  The people that train you after a PvP change are the same ones that will train you now.  Taking actions like that will ruin their reputation pretty quickly, regardless of whatever lame excuse they try to provide.  Besides, you guys actually see GMs on your servers occasionally, so you have recourse to deal with them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarbonius>Zarbonius</A> at: 3/19/03 2:54:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seaotter42>SeaOtter42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 3:01:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=53>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
PvP on blue servers isnt supposed to have a reward. If any sort of reward system existed for PvP then players who don't want to PvP would miss out on content simply due to not wanting to PvP. This undermines the whole point of having non-PvP servers. If PvP was so popular, the PvP servers would rank a little higher on the population chart. As it is now, the Zeks are comparatively empty. <br>
<br>
If you dont like the existing PvP options on the blue servers, don't use them, but don't expect PvP rewards on a blue server, because it wouldnt be fair to people who have come to expect to experience *all* available game content without having to engage in PvP. <br>

SeaOtter, I could be wrong, but aren't people who don't like PvP already missing out on the content of GM-run PvP events?  GM events can be (arguably) some of the more interesting content in the game.  I'm also not sure how adding an additional dimension (eg. increased roleplay via faction-based PvP) to the game, all of which was completely *optional* (i.e. red players can still only PK other red players) would detract from the enjoyment that non-red players would take from the game.  That's like saying adding more tradeskill items is unfair to people who don't want to tradeskill, no?<br>
<br>
The Zeks are emptier than other servers because PvP is a full-time system there, and not many people are willing to put up with the major pain in the ass that it can be at times (go start a non-twinked rogue on a PvP server, and you'll see what I mean).  But if you could bring only the best aspects of PvP from the Zeks to the blues and leave the negatives behind, why wouldn't you?  Especially if it's all optional? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarroslivinglight>ZarrosLivinglight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 3:34:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.e-cadfael.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/larger/70x100/70_057.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> Here's a twist on PvP that might be fun.<br>
<br>
Give players the ability to join existing factions in-game.  By doing so they become PvP+ to the enemies of said faction, and can PK them in return.  Meaning a shadow knight could join the Coldain faction, and would become PvP+ to anyone allied with the Kael giants as well as being able to PK them.<br>
<br>
This would be turned on by visiting an NPC in the faction's headquarters (Thurgadin in the case of the Coldain) and telling them &quot;I want to join&quot; which would incur +faction for them and -faction for their enemies (on an NPC level).  It could then be turned off by telling them &quot;I wish to quit&quot; which would incur a faction hit for that faction only (their enemies are still mad at you though.)  <br>
<br>
A limitation would be that you could only be a member of one faction at a time.  And they would have limited numbers of enemies.  One could walk up to the Indigo Brotherhood in Neriak and be able to engage in PvP conflict with those who joined the Emerald Warriors, Knights of Truth, and Guardians of the Vale.  Joining the Freeport Militia would make you PvP+ for those allied with the Knights of Truth.<br>

Basically you start neutral (-PvP) and have the choice of joining the Rebel Alliance or the Empire.<br>
The thing is, EQ's faction system isn't as black and white as that. While I think this could work in some areas of the game, such as Velious, the rest of the game just doesn't support it.<br>
<br>
Imagine if factions were the PvP switch; Being KoS to a faction opened you to attacks from players that are allied with that faction. This could work, and since factions can be changed pretty easily, it would allow players to move from +PvP status to -PvP status with relative ease.<br>
Since all factions between KoS and Ally would be -PvP, it'd allow people to choose their own allys, and even cater to those that don't want to PvP ever.<br>
<br>
Rewards? Think about all the quests you have to be allied with a race in order to complete; There are tons. <br>
So, by becoming a races ally, you'd be able to do those quests and reap their rewards, but you'd be open to PvP while you were allied. Once you've finished the quest, you could drop your faction back to Warmly, and you'd no longer be +PvP.<br>
<br>
The problem is there is a large portion of the games factions which are impossible to raise (like Goblin faction in Kunark, or Ring of Scale faction), and many factions don't have a opposite (Dwarves Vs Frost Giants, Dragons Vs Storm Giants). In order for a system like this to work, it'd require a serious overhaul of how the current faction system works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1163<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 5:36:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=57>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> Before Gem can respond yet another time with his macro, in case anyone is still unsure, pvp is implemented on blue servers.  <br>
<br>
Let me explain what I meant by rewards.  I probably shouldn't have used the phrase risk versus reward, but rather risk and no reward.  If you start a red (pk) player on a blue server, he is doomed to never enjoy content that he cant do without help from players that are non-pk.  Good luck finding a guild and enjoying the high end content if you go red.  <br>
<br>
The permanence of the red player designation causes most players (myself included) to shy away from using it.  Its silly to go red at all, in fact.  I'm with Nek, the 'going red' aspect of pvp could use a tweak on the blue servers.  His suggestion is a good one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1683<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 10:12:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> I agree I would try going PvP red on blue servers if I knew I could almost as easily change it back for a guild raid or if some idiot was being a greifer and camping my corpse I could change it back and go get my corpse without being attacked.<br>
<br>
I like this toggle Idea and I don't see how a griefer could easily abuse it and it would alow for &quot;Casual&quot; PvP and still alow people to do things with guilds and people not interested in PvP.<br>
<br>
Though I don't think there should be a time limit on toggling, just a monetary cost like 1pp per level of the character to change it back.  So if your level 1 and you go PvP you must spend 1pp to change it back.  If your level 65 and go PvP you have to pay 65pp to change it back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gemlin>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/20/03 8:08:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> There is a toggable flag.<br>

I don't think a faction based PVP would ever make it to a blue server, there are too many unknowns, and PvE was never designed with that in mind, though it does sound cool, I'd love to be able to spank some DE's killing my evlan brotheren, but in reality, it won't happen.<br>
<br>
That being said, Gemlin, Where would be the harm in turning off the Voulentary PVP tag using a Priest of Discord, after a specified time, at a reasonable cost to the players.<br>
<br>
The more I think about this, the more fun I think it would be.
