<br>
These are the current requirements for Sublimity -<br>
<br>
Bard - lvl 60+ <br>
Beastlord - lvl 60+<br>
Cleric - lvl 55+ with high mana pool for cheal rotation<br>
Druid - lvl 60+ with epic<br>
Enchanter - lvl 65<br>
Magician - lvl 57+<br>
Monk - 60+ with epic, run seed 3<br>
Necromancer - 60<br>
Paladin - 60<br>
Ranger - 60 with at least 18aa<br>
Rogue - 60 with epic<br>
Shadowknight - 65 + 40aa<br>
Shamen - 60 with epic, torpor, malo<br>
Warrior - 60 with Natural Durability 3, Run speed 3...must have at least 4k hp unbuffed and ability to hold aggro( only raids with us can tell that) If you are diety Rallos Zek might consider you if you are just barely under requirements.<br>
Wizard - 60+ with giantbane<br>
<br>
All applications must have a click item(such as shrunken goblin skull earing) enduring breath item, able to get all resist 100+, You must know your class and how to control aggro. Need to be able to play alot from 5pm - 12pm cst and especially on Wednesday Friday Saturday. You arnt expected to play every day but you are expected to play most of the time.<br>
<br>
your requirements themselves say you must use, cheat, steal as much game content from other people to get to these specs before your even worth our time.. very, very, very anti social<br>
<br>
people who want more 50+ in their guild and actually work for it rather than bottom feed off the hard work of others simply do more 40's stuffs for thier members in that range and guesse what ?!?!?  more 50's  <br>
<br>
i can see why you and people like you want to keep manaburn nerfed as that it gives access to the small portion of the game you are trying to monopolize for yourselves to other people also<br>
<br>
so.. no answer ? i take it your silence is comfirmation of everything that i said then<br>
<br>
there are fixes to manaburn that have been posted worth exploring.. i like the idea of no mana use but incuring other penalties instead.. failing that the only other direct fix is to look at the availability of the content ingame already avail to wizards that MB was put ingame in the first place to address<br>

<br>
a group zoned into skyfire last night.  cleric, warrior, SK, monk, druid, shaman.<br>
<br>
druid ran out, pulled talendor to the zone.<br>
<br>
warrior hit hotkey.  sk hit hotkey.  monk hit hotkey.  shaman hit hotkey.  druid sat down.  warr, sk, monk, and shaman hit a few more hotkeys.<br>
<br>
few seconds later, cleric hit a hotkey or two.<br>
<br>
druid, i think, may have gotten up and hit a hotkey.<br>
<br>
talendor died.  cleric was at 80m.  druid FOM.  shaman FOM.  sk FOM. everyone full health.<br>
<br>
warr, sk, monk, sham, dru, cler all /rand 100.<br>
<br>
exactly what was your point?  other than im pretty sure none of those guys really knew how to actually waltz.<br>

the only direct fix without the MB issue adding additional content to the game or to rework how MB now works for the wizard class is to look at the availability of the content already ingame that MB was put in as a balance to achieve it<br>

regardless, if they want to change it, change it.  but for the negative changes, they need to put in positives, or lower the cost significantly.  its simple economics, in a sense.<br>
<br>
only one MB per minute?  k, 5 points instead of 9.<br>
<br>
focus and AA skills dont affect it? k, 3 points instead of 5.<br>
<br>
or, lower recast significantly.  or lower mana cost.  i dont really give a flying $hit what they do, but i respent the @#$%$@#%$ points on it again, because they quite specifically said they were satisfied with the damage it does, and only were changing the time for casts between mb'rs.  and only then to find they deceived us and stealthed in a damage nerf, significant i might add.<br>
<br>
id like a steady, dependable 7500 damage, use up to half my mana, if im under half, use whatever i have, but still give me 7500 damage.  if im full of mana, i still have half my mana left.  feel free to put in a self stun component, or res effects, but its still 12 points in MC, and 9 for MB, therefore i want something comparable to what was released for this price.  and as it stands, its only nearly half that. <p><b>Cremator Incinerator.<BR>

Not 4 groups of wizards. Your typical guild, even with 50 players present, can easily wipe to him. You see the imbalance? 13 wizards who are dubious or better to CoV faction can kill a mob 50 people can't. And these wizards don't do anything but push 1 single button and 5 seconds later the mob is dead.<br>

That is what does not make sense.  Don't GSS, Strike of Solusek, EER, and AT trivialize Kunark content?  Dont AM3, EQ, and Trueshot trivialize Kunark content?  Doesn't level 65 warrior damage mitigation trivialize Kunark encounters?  Doesn't command of druzzil trivialize encounters?<br>
<br>
Nerfing one characters AA abilities does not preserve content.  A better solution to preserve content is to make specific mobs immune to the attacks that trivialize them, or give up on trying to preserve them.  The mobs in PoV/PoS hit harder, faster, and have nearly as many HP as the kunark dragons.  Apparently evolution has left them behind.<br>
<br>
While I don't think monopolizing epic spawns is a nice thing to do or a decent thing to do, nerfing an entire classes abilities because 2% of the class are jerks does not sit well with me either.  This ability was NOT exploited, nor was it overpowering...  it is just high level content applied to low level mobs.  In the same pattern, I think VI should take measures to preserve the content of SolB and Lguk, for it is much to easy to kill the magi and efreeti... /sarchasm off<br>

Thats 7692 combined dps (a rough estimate, in reality its more). A number no other class can match with so little people.<br>
<br>
Think of how that ruins future content. With the old manaburn still in game new content such as mobs with maybe only 20k hp but AEing for 2k unresistable damage every 6 seconds would not be an option. They would have to resort to luclin end game style bosses where the melee go afk for 30 minutes and the battle is not based on strategy but the cleric's ability to mod rod and keep mana up. Is that fun to you? <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaeldayanie>vaeldayanie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/02 5:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: manaburn vs. nuking...</span><hr size=1> Outside of Kunark and some velious encounters (read vindi and below) 100K damage is not really relevant.  The nerf can 13 wizards kill a dragon with 100K hp (sontalek)? yes.  Could 40 wizards band together and kill King Tormax?  probably if they could get there.  This is a horribly inefficient way to use you your wizards in a post kunark sense.  They are better off from a dmg perspective to slow burn mobs.  100k is a nice dent in some high end content, but most wizards I know that have MB are capable of easily doing at least 20-30k damage in the same fight by actually casting nukes.  So, if you have your 13 wizards manaburn you are wasting a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
All manaburn really let us do was ass rape kunark encounters and maybe made some velious encounters a little easier.  It is a spell that actually had less true value than most people perceived.<br>

think of the future... Maybe a mob that hase unresistable AE for 2k dmg and 50% slow, hits like AoW, but only has 30-50 thousand hp would be an interesting encounter but manaburn would trivialize it too much. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaeldayanie>vaeldayanie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/17/02 7:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sorry</span><hr size=1> sorry to bump this so late, couldn't get on for a couple of days.<br>
<br>
The days of a 30-50K HP raid mob encounter are over anyway and with that few HP's unless the mob AE death touched, that wouldnt be much of an encounter.  Most good guilds would have that mob wasted in under a minute.<br>
<br>
In summation, I think MB was situationally a stupid target for a nerf.  The effect really has limited usefullness other than impressing your friends.  All Sony had to do in order to protect the content and the skill was take the 5 or so Mobs that it completely trivialized (VS, Son, Tal, Gore, Sev, Wuoshi, and the other completely exposed and unprotected kunark/velious content) and make them immune to the attack.<br>
<br>
You didnt see much bragging about wizards MBing Trak because he was hidden away in a dungeon, 6 wizards could easily kill him, but it would have been a real pain in the ass to get to him.  <br>
<br>
The point that I am trying to make in my posts here is that one way or another all old world content is trivialized by the abilities gain in the next set of expansions.  Killing trak or gore now is insignificant when compared to that same accomplishment in the pre velious era.  Why?  Mudflation, AA's, and Lvl Cap raises.  All of these factors unbalance and trivialize previous encounters.  Sony has 3 choices in how to deal with this....<br>
<br>
A) hit every ability that nerfs this blindly with the nerf bat (seems to be the answer of choice lately)<br>
<br>
B) Ignore it (tried that, but greedy wizards made it so that they couldn't anymore)<br>
<br>
C)  Make the exploited/trivialized mobs immune/resistant to the attacks that trivialize them.  Seems a simple solution but I am sure it is marginally more difficult than A so they will not do it.<br>

Do you think that Sony envisioned tanks with 9500hp, rangers that bow crit for 2k, wizards that crit for 5-6k, FT15, or any of the other abilities we see now when they designed the kunark encounters?  I doubt it and if they did, what are they supposed to do now?  go back and retrofit trak with about 400K more HP, an upgraded AE, flurry's, rampages, and enrages?  They can't do that because if they do then they will take the encounter away from the people that is supposed to be conserved for.  All encounters become trivial over time....  give up trying to conserve them.  Yes, one day all kunark encounters will be as trivial as the magi in guk.<br>

id like a steady, dependable 7500 damage, use up to half my mana, if im under half, use whatever i have, but still give me 7500 damage. if im full of mana, i still have half my mana left. feel free to put in a self stun component, or res effects, but its still 12 points in MC, and 9 for MB, therefore i want something comparable to what was released for this price. and as it stands, its only nearly half that. <br>

<br>
As it stands now, Necromancers have an AA ability called Lifeburn.  Basically, it drains their hp into a single blast nuke.  It also has a minor heal / lifetap effect.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, Manaburn would be far more useful if it worked the same way, for mana that is.<br>
<br>
BTW, Lifeburn has the same limitation as Manaburn in terms of time between casts. <p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="350">

It still is the highest single target UNRESISTABLE direct damage spell in the game.  That coupled with the fact it has unusually low aggro for the amount of damage it deals will always be useful in certain situations.<br>
<br>
That being said would very much like to see the cap removed from Manaburn.  As is 9492 is pretty damn pathetic, given attainable manapools are well into 6K. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fenturiistari>fenturiIstari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/27/03 8:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good old manaburn</span><hr size=1> mana burn was taken out because druids who have every other perk in the game were jelious of wizzards having a perk.<br>
<br>
It took about 4 wiz and most took a healer of some sort to kill VS.<br>
<br>
These &quot;ubers&quot; are now 65th with 150aa.... <br>
I bet a cleric, war, rog, shammy could kill VS with 4 just like the 4 wizzys used to.<br>
<br>
humm a cleric and a chanter can clear the whole BoT a THIRD TIER pop zone! not some old kunark dragon! and named BoT with just them.. even dual boxing...  <br>
<br>
Um, ever read lifeburn on necro's?  now add virtue, and 65th shammy buffs..  lifeburn was not nerfed like Mb cuzz no one bitched and complaned.<br>
<br>
It was taken out not for game balance but to shut the people up who were jelious.<br>
<br>
I say fine, take MB.. please give me cheal, track, charm, buffs, DS, ... Oh wait... thats a druid... humm.<br>
<br>
Bane spells should have componet cost lowered.<br>
<br>
Portal frags should be removed or at least sold in POK.<br>
<br>
SF port should go to the same place as druids... not the death trap<br>
<br>
61+ DD spells should hit harder. But mostly something &quot;fun or new&quot; should have been added not a no thought re-tread like we got.<br>
<br>
They add in a nuking dragon pet.... and give it to mages /bog<br>
<br>
Wizards need a new line of spells to make them a desirable class for groups. Do it with the new frog expansion... rare magic known only to the frogs has surfaced... bane of ribbit a 250pt DD proc that can be cast as a buff for melee.<br>

<br>
Well as proposted I think was a good idea, but still... too powerful for us too great an advantage when thinking of it. Well then I thought about LB.. it taps HP back to the Nec, Umm what if MB hit the target and the recycled back to the wizard slowly, but regained all the mana he used on the MB over a course of time maybe that time it takes for the MB effect to weare off.<br>
<br>
I hope VI find some selution to this, bc I invested in it again, but it is too much cost for alittle usefullness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
