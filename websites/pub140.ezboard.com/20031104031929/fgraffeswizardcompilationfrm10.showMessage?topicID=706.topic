Some want our spells to do more damage, some want it to be an automatic damage upgrade.  Some look at items and say that focus items should do it.<br>
<br>
Well, we need to look at this from the angle of how much damage we do over time, but also not in the form of just saying, &quot;Better mana regen&quot;, or &quot;More damage output&quot;.  Instead, let's look at this from a more fundamental level.<br>
<br>
If we take a melee with the very very very best weapon(s) available, no buffs, no haste, no disciplines, no AA skills to improve damage.  Take the damage output of that melee.  <br>
<br>
Next, take a wizard, give us Elnerick's(Garrisons hasn't been found and may not even drop).  Now, this is 1890 damage for 525 mana in 7.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
How long does it take the melee to do that 1890 damage?  The time it takes should be roughly the same as it would take for us to regen that 525 mana.<br>
<br>
If you take this as being roughly balanced for damage output, from a melee perspective, the wizard could do a HUGE level of damage, and could outdamage the melee in the short term, but would then need to meditate back up.  This seems a bit unfair from the perspective of the melee.<br>
<br>
From the perspective of the wizard, we clearly would die if we were to do this, our hit points, and our ability to withstand an attack give us a weakness.  Also, this does not take into account how strength, stamina, and buffs increase the damage output of the melee classes.  So, when all is said and done, the benefit of buffs to a melee class would generally balance this out in the short term, but to keep it balanced long term, caster damage SHOULD be a bit higher.<br>
<br>
Now, we KNOW that to give EVERY caster the proper damage output to compete with the most uber of melees would also be wrong.  So, we add focus items to the picture.  In theory, the effect of a focus item SHOULD be different from item to item.  So a level 49 damage increasing focus item should do more than one for a level 29, and should do less than a level 60+ focus item for how much it boosts damage output.<br>
<br>
Melee disciplines are there to boost abilities for a short time, and these should in theory balance out against a caster chain-casting.<br>
<br>
But no matter how else people try to say, &quot;We should get an inherant bonus to damage&quot;, or any other method, it's clear that when it comes down to it, the boost we get from focus items, and NOT in other ways should be the key to being balanced.  These focus items, like melee weapons, should be available as both NO DROP, as well as available to be traded.  They should not be level restricted in the normal sense since melee weapons in general are not level restricted.  And if we find that focus items do not achieve this level of balance, so that the most uber of wizards can't compete long-term with melees, then we will know that Verant's idea for focus items has failed.<br>
<br>
I know that this is a class balance issue, yet I'm curious to see if there are any flaws in this argument, and suspect that the class balance forum doesn't have as many people who even look at the posts.<br>

Fixed?  I think the term &quot;Adjusted&quot; would fit the situation better.  But I disagree with the path you are attempting to take.<br>
<br>
The Wizard's biggest problem, as I see it, deal with damage per second.  And most people attempt to generate this number with an equation like this (Max damage per cast / casting time + recast time + recovery time).  The problem I see with this is it does not take into effect med time, and can not be used effectively with AE spells.<br>
<br>
So I have tried a new equation (damage * number of mobs affected / CT + RT+ recover + med time)<br>
<br>
The old equation states Elnerick's Electrical Rending has a damage/sec of 189.  The new equation gives the same spell a damage/sec of 14, without any buffs strictly straight med by a level 60.  <br>
<br>
We all know melee are claiming damage/second numbers of 100+.  If we adjusted the damage in the new equation to get the d/s equal to 100.  The spell would now do 13600 damage per cast.  We reduce the mana on the spell to generate the 100 d/s.  Now we would have to reduce the mana by 93%.  This would allow the wizard to do 158,760 in a full burn of all his mana chain casting this spell.  Now if we adjusted the amount of mana wizards regen we can obtain 100 d/s.  It would only take obtaining FT items that would allow 330 mana regen per tick.  This option allows VI to keep full burn damage the same, max damage per spell the same.  But it allows wizards to become solo gods.  <br>
<br>
Therefore I submit to all of you that VI has their back against the wall when it comes to wizard balance.  As with all these adjustments it places wizards more powerful than the &quot;Vision&quot; allows.<br>
<br>
Possible solutions?  possibly hard code an adjustment in the grouping code that adjusts the mana wizards regen according to the number of people in the group.  This would eliminate the solo gods title.  Yet increase d/s.  <br>
<br>
I personally believe that wizards are damage dealers and need to be balanced against the other damage dealers in the game.  Even if those other damage dealers are melee.  But right now it is impossible with the current spell system in my opinion.<br>

That's why I don't give the exact number that's needed to boost us.  Also, as I mention, focus items, if they boost our damage output by a decent level WILL do the job in balancing the class. <br>
<br>
Now, I disagree with you on how fast our mana regen should be.  Yes, it SHOULD be faster, but our ability to pump out a bar of mana against a mob or mobs is balanced against the melee disciplines.  Add ot this that we are talking about the difference between inherant ability vs. ability caused by items(melees).  This is why focus items should be the source of a lot of the balance.<br>
<br>
A naked melee is fairly useless in any fight that gives experience.  A naked caster with spells is often able to handle mobs.  This is why simply boosting the ability of casters without having equipment being the key factor would only cause more problems.<br>
<br>
So, focus items reducing casting times, increasing damage, reducing agro, and increasing spell duration(such as roots, DOT spells, and even rains) would go a long way to solving our issues.  And to be honest, being able to do huge damage on one bar of mana without equipment would be a bit overpowered IF it were possible to do this without equipment.  I agree that increasing our damage/second is key to the whole balance issue, I simply see the need to have it be a function of equipment rather than any other method.  <br>

I would like to address a quote from you real fast as it confused me.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't understand how our ablitiy to burn a full bar of mana is balanced against the melee disiplines?  We have the ability to burn a full bar starting at level 1 yet melee disiplines start at level 51.<br>
<br>
I am just starting to dive into the fray on the inherant ablities vs item ablities.  I only see this as a real problem during the low level portion of the game.  Where as in the high end, items mean so much to all classes. With a naked wizard while they still have their spells their mana pool can be cut in half or better.  Yes a naked melee may be useless in any battle that gives exp.  The usefullness of a wizard is also drastically diminished.  <br>
<br>
Now as for Focus items.  I see focus items being similar to the 10/22 weapons.  There are a large number of 10/22 weapons in the game.  Some with stat boosts, and some with spell effects.  To clarify I see the focus items generating diversity for casters.  So the casters can customize their toon to meet the needs they see placed before them.  I do not see focus items balancing the wizard class.<br>
<br>
Like I stated increasing the damage/second is the only way I can see of increaseing the damage/minute and damage/hour.  I disagree with the idea that by increasing the damage of a spell by 20% or even 80% will increase the damage/second.  The down time, the meditation time is the killer.  When all our post 50 (single target) DD's average 320 mana a spell, it takes a level 60 (no buffs straight med) approx 75 seconds to gain that back.  <br>
<br>
Balance needs to be the first and foremost issue.  I don't want to be a god class.  I want to be balanced, needed, useful and welcome in a group class.  And the only way I see this happening is through adjusting the mana regen on wizards.  If that is done through hard-code, or items I don't really care.  I just don't want it done through buffs.  Because with buffs you have to be in the group to get the buffs and the biggest problem we have is getting in the group.  Once all the damage dealers have been balanced across the board.  Then that gives the Dev team a way to balance other parts of the game such as agro and item distribution.<br>
<br>
If they did look at this idea, and decided to implement it.  I could foresee a mix of items and hard code as the best way to go about it. <br>

I was talking more in terms of overall balance, if the focus items are implemented to balance us.  IF we were to be balanced long term, so that the damage we do with spells/second+mana regen time for those spells were balanced against melee damage output.<br>
<br>
So, the game is balanced, melees doing long term what a wizard does in a single nuke(with focus items to improve casting speed, and to add damage), and counting the regen time of the mana so the wizard keeps to the same general damage output.  Now, the wizard ability to cast down a bar of mana quickly is what I mean is offset by the melee disciplines.  Our regen time in this case would let us continue to keep up with melee damage output on an ongoing basis.  The melee &quot;spurts&quot; of damage would be used up and our ability to burn down a bar of mana is &quot;used up&quot;, so the balance is kept.<br>
<br>
I know the classes arn't balanced right now, we STILL don't have our focus items, so we can't even see if they balance us, but once they go in, if we find that melee disciplines and equipment are able to let them continue to outdamage us in the long term, things might be BETTER, but things will still be broken.  Wizard/caster damage output plus regen time MUST be balanced against melee damage output(that has no regen time).  We may need to push for more mana regen if focus items don't do it, or for a boost to the level that clarity provides, but that's for later and would be speculation about how good focus items will really be.<br>

Not a lot of thought in this, mostly something to build on.  I'm just typing as they hit me.  I will have to look at melee disciplines to really hone this one out.<br>

<br>
So we turn it around and say that us being able to chain cast is the reason we don't get disciplines.  We CAN chain cast to do a lot of damage quickly, but then we are limited by the mana regen, which balances our damage output against the melee classes.  With focus items and mana regen buffs as well as Flowing Thoughts items, it MIGHT work out this way, if Verant would ever put the promised items in.  With no patch this week, it will be 5 or more weeks since Absor said, &quot;In the next few weeks&quot;.  <br>

I'm lvl 35 and in a group killing hill giants the other night we has 1 warrior (36), a druid, (32) and a ranger (27). I found that every fight we had I was doing 75% of the total dmg to the mob. This was because the warrior was not twinked. I know nothing about the end game, but at my lvl i don't feal underpowered. The way I see it is that the problem is pure and simply twinking, figure a way to stop twinking and we would be ok again. Yes melees can sustain their damage over time, where we have to med. But they also don't have the option to burn things down if it all goes bad. I can't count the number of times i've saved the melee's lives burn burning down bad pulls when they would have been mashed. Pitty is they rarely remember this, and they have no idea how much damage a good wiz can do when they want too. It makes me laugh when they get a bad pull, you save their ass, then they complain that they are ready for another and you have to med! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133269">Nepenthes</a>

Druids use DOT spells, so can cast and sit and let the DOT do much more than any DD spell over the duration of the spell for the mana cost.  <br>
<br>
I still feel that focus items have the POTENTIAL to balance casters 90 percent of the way if they are implemented correctly.  The mage items are an example, but I hope that the real thing has weak focus items for lower level, and more powerful focus EFFECTS at higher level.  I also hope since Verant has refused to limit twinking by putting level restrictions on melee equipment that they don't limit twinking of powerful focus items to low level casters.  What's fair is fair, even if it's a stupid design to allow this sort of thing.<br>
