The door was in the Eternal city of the High Elves, Felwithe, his home, and the secret passageway it revealed led to unbelievable stories.  Behind this secret door he would crouch, breathless, with the great General Jyleel bare paces away.  And here he would listen to the stories of heros, the selfless knights of Tunare, the Paladins of Felwithe...Koada'Vie.<br>
<br>
Faced with the tales of the nearby orc wars, the villainous Tier'dal to the south, the undead menace in the forests of far off Antonica, and the mysteries of newly found Kunark, following the simple lives of his Tradesfolk parents stood little chance.  He shadowed the great Elves, asking only to learn, until he was finally accepted as squire and acolyte.  He crafted a rough bow from hickory (his father's craft), and received from his father an amazing gift, a sword that Somma had not known existed.  He handed over an ancient short sword, saying only, &quot;I killed an orc once with this.&quot;  <br>
<br>
From the figure who had never raised a hand against him, or his voice against another, Somma would not have thought it possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
But this was so long ago, and so so far away, and that child was dead, and now a second of the fearsome Ashenbone Drakes had appeared, great skeletal dragons whose wingtips screeched as they slid across the sides of the closepacked buildings.  A darkskinned Enchanter stepped forward, attempting to mesmerize the beast before the scales could tip against our force, but she was flung aside by a clawed fist, coming to rest broken and still beneath the dark wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's too late!  Protect the Clerics!&quot;  More of Innouruk's minions joined the fight, as the Holy Ones began their attempts to step...beyond.  The surviving fighters reformed attempting to give the healers a chance to escape, raining blades and magic and miracles upon their tormentors, until each was finally dragged down into exhaustion...and pain...and darkness...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Teach me magic.&quot;<br>
<br>
His master closed her eyes slowly, and reached into the shelf behind her, removing sheafs of scrollwork.  &quot;We have no magic child.  By ourselves we are nothing, we move by the miracles of the All Mother.  And it is for us to gain the wisdom,&quot; she flicked his forehead for emphasis, &quot;and experience, to fully realize her strength within us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Here is where we all begin.&quot;  Sarnia placed the scrolls before him.  &quot;These are the Thousand Prayers to Tunare.  They are the beginning of wisdom, they are to allow us to be her conduits, her instruments, here in the world.  When you are ready, She will come to You.  With time, if you survive,&quot; her smile was only half joking, &quot;you may even be able to return those who have passed beyond this life.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I came to with a start, my hand reaching out above me, breath flooding back into my body.  I gasped openly, seeking the horrifying wounds which had felled me.  But there were none.  A cleric in gold sat nearby, eyes closed in meditation, &quot;welcome back.&quot;<br>

Hah!&quot;<br>
<br>
I smiled back.  &quot;Ah, if only it could be true.  Through fifty long trials all I have asked was to be allowed to bear the brunt of the battle.&quot;  I gingerly removed the gauntlet from my left hand, pealing the inner glove from cracked skin, revealing the missing middle finger where an ancient Wyvern claw had crashed through shield and steel and bone.  &quot;But after all this time, I have begun to notice the bleeding.&quot;  I stopped to study the four fingered hand as though it were a specimen behind glass.  &quot;And the things and people I have misplaced along the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Marielle laughed as young Somma kneeled before her, his new banded mail making it much more of a feat than had his old leather pieces.  He knew his courtesy and attention made her uncomfortable, but she tolerated his presence remarkably.  At times, he liked to think, she even welcomed it.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lady, you are radiant,&quot; And she was.  The young Mage wore a new white robe that seemed to glow from within.  But perhaps that was just her.  She had heard a spell she sought could be found in the library at Ak'Anon, and though he despised the ticking city, he had offered to keep her company on the short trip from Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The trip through the Faydarks was uneventful, this being before the encroachment of the aggressive and powerful Brownie scouts, but upon arriving at the crossroads in the Steamfont Mountains they found the road guard slain.  The unfortunate gnome stared up at the surrounding ridges with unseeing eyes, and the travellers looked as well.  A quick prayer to Tunare was all that could be spared as the two hurried on to the city.  Whatever or whoever had dispatched the guard would have had little trouble with them.<br>
<br>
Upon arrival they reported the incident to the city guards and moved on to the great ticking halls of magic.  They crouched as they moved through the tiny entryways, for hours moving from one unnatural clockwork librarian to the next.  Finally, satisfied that she had been misinformed they escaped the city and the mountains to return to the shining halls of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The barlass Wela soothed their disappointment with Elven Wine deep into the evening.  They exchanged stories and laughter, and spoke of her entry into the local guildhall, the Elven Elite.  Somma had seen many members crisscrossing Faydwer and had fought alongside several, but he had given little thought to being able to join such a band.<br>
<br>
Mere months later, Somma was also numbered among the ranks of the Elven, invited by his own mentor Sarnia, but Marielle was gone.  She had vanished, probably gone into the East, crossing over from whence none return.  <br>
<br>
Sadly, she would not be the last.<br>
<br>
<br>
The bloodsoaked Ranger snapped her fingers before my face, holding up a broken Drachind leg-tip.  &quot;Hey, we're not done yet.&quot;  She lit the remains and tossed them down into the closest nest.  We heard silk catch fire and then the tell-tale clicking of the beasts, like thousands of the tiny gnome clocks, racing out of control in the darkness.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usommatilmouren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Somma TilMouren</A> at: 7/11/01 5:40:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usommatilmouren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Somma TilMouren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Moff</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/13/01 6:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/f326955b/bc/My+Documents/EzBoardSommaPic.jpg?bcAwAK7AxXoXA6n3 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Karana Night, pt1</span><hr size=1> In the eastern portion of the Karanas, below the highland falls, there is a hill that the gnolls have claimed as their own.  Whatever magics have been employed there can only be guessed at, but as the sun sets each evening the rotting cadavers of their dead appear as if expelled from the very earth.  The local farmers call them Undead Reavers, and their guards are always on the lookout should the damned creatures wander too close.<br>
<br>
Somma and his childhood friend Leaflaun the druid were hunting the huge crag spiders . . . and the occasional griffawn, a great flying cross between a lion and an eagle, and quite vicious.  Local tailors bought the silk from the spiders and the local residents were always happy to have help with the griffs.<br>
<br>
The pair crept shoulder-deep in the tall Karana grasses, the sharp blades nicking any exposed flesh, as they neared one of the black and red spiders.  Everything was larger here, and more brutish, in the new lands of the humans.  It was as if the gods of the younger races were attempting to make up for other inadequacies through the sheer size of their creations.<br>
<br>
The druid moved quickly away to the right as Somma rose up and loosed a long range arrow at the creature, beckoning it toward him.  It struck home in a hairy flank and the monster shrieked as it raced toward the retreating Paladin, who fired again as he backed away toward the great wooden bridge to North Karana.<br>
<br>
From the spider's left Leaflaun rose from the grass and gestured.  Instantly, fire rose up around it, assaulting their senses with burning flesh.  Roots rose from the earth to entwine its legs and it tried in vain to reach one, then another, of its attackers.  Finally, Somma moved in with axe and shield to finish the contest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am poisoned.  One moment.&quot;  Somma closed his eyes and mouthed one of the Thousand Prayers, one of cleansing and purification.  He repeated it until he felt the wave of renewal pass through him, certain that the corruption was gone.  &quot;Tunare blesses us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What would your teachers say if they saw you fighting as some wild Ranger, with bow and axe, rather than always sticking in your thick head to be pounded on?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They would say I am cleverer than most, but even so, I could always blame the company I keep.  In any event,&quot; he pulled a broken fang from between two bent banded strips across his tunic.  &quot;I stick my head in quite sufficiently, thank you.  Or at least, just enough to keep my favorite hunting partner in one piece.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leaf extracted the last of the salvagable silk as Somma watched and learned.  Since the first moments they had drawn breath, before they chose their different callings, if one of the boys was around, the other could not be far off.  After a moderately painful learning period, Somma was almost as at home in the trees of his Wood-elf friend as he was on the paved streets of Felwithe.  <br>
<br>
The third member of their ancient club, little Emerelle, had become a true Ranger, joining the Thunderwalker guild.  She had early gone off to seek her fortune, though they still adventured together from time to time.  She could often be seen beneath the branches of Kelethin, helping the young as they learned their ways in the forest.<br>

The rain had just ceased, and many of the smaller creatures who made this jungle their home had begun to rise from hidden dens.  The cape draped over me for shelter still disguised my seated form, but something large had moved nearby, more felt than heard.  <br>
<br>
Had I not spent so much time with the druids and rangers of Faydwer I might've moved at the thought, betraying myself to whatever had come to call on my little camp.  I waited without breathing, allowing my senses to merge with the jungle around me, grown suddenly quiet.  In the deep distance to the north was the haunted city of mists.  Farther and to the east was Sebilis.  Fortune and glory, hehe.  Not if I ended up as a dinosaur treat.<br>
<br>
That's what it was.  I had heard its throaty rattle, as a stick dragged along a wooden fence, moving now to my front.  And a big one from the pitch.  Inch by inch I slid the cape forward until a slit of light filtered between it and the brim of my helm.  As I saw the mottled grey and yellow hide the cape fell completely and the Trak's head snapped quickly around to stare straight into my cozy nook.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning.&quot;  With one motion my forearm was through shieldgrips and my scabbard emptied.  I quickly charged it screaming and delivered a solid bash across its snout.  Stunned, it backed away a few steps, not sure if the unfamilar shape half hidden behind a great round shield was food.  I shouted again and advanced, landing another thudding blow under its eye.  Once again it retreated, a bit farther this time, fenceposts rattling deep beneath the thick cords of its neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't draw blood, don't draw blood.&quot;  With blood would be an escalation, and ancient instincts would win out.  &quot;Go!&quot;  I shouted, and stepped forward again.  This time it moved back voluntarily, its eyes never leaving mine, but it slowly backed away into the jungle.  Finally, it turned away and loped off, blending into the underbrush.<br>
<br>
I stood for a time watching it go, knuckles white and bloodless with a deathgrip on my shield.  Slowly I looked around for my scabbard, slung away in the first mad rush.  The simple act of bending to retrieve it was almost unbearable, and I noticed for the first time that my legs were shaking under the effort.  <br>
<br>
I sheathed my unused blade and dropped back into the hollow of the tree, penning a letter that ultimately a bard would deliver to my home in Felwithe.  &quot;Greetings father, this will wake you up in the morning...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usommatilmouren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Somma TilMouren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Moff</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/31/01 2:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Backward Glances</span><hr size=1> &quot;Boy!  If your mother is through feeding you, you have a visitor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma excused himself from breakfast and went to meet the lean messenger.  He accepted the guild dispatches and slipped a few coins into the bard's pouch.  &quot;Thank you, Tarique.&quot;  With that, he was gone, the sound of his drum echoing through the Felwithe streets, receding through the early mist.<br>
<br>
Somma's father looked after the retreating figure until he was out of sight.  &quot;Barely in his teens.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's why they gave him the city run.  He'll be out ducking Sarnak like his brother soon enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I suppose he will.  You only just arrived here last night, how did they know you'd be here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the bards of Norrath move in mysterious ways.&quot;  Actually, Somma was quite familiar with the vast network of informants and contacts scattered across the land, having run mail regularly as a youth, anything to pick up a few extra coins.  He'd never learned to play an instrument though, and since one unfortunate expedition to Skyfire Mountains, supposed he never would.  &quot;No doubt they'll be chasing me across the Karanas tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I see you've already packed.&quot;  He eyed the stuffed satchels with some distaste.  &quot;One night is hardly a fair visit.  Your mother will take it out on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shannice's voice rose from the other room, like crystal chimes, lightly kissed by the wind.  &quot;I'll do nothing of the sort.  My son may come and go as he pleases and I will delight in both, knowing that his absence means only the promise of his joyous return.&quot;<br>
<br>
His father leaned in close and whispered conspiratorially in Somma's ear.  &quot;She'll take it out on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It can't be helped.  I'll be heading west to link up with the Alliance scouring the countryside for some bandit.  I hear he's a very powerful monk, an odd calling to fall into banditry.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fog had begun to burn away and chimes rang once again from the sunlit kitchen.  &quot;No doubt you're protecting us from the whole truth once again.  The Karanas, I have heard tell of the Plaguebringer's influence there.  Will you need any special provisions or linaments?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes, the mighty Bertox.  Beware, lest he give you an itch.  Fear his power or risk a horrible sneeze.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;You joke.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I joke.  Callous of me.  The farmers do suffer terribly.&quot;  He did not mention the growing rumors of the Plaguebringer's influence in Ak'Anon to the south.  He moved quietly up behind his mother and massaged her shoulders.  The long hair that fell across his hands was a deep gold, only recently begun to develop the inevitable white streaks of age.  Her dress was a dark forest green, with lacework dating back centuries.  &quot;I shall require only Tunare's presence, and she is with me always.&quot;<br>
<br>
His father eyed the bag of dispatches meaningfully.  &quot;So, are you going to share the exploits of the mighty Elven Elite with your parents?  Or must we read everything in the paper like everyone else?&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma smiled and opened the bag, pulling from it a handful of notes.  &quot;Ah, some of this is old news.  The High Priestess Kiffe has joined us.  A very powerful addition.  Nalilya has acquired a pair of Efreeti Boots from an expedition into Nagafen's Lair, excellent.&quot;  His smile vanished and the color drained from his face, then returned again in an angry flush.  &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;  His mother clasped his wrist to steady him as he rose shaking from his seat.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This can't be.  It's impossible.  It must be false.&quot;  But he had never received false information from the bards.  &quot;They've killed the King of the Frogloks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In far Kunark?  Excellent news.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, in Guk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Guk?  But they're not evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma crumpled the paper and flung it into the fireplace.  &quot;Tell that to my brothers.  The occasional skirmish or misunderstanding is to be expected.  After all, the frogloks have been forced into an odd web of alliances in order to defend themselves from the Trolls and undead which menace them.  And they consider an attack on their allies to be an attack upon them.  Who would not?<br>
<br>
&quot;These creatures, though we may consider them savage, allow the races of light to move freely through their city, attacking only to defend themselves or their allies.  How well we repay them for their forebearance.  It would appear we are now more driven by love of loot than the right.  Who is the true savage?<br>
<br>
&quot;This guild is not about the easy way, the most expedient path, loot and power above all - good, bad, or indifferent.  Elite is a set of standards with which to conduct our affairs among all the citizens of Norrath, whether they are incased in skin, scales or feathers.  We judge by actions, not by appearance.  The Elite in our title is not a measure of power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father, we have murdered the sovereign of a non-belligerent civilization.  Tunare forgive us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma turned to his writing table and quickly wrote out a copy of his guild's charter, asking the members to read it again, not just the words, but the spirit behind them.  He grasped the elaborately etched pendant he had worn through thirty hard trials, never removed since presented to him by Master Colwyn and Sarnia so long ago.<br>
<br>
His father came to him quickly, reaching up to stay his hand.  &quot;And what do you think you're going to do with that?&quot;<br>
<br>
The look on his son's face was lost, possibly for the first time.  &quot;I just don't know.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=27.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=27.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
