Mainly it seems that everyone are convinced that wizards &quot;don't do enough damage&quot;. I have yet to see anyone actually doing calculations on this matter, and take into account factors like average time killing mobs, average time between mob pulls etc.<br>
<br>
Furthermore I have yet to see any hard data on pet damage. We all know mage / necro pets do &quot;lots of damage&quot;, but how much?<br>
<br>
I think the wiz community would be helped a lot by people who spend some time researching this using scientific methods. I'm going to try to get a log parser for a start, to evaluate melee damage. <br>
<br>
If anyone have links to other info, please post them here.<br>

However, when said mob becomes ENRAGED and the like, you really want those wizards unloading.<br>

Believe it or not, even after unloading all of you mana, Cazic is not agro on you, even while sitting at his feet!  I have even have had to med at his feet to have enough mana for another cast or two.  After casting at close range (his feet) he will then take a moment and squish you.<br>
<br>
After poping back in, I see the tanks still doing their thing.  The mage pets are right there doing their thing as well.<br>
<br>
Even after 2 or 3 deaths, the tanks and pets are still doing their thing.<br>
<br>
I think it sucks having to lose experience each time, just to be able to keep dealing damage.<br>
<br>
How can we deal damage over the long term and still compete with the other clases?<br>

Maybe my perception of dmg is wrong.  I would love to see the numbers...  I hope Woland is successful in his efforts.<br>

<br>
For example, what is the real mana cost of a spell at each level, given that specializations kick in.  What is the probability a different class is casting damage spells within their school of specialization?  What is the actual damage over time for dd spells after resist rates are computed?   These questions are only a few of MANY.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see an &quot;analysis&quot; that accurately shows the real average cost of spells and the real average damage of spells. <p>Lady Sinari Dax<br>

Since the logs all show that melee weapons recently introduced into the game (especially on twinks) outdamage us very quickly, sometimes in single fights and shorter, that is pretty much not hard to figure out.<br>
<br>
Seriously, it really is that simple, you can sit and work out all the theoretical formulae and ideas you want, trying to juggle fizzles, mana cost, specialization, misses, critical hits, backstabs, armor class, haste, and all that into some monster system.  Or you can just use what actually happens in the game. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usinaridax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinari Dax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/01 12:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm, look at dmg on large mobs...</span><hr size=1> So what's your point now, Grim?  We're not balanced at low levels versus well-twinked fighters?<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that twinking has such a pronounced effect in Everquest, but I don't think caster classes should have damage output increased to even it out.  Empowering casters would be, in a matter of speaking, twinking all of them to balance them versus twinked fighters.  Well, then how does that affect non-twinked fighters?  They would then be poorly equipped for groups.<br>
<br>
As for comparing our damage output to that of other casters, I again assert we are woefully ill-equipped to answer such questions with the information available. <p>Lady Sinari Dax<br>

But THIS discussion was about the 'scientific' approach called for as if it was a new idea.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk about vs other casters, I'll just refer you to 900,000 posts by people such as myself and others over the past 2 years on this very subject covering it to disgusting detail and complexity.  You probably are new on the message boards or to the game and missed all this, if so, trust me its been covered. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/01 2:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm, look at dmg on large mobs...</span><hr size=1> Grim has said it many times before, the issue is that at lower levels, even without twinking, wizards come out a bit too weak at lower levels.  Twinking of melee characters only makes the problem worse, but doesn't create the problem.<br>
<br>
Level 4 wizard compared to a level 4 warrior with a rusty sword and with both in cloth armor, who survives better?<br>
<br>
Level 8 wizard compared to a level 8 warrior, now with a normal long sword, perhaps some dervish cutthroat rings and leather armor, who survives and does better in a group?<br>
<br>
Level 12 wizard compared to a level 12 warrior with some pieces of chain or plate thrown in, who survives and contributes to a group better?<br>
<br>
Note that I'm not going into quests or other things a warrior can do to get yet better armor, but most people will agree that at these low levels, warriors are better across the board at their contribution to a group.  Now, if we are expected to start weaker, with low hit points, and to have going up a level be a struggle, then doesn't it make sense that wizards and other casters should end up with a bit of an edge at the high end game, rather than the warriors holding that edge all the way to level 56?  At 57 our draughts get a bit of a kick up to 716 damage, it's why it's not QUITE as bad at the very highest levels, but at low levels, where we start out weak, what you suggest is that twinking cobalt down doesn't DESTROY casters, and the role we play in groups.<br>
<br>
  It's that simple, twinking kills the low end game, and even in the high end game, the best spells and best equipment in the game make melees more powerful overall than wizards, no matter how well we play.  Stamina should be the key to limiting melee power, and it doesn't do a damn thing to limit melee classes, and that's a problem as well.  If you remove the UBER items from melees, and limit them to &quot;normal&quot; items, things arn't as bad, but uber items get twinked and sold to the point where they are almost common in the 56+ game on most servers.  Can you deny it?<br>

I've seen pages apon pages of analysis that was trying to fit all the different factors into it. I've also seen many results of parsed files that said exactly how much damage was dealt by all.<br>
<br>
I personaly like the parsed files better. Its much easier to do and actually gives better results. It tells you exactly how much damage is done by each class after resists, fizzles, specialization, crits, BS, disc and everthing else is taken into account.<br>
<br>
If you want some numbers here are a few of the ones i did that i can remember off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
Kromzek Captain. 55kish hps, lures only, short fight.<br>
lvl 60 Warrior w/epic, w/CoF, w/VoG<br>
lvl 60 Wizard w/lure of ice, w/C2, w/cantra<br>
Warrior did 5% more damage then wizard. In this situation of a short fight I consider it balanced (wizard would've done more if he didn't have to use lures). <br>
<br>
New Inny. tons of hps, can use regular spells, long fight<br>
lvl 60 wizard w/C2, w/cantra, w/PoG.<br>
lvl 55 rogue w/epic, w/shissar<br>
Rogue did 50% more damage then wizard. I don't consider this balanced. Rogue is 5 levels lower and is being thrown around by innys Gflux so isn't in mele range all the time, meanwhile wizard has near max manaregen and yet the rogue still manages to outdamage the wizard but such a high amount. Its wrong.<br>
<br>
Shroom king. exp group, constant pulls, 7 people 58 to 60<br>
lvl 60 wizard w/C2, w/epic, w/icy spear<br>
lvl 58 rogue w/epic, w/shissar<br>
Even though the wizard was only useing ice spear to get the most damage possible over the course of an hour the rogue still did 150% more damage. In otherwords the wizard did 40% of the damage the rogue did. Again i don't think thats balanced.<br>
<br>
Sorry i can't remember more specific numbers for you. They were so depressing i threw them all out after i finished my parsing study.<br>

besides damage what else do we wizards do?  Rouges have more survivability (hp, ac, evade and all that) then we do, they dont spend mana when pokeing with their little daggers, and they can get some really nice equipment (ours include +mana items from VP, whoopty doo).

<br>
I tried sunstrike a couple times but was always resisted too much unless there was a druid around to do ro's. Could be i just had an unlucky streek i'll have to try again.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &quot;I still don't understand why people expect to outdamage rogues in xp groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
I personally don't expect to nor want to outdamage a rogue in an exp group. In raids maybe but not in exp groups. However when 1 rogue can do the damage of 2.5 wizards its real hard to justify the presence of the wizard and then we have problems. Yes let rogues outdamage us but let us be in the same ballpark (like it was prekunark).<br>

I just do not understand that statement.  Why in the world should any class out damage a Wizard?  Moreover, why should any class in a normal grind group be able to out damage a Wizard in a given round?  The only answer to that question should be resists.  /boggle<br>
<br>
Nerf the other classes and the Mobs so that they do the same relative damage as a Wizard (in a round) and this problem of Wizards not doing enough damage goes away.  Alas, the mudflation that has occured with the tank classes to date with Kunark and Velious precludes this idea.  VI would have to strip too much of its code to implement such an idea.<br>
<br>
I had a peek at disciplines yesterday.  I was appalled.  It was my first view of these &quot;tank only&quot; capabilities and I almost had a cow.  (I only looked at Rogue and Monk since they are the big damage dealers &quot;That Wizards were supposed to be&quot;).  I encourage you all to read them as well.  A monk can do an Insta-Kill (like disintegrate), yet leave a corpse that can be looted. And  Rogue can do 32000 (GAH! I dont believe it!!!) using Assassinate.<br>
<br>
Disciplines kick in at level 30 for some classes and 51 for others.  Most of them are real yawners  (i.e. ZZzzzz) but at higher levels they can be awesome.  And what do the casters get?  umm lemme see...  Bupkiss.  Who are these guys at VI that design this stuff and could they withstand an Ice Comet?<br>
<br>
Have a look for yourself, but keep a container nearby for the wretching that will certainly occur.<br>

Tonight I was playing in a Frost Giant Elite group in the Great Divide. I was using a Wurmslayer and let me tell you, Stamina drops. It drops fast. It depends on weapon weight, attack speed, How much base stamina you have, Etc.<br>
I even had Augmentation on, which is supposed to regain stamina fast, but I was gaining it back like mana. The one thing that didn't happen was when I was out of stamina (the yellow bar) I didn't hit any less, or any less frequently. In fact it was like the Stamina bar ment nothing in the game.<br>
Then someone in the group told me that once your base Stamina is over 100, you no longer get the low stamina effects. I don't know if there is any truth in this, but it would make sense.<br>
If Stamina were directly related to how much you could attack no matter how high your base stamina was, then you wouldn't see tanks lasting very long without the proper buffs.<br>
Of course, Invigor (Newbie level Stamina Buff) will refill a stamina bar in just a few seconds. Sitting down will too.<br>
When Stamina works like the mana bar, then we'll be more balanced with melees. <p><center><br>Jarnin Fisheermann<Br><b>Disciple of Hate<Br><b>Rallos Zek</b><Br></b><Br>Grand Master Fisherman<Br>Master Brewer<Br>Master Chef<Br>Master of Begging</center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=454.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=454.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=454.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=454.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=454.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=454.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
