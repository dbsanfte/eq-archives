Here's my bet on how it will happen, after seeing all the Nerfs since beta3:<br>
<br>
You will only be able to MB a mob for a certain percentage of it's health, probably 33% or so (unless it's lvl 46 or under). That way the &quot;intended&quot; role of MB--a &quot;well balanced&quot; raiding party--will still remain. A few wizards in a large raid with other classes will be able to contribute to killing any mob, but a group solely made up of wizards will not be able to kill ANY high HP mobs w/o using regular nukes, which since it is bound by time will effectively mean no more team MB. Any MB damage above the given percentage will not be applied, and if you try to MB a mob that is beyond it's threshold you will either get &quot;that spell will not affect this creature&quot; or it will use all your mana and do squat (probably the latter).<br>
<br>
Anyone else think it will happen different? <p><CENTER>

Face it, no ability this unbalancing will ever be allowed to stay in the game forever.  It destroys the lower level dragon and epic mob encounters, and really breaks the entire epic process for many guilds.  It can't be allowed to remain as it is.<br>

<br>
Actually, the thing that most broke those encounters was SoV. Failure to understand why just undermines the whole point you try to make. None of these encounters is exactly tough now given the equipment you can use. All of these encounters were done using far inferior gear. Velious already broke these encounters from this point of view and Luclin did so even more.<br>
<br>
&gt;Hell, just look at Donal's BP, and having the Mage &quot;quick cast ring&quot; effect CH, those trivialized encounters and were eventually Nerfed™, MB will be too. I can't believe that anyone would be surprised.<br>
<br>
Everyone brings up Donal's as if it were some realistic comparison to MB. It isn't, and in fact, it doesn't even come close. The BP helped trivialize almost <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> fight, not just a select few. MB is only useful in a few circumstances, and those tend to be at the low to low-middle end of encounters of EQ, and not even all of those. <br>
<br>
CH is a major factor in the design of every single end encounter of this game, MB is not. Anything that affects CH will be looked at a lot closer for this very reason and this is the reason that the ring won't affect CH.  <p><a target="_blank" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
I understand that the quality of equipment available now does trivialize Kunark and Old World encounters for any class, but most guilds won't bother assembling the forces to take out something like a Kunark dragon just to sell the MQ of the epic pieces.  Doing that takes more time than it's worth to assemble all the people necessary, when they could just be raiding higher level zones and getting loot better than anything they could buy with the money.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when a few Wizards can just gate very near the mob and go in and take it out with very little preperation, it suddenly becomes *VERY* worth while.  6 Wizards splitting 200k is well worth their time, while a guild trying to split 200k 24 ways is not.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that I don't see uber guilds rolling through Kunark just to farm epic pieces and lvl 60 spells to sell at inflated prices.  In the cases where one of those level guilds does kill a Kunark dragon, it's usually for a twink to get their epic, which I don't have nearly as much problem with as 6 Wizards holding a dragon scale hostages for the highest bidder (BTW I have a real problem with people selling the scales they were awarded for their personal epic as well).<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with MB, per se, just the way a few abuse it.  The abuse of lower lvl content is not unique to Wizards, but they're currently the most frequent offenders. <p><CENTER>

<br>
Why would it take 24 melee/healers to kill a kunark dragon? The only fair comparison is to compare to a group of lvl 60 melee/healers with 23+ AA points. Thats what it takes for the wizards so thats what you have to allow for the melee/healer group. I say group because all it takes is one group if they are all lvl 60 with 23+ AA points. If you don't think it could be done with one group then you have no clue. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One more thing, wizards could never do this with less than 4 wizards because you can't guarantee a crit. On the other hand if you went for truely uber melees from AL or FoH it could be done with 2 people.<br>

MB Wizards are much less depedent on support classes, so not only does it take less prep time but you don't need to spend the time to collect your non-porters from the far corners of Norrath and Luclin.<br>
<br>
(Edit) Any way, the above is just pointing ot that it's more convenient for Wizards to monopolize epic spawns than it is for other classes, which is probably why they do it.  I haven't seen a rash of any other classes in particular, or groups in particular regularling farming epic spawns, and there are a LOT of charcters out there with a lot of AA's, not just Wizards.  By your rationale every class in the game would be farming and KS'ing epic mobs, and that's just not happening.<br>
<br>
If say, AA Warriors and Clerics started banding together to form Team Melee and farmed and KS'd mobs that dropped epic peices, then there would have to be some kind of restraint put in place to limit them, and people would try to find out just what it was about game mechanics that let them do it so easily in the first place, but to date I haven't seen a Team Melee spring up on every server and start posting screen caps of Gore, Sev, etc being taken out by 6 players.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether or not other classes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> take down these mobs, they don't.  The only rational explanation I can come up with as to why that is, is because it's so much quicker and more conventient for AA Wizards to do it than any other class, thus the reason there is outcry about MB and not about any other class' AA.  Yes there was a brief uproar about DC, but when no one noticed it seriously impacting the game, they stopped complaining about it. <p><CENTER>

I realy wonder what killed epic mobs before MB was around, it must have been magicians as it wasnt melees and clerics according to this magician. There are posts about single melee groups killing those dragons. There is also a story of team magician doing plane of air (epic mobs).<br>
<br>
But there is actualy a reason for wizards to use manaburn on these types of mobs that arent there for other AA skills. Its that its pretty useless to use MB on a 1mill hp mob. So the uber whatever can use his AA skills while doing normal raiding, but the wizards will have theirs left to use on spare time on kunark dragons. Maybe you should suggest how the skill would be improved for end game raids instead of how to nerf it where it works?<br>
<br>
On the other hand, considering the importance magicians place on those kinds of encounters so have I to conclude that Frenzied Burnout with 36 second duration is working as intented. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uthediscoinferno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The DiscoInferno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 744<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/4/02 2:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How MB will be Nerfed(tm), taking bets...</span><hr size=1> Takes a minimum of 4 uber wizards lots of aaxp to do this.

If anything, this helps lower end guilds who can't equip themselves in such a way to trivial the encounter. 1-2 MB wizzies in a low end guild can make these mobs attainable<br>
<br>
I wasn't comparing MB to Donals btw, just saying that if they nerfed i feel it would happen in that manner.<br>

<br>
I freely admit that a few melees and clerics with equivilant amounts of AA can farm epic mobs, but my point is they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DON'T</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Sure, there have been isolated cases where it happened, on my server 1 1/2 groups took out gore, and that was w/o any MB'ers.  The point is, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> since</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> MB was added to the game there have been a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> rash</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of MB KS'ings and killings of epic mobs, and then have the Wizards turn around and try to sell the green scale for 100k+, etc...  This has been happening very regularly on many servers.  Some servers even have Wizard websites of which zones to camp mules in to watch for the epic mobs so they can immediately kill them as soon s they pop.<br>
<br>
My point, which you completely ignored is that it takes far, far less time for a group of Wizards to port in and MB something then it takes to collect a group of melee and support classes, port in, buff, and engage.<br>
<br>
It is the convenience factor of MB combine with a class that can almost instantly get to anywhere in the EQ world that makes it so unbalancing.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I admit a small number of any classes with lots of AA and very good equipment could do the same thing, it would just take them a lot more time and effort, which is why they don't.  It takes 6 Wizards very little time or effort to continually slaughter epic mobs minutes after they pop, which is why Wizards do it.<br>
<br>
You must realize that you can't argue with that fact, because you completely avoided it.<br>
<br>
And as to MB being useless against the uber Luclin mobs, do you just not have a clue?  Everyone knows MB barely generates any agro.  It's been posted like 239842348 times that when fighting emp, or VT mobs all the Wizards MB at the start of the fight, then mod back up and use regular nukes after melees have generated agro.<br>
<br>
It's not that MB is useless against uber mobs, it's that MB Wizards realize they can make a ton of money by saving their MB and using it on content that is way under their level.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying Wizards are stupid, if they were they wouldn't be making loads of money off of MQ'ing epics like they are.  I'm saying don't insult my intelligence by saying MB is useless for anything else.  It's just less profitable. <p><CENTER>

How many servers do you keep an eye on epic mobs on that you know this for a fact? Maybe you have access to Verants statistics?<br>

Some servers even have Wizard websites of which zones to camp mules in to watch for the epic mobs so they can immediately kill them as soon s they pop.<br>

And as to MB being useless against the uber Luclin mobs, do you just not have a clue? Everyone knows MB barely generates any agro. It's been posted like 239842348 times that when fighting emp, or VT mobs all the Wizards MB at the start of the fight, then mod back up and use regular nukes after melees have generated agro.<br>

The magician would do more damage nuking the mob then making modrods for the wizard to regain mana. And personaly I dont think using a skill to do less damage is very usefull. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaiyanenfarre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aiyane N Farre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/5/02 9:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How MB will be Nerfed(tm), taking bets...</span><hr size=1> Since I'm bored at work I've decided to reply to the actual original post and show why it will never happen the way you suggest anyway.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You will only be able to MB a mob for a certain percentage of it's health, probably 33% or so (unless it's lvl 46 or under). That way the &quot;intended&quot; role of MB--a &quot;well balanced&quot; raiding party--will still remain. A few wizards in a large raid with other classes will be able to contribute to killing any mob, but a group solely made up of wizards will not be able to kill ANY high HP mobs w/o using regular nukes, which since it is bound by time will effectively mean no more team MB. Any MB damage above the given percentage will not be applied, and if you try to MB a mob that is beyond it's threshold you will either get &quot;that spell will not affect this creature&quot; or it will use all your mana and do squat (probably the latter).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you put an effect on the mob after it's been MBed to prevent others from using MB then how do you handle mobs with 50k+ hps? One MB will not do 33% of its hp so you should be able to MB it again, right? If it has a non overwritable effect on it from the first MB then the second won't take effect and you can't do the 33% you're supposed to be able to do. If you don't put an effect on the mob then how do you know its been mana burned before? Set a flag of some sort? In what database file? And how do you know that wasn't some other group that tried and failed an hour ago? Store the time as well? or just work off of the mobs hp and remove the flag after it heals up?<br>
<br>
Any of these things would take a big chunk of new code and some of them would require changes to database tables to add fields. Three years of history of EQ says that this will never be done. Its to much work for too little benefit.<br>
<br>
Yes, they did make some major database changes recently but those were for the new inteface and the chat channels mostly. Making changes like that just to nerf manaburn would be silly.<br>
<br>
Edit: I also question the words &quot;intended role&quot;, are you saying that you are part of Verant's design team and were one of the people who came up with manaburn? If not how do you know what its intended role is?<br>

Of course they do. I don't think for a second this is a phenomenon unique to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
I can name you off the top of my head three separate (Non-MB) groups of people that farm epic pieces nearly continuously. I know of only one MB group on Inny in comparison.<br>
<br>
Ok you feel MB is &quot;unbalancing&quot; because 6 wizards use it to farm epics pieces to sell? It sounds like you are upset about their actions more so then the power of the ability. Or is it that you feel 6 wizards should not be able to duplicate the results of a comparable 4-6 person group?<br>
<br>
If someone monopolizes a spawn you can petition them. Of course, more a logical way would be to work out a deal with them, but that is your call.<br>

<br>
To (forget first name) N'Farre, VI already has a way to track damage done by each player, so it shouldn't be much of a stretch to modify that code to track damage done by a certain type of effect, then set an immunity flag (remember, they already created code to make mobs immune to certain affects).  Also, it's only an issue for mobs at a certain HP level, say under 32, 64, 100k...  something in that range, not for mobs like Emp or stuff in VT.<br>
<br>
I forget who made the point about Mage making better use of their mana by nuking instead of making Trods, well that's only true if the mob has a very low resist rate to fire or magic.  For a mob with high resist rates, it's better to make rods for Wizards and let them use lures.<br>
<br>
Selanor: On my server, I have only seen two types of people selling major epic pieces: the Wizards from local Team MB, and a few people who were awarded epic pieces on public raids, but decided to sell them instead of using for their epic (which I equally dispise).  I have not seen any uber guild melee teams running around killing epic mobs and selling the pieces.<br>
<br>
But I can see the argument is really pointless because everyone apparently thinks they are &quot;owed&quot; this (situationally) overly powerful skill, just because they weren't a very powerful class before.  That being the case, I won't bother responding any more. <p><CENTER>

On my server people and guilds sell weapons, armors, spells and quest items all the time. Uberguilds actualy have a very good reason to do this as well. There is a cost for high end raids with gems and such that isnt paid for with the loot from such raids. So they are getting the money from somewhere. Maybe on your server the less uber guilds just give them money.<br>

Your experience with this? I have actually noticed the opposite really, MB in any long fight tends to be rather pointless except perhaps right at the end to dump your remaining mana before the mob dies anyways. It is not necessary to have in order to any of these mobs, and doesn't actually help your overall damage output much, if at all, either. <p><a target="_blank" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

Yes, they track damage per character, its called the &quot;hate list&quot;, it has entries for character-id, damage and taunt. Tracking manaburn damage seperately would require adding a field to this table and re-writing all the code for the hate list. We all know what happens when they tweak the hate list don't we? This is a no no. If they simply create a &quot;new&quot; table just to track manaburn damage and then add a new code loop to check how much total damage has been done to the mob by manaburn and calc the percentage of its total health that represents......thats a lot of extra coding and also more overhead on the server. Everyones gameplay will slow down or they have to buy more processor power for the servers. $$<br>
<br>
As far as immunity flags go, those are hard coded things that are part of the mob data. Immune to slow or snare or stun, etc. Adding a flag for manaburn to the mob database might not be a big deal but these flags apply to all mobs of the same type. If you set one dynamicly when one of these mobs got manaburned then all mobs in the world of this type become immune. Furthurmore, I very much doubt that a dynamic event can set a flag in the mob database and I doubt they'd put such code in, too many oportunities for error. You might say only flag &quot;unique&quot; mobs (you were talking about all mobs) but it still has potential to mess up the database if someone codes it wrong.

Why not just tweak mob AI to cast that in response to being manaburned?<br>

A well-timed manaburn gank should still work, this would just increase the risk a bit. <br>

EDIT: Btw i don't think manaburn will be nerfed, maybe if they started giving us breastplates with a mana free manaburn they'd add a buff eh?
