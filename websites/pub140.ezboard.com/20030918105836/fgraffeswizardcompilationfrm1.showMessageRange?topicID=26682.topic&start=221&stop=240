<br>
A few months later they nerf the elemental minis in PoF and PoW because the RvR was off and now it looks like they will nerf exp as well (compared to the other PoP zones).<br>
<br>
This doesnt matter that much to me since I have the aa skills I want and my guild can kill the new minis, but why should the ones that get to the elemental planes now be denied the same reward that I got? And why do I get a feeling of deja vu?<br>

Having the bragging rights and being able to farm with no competition is more than sufficient reward for being first.<br>
<br>
Suppose that you were climbing Mount Everest. When you were almost at the top they suddenly made the mountain a mile higher since a more experienced climber that had climbed it 10 times before thought that it was getting too easy. You would probably be rather upset about that.<br>
<br>
I think last time I personally was affected by this was when they &quot;removed&quot; Vulak just when my guild had started to kill him (we were a pretty young guild at that time). I know for sure that we didnt like it back then and I don't think players that end up in the same position today like it any more.<br>

The groups that I have been were:<br>
<br>
1. SK, Ench (they 2box), Wiz, druid (me 2boxing) in BoT<br>
2. Ranger, Cleric (2box), Wiz, Druid (me) in BoT and PoV.<br>
3. Bst, Druid (2box), Wiz, Druid (me) in PoV.<br>
4. Cleric, Magician (2box), Wiz, Dru (me) in BoT. (mind you the mage was lvl 63 so no charming)<br>
5. Wiz, wiz, wiz, wiz, mage, necro in PoV (outer camp agro kiting me being puller + agro kiter and we had a blast. No medbreak.)<br>
6. Monk, Sham (2box), Wiz, Druid (me) in PoV<br>
7. Pal, Necro (2box), Wiz, druid (me) in PoV.<br>
<br>
Before my 2nd break, I used to play alot with group No.3, beastlord being the main tank and slower, and me being the primary damage dealer. Usually med break happens when the bst is near 00m, but again it was pretty steady exp group that can pull 1AA and a bit per day. (session). <br>
<br>
No.2 group, yes the ranger is the slower using his EarthCaller (sp?), although his cleric has heck of a lot of mana regen + FT gear but still it was doable. Was frightning doing in bot (the bees upstairs), but still it was doable.<br>
<br>
No.6 group usually is the undead camp in PoV. Condition was the monk having virtue and he did tanked np. Btw his hp is 3500ish unbuffed so nothing uber. (me thinks)<br>
<br>
No.7 group now this was devastating. It was the undead camp of course, the necro being the puller + slower, then pal + wiz being damage dealers. Mind you appart from the bst dru and rng cleric group, my druid was the main healer all the time. Too bad that all these groups were guild only. Haven´t been in pickup groups much lately, nor I solod much. The only thing I ever solod for good exp is in PoV outer cave and some Grimite Frogs which are snarable. (you need harmony or lull in order to do this)<br>

<br>
One of the greatest deterrents for me, as a Wizard playing in EverQuest, to gaining experience was that I was constantly nagged by the fact that I could gain so much more experience while quadding, but this lonely solo experience was definitely something that I detested. Why play a MMORPG if you're not going to interact with people? The answer to that might very well be that the type of people who prefer solo'ing are likely the type of people who are eager to show off their accomplishments in an anti-social fashion, or, conversely, the type of people who just don't have time for the lengthy setup in groups (or who don't see the benefit of grouping).<br>
<br>
Increasing the experience inherent to grouping will address both major concerns above.<br>
<br>
With Shadowbane making experience-gathering silly (most characters basically finish leveling in a few weeks, rather than the months-to-years that EverQuest requires), and WoW poised to make progression less experience-based and more encounter/quest-based, EverQuest has to dramatically redefine its progression model if it hopes to remain competitive. As predicted, the competition is already prompting some positive changes over at SOE.<br>
<br>
The extend to which this improvement is successful remains to be seen, but I am optimistic that through the competition that SOE is facing, EverQuest will become more and more accessible to the casual player, and hardcore players - those that constitute the very active, but from a commercial standpoint, smaller userbase - will take a back-seat. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.kaelon.com/images/kaesiggy2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
-there are players, that want to keep more time reserved for RL. So they never play long sessions.<br>
-there are players who got sick and tired of LFG or starting to make their own group. Despite what some people say, some servers really got a problem.<br>
-there are players, that for some reason have to go often afk during playing, which means, a group really don't like to have them.<br>
<br>
Only things this change will do:<br>
- force that 1 percent of the die-hard solo-ers to find another way of earning the same xp, they got now.<br>
- Make the gap between the classes(or players) that have trouble to find groups and ones that don't have that problem like 3 times as big.<br>
- Make the gap between casual players and others bigger, means casual players will get it slowly a bit more difficult to group, unless with other casuals, because real fanatics rather have people in their group with loads of aa.<br>
-Make the gap between &quot;uber&quot; players and normal players bigger, which will undoubtly lead to other nerves in the future.(since soe will realize some things are too easy with loads of aa)<br>
<br>
But will this change stimulate grouping? Nah, not that much, maybe on lower lvl it will, since the people solo-ing on low level are mostly twinks, who just want a new char high lvl as fast as possible. (guess they will now plevel a group of lowbie's together instead of solo)<br>
<br>
People that already group, will keep grouping. People that can't group that much, will still see the same problems. Only a very minor part of the eq population will change their attitude from solo to groups.<br>
<br>
IF soe really wants to improve grouping, i suggest they increase the groupsize without penalty, like raid system does. So more people will get a chance to form a group.<br>
Or adapt a lot of zones, so there are more group kiting spots around...<br>

Higher level characters, with more AAs, have an easier time getting into sub-uber or uber-crossing guilds that can equip them with what uber-guilds seek (keys, prereq. flags, etc.). With a greater experience pool being fed to all players, in all locations, simply on the basis of grouping, you have a very real, concrete hope of seeing a lot of casual gamers and role players hit their 60s faster and with greater enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
There's nothing more discouraging than to talk to sarcastic and negative Level 65 players -- and I've seen more and more of them these days. I have to think that the leveling grudge combined with prerequisite hard raiding schedules must have contributed at least partly to this mentality. <br>
<br>
You make leveling easier, you bring more fun to more people without removing end-game challenges and competitive encounters. And for EverQuest to survive against its future competition, it needs to appeal to people who aren't willing to put 8+ hours a day into the game. And this crowd is constituting an ever larger majority as the population continues to shift towards player base retention as opposed to fast-paced growth. It's a simple matter of economics and good business planning.<br>

Hum, what the fuck is that? Sorry I have 200AA and the best AA i get now is in a group. if I grp then with these changes almost an extra aaxp per hour while on the other hand I lose 63% aaxp per hour if I'm grinding hard with full raid buffs. While I'm fine doing tradeskills at this point, this kind of massive nerf to `encourage grouping` is hi, bullshit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since the nerf isn't 63% am I right in assuming that you are counting the extra experience groups will gain over you soloing as a nerf towards you rather than the difference between what you get now and what you would get post nerf?<br>

To what end are you getting these levels, so you can be soloing at level 65?  What's the purpose, is this a race to you?  If it is to group and kill uber stuff so you can feel like your manhood is bigger, won't the grouping bonus help you then?  Increasing group xp gain doesn't hurt you soloing, it just helps grouping.  You are getting the same xps soloing unless it gets nerfed.  If it gets nerfed, did you really expect to continue gaining such a noticable benefit solo in a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GROUP GAME?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erumaroneverbright>Erumaron Everbright</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/7/03 9:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> Grimstaff doesn't know what's going on, I feel sorry for him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=avgwiz>AvgWiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/03 11:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group xp changes ..... predictions</span><hr size=1> Myself, I am concerned at what the changes in xp rate full group versus solo are going to become.   80 percent difference is very high.   <br>
<br>
However, given the large disparity between full group xp and solo xp, SoE must address the groupability of classes quickly.  Unless they do, in 6 months here is what I predict:<br>
-- more lvl 65 holy trinity classes<br>
-- less lvl 65 traditional solo classes<br>
-- less short durtation casual players<br>
<br>
Here is why:<br>
-- On many servers, the lower level players are alternates for higher level characters.    For many of them, the objective is to level up quickly.  Since the full group bonus will allow you to level at least 80 percent faster than solo, efforts to make them will be higher.  Right now it is a 20 percent bonus over solo for a full group.  Now it is 80 percent.   This is 50 percent more xp per hour than before for the group of 6.<br>
-- Casual style players who are good in groups will quickly be out of level range of the other chars in their normal group.  A casual player may only spend one hour online -- 30 minutes of which will be lfg and getting in group.   But their group mates from the previous session might have been online for 2, 3 and 4 hours respectively.   Given that, in only a few hours, they might be a few levels beyond them.  While this could happen currently, it takes much longer for a player to advance out of your level range for groupablility than it will after this change.  This will further add to the time it takes for a casual player to get a group.<br>
-- This will further re-enforce the holy trinity groups.    From a grouping perspective (and yes I have most of my xp from friends groups) -- tank/cleric/chanter-slower/3xdmg chain pulling groups have been the best xp.   The only exception was aoe centric groups.  When KEI level range gets implmented, the wizard will spend significant time nearly oom.  While the twinked melee will still be doing major dmg.<br>
<br>
To prove the first 2 points on the list -- 6 months from now I will do the following test:<br>
-- Get a list of how many lvl 65 holy trinity classes there are today.  These will be cleric, enchanter/shaman, plate tank (war/sk/pal).   Get a similar list for the less group friendly classes:  necro, wiz, druid (druids have problems post 50), etc.<br>
<br>
-- Repeat this same list after 6 months.  <br>
<br>
If the number of new lvl 65 of the group desirable/necessary classes is far higher than the more solo dependant ones, 2 or the 3 points will be proven.   The last prediction of casual players becoming discouraged will be harder to prove.<br>
