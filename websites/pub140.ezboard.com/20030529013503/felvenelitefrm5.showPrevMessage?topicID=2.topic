She had been trying for days to write lyrics to a new song and had nothing to show for the fruits of her labor.<br>
 <br>
Perhaps she just needed a small break and the words would come as they so often did, when they were good and ready to come. She rose from the desk, capped the ink well and placed the quill carefully inside the desk drawer next to the stack of parchment there.<br>
 <br>
A little levity was in order, so she decided to take a stroll over to the local tavern. She knew that her master was there, and that he would counsel her on the matter at hand. Not only was the older bard her mentor, he was her friend as well, and she always felt better after a visit with him.<br>
 <br>
As she neared the tavern, she could see the lanterns flickering from behind the windows brightly and could hear the laughter and merry making of those from within. <br>
<br>
She opened the heavy door, and a rush of warm air permeated<br>
with the smell of  food, elven wine, and pipe tobacco wafted up into her nostrils. After stepping over the threshold, she approached the inn keeper, trying to keep a solemn and serious look upon her face. <br>
 <br>
“Hello, Silverrleaf ! “ he chirped as he greeted her. “What can I get for yee this fine day?” he asked.<br>
 <br>
“I think I would like a glass of you finest fish wine” she replied, as a small smile spread slowly over her face.<br>
 <br>
“Aren’t you a little young to be partakin’ in such things Miss Silverrleaf?” a deep, melodic, baritonish voice to her left asked. She knew the voice very well, better than this game she was playing her role in now, the smile spreading over her face, unable to maintain her composure anymore.<br>
 <br>
“I do tire so of everyone thinking that they know what is best for me….Please, bartender, the wine” she responded as she slowly turned toward the voice, the smile growing in it’s intensity until it threatened to split her face in half. She greeted her friend and master with a warm and affectionate embrace.<br>
 <br>
The bartender, knowing his role in this game as well, promptly laid out milk, cheese, and muffins for the younger bard and fetched a glass of the finest elven wine for the elder bard.<br>
 <br>
“How goes the work on your new composition m’lady?” the master asked.<br>
 <br>
“Not well m’lord, I have been floundering with it for days and still I have nothing to show for it” she replied.<br>
 <br>
The elder bard pondered this statement for a moment as he knew from experience, that sometimes distraction was the best medicine for writers block.<br>
 <br>
“You have been struggling with this same piece for a fort night now,perhaps you need an adventure, maybe you could take the mail to Kelethin tomorrow instead of me. The master there has sent word requesting a permanent carrier to cover the mail route there and the truth of the matter is, the route here is much to dangerous for one as young and tender as you. Besides, it would prove to your benefit to visit your family and get to know them better.”<br>
 <br>
The young Silverrleaf looked a bit stunned as he spoke, he had always watched over her so closely, so much so, that at times she felt she couldn’t breath without him knowing about it. She couldn't believe he was going to allow her to journey to a far away land unsupervised.<br>
 <br>
“I already have spoken to a young wood elf ranger there of the plans to turn over the route to you and he has agreed to see to your lodgings and guaranteed your safe travel from the shores of the Butcher Block mountains to the village of Kelethin where you will make your new home.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The rangers name is Talanthas, and he will watch over yee in my stead. He is a close friend of your family and perhaps, even though they journey and adventure often, you will get to be more familiar with them better through him and through meeting and getting to know their friends. <br>
They have many stories to share with yee.” <br>
 <br>
Silverrleaf was left a bit speechless as he continued.<br>
 <br>
“The boat leaves tomorrow morn at sunrise m’lady. Eat well now as there will be no time in the morn for breakfast and bed early this eve as the ride can prove to be long and arduous.” <br>
 <br>
The elder bard slowly handed her a heavy mail bag and he was smiling, as he began to speak again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will learn much in you travels and adventures and be given an opportunity to learn your family history. In doing so, you will find subject matter of many new songs and stories. Perhaps, you will even find a muse.&quot; as he said this, a twinkle came to his eyes.<br>
 <br>
The younger bard stood with a puzzled look upon her face, still holding the mailbag, pondering what had just occurred and what adventures lay ahead of her. Anyone walking by, would have deemed her to be simple.<br>
 <br>
The bartender interrupted her thoughts and brought her back to her back to reality only by asking her “Aren’t you going to partake of the cheese and muffins Miss Silverrleaf?”.<br>
<br>
Startled by this, she glanced about her, realizing the elder bard had left the tavern.  Recovering herself quickly, she turned, tossed him a gold piece and strode out of the tavern.<br>
 <br>
She returned to the place that she had known all of her life as home, gathered her meager possessions and placed them carefully together in her back pack.<br>
 <br>
She removed her amor, still pondering what was yet to come, drew back the coverlet of her bed , climbed in, and blew out the lantern on the nightstand next to her bed.<br>
  <br>
Silverrleaf was awakened the next morn by the crowing of the rooster just as the sun was rising upon the horizon. Much to her chagrin, she woke slowly and with much resistance from her fatigued body.<br>
<br>
She had not slept well at all. Hellish dreams of glinting green goblins, and purplish orcs with glowing putrid yellow eyes haunted her, and kept her tossing and turning all night as she tried desperately to evade them in her dreams. She had been awakened several times during that night by her own screaming, because of what these relentless beasts were going to do to her if she was captured.<br>
<br>
She knew that she must not dally with these remembrances now, for they had only been mere dreams and because she had a boat to catch this morning. She decided that she was looking forward to this trip.<br>
<br>
Throwing aside the coverlet, she rose from her bed, gathered her tunic and leggings began to dress for her trip. <br>
<br>
She padded to the bathroom quietly, so as not to disturb the others in the house, and began to brush her teeth and her hair. She gazed at her face in the mirror for a moment, and wondered just what lay in store for this visage that shined back at her.<br>
<br>
Silverrleaf reminded herself that she had to hurry, knowing full and well that the harbormaster kept a tight schedule. Re-entering her sleeping quarters, she began to gather her few possessions together, and glanced one last time about the room that she had come to know as home. <br>
<br>
As her eyes fell upon the desk and the stiff, high-backed chair, she remembered her quill, ink well, and parchment. She gathered these together and placed them carefully inside her nap sack. <br>
<br>
She walked quietly to the door, opened it slowly, and without looking back, she closed that door.<br>
<br>
Her paced quickened, a purpose in mind, her steady strides led her from the building and on to the street. Even at this early hour, the streets of Freeport were beginning to fill with both humans and elves, eager to start the day’s business.<br>
<br>
 She noticed that the closer in proximity that she got to the docks, the more frenzied became the activity. She stopped at a nearby shop that had just opened for business for the day, but only long enough to purchase a few biscuits, a canteen and a fishing pole, and some bait. She was in such a hurry that she even forgot her change, and the young shopkeeper had to chase her almost to the port in order to give it to her.<br>
<br>
Once at the port, she purchased her ticket and was informed that the boat to Faydwer would be pulling into the port at any moment, and she was given instructions upon which pier she should await its arrival. <br>
 <br>
As she began to bait the hook of her fishing pole, she heard a sound echoing in the distance, much like that of a horn. <br>
<br>
An elf standing next on her on the pier exclaimed “Ahhh the boat….gather your belongings child if yee don’t wish to miss it.”. <br>
<br>
She collapsed her fishing pole, still holding the pole, she re-donned her backpack.<br>
<br>
The boat approached the dock , majestic in its size and presence. The gangplank was lowered and the occupants disembarked. Overjoyed family members, greeted the ones that they loved with warm hugs and affectionate kisses. <br>
<br>
She wondered what it would be like when she reached the shores of Faydwer, and what the elf sent to meet her upon those shores would be like. Her reverie was broken only by <br>
the announcement that passengers to Faydwer could now board <br>
<br>
She stood for a moment observing the hustle and bustle of people boarding the boat when the elf next to her poked her gently and spoke “Now is the time child.”  Silverrleaf strode up the gangplank and handed her ticket to the purser. Realizing at this point that her journey had just begun.<br>
