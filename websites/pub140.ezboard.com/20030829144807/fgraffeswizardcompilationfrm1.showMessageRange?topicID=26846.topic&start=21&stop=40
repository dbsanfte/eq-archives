I can't Imagine a tradeskill class which from what they are saying now doesn't hunt in groups to exp is going to catch alot of interest from EQ's player base.<br>
<br>
Sure since it's necessary it'll end up being everyones first alt, but frankly thats a poor way to go about doing things. I mean look at enchanters in EQ, back in the day there used to be 1 or 2 per zone everyone bugged for clarity and that was about it. Very small population compared to more directly involved classes.<br>
<br>
Also, to the person who said 1 char per server. It really wouldn't surprise me, just look at SWG. They know people are willing to front for the second account anyway, so might as well not make it an option. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nafarius1>Nafarius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 9:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I already knew I wasn't going to play EQ2.

I've just read up on the game in general, as they are still in closed beta I believe.<br>

<br>
(2) It's their game and they can do what they want but if they were smart they would have been taking notes from all the popular boards over the years.  Some messages sing loud and true over and over again.  I won't get into all of them, but shame on them for not listening.<br>
<br>
(3) Roleplay is awesome if the game is really developed around it.  Rather, I find that many times I'm playing a fantasy MM FPS.  Develop the history properly and really add dynamic content (like the frog attack--although I hated that that's a good sign).  Don't keep the world static and don't charge us for those kind of changes!<br>
<br>
(4) Questing is awesome when: (A) There is real story-line and the game's history is strong. Otherwise it sucks, which is how I find many of the quests in EQ--thus I don't quest. (B) The quest isn't so damn tedious (i.e. not so many rare drops of off rare mobs). Otherwise refer to what happens in 'A' above.<br>
<br>
(5) Item decay to quell mudflation is just wrong.  It's a damn game!  Who the hell cares what Joe Schmoe has and more importantly why on God's green earth would the item just decay to nothingness.  Damn I've used my non-uber chef knives for years and they work just fine and don't show any sign of just disintegrating.  If you care that item 'X' has 'Y' assigned value so much become a damn accountant and get out of my game.<br>
<br>
Lastly, OT, I could never understand when some mob was beating the piss out of me or my guild and he was clearly holding some item in his hand that when we killed him he didn't drop that item.  Or why is it that named mobs who would obviously have some story line behind them wouldn't ALWAYS carry their items of &quot;ass kickedness&quot;.  Explain any reasonable reason for these in a fantasy role playing game.  I can't.<br>
<br>
Still playing EQ but I hope to see some of you in WoW and Mythica. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xcoltranex>xCOLTRANEx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 11:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> I think the original author of this post makes many good points, this being the most important that I have seen...<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Next lets go on to item wear and repair.....Certain items shouldn't decay AT ALL, I've seen no mention of exemptions.....It's presumed that people will grow out of items...Situations where items that have some sentimental value....&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
there are certain items for me that I have used from level 1-55, and will continue to use until the very last day i play EQ....<br>
<br>
with item decay, can you imagine the amount of back-feeding that will go on as useful items are vanishing on high level players?  i think the thought that all items will be &quot;out growable&quot; at some level is too optimistic, and impossible to implement.  there have GOT to be some lower level items that high level chars will still find usable, or a robe with cool graphics, etc....<br>
<br>
to put this in EQ terms-- i dont wanna do the TFlux or Jboots quests over and over, etc....how over-camped would Aten be when all the KEI robes on your uber casters wear out?? etc....<br>
<br>
one redeeming quality for me (as a late starter) of EQ is that once most content gets passed by the big guilds, they really have no reason to go back and do it again once everyone is set up (NToV, SSRA, etc)..<br>
<br>
just my 2cp, and a thought on possible problems...<br>

<br>
Tradeskill Class:  First and foremost I think the idea of a class wholely focused on it is a stupid idea.  On the other hand I believe that certain classes should be focused towards only a select few trade skills.  IE: Fighter classes would have the selection of Black Smithing, Fletching and brewing tradeskills.  Good selection with only one of them being mastered.  Priest Classes: Alchemy, tailoring, (class limited) smithing, spell research and brewing.  And so on.  Things that make sense when considering the class and the trade skill.  Heck I'd even consider trying some mix within the trade skills.  Example: Rogue classes able to blacksmith, but only chain type armors.  Warrior and plate wearing Priests plate.<br>
<br>
Well it's at least a consideration. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phaedran>Phaedran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 701<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 12:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> I like the idea of a tradeskill class. Item wear and tear is good  for the player economy in my opinion. This will stabilize the economy and make it so players have to spend looted cash and items to keep on going.  <br>
The fact items do not decay in EQ1 resulted in the lame ass mudflation you see today where older items values plummet and new items prices are through the roof. <br>
It makes more sense that tradeskillers would have superior skill with creating/maintaing items than professional adventurers, it's what they will specialize in, afterall. <br>
One thing I hope they do, so people cannot have mules, is limit people to a SINGLE character per server per account.  Sure, this won't stop the two boxers, but they need their heads examined,anyway. <br>
The death penalty is fine: you die, there's a price to pay to reenter the land of the living. <br>

You can't say item decay/wear is going to be a bad thing if you don't know how difficult it is to get a good item, or how long it takes for the item to wear in the first place.<br>
<br>
You can't say that the death penalty is going to break the game if you don't even know how likely a person is to die, or how rare it is to find a rez.  Maybe there is going to be a graveyard-like concept, as there is in PoP.<br>

Have you ever visited the EQ-Traders message boards?  It seems like there are plenty of people who would be interested in a tradeskill class to me. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79710">Ealadan Azurefire</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It holds back mudflation and it makes items more valuable.  It also increases the player to plaer interraction.  I have played under this system and it's terrific.  It's not new but it works to hold back mudflation well.  <br>
<br>
As for sentimental value please name one item in EQ you actually currently wear for sentimental value that you obtained more than two years ago.  Don't be an idjot.... there is not a single thing I still wear regularly.  My orange hat is in the bank to be taken out for fun... it never would have worn out... plus wear and tear will be reversable in large part.... <br>
<br>
As for death... so what if you lose an item... its mud junk stop yah kvetching.  <br>
<br>
I see the biggest issue with Player made stuff is that it's all the same.  You need a system to differentiate items to give them a personal feel.  <br>

Item wear, item destruction and XP loss on death are all put in so players have to repeatedly do certain simple tasks to slow people down.  No one WANTS to go farm their 10th same peice of armor because their old one wore out or got poofed.  No one WANTS to lose XP when they die and then have to turn around and regrind it.  By having slow travel time, low rewards for killing mobs, long mob/boss respawns etc. they're pacing people's experience of the game so people will keep playing.  People got fed up with slow travel in EQ1, so they sped it up in EQ2 but to keep the game's pace from speeding up to the &quot;experience the entire game in 2 weeks Diablo2&quot; point they introduce item decay so you have to repeatedly replace gear or farm money to get it fixed.<br>
 <br>
  I think the death penalty is fricken brilliant personally.  When someone dies it'll make them WANT to log off and come back tomorrow so they don't have to grind the XP debt off.  It'll make people feel like they're achieving something while offline, keeping people interested AND putting a speedbump into the game at the same time.  Sheer genius. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1320<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By the way there are a number of people that like the tradeskill class idea, and that like the item decay idea.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Watch Star Wars Galaxies when its released. It fully embraces the Trade skilling aspect.  Lets see how it does, because frankly, most reports from Beta say its lame. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malynnarathorn>Malynn Arathorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> Did this phrase make anyone else almost spit pepsi all over their monitor?<br>

However, I will play a bit of a devils advocate.<br>
<br>
Most of peoples complaints about tradeskills, item wear, item loss, etc, all seem to be comming from a very EQ1-centric point of view.<br>
<br>
Yeah, if SoE was to implement item wear/loss/etc into EQ, it would blow goats more then I'd care to imagine. Yeh, I've had items I've used for 3 years on my toon and never gotten around to upgrading till rescently (kkthnxdustybloodstainedgloves). Why would it suck hard in EQ? because the game was not designed around these concepts.<br>
<br>
In EQ2, if the game is being designed and based on the concepts of item loss, decay and tradeskills, most likely (or one can hope) that the rate of item flow in/out of the game and how people obtain items is done in a natural manner which does not involve exessive backfeeding.<br>
<br>
Stop thinking of EQ2 concepts in EQ1 terms, cause well, in that case yeah, it is pretty shitty.<br>
