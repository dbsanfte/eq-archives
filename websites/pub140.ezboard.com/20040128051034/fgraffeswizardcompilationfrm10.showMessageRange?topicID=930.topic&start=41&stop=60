That's a myth or wrong perceived.<br>
Some people think, that at level 65 ALL casting classes regen 3 more mana, when medding. So it's not a real specific wiz 'innate' bonus.<br>
<br>
And yes, i seriously think we could use a boost in mana self regen too, if we can't use a horse. (So, in dungeons.)<br>
Outdoors our manaregen is ok.<br>
(But LDoN will not be an outdoor zone...)<br>

<br>
At level 52, with manaskin and familiar, I get a 2 tick increase from my own buffs, and harvest, which gives me about 9% mana back. With and earring, 3 tick. All other three classes, have much more effective ways of restoring mana either by self buffs, mana draining, or pet reclaiming. Even shaman and beastlords have better self mana regen at level 52. And all their mana regen spells and methods start way earlier. We get Harvest at 34, and then don't see anything else till 49, 54.<br>
<br>
Yes, wizards come into their power later. That doesn't mean it's fairly balanced. Moving down the mana regen on familiars to start at level 29 doesn't overpower wizards. Same for incresing the amount of mana gathered from the Harvest, or reducing the recast time on it, say to 5-6 minutes. And yes, adding or increasing the mana tick on our rune spells would be good to. <br>
<br>
As for a self clarity, not to sure how I feel about that. Possibly by increasing what we currently have, there wouldn't be a need for one.<br>
<br>
But if Druids really wanted to support wizards in something for our support of them, then perhaps a fix on Manaburn might be something all wizards could agree on. I'm not talking about restoring it to what it was, but perhaps just two things, Increase the amount of damage it does, a much higher mana to damage ratio, and return the chance to crit with it. Keeping the 1 minute rule is fine with me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3545<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 9:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> &gt;Generally speaking, when I think of what wizards need, I try and look at the class as a whole from begining to end, not just at what level I'm at.<br>

Except you do look at just the level you are at and ignore the rest, then you ask for things that will make you more powerful at your level and every level after that, with no effort required on your part at all. All that and you still fail to realize that even at the level you are talking about your self mana regen stacks with everyone elses buffs, making you more powerful if you do get those buffs. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

True.  What level of FT does each familiar give right now?  I was long past those levels when familiars came out.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Same for incresing the amount of mana gathered from the Harvest, or reducing the recast time on it, say to 5-6 minutes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ah, but here you are wrong.  Making harvest more powerful effects every wizard all the way to 65, and we all acknowledge that as far as mana regen goes, we are fine at 65.  Any solutions for lower level wizards must not effect end game wizards or they are unbalancing.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But if Druids really wanted to support wizards in something for our support of them, then perhaps a fix on Manaburn might be something all wizards could agree on. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You seem to have this odd view of balance.  Like, i'll support your whacky idea, but only if you support my cause too.  Balance issues are usually ones where every class acknowledges that a class needs something, for instance almost every class in EQ was behind necros wanting dot stacking, whether wizards were boosted or not.  Balance involves just that, balance.  Balance adjustments are made to keep everyone on as close to an even keel as possible.  Most of the suggestions i have seen in this &quot;i'll scratch your back if you scratch mine&quot; theory would result in every class in EQ being significantly more powerful than we are currently.  This would neccessitate rebalancing encounters.  This would suck.  If someone honestly thinks thats druids need better heals regardless, i can respect that even though i disagree pretty strongly.  But if you think that, it should not matter whether or not druids think wizards should get whatever you are crusading for.  It doesn't work like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bricsummerthorne>BricSummerthorne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 10:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Not at all true. The level 29 familiar having a one mana regen tick doesn't effect me, as I don't use that familiar anymore at level 52. If mana regen was stuck on lower rune shields, that still doesn't benifit me, as I'm not using them, and they don't stack with each other, It's not like I will have 3 runes on myself. <br>
<br>
So again, this helps wizards lower in level then me. At best, the level 49 familiar would have a 2 tick mana regen. And even if they doubled the mana regen from manaskin, I would have only 4 tick increase for myself up to level 54, when I could get a another tick from that familar for a total of 5 mana increase.<br>
<br>
My comparison was to show that the three other classes, by level 52, have much better means of self mana regen already. I speak from my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>experience</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> up to then. Just as you speak from your experience as 60+ wizard. <br>
<br>
But lets jump above 52 and see what we get at say 58.<br>
<br>
At 58, magicians get Transon's Phatasmal Protection +4 mana tick, +7 hp tick. This combined with pet reclaiming gives them very good ability to restore mana fast. So 4 mana tick, plus pet reclaiming. I'm not even counting thier own mana preservation focus items, as we are talking about mana regen, rather then mana preservation.<br>
<br>
At 54, enchanters get clarity 2, 11 mana tick and Gift of insight 56, which is 100 extra mana, and +1 tick. And where appropriate, mana taps. So total +12<br>
<br>
Necros at 56 get Demilich, 31 mana for 46 hps. And at 55, infusion which is 1000 instant mana, castable every tem minutes, but does cost an essence emerald. However, there are plenty of people out there more then willing to sell thier XP, so every necro I have known has several of these gems. So 31 mana, and 1000 mana every ten minutes. <br>
<br>
Wizards, have familiar at 54, 2 tick increase, manaskin one tick increase. Harvest, around 290 at level 58. So 3 ticks, plus 290 mana every ten minutes. Nothing I can see says that spell shield and manasink have a regen factor as part of them.<br>
<br>
All four classes get mental clarity, so by 58, they all have that bonus. You count your epic, but that isn't as easily gotten as all the other abilites I have listed here. Yes, some spells are rare drops. But, you can buy a spell, you can't buy your epic.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, I honestly can say that I think druids and shaman need a boost in thier healing spells. I've also said that they shouldn't be as good as cleric heals, but currently, I don't think they even come close.<br>
<br>
Why is asking druids for support of our cause's in return for support of thier causes a good thing to me? It's called community support. When enchanters got thier illusions changed, I sent in feedback. I'm not an enchanter. When monks got nerfed, I sent in feedback. I'm not a monk. These changes really effected the those classes, and not in good ways. I've yet to hear how faction changes with illusions over powered enchanters. <br>
<br>
I see no reason for classes to be so against each other all the time. I'm not threatened by druids having better heals. I wasn't even against magicians getting better fire pets, just how it was being done. I've never had a problem with magicians having nukes that are comparable to ours. <br>
<br>
It's not like Druids came here wanting our abilities. But the first comments were to shove of druids, I'm not supporting you, your over powered as it is now. <br>
<br>
You can call it you scratch my back, I scratch yours. I call it give and take. A little of something for everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3546<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 11:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> &gt;Not at all true.

<br>
No, you just don't think things through is all. Almost every thing you mentioned does have an impact on later levels in some manner with the possible exception of the familiars.<br>
<br>
&gt;So again, this helps wizards lower in level then me. At best, the level 49 familiar would have a 2 tick mana regen. And even if they doubled the mana regen from manaskin, I would have only 4 tick increase for myself up to level 54, when I could get a another tick from that familar for a total of 5 mana increase.<br>
<br>
The familiar change is the only one thing you talk about that even remotely might make sense. Talking about doubling the mana regen from manaskin would also give it twice the regen that Force Shield gets and 1 more than the Epic has.<br>
<br>
&gt;My comparison was to show that the three other classes, by level 52, have much better means of self mana regen already. I speak from my experience up to then. Just as you speak from your experience as 60+ wizard. <br>
<br>
I speak from my experience at playing a Wizard at every single level of the game. Contrary to your apparent opinion, most of us don't buy our Wizards fully equipped at level 65. <br>
<br>
&gt;Necros at 56 get Demilich, 31 mana for 46 hps. And at 55, infusion which is 1000 instant mana, castable every tem minutes, but does cost an essence emerald. However, there are plenty of people out there more then willing to sell thier XP, so every necro I have known has several of these gems. So 31 mana, and 1000 mana every ten minutes. <br>
<br>
The Lich line does not stack with the clarity line. Necros do not, as a rule, use Infusion on a normal basis. They have several of those gems because you can res someone with them. Lich also takes health, which can be a downside at times.<br>
<br>
&gt;But lets jump above 52 and see what we get at say 58.<br>
<br>
If you are going to jump to 58, why don't you jump to... 60? or 65?<br>
<br>
&gt;At 58, magicians get Transon's Phatasmal Protection +4 mana tick, +7 hp tick. This combined with pet reclaiming gives them very good ability to restore mana fast. So 4 mana tick, plus pet reclaiming. I'm not even counting thier own mana preservation focus items, as we are talking about mana regen, rather then mana preservation.<br>
<br>
Transon's does not stack with PoTC and the like, something all your mana regen does. Pet reclaiming takes a lot more work than you think it does.<br>
<br>
&gt;At 54, enchanters get clarity 2, 11 mana tick and Gift of insight 56, which is 100 extra mana, and +1 tick. And where appropriate, mana taps. So total +12<br>
<br>
And they can cast it on you, giving you thair mana regen AND your own regen.<br>
<br>
&gt;Wizards, have familiar at 54, 2 tick increase, manaskin one tick increase. Harvest, around 290 at level 58. So 3 ticks, plus 290 mana every ten minutes. Nothing I can see says that spell shield and manasink have a regen factor as part of them.<br>
<br>
So you have 5 mana/tick that stacks with everything else, and has no real downside.<br>
<br>
&gt;All four classes get mental clarity, so by 58, they all have that bonus. You count your epic, but that isn't as easily gotten as all the other abilites I have listed here. Yes, some spells are rare drops. But, you can buy a spell, you can't buy your epic.<br>
<br>
The epic is not exactly hard to get these days. And, technically, you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> actually buy most of your epic.<br>
<br>
&gt;And, no I don't fail to realize that my self mana regen stacks with others. Clarity 2 stacks with the magicians Transons. With necros demiliche. <br>
<br>
But yes, you do fail to realize it. Because Lich doesn't stack with Clarity, and Transoms doesn't stack with PotC. All of your mana regen does. And even then you have to pick arbitrary levels to make you look like you are so poor and weak. Sorry, not buying it. <br>
<br>
&gt;And I have been talking about what we can do for ourselves, not what others can do for us.<br>
<br>
And that is exactly the problem with the way you look at things.<br>
<br>
&gt;And as I've said, i don't think our own self mana regen should be on par with enchanters. But that doesn't mean it can't be upped some.<br>
<br>
It doesn't mean it should either, especially when you consider that the mana regen Enchanters get just adds to your own. I still haven't seen any pressing need for anything you have mentioned. As far as I can tell, you just want a Munchkin class, and you are unhappy that it isn't as close to that as you thought it would be. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Believe me, druids don't need more, except for a few of em need brains (see patch healing on mobs that Quad 600 onto a druid after your breathern druid has patched)<br>
<br>
EDIT<br>
After reading more, i must say.. WHAT A BUNCH OF WHINEY PRIESTS. Clerics, i've played you, your heals are awesome, your other abilities suck. Druid, my main, own. Shaman, which i've also played. Have the manaregeneration unrivialed, even thou you have to spend most of it on slowing, your dots, nukes, and other abilities allow you to be fairly powerful. Wizards are kinda unfun, all you get to do is nuke :/ <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=535200"> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://yesspeaceface.homestead.com/files/cristobansig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://grubs.cabalistic.org/">The Grubs </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crist0ban>Crist0ban</A> at: 6/18/03 1:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 2:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heal Like a Cleric</span><hr size=1> Qaman, ok, your starting to come across as putting words in my mouth. I've never claimed to by unhappy or wanting to make a munchin class out wizards. Far from it. I think in this thread and other threads, I've always stated I'm happy with wizards. But I would never make a claim that any single once class doesn't need a tweek here or there.<br>
<br>
You've also have brought up stacking issues, and I haven't been talking about what stacks with what. I've been talking about what we can do for ourselves. <br>
<br>
When I went and read up on the other classes ability to self improve thier mana regen, one of the things I did look at was stacking issues. And I saw nothing about the lich line not stacking with clarity, but I'm more then willing to take your word for it. What I did see was comments about how the lose of hit points for mana was not much to be concerned about, as the dots and life taps easily compensate for this. Also, who is to say a necro would never use infusion. <br>
<br>
Magicians Transon does stack with everything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>but</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> PoTC, so it's not like they have the option of their own or someone elses, the can have clarity and other such mana regen buffs along with Transons.<br>
<br>
And pet reclaiming is not hard. Just boring, and runs through Malachite. Not to mention I completely left out magicians mod rods, which while converts hp to mana, which the mass rod, is clickable for 300 mana (for 450 hp, yes) every 5 minutes. Which means in ten minutes, a level 56 magician can get back 600 mana via mod rods, while harvest doesn't even give back 300 at 56. <br>
<br>
But again, this was never a statement about stacking mana regen. This was about our self ability to improve our mana regen.<br>
<br>
Sure, if you had one part of the epic, and found two other non-wizards with the other parts of the epic, different then yours, you could pay them to help you multiquest it. That still doesn't mean counting the epic mana regen applies to everyone.<br>
<br>
As for doubling manaskin, manaskin has a 1 tick increase. Doubling it would make that 2. The epic has a 3 tick. 2 is less then 3. Force Field is level 63, and yes, the epic barrier of force is better. But they don't stack, so even if Force Field was doubled, that's only 4 your not able to stack it with your other manaskin/regen spells. Since Force Field is part of PoP, having it be better then the epic effect makes sense. If the epic effect was meant to be the best of all times, there wouldn't have been any reason for magicians to get new PoP pets, as they wouldn't be better then the epic pet.<br>
<br>
Manaskin and Force Field are the only two spells we get with a built in mana regen along this line. <br>
<br>
And I don't think I'm advocating increasing all our mana regen spells across all levels. I'm advocating improving our lower end ones. <br>
<br>
Currently, familars offer this in mana regen:<br>
29-0<br>
49-1<br>
54-2<br>
60-4<br>
<br>
If at 59 you get the improved familar, it's a 6 mana tick, and the alligent familar is 8. So, moving it down doesn't have to mean increasing the higher end. <br>
<br>
29-1<br>
49-2<br>
54-3<br>
<br>
and the rest stay the same. But even if you followed the progression, the level 64 alligent famaliar would have 10 mana regen, Epic would have 3, or force field 4 (if we doubled it), mental clarity 3 totaling 17 (10+3+4) per tick, over 14 (8+3+3). <br>
<br>
Even if they changed just familars and manaskin and not harvest or HoD, at best, at level 52, I've given myself an increase of 2 per tick in mana. That is hardly over powering. <br>

Soloing, they can avoid almost all damage.  They don't need healing.<br>
<br>
Soloing, they can avoid being hit with range.  They don't need tanking.<br>
<br>
A Wizard in a group gets:<br>
1&gt; More sitting time, hence more mana regen.<br>
2&gt; Extra mana regen buffs.<br>
3&gt; Can kill summoning mobs.<br>
4&gt; Reduction in room needed to kill a mob.<br>
<br>
The Wizard pays:<br>
1&gt; Gets to use her less efficient single target nukes.<br>
2&gt; Has to share her XP with non-damage dealing classes.<br>
<br>
If you want to improve wizards mana regen at lower levels, improve other classes lower level buffs, and make more classes that can buff each others mana regen at lower levels.  Short duration buffs please.<br>
<br>
Self mana regen is also solo mana regen.  And Wizards have never had solo XP problems.<br>
<br>
In a group or in a raid, a wizard will have more mana regen than most other members of his group or raid.  Shamans and Necros will tend to have better.<br>
<br>
Pet cannibalization takes time and, before suspend minion, renders the mage defenceless.  It also requires you to rebuff and regear the pet after you canni, plus it costs you your pets DPS while you are doing it.  And, it can't be used in any place where pets can't be used.<br>
<br>
Mod rods generate 7 mana per tick net, or 9 mana per tick in the target, when used perfectly.  Burst mana regen is naturally higher.<br>

In my whole time as a wizard, I have only spent three days quadding XP. And that was only because my guild was having a friendly contest to see who could be the guilds first Baron. And I was competing against another wizard, a druid, and a SK with a cleric alt.<br>
<br>
I'm not always grouped with an enchanter, which at my level, is the only class that can give me a decent mana regen buff. I am not always in an outdoor zone, with the benefit of a mount. Because I don't try and structure every group I'm in around Tank, cleric, enchanter/shaman. <br>
<br>
Also, this is line of discussion still doesn't address what is so wrong with supporting druids?

(No offense, but it is really rediculous).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Transon's does not stack with PoTC and the like, something all your mana regen does. Pet reclaiming takes a lot more work than you think it does.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well let's discuss manaregen then, but please stay objective and look for the reasons, why we get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>a minor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bonus to manaregen.<br>
<br>
First off, we have our share of not stacking manaregen buff. Epic and SD does not stack, like Transon's does not stack with PoTC.<br>
Pet reclmaining is not as much effort as you think, it is actually very efficient and quite easy. In groups the Mage is not defenseless, if he does it as well, since he got his other pet (the PC tank, duh) on the target.<br>
<br>
So, let's see further:<br>
<br>
Druids get treeform and other forms of manaregen, when they are soloing. (And they have about the same manaregen when soloing like we do have, but they have on top heals and buffs and charms and all other things who help them soloing.) In groups they offer much more than a Wizard, who is only nuking. So, this makes up for the 2, 3 more manaregen that we get.<br>
<br>
Clerics get Blessed armor of the risen, which is 6 manaregen and stacks with everything (but focus, i believe). Since Cleric heals are not resisted like our nukes and are much more efficient than our nukes are and they don't have a lot of grouping problems our 3, 4, manaregen seems to be justified.<br>
<br>
Mages have their pets, if they are OOM. They don't need nessecarily mana to do damage and contribute to the group. In fact they are the caster-class with the best sustained damage.<br>
<br>
Necros: See mages, but on top, they have amaging manaregen abbilities, especially at high levels. 90+ manaregen is easily surpassable.<br>
<br>
Wizards: We have ONLY our mana to contribute to the group. We don't buff, we don't debuff, we have no pets, we nuke only. Our nukes can be resisted, and they ARE resisted allmost much as nukes from any other nuking class. (They neg 10 innate resistance bonus is a joke, really.)<br>
The 3, 4, 5 more manaregen that we get from our manaregen abbilities are more than nessecary for us and justified. Especially in dungeon zones where you can't use a horse.<br>
Think about it... 5 more manaregen results in 500 mana every 10 minutes. That are two post 60 draughts every 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
SOE is not naive. There was a reason why we did get Harvest and HoD later on.<br>

You might have overread that i am pretty much happy as a wiz and please don't impute some kind of 'class-envy' for me, when i just try to correect you pro-biased statements.<br>
<br>
I think i have to be even more precise, 'you just don't think things through is all' (as you said.)<br>
<br>
In accordance to your manaregen statements:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Lich line does not stack with the clarity line. Necros do not, as a rule, use Infusion on a normal basis. [...] Lich also takes health, which can be a downside at times.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Necros do have the best manaregen in game (maybe together with shamen), there can't be a dispute about that. Whether they use it or not is a omplcetly different topic. In groups they may not need their lich-line, because they have so many other things to contribute to the group (for example their Pet, duh) when they are OOM. This is not class-envy it is a fact and it is just one example why i think, our manaregen-line is not overpowered and could need even some more improvements, maybe in the next expansion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Transon's does not stack with PoTC and the like, something all your mana regen does. Pet reclaiming takes a lot more work than you think it does.<br>
---------<br>
No, but I don't compare that with stacking Transoms and PotC either. Do you? Oh wait, you do. Like I said, most of your posts are just as laughable and just as fact ridden.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So you have a comprehension problem, i see.<br>
You said ALL of our manaregen does stack and i gave you one example that it is not true. Your statements is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WRONG</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Qaman, not all of our manareen does stack with every buff.<br>
Second wrong assumption is that pet canni is a lot of work.<br>
First, pet canni in dungone exp group situation is very usefull and powerfull. I grouped with a guild-mage the last days in CoD to Plevel some alts. As you surely know, we can't use horses in CoD and i just nuked away without watching my mana, same did the Mage. All of sudden he started to reclaim his pets several times and after 2 minutes (!) he was FM again.<br>
I as the Wiz could not do it, even not with both Harvests up. Pet canni is not limited to a 10 minute timer like our Harvests are.<br>
Now you assume we have better manaregen (without counting pet-canni) than Mages. Dou, boy, that is true. But did you think through , why we do have beter manaregen than a Mage? Because we are useless OOM, the Mage is not. Is that class-envy? Nope, it is not, Qaman. I did not even complain about those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, it's part of our class. I just gave you one reason, why our manregen might be better than that of Mages, duh.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The epic is not exactly hard to get these days. And, technically, you can actually buy most of your epic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well, i won't comment on your 'you-can-buy-the-wiz-epic' statement, but i personally think it's not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> easy, still. Aside that, the epic is 3 manaregen, that are whooping 300 mana every 10 minutes. (Gasp, it's 1 1/2 nukes.) I consider the manaregen part of the epic-buff as a bonus, it does not help that much.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But yes, you do fail to realize it. Because Lich doesn't stack with Clarity, and Transoms doesn't stack with PotC. All of your mana regen does.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you play in that league, Qaman, than you fail to realize that the Epic does not stack with SD. SO you are not 'better' than the original poster.<br>
<br>
All previous statements by me are not made because of class-envy, just to correct your biased perception, that you showed in your comments to Faramir's post.<br>
<br>
If you already feel the need to twist words ('All of our mnaregen stacks', etc yada yada), then do it in a fair way without putting words in other people's mouth.<br>
<br>
Oh, a finaly comment is left to be made, in accordance to you last staement to me, Qaman:<br>
<br>
&quot;I still have the feeling you&quot; try to nerf the Wiz-class wherever you can, because you make comments that sound like 'i think we are overpowered already'. You would be much beter off as a Velious- or, perhaps, Kunark-Wiz. Every single one of your posts seems to be about our overpowering abbilities compared to other classes and how those other classes can't do anything. It does sound like your guild would be better off replacing you with a weaker Wiz at least, you make it too easy to them.<br>
<br>
Like I said, Qaman, most of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>your</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> posts are just as laughable and just as fact ridden, trying to twist every fact in favor to your YA-sayer opinion and in doing so, you make even wrong and stupid comparisons. (Wiz manaregen stacks with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->... riiiiiiiiiiiiight.)<br>

This ability has been ingame and known widely since dawn of time, introduction of focus effect (summoning effiency 3) in luclin made it usable tactic and serverwide used. This is not a new thing.<br>
<br>
We gain spell &quot;reclaim energy&quot; at level 1 to do this way of mana regen or more likely, way to take mana back from damaged pet to resummon a new one. Mages get item with this effect (instant) around level 20-30 through newbie quest in sol ro temple. The way to gain some usefull scores with this tactic you have to be atlest 51+ in level.<br>
<br>
Mages are totally defendless while doing this, they also can not use their pets that is the base source of magician damage while regaining mana this way. <br>
<br>
If group is working like it should, constant pulls and fighting there is no gain regaining mana this way. For example cod rats, mage water pet when positioned behind the mob does over 50% of our damage, pushing 80-90 dps solid. If the mage was canning and not using his pet, he was killing his damage output. If group has alot of downtime, this ability also evens out with wizards, becouse of your harvest and better mana regen generally. Our manaregen is limited to one buff in pop, XPG that gives us 6 points and self use of rods, 4 points, and if you compare this to what wizards can regen..<br>
<br>
And I fail to see the point, mages have always been better in very long runs in overall damage output than wizards, mainly in exp groups. In penalty for this, we get no CC abilities nor evac or so forth and not to mention to deal damage quickly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Our CC ability is limited to pet enrage in pop that can stop add for 10 whopping seconds. (and usually, mobs strike when pet is about 15% kills it so it dosnt have even chance to enrage) Only things to group we can bring are mod rods that regen you for extra 7 mana if used constant and coth, for dealing in the long run more damage than wizards.<br>
<br>
So our ability when not using pet, standing still and constant canning can give us 60-100 per tick regen highly depending on mage's aa skils and gear. Most of mags wont even reach 60 with this technic. Another point to remember is that normal exp group base mana regen varies from 40-100 per tick depending what classes you have to buff you. (meaning, I stand and eat pets, you sit)<br>
<br>
So I really dont think &quot;pet canni in dungone exp group situation is very usefull and powerfull&quot;. Your group is doing something seriously wrong if there is time to start eating pets.<br>
<br>
Second wrong assumption is that pet canni isnt a lot of work.<br>
To make good use of this effect SCM3, QS3 and SM2 is a must. Thats a load of aa points and you also need to spaw gear for this and have that gear to swap in first place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Its hella annoying, reclaim, cast, wait, reclaim, cast, wait, non-stop.<br>
<br>
Yes, its usable in some situations and good in groups that dont fall into the holy trinity thinking and damn good on CR or tossing rods in raid. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gareonk>gareonk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://cray.tuug.fi/~coe/jetpac.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/19/03 6:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 7:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> OK, this thread has gone way off the orginal subject. Thank you Qaman. If your secret goal was to take away focus from why wizards should or shouldn't support druids, it almost worked.<br>
<br>
There are errors in your facts, and so, I don't find your reasonings to be very sound. You also make general unfounded statements, and support your ideas with things that are techincially possible but highly unlikely. (like buying almost all of the epic). <br>
<br>
When I looked at mana regen of the four classes (and shaman and beastlord) even in the high end, most classes could improve thier mana regen themselves. Because not everyone always travels around with enchanters or high end druids and so on. Sometimes a persons group doesn't have these, but can be very effective group none the less.<br>
<br>
Just because you feel your mana regen at 60+ is fine, it doesn't mean everyone who thinks differently is wrong. And in trying to prove yourself right, all I saw was some worng facts Like if you doubled the mana regen of manaskin, it would be better then the epics. Transons doesn't stack with PoTC and like. But it does stack with clarity and possibly shaman buffs? That's hardly being unstackable, like you tried to make it seem. Yes, I didn't know the lich line didn't stack with clarity, but nothing I read in trying to find out just what other classes can do said that. (but I'm also going to ask around with my necro friends).<br>
<br>
But back to why this thread was started, druids asking us for support. Whats so wrong with it? The wizards that are against it come across as mean spirited people, with responses like tak off, hoser.<br>
<br>
Some wizards are saying Druids heal just fine, I was in so and so and we had a druid healing and no one died. That doesn't mean that the druid was happy healing, or that it wasn't an easy task, or that it didn't take all her mana. They might have had no problem with it. Or they might have just shut up and did it cause they felt a group was better then no group. Maybe they did like it. <br>
<br>
And if you think asking for support for what wizards want, in return for supporting druids is wrong, well, time to learn something. That's how you get things changed in this world, by having a large number of people support your cause. And in this game, with almost every class against every other class, one class supporting another class would certainly make Sony notice, and maybe, just maybe take what was being said more seriously.<br>
<br>
My three suggestions on things druids can support wizards on are all based on common frustrations or desires from these boards, whether or not you agree with them.<br>
<br>
Many wizards want bigger nukes, for a varity of reasons. Failing getting bigger nukes, an adjustment of the mana cost would be very similar to that. Both of these are things that Sony has done in the past, so neither are unprecidented.<br>
<br>
Many wizards feel that thier ungroupablity, especially in XP groups is because once they OOM, they are uselless. This means that they need to beable to regen mana at a rate which doesn't seriously hamper the group. So upping our own mana regen slightly is a solution. Even if they changed just the famailar and skin lines, at best we are getting maybe 3-4 extra ticks in the high end of the game. <br>
<br>
Wizards mourn the loss of Manaburn, and in general many feel that it is completely useless. It would be great if Sony went back and reviewed manaburn and made it better, but not as good as it used to be.<br>
<br>
None of these are unreasonable (even the improved mana regen) in return for supporting druids. In fact, I would still support druids for an improvement on thier heals, even if we didn't need these.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=101&stop=102>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=930.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=930.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> -
