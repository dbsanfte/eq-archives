All around her there was nothing but ice and snow. Her only companion on this trip was her spirit wolf, again he turned to look at her as if to ask her why. Sighing she knew that she could not get away with out answering him. For some reason he had away of getting any thing out of her that she did not want to speak about, and with only a simple look too. He gave a soft woof and she looked at him again before groaning, knowing full well that he would not give up. Years of being together had made it easy for him to learn her ways and how to deal with her. No matter how much it irritated her that he could, she always felt better after talking to the one being who totally understood her. <br>
<br>
&quot; You know why, but I will tell you again, only the ice and snow of home can ease this pain.&quot; <br>
<br>
If a wolf could be said to give a doubting look he was giving her one at that point. Conveying his thoughts to her as he always had and questioning her decision yet again. It was all she could do not to turn and look at him with her hands on her hips.  She should have known that he would be this troublesome about this, he had grown to like the guild hall way to much, that and the warm weather. She gave him a disgusted look before speaking again to him. <br>
<br>
&quot; I need this wolf, it is the only way that I can get though this and remain myself. And yes they are my family too but this I know they can not help with. At least not at this point, maybe once I have completed the first three waves of the cleansing ceremony I will be able to return to the guild hall. Until them give over and let it rest will you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence came after that and she was thankful for it, the grief and turmoil that she had helped her friend with settled heavily on her shoulders. Since she had come in to her natural ability as a shaman, she had helped those who needed it. Some times it was only using a healing spell, other times it was it was more of a spiritual heal that took a lot out of her. This time the pull had been so strong that it overrode every thing else. The moment she had seen him, she had known that if she helped him it might destroy her. Looking up she saw the cabin against the snow and smiled, for the first time in weeks. Sanctuary, it beckoned to her, almost as if calling to her on a spiritual level. Here she would be able to work thought the grief she had taken in to herself to ease him of the pain that bound him. It had not been easy to walk that road with him, to see and feel every thing over and over till she could take it away.  Only her training made it so that she could keep herself separate, but that did not stop her from feeling it. <br>
<br>
It had taken her some time to get him to open up to her,  and to trust her enough that he did not give her that indifferent look all the time. Once the connection was made she had little trouble leaching out the pain and distrust that  was wrapped around his heart. At first she ahd simply asked for his help on a few quests that she had been given. She gained his trust and listened to him when he had finally managed to talk about his past. Working with him day after day allowed a friendship to form, one that meant more to her than most. She could not help that she had fallen a little in love with him. His caring nature and the sense of humor that very few actually got to see had warmed her, after she had chipped the ice form where it had no place being. <br>
<br>
She had thought that after every thing, he might have felt the same for her but she would never know now. They had been getting ready to start another quest when there had been some kind of mist that formed in front fo them. A woman walked out of it and it only took one look at his face for her to see that this was the one person she could never compete with.  How could a barbarian compare to the grave and beauty of the elves, as she thought that it was confirmed when he stood up. She saw him start to walk towards the stranger, standing herself she took one look at him and then cast the spell that would send her home. She had not even waited to see if he would look back at her, instead she had been greeted by a blast of cold and her wolf companion as she entered Everfrost.<br>
<br>
That was how she had come to be standing in front of her old cabin, and the one place she knew that she would be at peace. Walking in to the cabin she could tell that it needed some work to make it suitable for her to stay in. Stretching she got right to work and had it ready in less time that she thought she would, the roof was in good condition and once she had a fire going it was warmed up the cabin quickly. She cleaned up all the snow that had managed to come in though the rear door. Once she had everything cleaned she unpacked all the supplies that she had brought with her. Turning she headed in to one of the other two rooms, making sure that the bedroom was fit for sleeping in and that her ritual room was intact. She looked around and could almost feel peace seeping in to her just from being in her ritual room. Every thing was where she had left it and knowing that made it so that she could relax at least a little bit. <br>
<br>
She knew that she had some time before she needed to start the first ritual, walking back out to the main room she quickly fixed some food and watched the fire while she ate. When the appointed hour came she rose from the chair she was in and moved in to her ritual room. Lighting several candles, she asked her wolf to guard her while she slipped in to the first level of meditation. Softly the words of power came from her mouth, weaving her deeper in to the center of her spirit. She knew that there was a price for absolution, but she knew her Gods would not take her life for easing the pain. The meditation took on a trance like quality as she offered herself up to the Tribunal for judgment, her body relaxing as her spirit was transported to a different plane. <br>
<br>
~~ She stood before then and waited for the first to speak, the voice was quiet and sounded more in her head than as if actually spoken. Again she was before them but this time she was here for absolution and to have the peace that she needed from the pain. They knew why she was there and waited several moments before asking her if she was sure it was what she wanted. Having gone though it before she knew some of what would be taken for her but since it had become partly personal, it would hurt a lot more. Standing tall she looked at each of them before nodding her head and speaking again. <br>
<br>
&quot; I wish absolution, and seek it here, I know the price and am willing to pay.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every thing around her went black and she closed her eyes, feeling some thing slip in to her mind and sifting though all of her memories of the pain and her helping him. Her soul screamed over and over as she was made to relive everything again, seeing him so quiet and looking alone. The pull of needing to help him in what ever way that she could, then helping him to open up once again and trust. Tears burned her soul as they washed away the pain of reliving his past hurt, and then it started on her own pain. There was a wrenching in her heart as she watched their last parting before she had come home to EverFrost. Again she saw him looking at his lost love and knew that there was nothing more that she could do but wish him happy. Never could she mention the emotions that were hidden deep inside her, to do so would only cause more pain for all of them. After some time she felt the cooling feel of justice, as it washed though her and eased the pain. Forming a layer of ice around her to protect her until she was ready to help the next one that needed her. <br>
<br>
&quot; Thank you.&quot; <br>
<br>
It was simply said but she knew that they were aware of how much this meant to her, now she could return and start again. Light flooded the area where she was kneeling and when she opened her eyes again she was back in her body. Little did she know that it had taken three days for them to give her the what she had been seeking, or that over time if she did not learn to care again the ice would stay there permanently. ~~<br>
<br>
Stretching cramped muscles she turned her head and looked at her wolf, wondering how long she had been in her trance. From the look of things she would have guessed three days at the least. It took a lot of effort to actually stand and she walked in to the main room of her cabin, starting a fire before cooking some thing for her to eat. She wanted to give it a little more time before she had to face the world and every thing that was in it, along with the people that she would have to see at some point. Once her food was ready she went back to sit in front of the fire and her companion came to sit beside her, offering what comfort he could. He told her with out words that it was the morning of the fourth day and that all three waves of the ritual were completed. It surprised her that the Tribunal had done all three steps at the same time, but it was their will to do it as they saw fit. She had a vague sense that he had some thing else to tell her but was unsure if she would want to know it at that point, sighting she looked at him. <br>
<br>
&quot; What it is friend?&quot;<br>
<br>
In their way of communicating he told her of the visitor that had come to see her, only to leave again before she had come out of her healing trance. Kallren frowned and wondered who it could have been that had been there, she knew deep down that it would not have been the one she healed. There would never be a place for her with him again, sadness throbbed though her and the ice hardened, soothing the ache and lessening the pain again. Absently she wondered if she would ever be able to think about him with out needing the soothing cold that followed the absolution. Shaking her head she let it go and looked again at her wolf. <br>
<br>
&quot; Well maybe at some point we will meet who it was again and see if they need my help. Right now I just want to relax for a day or two before we head back to the land of the elves.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence followed that statement and she was content for the moment just to watch the fire burn and relax as much as she could. There were so many thing that she thought about but soon it was all forgotten as the fire consumed the wood. Tomorrow would be another day and she knew that there was more to this life than what she had already experienced. <br>

His trips were taken for many reasons and this one had been to meet some old friends to take on a new land that rumors had passed around.  It took him to the far reaches of the northern lands that held rumors of powerful beings that held great wealth.  Klinget being generally a lone warrior that followed no one leader saw nothing wrong in answering the occasional call of wealth and fame as he saw fit.  This particular trip had been very fruitful in that none of his comrades were lost and they did get some booty that split nicely among them.   These lands were especially harsh to someone so used to fields of green grass which lead to the hot desert or the cool shade of tall forests.  But it was nothing he could not handle with the provisions he had purchased and now carried in his bags with his gear.  The last outpost he had come upon was mostly the tall barbaric type that inhabited this land.  They were mostly well mannered but there were a few southlanders that helped remind him of home.  At this post he had traded with some and talked with many more.  Much information can be found this way and can lead occasionally to very profitable ventures.   He heard tales of the usual, raiding bands of wild orc, packs of gnolls, frenzied goblins running loose.  But someone he met told him of news not from that region but from the land of trees and elves.  Someone was missing.  The man spoke of how a couple had gone out.  One was still unaccounted for but for some reason noone knew where she was but was fairly sure she was alive.  Going on he spoke of how she had disappeared and where she had stood the grass was left frozen and coverd with ice and snow.  Klinget had seen similar happenings many times before in many different ways.  Small areas left burnt, sometimes covered in sand, but to have done this he knew it had to have been a magical gate opened to a harsh and frozen land.  From the description he received he thought he might know who this person was, and if it was he might know where they were going.  This place was far from any outpost, or anything for that fact but ice and snow.  He wondered if jumping from that fair climate to one so cold if the person had been prepared even.  This is what he now set out to find.  This would lead him far off his direct route and called for many more supplies, especially if he needed to help this person. <br>
<br>
      The direction he chose would not be the safest but much quicker.  He did not worry though, the only things he knew that would threaten him would be a few small bands of goblins, and they posed no threat as long as their numbers were small.  Other times though it would be much more dangerous because the tribes of goblins were known to get quiet large but they were warring among themselves and remained small with no treaty.  He set camp when he had to making traps with what he could.  Most the traps were more alarms then mortal.  He slept with his weapons drawn at night in case of any intruders with mal intent.  For several nights he done so with no incidence but knew that he had been noticed and it would only be a matter of time if he did not leave their territory soon.  <br>
<br>
  He had set up camp early and hastily with a storm on the horizon.  Not taking the usual care in his traps he had focused more upon his shelter, he would need it to survive the night.  He fell asleep to the howls of the blizzard that came.<br>
<br>
  And that night they came.  He laid on his side weapon drawn and his back to a rock he used as part of his shelter.  He awoke to the sound of a bloodied gurgle and grasped his sword.  He thought to himself how foolish he was to think nothing would come out in this storm.  His eyes quickly adjusted to the odd darkness that was cast by the blizzard and made out what seemed to be two set of small legs shuffling toward him.  He grit his teeth as they came closer biding his time till they were in reach of his blades.  He could hear more though, but how many could there be he wondered.  He could now make out they were goblins.  As the two came upon him they stopped and one bent down.  As the one did this Klinget quickly drew his dagger and sank it in the creatures gut while jumping to his feet and quickly spinning around landing his sword blade in the side of the puny goblin and cleaving him in half.  This action set the camp alive with shrieks and howls.  He knew there was no use in running and it would be certain death to leave his supplies behind anyhow.  So he grit his teeth and drew his second blade and with a howl that echoed through the winds charged out of his lean to. Charging out he was surrounded by the creatures many carrying torches and many wielding crude weapons.  The goblins cowardly by nature were startled and some ran off but most turned upon him. Keeping their distance from him the first to attack came from behind leaping on his back off the rock he used for cover.  The goblin stabbed at his side and would have been mortal if the crude weapon did not break upon his armor. Quickly slinging the thing from his back and stabbing it as it landed the rest charged him.  Slashing them as they charged they still managed to get close enough to grab him which he would quickly grab and sling them off.  Single they were no match but there were so many. Many times he would get two or three with a single slash but they kept coming. The fighting lasted for hours but seemed like days.  Losing count in his mind after twenty he guessed he must have slain thirty goblins before the few remaining ran off into the storm.  Exhausted he was able to crawl back to his rock before passing out.<br>
<br>
  The next day he woke early.  The blizzard had covered the area leaving almost no trace of the nights happening provided the occasionally stone spear sticking up or tell tell mound of a body underneath.  He quickly gathered his things and set out knowing that if he did not make it beyond the borders they would come again in greater numbers and his death would be certain.<br>
<br>
   Making good time he would spot the occasional goblin and would shoot them with his bow to keep them from running back.  He easily made the days journey and made it well beyond the borders of the ice goblins land.  The only thing left in his way was the ice and snow of the days journey that was left.<br>
<br>
   The next day went by without interference and by late that evening he saw his destination on the horizon.   He could tell from the distance that he had probably made the journey in vane and that all was well by the light he could see through the window of the cabin and the soft plume of smoke coming from the chimney.  When he got to the cabin he knocked and called out.  Answered by nothing he opened the door and was greeted by a loud growl and knocked upon his back with a large wolf standing on his chest now.  He yelled out hoping the master would hear and calm the beast.  As he did the large wolf began to lose its mass and became almost transparent and totally weightless upon him as it heeled and licked his face almost apologetically.   Getting up and out of habit trying to pet the dog only to have his hand pass right through he remember these creatures are only touched when they really want to be.  The wolf turned and trotted back inside the warm cabin and Klinget followed.  The air was thick with incense.  He looked about and the place was well kept and lit but looked like no one had really been there in a day or two.  He looked around more and opened what was a closet and as he went to open the other door the wolf quickly took its solid form it had before threatening him back from the door.  He knew the wolf would always care for its master and for some reason the creature felt they should not be disturbed at this time. <br>
<br>
   It was now getting late and he thought maybe it would be ok to stay inside as long as he didnt go passed the door and the wolf seemed to agree.  He couldnt help but wonder what was past the door as he would watch the canine phasing in the door then back out quickly making sure Klinget was not trying to get through it.  He cooked his meal and made a pallet on the floor and slept feeling safe in this place.<br>
<br>
  The next day he was awoke by the wolf taking its form just long enough to nuzzle him awake.  It was just before daybreak and he thought he may well go.  This place was safe, the goblins dared not venture near these lands for they believed they were evil(which would be good by our standards).  So packing his things back up only taking what he needed to get to the next camp he left the rest thinking they might be  more use to the owner of the cabin, seeing how bare the cupboards were.   As he stepped out he felt a cold wet nose touching his hand but when he turned the wolf had already taken its ghostly form back.  He smiled at dog and said 'good boy' as the dog  sat down shuffled its front feet excitedly and yelped happily.  He shut the door behind him and jumped as the dog poked his head through the door, how magic creatures always managed to creep him out with such tricks.  As he walked off, turning and taking the path towards the south the wolf watched him till he was out of sight.  As he walked he did so at a much more lax pace, almost as a man would through a park.  He thought about his trip and tried to figure his earnings.  He wondered where he should go for he had heard no need of his presence back in his guild hall yet.  He wondered if he would ever find out what was happening behind that door or if he would get to see the person again for that fact.............<br>

Looking at the silent landscape she felt at peace, well mostly at peace. There was still a restlessness in her, almost as if the las was trying to tell her some thing. Maybe it was time that she left the mountains and returned to the land of the elves. There was some thing about that musterous freind that stopped to visist and check on her, she felt drawn to find out who it had been. Out of all the people she had known or knew, none of them seemed the kind to travel all teh way out here just to make sure she was safe. Most were too busy with their own quests or challanges to take the added time to locate her. She felt a wet nose against her hand and smiled down at her companion. <br>
<br>
&quot; Yes it is time to return, we will leave as soon as I finish packing my pack and secure the cabin.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was an excited yip that came from him, chuckling she went back in to the cabin and workeed quickly to lock evey thing down. With her pack sitting on the ground she closed the door and secured it tightly. After one last look at the cabin, she turned and started walking south. She knew that there were goblins and even orcs that might attack her, but they did not stand a chance of stopping her. As she walked the idea of going to the new wayfair camp settled in to her mind, she could stop there and get suplies before asking the Mangus to sent her to Butcherblock Mountains. That way she did n ot have to go to far before she was back in the guild hall. <br>
<br>
Traveling one of the harder trails she was able to think and just enjoy the physical strain of hiking over the icy terrain.IT took her a lot less time to reach the camp and she traded for what she needed before moving to the mangus. After listening to where he was willing to send her, she made her request and stood very still. For several moments she stood there asn waited before any thing happened, she heard the incarntation and closed her eyes. There was a flash of light and a cold feeling washed over her, when she opwned her eyes again she was in the wayfare camp in butcherblock Mountains. All around her were other races that were searching for some kind of adventure. Feeling slightly reluctant to continue on her original course she turned away form the land of the elves. Sighing she headed toward the book that would allow her access to the plane of knowledge. Again she felt the cold tingle that washed though her and sensed the flash of light after the last word was spoken. There a feel to the air that let her know that she had arrived, uncertin of why she had come she called her companion to her side. <br>
<br>
&quot; Well?&quot;<br>
<br>
He gave her a soft woof and started off toward the main bank that was just over the hill. She followed him, not really knowing why but guessing that there was some reason for this. They entered the banks and Kallren walked up to the man who was behind the counter, she talked to him softly and put some of her gear in to his keeping. It felt good to loose some of the added weight that she had been carring with her. Turning around she was surprised to see that her companion disapearing through the open door. Sighing and shaking her head she walked out of the bank and looked around at all of the people there. She barily caught sight of him just before his tail disapeared behind a blue wall. She was starting to get flusterated at his game and was about to summon him back to her when she came around the corner and stopped dead. <br>
<br>
She was not sure if she should look disaponted or start laughing at the sight she saw. Her pet was standing on the chest of what looked to be a human warrior. Since she could not see his face because he was being licked  by the solid form of her pet, she tried not to laugh. Clearing her throat she summoned him back to her side and spoke to the man who was still laying on the ground. <br>
<br>
&quot; Hello there, I must appologies for my companion, its not oftin that he will leave my side to sniff out some one to pounce on.....&quot;<br>
<br>
Her words trailed off as she looked up to see who he had jumped on. Her eyes went wide with recognition, she knew him, he was Klinget and before she had been called to help the other they started becoming freinds. At a loss as to what to say she looked away, wondering why her pet had come to find him....... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=117.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=117.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Library<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Recruiting<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
