Much of my young life was spent frolicking (not froglicking..) amongst the bats and the bees of our forest of Greater Faydark.  However soon things became dark with evil, as the Orcs of Crushbone rose up from the bowels of some political party gone astray, and let out a mighty burp so rank that it withered half the forest!  Thus a call to arms was made and I joined the brave ranks of the tribes of Felwithe and Kelethin to fight this evil menace.  After many long and arduous seasons we prevailed. It was then on a misty summer eve that I felt the pull of the grand moon of Luclin pulling me, beckoning me.  Feeling the need to break free of the mundane life of Faydwer, I boldly traveled to Luclin.  Upon arriving I was immediately recruited in the fight against the pesky bandits of Paladul.  The seasons went very fast and soon the longing for Norrath became too intense to ignore.  It was at this time I traveled to the Lake of Ill Omen.  Ahh yes, those were the 'Salad Days' of many deaths and triumphs.  As soon as I found I could levitate myself to the top of the mill, I promptly moved on to lay the 'smack down' on those huge candy a** giants of the Frontier Mountains.  It was around this time that I started exploring more in detail the realm of Norrath.  I found the giants of Rathe Mountains to be rich with platinum and I quickly set up camp with an ex-guildy friend of mine.  We looted and plundered those giants until Broog himself had to spawn continuously in order to keep the balance!  On one journey, with nothing particular to do, my friend and I decided to do the dreaded camp of the Ancient in Southern Ro.  Well, the blessed Mithaniel Marr must have been looking favorably on me that day and within 10 minutes the Ancient appeared, ready for the slaughter!  Now I roam, I'm a drifter, a Ronin, meeting friends along the way and wasting uglies as I go.  Someday though I know I will join a new family for fun and adventure!  I hoped you enjoyed my memoires. -Klistan Terramare</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">ICQ - 165682146</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=231703" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
