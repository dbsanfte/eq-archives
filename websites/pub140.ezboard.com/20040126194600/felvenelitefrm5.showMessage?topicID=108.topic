Wandering around the city that is the plane of knowledge, his mind was going over recent events.<br>
While he hadn’t tried to make much of it, he was now of an officer rank within the Elven Elite, it seemed he’d earned a lot of trust with the leader of these elves, Seyah and had also gained some respect from others in the guild. How, was something he didn’t ponder to much, all he knew was he did what he was asked and served the interests of the elves where he could.<br>
Just as he’d been getting used to that, after only just starting to feel right in the elven guild at all something else had come along to cause him to stop and think.<br>
A human enchantress, Candra, had taken to asking him to join her and her other friends on adventures, quests, and simple exploration even. At first this had seemed just a case of preference to pick one of the Elven Elite to join her but slowly that perception had changed to Kenelan. He had heard a few things about this enchantress, which made him wary of her, particularly in the way she acted towards males.<br>
Now though, Kenelan felt comfortable with the skill of Candra when hunting, to go as far to say he trusted her abilities as much as his own. It had become more though, he was fairly certain Candra considered him “her warrior”, which he didn’t at first feel comfortable with as it sounded as though he was a possession but now in his mind she was the enchanter he’d turn to first.<br>
<br>
Kenelan, looked around where he had been wandering and noticed with a slight sigh that he’d been following a path towards a certain couple of big rocks in the city area that he knew Candra would spend time sitting upon when she wasn’t busy.<br>
He could see a figure there and after a moment he recognised the robe that they were wearing; it was Candra, sitting on ‘her rock’.<br>
Part of him was tempted to try and walk by, nearer the wall, to avoid attracting her attention. Engaging in conversation away from combats, particularly with someone as open to talk as Candra, had always bothered him a little, probably because he wasn’t used to there being much outside of combat for him.<br>
He didn’t get the chance though, as he began to move a little to the side, Candra looked directly at him, noticing him from a distance he was sure. Sighing again to himself he moved directly towards her, rather than try act as though he’d not noticed her.<br>
<br>
As he approached, Kenelan could see that Candra was smiling already. He stopped a few paces away to give a slight bow and a smile.<br>
<br>
“Good afternoon” he said, looking slightly upwards to where she sat.<br>
<br>
Candra gave a quick grin before leaning down a little, her robe already quite low cut, now offering more of a ‘view’, and replying,<br>
<br>
“Good afternoon, Kenelan” she said, “what brings you to see me?”<br>
<br>
Kenelan always got the feeling she was toying with him a little, though it’s effect on his normally quite cold nature was minimal at first, it was starting to become distracting.<br>
He stopped to try think of a reason to be here, instead finding himself looking deeply into her violet eyes, distracted.<br>
As another smile was beginning to form on Candra’s lips, Kenelan blinked and realised what he was doing. Now thinking about it, there had been something, a favour he’d wanted to ask since he’d come to trust Candra more.<br>
<br>
“I wish to ask a favour,” Kenelan said, looking to end the silence. His face took on a serious look.<br>
<br>
Candra gave a curious look for a moment and sat up again.<br>
<br>
“Oh? And what could I do to help you, Kenelan?” she asked, smiling brightly again.<br>
<br>
Slowly and carefully, Kenelan reached into a pouch on his belt, drawing out a ring. He held it up between his thumb and forefinger more clearly showing that it was a diamond encrusted band, not quite just a simple ring.<br>
<br>
“This, was my wedding ring,” he started. “From a marriage that now really does not exist”.<br>
<br>
“Such a small item, yet it feels so heavy to me” Kenelan continued “I need to be free of it, before I can begin to move along, before my mind allows me to forget.”<br>
<br>
Candra’s face took on that curious look again.<br>
<br>
“And...what is it I can do to help?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Kenelan slowly reached forward to take hold of one of Candra’s hands, grasping it for a second before letting go, leaving the ring he had held a moment ago behind.<br>
<br>
“Take it, do whatever you will with it but keep it from me, so I don’t any longer have to carry it” he replied after.<br>
<br>
Giving a sigh of relief, now in a small way glad to be free of it, knowing he couldn’t have thrown it away or destroyed it himself.<br>
Kenelan turned and began to walk away. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=323428" target="_new">Kenelan</a>
