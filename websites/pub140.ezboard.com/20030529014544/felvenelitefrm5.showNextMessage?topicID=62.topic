Those approaching to offer company are chased away with various snorts and thrown objects.  What is causing the small fighter's condition isn't apparent to the other members of the Elite, however, they know when to leave a Dwarf to stew in his own troubles.  From the hearth where they watched over Blahg, a whispered conversation soon began.<br>
<br>
A good friend of the Dwarf's, Elrax worries.  &quot;I don't believe that he has slept a wink since our journey to slay the minions of Innoruk.  I do not know why, but he seems to dread rest since that day.  Perhaps he is ill, infected by some foul curse from that land of hatred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eliani, also sitting near, whispers: &quot;I sat near him during our siege.  He seemed driven by some force, filled with even more energy than normal.  He tore into our enemies in an absolute fury.  I am not sure that he is well.  Fayeth has been trying to find what is wrong, but even her healing powers have not been able to discern what is troubling him so.&quot;<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Blahg remembers back to the day he earned his Lana'Ch'Graokh.  He was but a young boy, being raised by a traditional Dwarven family on the farmland owned by his family for 173 generations.  His father worked the fields, his mother and sister baked and gardened, and Blahg helped out wherever he could.  Throughout the years, Blahg's father had pushed him to pursue knowledge and education wherever possible.  The mock swordplay of the other children had no place in Blahg's life, only the books and scrolls held in the Kaladim libraries and brought by caravan's of traders from the Libaries in Erudin, home of the Erudite Scholars.  <br>
<br>
Over the years, Blahg began to learn of magic, which generally had little place in Kaladim.  Oh yes, there were the mighty Clerics of the Underfoot, however Blahg was amazed to find that there was magic in the world which was NOT granted by one diety or another.  Magic which came from deep within Norrath, and was there for the taking if you were wise enough to unleash it.  One particular traveler spoke with Blahg for many hours about an old man living high among the rocks near the Cauldron of Dagnor whose knowledge of magic surpassed that of anyone he had ever met.  Little did Blahg know, but his sister, Rashukch also hearing these words, set out to find the hermit that very night.  While Blahg pondered how to go about approaching this magician, Rashukch, having always hated the role of a housetender which she was born into, traveled through the many passes of the Butcherblock mountains, all the while under the cover of lies to her family of travelling to Kaladim to purchase baking supplies and visit a friend.  <br>
<br>
Eventually, Rashukch found the magician's small hut, and befriended the small old man.  At first she was a bit frightened of him.  His race was impossible to tell, as age had not been kind to him.  His shrivelled body was little more than a thin layer of skin over all too visible bones.  He seemed kind enough, and introduced himself as Kanalar, telling her stories of growing up near Freeport.  When asked if she could stay with him for a while, and learn more about him, he seemed more than happy to have someone around to listen to his many stories.  Kanalar loved listening to his stories, however, nothing about the man seemed very magical.  He would go down to the lake in the morning to catch fish for meals, and would occasionally ask her to take his bow and shoot a game bird or rabbit.  Finally, the end days she had intended to spend with him grew near, and she told him that she would soon be leaving.<br>
<br>
Throughout the last few days, Kanalar seemed weaker and weaker, relying heavily upon an ancient looking gnarled staff when walking, and spending more and more time each day in his bed.  On the day she intended to leave, Rashukch found that she could not leave this poor man by himself, and agreed to spend few more days.  Upon hearing this, Kanalar told her that one of such kindness would do just fine.  Confused, she turned to face him where he lie in his bed, only to hear an strange sound and find the bed empty.  An odd breeze startled her, and she turned around to face Kanalar, dressed quite differently in a jet black robe with blood red accents.  The odd breeze continued to slip around her, becoming visible as a light mist.  Finding that she could not move, Rashukch panicked, but there was nothing that she could do.  The mist crept into her mouth and nose, gagging her, but she could not react even to cough.  The misery grew worse and worse, until Rashukch faded from this world, with hopes of finding peace in the arms of the one, true father, Brell Serilis.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
When the days turned into weeks, and finally into more than a month, and Rashukch had still not returned, Blahg's father, Teneris, asked him to go to Kaladim in search of her, and to return home with her.  Upon reaching the city, Blahg searched for days, without finding even a clue to prove she had ever set foot in the city gates.  Eventually, a terrible though occurred to him.  In the inn, while talking a traveling merchant about a supposed hermit magician living not far away, Blahg remembered hearing a familiar voice at the table behind him.  Realizing that Rashukch, always a free spirit and in search of adventure, had also heard the tale, Blahg knew where she must have really went.  Running from the gates of Kaladim, he found a merchant who would be travelling close to the Cauldron of Dagnor, and asked if he might ride along that far.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the rim of the Cauldron, Blahg found one of his family's mules tied to a tree, and knew his worst fears were true.  Rashukch had come here, and by now had probably found this hermit.  Hoping that all was well, but dreading what might have happened, Blahg ran quickly, following the general directions given to him over a month ago.  Finally finding a small hut on a rocky shelf, Blahg approached it, not knowing what to expect, realizing he hadn't even though to arm himself with anything more than a small blade he had been studying in the libraries of Kaladim before his terrible thought occurred to him.  Legend had said that this blade had been enchanted with power by Brell himself, thousands of years ago, before the Great Goblin Wars.  It didn't appear to be much, and most thought of it as merely legend, the real blade having never existed, or lost long ago.<br>
<br>
Blahg was about to knock on the door, when he heard a strange gasping noise behind him.  Turning, he saw a frightful creature lurching towards him from a small patch of brush.  This was no creature he had ever seen, nor even heard of before.  Strange gray skin hung in shreds from it's body, half of it's face missing with jagged shards of bone jutting from the resulting crater.  As the creature grew nearer, Blahg found that the most frightening thing about it was not it's appearence, or wretched smell.  It was a small necklace still dangling from it's neck.  On the chain was the pendant Blahg had made for his sister while learning the basics of forgind precious metals.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Seeing the look on the small dwarves face, and knowing well that he had recognized his pet for what it truly was, or at least had been, Kanalar stepped from the shadows.   &quot;Welcome young Dwarf.  I apologize, but I was not expecting you this soon, or I would have had a more proper welcoming party waiting for you.  Alas, you shall have to settle for nothing but your poor sister here.  She really was an amazing girl, and you can die knowing that she gave me great strength.   Perhaps more than I shall receive from you.&quot;<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
As the words of the strange man in robes faded, so did their speaker.  Blahg was left standing on the rocks with some...   thing...  which was once his dear sister.  The creature roared and launched itself, proving that it posessed much more than it had previously exposed.  The pitiful way it had dragged its ruined body out of the brush was but a show, as it now seemed to be a writhing mass of power.  The spongy dead hands it had held gently at its sides now proved to be fitted with long, glinting claws.  The first charge of the creature knocked Blahg head over heels off of the small outcropping and down onto a lower ledge.  More shaken than hurt, the tiny dwarf pulled himself off, and remembered the blade hanging from his belt.  As he bared it, his once-sister dropped from onto the ledge, seemingly even larger than before.  Seeing the blade, the creature hissed, holding it's distance, but began performing a strange ritual.  Suddenly, a wave of power washed over Blahg, stunning him momentarily as his breath caught in his throat.  As quickly as the wave hit him, so did the creature.  Blahg felt an agonizing wave of pain as a clawed paw tore at his face.  His vision skewed to the right as his left eye glimpsed its last vision.  Rashukch tumbled over him, her momentum carrying her nearly off the ledge.  As she spun at him again, Blahg swung wildly with the blade, which he had somehow held onto.  Amazingly, he felt the small sword contact something, and was jolted to his feet as a mighty force poured into him , seemingly from the very hilt in his hand.  The blade glowed orange in the fading sunlight, and a roaring explosion tore Rashukch from on top him, carrying her off a ledge to the rocky shore far below.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Blahg's father was working in the fields when his son came limping up the road, guiding a tired mule.  Teneris was overjoyed to see his son, knowing that his return meant he had found their precious Rashukch, and ran to him.  He stopped after only a few steps, however, when he saw the blood trickling from beneath various bandages covering his son, and the odd mask covering part of Blahg's face.  As the covered cart being pulled behind the mule rolled into view, Teneris fell to his knees, knowing that something horrible had happened to his dear daughter.  When Blahg finally drew near, Teneris could not speak, for fear of showing the weakness of a tear.  Once Blahg had told him what happened, the  fear seemed easy overcome as tears washed the dust from his weathered face.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
Dwarven lore states the existance of a special type of soldier.  A soldier who can do more than weild a flashy sword or axe.  This special warrior is known as a Kuhn'Tcha Moreia.  The Kuhn'Tcha Moreia were able to weild the most powerful of all weapons - those which are imbued with the power of the very gods which shape all that is.  The Moreia once made up the King's Guard, and held high ranks in the armies of Kaladim.  Now, though, the Moreia have become all but extinct, a mere footnote in the passage of Dwaven history.  <br>
<br>
Lore speaks also of a rebirth, so to speak, of the Moreia.  This rebirth would begin with a single Moreia being found.  One who would become more powerful than any other Moreia before him.  The mighty clerics of Kaladim had been waiting for this day for thousands of years, and had prepared a special Lana'Ch'Graokh (The mark of the Moreia - The original Lana'Ch'Graokh was but a mere piece of linen, bathed in the blood of the first victim of the discovered Moreia and laid with heavy enchantments into the hair or beard of the new inductee.  The Lana'Ch'Graokh was said to protect the Kuhn'Tcha Moreia in battle, and to give them the strength of a dozen dwarves.)  This new Lana'Ch'Graokh was not mere linen.  Legend told that the sacred metals of the three lands must be forged into thread, and weaved with the blood red hair of a the first King of Kaladim himself, to create a special Lana'Ch'Graokh. This symbol of Brell's fury is to be given to the first of the new Moreia.<br>
<br>
Blahg received this Lana'Ch'Graokh during his 19th summer.  The enchantment process which fused the mark and the Moreia has always been noted as being painless.  Blahg's inductment, however was different.  His screams were heard for miles.  <br>
<br>
Days after the ceremony, he still writhed in pain, and the most wise of the high priests were no longer able to sustain his life.  The clerics hung their heads as their new champion's body went still.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
<br>
The last thing Blahg remembered upon waking was the Lana'Ch'Graokh being woven into his beard, and a jolt of pain when the high priest began the first of the many necessary enchantments.  As he awoke in a dark tunnel, a pair of glowing eyes blinked at him from the dark.  Once Blahg's eyes adjusted to the light, he pulled himself up, and turned to face the eyes of Brell Serilis.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry that such pain was necessary, but even through the Lana'Ch'Graokh, I cannot adequately communicate to you what you will become.  As the first of my new children, your existance will not be an easy one.  Dark things are afoot in the three lands.  Dark things which will eventually lead to the downfall of the Elves themselves, and eventually, my own children.<br>
<br>
I must bring you here to tell you of your future, so that you will understand what you must do when the time comes.  From this day on, you will no longer have peaceful dreams.  When you rest, you will be assaulted by dreams of the future.  These dreams will no doubt be filled with horrifying visions of death, but fear not.  You, and the new Moreia, have the power to change this future.  I have granted you the power to battle these foul evils, in hope that you can preserve the delicate balance which is life as we know it.  I charge you to seek out the true champions of the Elves, and to help protect them.  Tunare herself is in great danger.  The only way to prevent this evil from achieving domination is to band together, not as Dwarves and Elves, but as Good.   You must stop their wicked plans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blahg feared this more than anything.  &quot;Forgive me, my Lord.  I know nothing of battle.  All of my life I have strived to gather knowledge, so that I might learn more of the ways of the world.  I wield a quill much more steadily than any blade or bow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear not, Blahg.  You may find that you know much more than you think.  Being a Moreia grants you more than my strength and protection.  The memories of the thousands of Moreia before you are yours.  You might find yourself in posession of many amazing talents which you have never known before, a very capable fighter, one who can weild any weapon with speed and grace in any of the many fighting styles of the ancient Moreia.<br>
<br>
Farewell, Moreia.  May you serve the Light well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blahg's woke again, this time lying on the ceremonial table where the Lana'Ch'Graokh was made one with him.  The room was empty, the torches made low.  He could here the prayers of the Paladins and Clerics of Kaladim echoing through the quiet halls.  Footsteps approached, and a priest of Brell dashed into the room.  <br>
&quot;Moreia, I could feel that you were here.  You have returned to us.  I shall gather the others!&quot;<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Several weeks later, Blahg removed the eyepatch which he had worn to hide his dead eye from the world, and set off for the High Elven Castle in Felwithe, determined to find and join forces with their champions.  A dream of a terrible realm of hatred, ruled over by the wicked hand of Innoruk himself had haunted him for days.  These Elven Elite were his only hope of laying siege to this realm of evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
The dream of slaughtering the minions of Innoruk had been fulfilled.  As Blahg sat in the dark, his friends quietly worrying from a distance, he feared what would be next.  Having not slept for days, his weariness finally overcame him, and he drifted to sleep, and his dreams began anew. <p><html>
