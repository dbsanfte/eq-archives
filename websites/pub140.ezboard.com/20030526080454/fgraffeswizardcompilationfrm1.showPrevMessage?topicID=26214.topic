If you don't care, don't read. :P<br>
<br>
So, there I was, kiting wyverns in CS, had dinged 49 the night before and had built up a decent buffer. I get a tell from a guy asking if I want to join a Naggy raid. I thought about it, and said what the hell. I'm not in a raiding guild, and have never been on a raid.<br>
<br>
I port over to Nektulos and run to the druid ring in Lavastorm where they're meeting to assign groups and such. We get our groups assigned, gather the few remaining necessities (it was a pickup raid) and head in.<br>
<br>
Most of the giants had already been cleared, so we slaughtered a few kobolds, bats, and LDC's on the way in. We get to the &quot;prep&quot; room, and pull a couple of FG warriors and Magus Rokyll. Fight went really simply. I had a couple of resists on Rokyll, but my group still managed to do enough damage to him and the FG's to get xp. (Most of the people there were Non-PoP so we weren't using the raid system.) We lost one ranger on that fight, so we rezzed him and then prepared for Naggy. <br>
<br>
Due to some miscommunication problems and only having one Shaman, the buffing process was rather slow and tedious. By the time they finished junk buffing everyone, some peoples junk buffs were wearing off so they had to redo them. Then the raid leader went LD on us. So by the time he came back, most of the junk buffs were wearing off so we had to repeat that whole process.<br>
<br>
So finally, we charge Naggy. We basically had a three group charge. The first group went in and the proverbial shit hit the proverbial fan. I still don't know what happened, but someone failed to heal the MA. He died in about the first six seconds of the fight. The raid leader said for everyone to charge, so in we went. The last two groups charged in and all the meatshields and such engaged Naggy. MOST of the caster group stayed outside the door to avoid debuffs and the AoE, but a couple ran inside so we lost them quickly too. When Naggy dropped to about 55%, we went in and started nuking. I had basically 8 junk buffs. I resisted the first AE, and he stripped my first four buffs. My first ice comet landed for full damage, yay me! Then he stripped my second four buffs, and he resisted my second IC. I thought it would be a good idea to recast some buffs, so I backed into the hallway, buffed up, and stepped back in and cast Ice Comet. But, I forgot to change targets. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So, I Ice Cometed myself for 980 damage and took a trip to bind.<br>
<br>
We failed to take Naggy down, but it was fun as hell for me. Even with the embarrasing accidental suicide (which I told nobody in the raid about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) The CR took three hours because two monks and one rogue left, leaving us one rogue and one monk to do all the corpse dragging. The poor monk died about eight more times during the CR process. But, we got everyone rezzed and I TL'ed people out that wanted to leave, etc. Due to the long CR, we didn't try him again, but I look forward to getting my revenge.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share. It really re-interested me in the game. Quadding was getting really booring, but now I have something to look forward to. I can't wait to get in on some of the cooler raids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
That is sad, my alt is a monk, I've been on 4 naggy raids.  I ran one that was successful, been on 2 PU raids that were not, and the 4th I just happened to be in SolB anyhow, and CRed a failed raid.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no reason to die CRing Naggy's room without a lot of really bad luck.<br>
<br>
Just run in, and FD.  Wait for FD to refresh, stand and run 2 steps, FD again, do this and you can literally FD'd under naggy, which I've done to get to the corpses that are behind him.<br>
<br>
Then you can summon all the corpses individually, the only problem is the 1-2 lame people that forgot to consent that you have to beg for it, and the 1-2 guys that went LD, left since the wipe.<br>
<br>
Once you have a pile on you, repeat backwards, stand move 2 steps, FD, make a new pile on you...<br>
<br>
I know, that is just way off on a tangent, just hate to hear of a monk dying so much. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Great job on your first raid, GL on any future attempts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  That mask that drops off the Magus is pretty darn decent for a wizard too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Edit:  Maybe someone else was agroing naggy... that could explain the first death... but not 8, as he should have told everyone else to get out of the room completely. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=delfontes>Delfontes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.hartskeep.com/Shawn/deceit.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 4/22/03 9:50:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tsurok@graffeswizardcompilation>Tsurok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 10:36:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26210.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My First Naggy Raid!</span><hr size=1> After your first Naggy/Vox raid for the experience, I'd recommend not going on future pick-up raid unless the leader has secured a clicky stick and a few multi-group buffers.  Otherwise, buffing will take forever and, as a wizard, you'll take too much xp loss due to bind rushing.  I've seen a few higher levels on Bertoxx essentially sponsor a raid with MGBuffers. The buffers then get to roll on loot with the rest of the raid, if they wish, which seems fair to me,.<br>
<br>
IMO, since Vox and Naggy tend to be pick-up raids nowadays, I think they should scale back the dispell feature of their AE breath because no one 52 and under has MGB capability.  This means, for the level range these two dragons are intended, buffing is a royal PITA even for competent guilds, much less a pick up raid where it seems no one listens.  You shouldn't need MGB's for pick-up raids to be successful anymore for Naggy/Vox.  I'm sure others disagree.<br>

<br>
PS-  I'm sure its was mentioned to you, but make sure you are under the Dragon when casting as you have to be in melee range for dd to hit.  IMO, being under the dragon isn't any better than anywhere else within melee range, but the dragons have a tendency to move/change targets during a fight (especially Naggy), so being underneath when you start  casting makes it more likely that you will remain in melee range when the spell finishes.  <br>
<br>
However, since DoF casts so quickly, I can just stand to the side of Vox and have never had any trouble landing spells. <br>

Raids really are nifty. Pick-up raids can be a great amount of fun. I did a bunch of E'ci public Fear raids, and almost always had a great time, even if the raid wasn't going well. As wizards, we can actually get a better idea of what the raid as a whole is doing than most, since we don't have to be right in the thick of things and can move the camera around between nukes.<br>

<br>
This is soooo true... I sometimes join the naggy raid channel just to watch them talk cause sometimes its sooooo pathetic and funny, one time 90% of the raid died before they got to the ledge lol since they went the wrong way<br>
<br>
I've been on 3 naggy raids and only one was successful and I got kill shot! however didn't win any loot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The other two not soo successful ones were pretty bad...<br>
Just curious, you said you ran out and rebuffed?(wouldn't suggest this in the future though)<br>
when you went back in where people still fighting him actually? Join another naggy raid though, it was pretty exciting the first time i saw him go down!! Glad you had fun though, I would love to try it from a melees point and be in one of the charge groups, as compared to the 2 or 3 casters waiting in the hall with you. great fun though!<br>

Unfortunately pickup raids are my only options for Naggy and Vox right now, but according to a friend in a higher end guild, the guy that was running the raid knows his stuff and runs good raids. <p><center>

<br>
The one I organised for instance, my guild was more than happy to help with, a high level guild group cleared to Naggy before the start time of the raid.<br>
<br>
Then a mage passed out plus to FR/MR back items for everyone, we put on some long lasting junk buffs, and MGB ageoed the raid, hehe.<br>
<br>
That does help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Also that mage is a freak, level 65 guy that really wanted in on it, so he had the lvl 65 Cleric casting heal over time spells that could heal faster than naggy can damage....<br>
<br>
Naggy would immediately banish the cleric, the mage would CoH, hehe.  Fugger got 4 heals off during the fight... quite possibly turning the tide of the raid, because while that heal was going naggy really couldn't kill the guy it was on.<br>
<br>
It was for fun, I didn't get any loot myself, and I didn't allow anyone over lvl 52 to be in on the rolls, they were just there for support, and had a great time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zorlandar>Zorlandar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 5:01:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26210.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My First Naggy Raid!</span><hr size=1> I have done 3 Guild and 3 pickup raids on him so far.<br>
<br>
I had much more fun on the pickup raids as they posed more of a problem.<br>
<br>
The reason I did not enjoy the Guild raids is because my guild was way too powerful to be raiding this mob.  We had so many high levels there that they felt it was their responsibility to make sure us lowbies did not die and did all the work besides killing Naggy himself.  With all the high level buffs and insta rezes sitting around it was no challenge.  That made the raids no fun, I learned nothing from them except that level 65's can solo much of the stuff that a level 52 is scared of.<br>
<br>
The pickup raids on the other hand were tons of fun.  Only one had a toon that was too high for Naggy and she was only there for rezes.  One was a complete wipe out but the corpse run was as much fun as killing Naggy is anyway.<br>
<br>
So my preference is a raid that is challenging, too many handouts and free rides really spoil the fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 519<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/03 12:12:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26210.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My First Naggy Raid!</span><hr size=1> The ironic part about Everquest is it's usually not that the encounters are difficult, it's gathering up enough people who can actually find their ass with their own hands that poses the real challenge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26210.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26210.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26210.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26210.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26210.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26210.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26210.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
