Anyway, apologies for the confusion after re-reading what I wrote, I realize my choice of words was bad there.<br>
<br>
I agree with you in a lot of respects.  However, post 60 I have found that mana regeneration has been much less of an issue for me.  I can sit all day long in a HoH group and never run out of mana, even after one pull after another.  Some FT items, MC helped with this.<br>
<br>
Basically, what do you think it would take to make you more attractive for grouping?  I would love to see Verant address this very issue for Wizards.  I am not sure if spell changes (although this is probably the most likely answer) or something else is the resolution.<br>

Everyone knows how much damage a Mage does with thier pet, becuase that damage can be seen with the normal melee damage. Their damage shields also are atributed to them indirectly. Melees say I love mages damage shields, cause very time I get hit, I do X amount of damage. <br>
<br>
[side bar] Why is it that melees think that a damage shield cast on them is damage THEY are doing? <br>
<br>
The only time people know when a wizard has done damage with crits. Then it's jaw dropping, OMG. If you sit out a round, then it's comments of &quot;this mob is much harder&quot; which always makes me laugh. <br>
<br>
I encourage all wizards and mages to send feedback to Sony saying we want all our Damage to show up, just like does for melees. They don't even have to add a second line, it can be added to the line that shows when it says &quot;A Moss snakes skin is ripped by shards of ice and wind for 1120 non melee damage)<br>
<br>
If people can SEE what we are doing, they will change thier minds about how good a wizard is.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, I have a good group of friends, and always have someone to play with. In my group is another wizard. We like to tag team ice comet and other spells. I have a hotkey set up that sends him a tell pauses for 4 seconds, then casts ice comet. Often they hit at the same time. When you do 45% of a mobs Hitpoints in the blink of an eye, people notice. <br>
<br>
Next time your playing, take a few moment to do the /feedback command, and say you want your spell damage to show up all the time, not just crits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=necridious>Necridious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/28/03 8:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> Well, I can see with KEI, AA familier, AA Mental Clarity 3, AA Harvest, you would have few problems with mana.  Add a Bard and/or Beastlord and your in clover.<br>
<br>
However, lots of wizards are not nearly that level, and other classes don't have those advantages.  The need for very fast mana refill effect is still there, especially considering all a melee has to do is find one of 3 healing classes to refill their HP bar nearly instantly, and they can get AA first aid, and AA regen to help when they are experiancing downtime on their own--not great, but it's there.<br>
<br>
What Is needed to make wizards, or any caster class, wanted in groups is group utility spells. Priests Heal and buff, Chanters have Slow/haste, Clarity, and Mez.  Mages hurt nearly as bad as we do, and Necromancers are Grouping lepers till they get the group taps, and even then aren't real desired, it's about average then.<br>
<br>
For Wizards, I'd suggest DPS enhancing spells like Reverse a Reverse Damage sheild.  I'd also suggest a mana regen spell that refills a mana bar in 30-45 seconds, but ends if the recipient stands up or is aggroed.  Even if that effect is not given to wizards, it should go to someone other than enchanters as they are the only real source of mana other than a bard currently, and all core grouping roles should be redundant in at least 3 classes due to the number of classes vs. the number of group slots. <p><br>

Allowing everyone to see your spell damage would likely have people just filter it off after 5 minutes.  Bane spells are a cool idea.  I don't think it really adds to the groupability of a wizard.  But it's a cool idea.  I think a number of the spells suggested so far offer more groupablity really.<br>
<br>
Utter Concentration-- Buff that locks the recipient in place, and causes all spells to be un-interuptible for the duration.<br>
<br>
Know Allies-- Spell that gives a list of the targets positive factions. A second spell in this line might provide all negative faction hits provided by the mob. Usefull for knowing before you kill a mob what hits you will take. A third variety might provide all mobs or factions the target will assist in battle<br>
<br>
Temporal Stasis-- Freezes a target in time for 30 seconds, making it unable to move, attack, and makes it invunerable for the duration. (suggest make the refresh 25 sec or so that a wizard can only maintain one mob frozen in time)<br>
<br>
Portal Lock-- The target of this spell will find any attempts to cast gate/port spells collapse.<br>
<br>
Lava Walk-- Allows the target to walk upon lava as if it were solid ground<br>
<br>
These are the kind of original spells that will help wizards be more groupable.  I also think wizards should get a spell that sends target to bind point.  Why this ability was given to bards and not wizards is beyond me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/28/03 9:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> If we did get some better mana spells, I would seriously want them to be self only. One easy idea is drop the Harverst spell line down in levels and add another one. Make it a Harvest over Time spell. Somewhere inbetween harverst and Clarity. It doesn't increase mana all at once like Harvest does, but spreads it out over several ticks. Maybe like 20 mana each tick, for a total of 500 mana. Same cast and recast as a normal harvest. Only your not stunned, you can move about as normal and cast. You also can't cast other Harvest spells while it is working. If you try, you get the, This spell would not take hold on you, and you have to wait to recast it.<br>
<br>
As a wizard, i'm not interested in becoming a buffing class. A few handy new debuffs would be good. The surpress damage debuff for casting mobs (real casting not just mobs that have spell like natural attacks) is good, it's on par with slows, since that lowers the amount of melee damage done to tanks.<br>

Other than boss fights anyway, some of those ae's a brutal I hear.<br>
<br>
<br>
But why on gods earth would you want another self only spell?  They are why Necromancers are shunned so badly in groups, they have a ton of really cool buff lines--many of which stop at level 20 for some stupid reason, but they are self only which means that those in the group that would benefit from them don't get them.  Some say this is due to the pet, but it could simply be made so that it don't land on pets, and they did after all give the damage sheilds to the mages--and some have noticed they get pets too.<br>
<br>
What I'm speaking of is a varient on Harvest that ends if anything happens to the recipient.  I don't want 20 a tick, 30 a tick, or 50 a tick--except for a &lt;30 version, I'm thinking 150 or 200 a tick at least.  Something that will fill a spell bar in around 30 seconds.  And if was not self only, wizards would be wanted in xp grinds.  Probably a useless idea, they'd just make the spell 60 or higher, when mana is coming out the ears, and it's not needed anymore.<br>
<br>
Your idea of it does not address the core reason for even wanting the spell, which is excessive downtime due to mana regen.  Anytime you need to wait for mana longer than about 3 min--not at all uncommon even with KEI-- then it's excessive, considering you blew through it in well under 3 min of fighting.  Games are meant to be played, not started on your maching while you write your term paper's first draft on the side.<br>

I see how enchanters are treated. <br>
<br>
However, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>group</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> harvest would be fine, only I could easily see Sony making everyone that benifits from it get stunned.  <br>
<br>
For me, it seems a spell that gives us 50% -100% of our mana back in 30-40 seconds seems to unbalance things. Even though I'm a wizard, and I fully support better wizards, this would make wizards non stop nuking machines, which really doesn't seem fair to any other class that uses nukes or dots or whatever. <br>
<br>
A group harvest would be a boon to all casters, clerics to. If it gives back, say 300 or 400 mana, that's enough for a nuke from you or heals from a cleric. <br>
<br>
The harvest over time would be to shorten you down time, not remove down time. So yes, my idea does address the down time issue with wizards. Removing any down time for a wizard, even after level 60 id unbalancing. Yes, enchanters can steal mana from mobs that have it. Yes mages can cast and reclaim more mana with pets (they still have to take the time to do it). Personally, that is the spell that needs to be nerfed, if simply for the fact that the idea of getting more mana back then it cost to creat something just seems wrong. <br>
<br>
Hell, even if you cast it after the first nuke, it would still be helpful. 20 or 30 mana a tick, at say level 60, with a horse, and flowing thought would really fill up the mana quick. Since I believe 15 is the best you can get with flowing thought, I could be mistaken.<br>
<br>
As for stuff that would make a wizard more group friendly? Well, how about a group form of O'kiels Radiation? Which is stackable with other DS. On top of that, it gives FR. They should also extend the O'Kiels into a cold based and magic based lines, which are not stackable with each other. <br>
<br>
Or how about a familiar that acts as a group buff? Say the level 60 familar gives anyone grouped with the wizard, see invis, increase all resists by 10, and gives them a 2 mana regen per tick. <br>
<br>
Yes, traditionally, wizards are a selfish class when it comes to sharing benifical magic. We've focused more on offensive and destructive magic rather then helpful magic. So offering more buffs to other people seems out of line, but extending sefl buffs into group buffs would be in line I feel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lornick65>Lornick65</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/29/03 10:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> I think the focus needs to be kept not on what you can do that will help the other players, but on what only you can do to npc's that will benefit the group.

<br>
My version of Harvest would not make a wizard a non-stop nuking machine.  You would still have aggro for one, and on big fights or one with adds, you would still run out.<br>
<br>
Making a full group spell would be fine if it had no stun or something to it, since it would hit tanks and stuff too, and they would hate it.  If it's my version it's fine, it just goes away when they move, and they don't care as they dont need it.<br>

While I'm sure many will agree with your feeling here, in keeping with a wizards offensive nature, it's just not true.  There are classes in the game right now that can do little for a group and a great deal to a mob.  Necromancers, Wizards, Mages, Rogues...  All of these have a hard time finding groups, with the grouping edge till PoP going to Rogue, and starting to drift back that way too--due to mana constraints and the fact that rogues don't need it.  <br>
<br>
If you have nothing to offer the group, then your going to be the second thing anyone wants, Period.  This has been shown over and over again in the games history.  Of the pure casters, the only one wanted in groups is Enchanter, precisely because they can Haste and Clarity.  It does not hurt that they can Slow either, especially in PoP--they have all the utility, and fair nuking power too, though they rarely use it.  Clerics have the best heals, and untill PoP ruled the healing world, Now Shamans are pushing them aside with their slows, and Druids are left in the breeze except as backup, or charm in the few places it works.  What you can do for the group is indeed what causes group desireability and it's a major shortcoming of the game that all the utility was given to a very few classes. <p><br>

There is much you can do that isn't nuking, and can help the group, and I'm not talking buffs. <br>
<br>
First, when ever I am grouped with an enchanter, and we get adds, instead of nuking the mob the tank is on, I root and snare the mobs after the enchanter has mezzed them. Generally, what happens is he uses an AE mezz, and i use an AE snare. Then he goes back and uses single mezzes on them, and I root them. This way, should any wake up, they will be rooted, and if the root breaks, they will be snared anyway. This saves the enchanter from having to mezz and root and increase his aggro, making it harder for the tank to get aggro off him when he has to break the mezz. <br>
<br>
By the time this done, the tank has done about one bubble of damage and has lots of aggro. I then start my attacks, standing very close to the tank, in case I get aggro by accident. That way he doesn't have to run around trying to find the mob.<br>
<br>
I always have at least one stun loaded. And I've used it to save lives. There have been fights where we didn't have our enchanter with us, and the tank took lots of damage. I would see the complete heal message, and I would hit the mob with a stun, buying the cleric about 4-6 seconds to get his heal off. It also works when the cleric is getting attacked. I will switch targets, stun the mob, and then root it. <br>
<br>
And of course, our stun spells and force strike spells are great for stoping casting and healing mobs. Generally speaking, outside of boss mobs, those that do cast and heal don't have the hit points of melee mobs. So I switch rolls and focus more on stopping it from casting and healing. By the time it trying to heal, the aggro is fully on the tank, and I'm not worried that my stun is gonna get me killed. Stun, Nuke, dead. <br>
<br>
Two wizards in a group, with two stuns up each, can keep a mob standing there for a long time doing nothing. I normally group with another wizard, and we have a whole system worked out. <br>
<br>
There is much that a wizard can do for a group. Even if the group doesn't realize what they are doing, besides burning down a mob.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=necridious>Necridious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 6:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> I know that, and you know that.  There is something to be said for root and snare, and using stuns.<br>
<br>
Problems with their groupablilty:<br>
<br>
1. Root-everyone and their mother EXCEPT mages can do this.<br>
2. Snare- Of all that have it, ours is the worst, except Necro's is a DoT.<br>
3. Stun- while among my favorite spells, gets major, huge, unstoppable aggro if used more than once or twice.  I have done groups in PoN with my guild, where the cleric and I did chain stuns while the melee beat 'it' to death... worked fine but gives tanks the heebiejeebies just thinking about it.  Takes a bit more space than a standard group too, as you spread out a bit and keep it snared in case you get stun resists.<br>
<br>
But, I guess wizards are indeed super desired in groups since we can and do use all those tools you described on a daily basis, right?<br>

Nothing you said changes or refutes a single thing I said in my last post.  I agree, many wizards don't want a buff, but untill we do get some kind of group friendly utility that helps the group, we will remain as we are, unless we suddenly do 2x the damage anyone else is doing. <p><br>

Anyone that has their melee damage on doesn't care much about the spam, and when they see their hits, and then they see that 1.2k or higher hitting consistantly from us, then we will see people looking at us more outside the zone of crits, and that's a good thing.  Even if they only saw the draught lines from the 50's, they'd see the numbers and their minds would be registering that we did that.  This is the best idea for a solution imho.<br>
<br>
I have heard some good ideas for spells, but I have to agree with the people that say that we need to have more group desirability without making us solo any better.<br>
<br>
For this reason, I have to stand behind the weapon buff ideas.  A little different than a proc in that it doesn't make a check to work, but it does much less damage per hit.  Even 5 to 10 damage per hit on every melee in the group would be noticable in most situations, and pretty much everytime that's less than would be done by the damage shields that mages excel so well at.<br>
<br>
Making O'Kiels stackable would not do much, unless it was the new one.  I wouldn't mind being able to cast it on others, or have two other series similar to O'Kiels that covered cold and magic (maybe the cold one giving EB instead of lev or something, for example), the result would be a little more utility with interesting, multi-result spells.  I think single target versions should be added before an all out group version, but that's just in keeping with the concept of mastering a spell before getting a better version of it.  I really like this idea, since O'Kiels is finally somewhat useful, and this would open us up just a little, which in my opinion is all we really need.<br>
<br>
Damage debuffs are not a bad idea either.  They would help with those mobs that do cast, and therefore at least give us some areas where we are more group desirable, even though most damage is melee.<br>

That goes against what they had in mind for wizards. <br>
<br>
It's not so much that wizards don't offer anything to a group, it's that people that have no understanding of wizards or have never played one to high up can't see what a wizard offers. Mezzes and hastes and slows and heals are all directly tangiable to most people in a group. <br>
<br>
Wizards damage isn't dirctly noticable. But wizards can shorten any fight considerablly. And if someone can't see that, then the problem lies on thier end. Anyone I've grouped with over and over again soon realize this, once I'm not with them. Wizards = more damage = mobs dead faster = less healing from cleric = less down time for cleric = more playing. That is a long equations and many people won't aggree with it. Someone will say, but after taking down one mob, I'm OOM. Well, at level 51, I have 2800 mana. That's 13 Daughts of Fire, which is 8944 damage, which doesn't count the effect from my improved damage 3 item, which could be a potential 1700 more damage. <br>
<br>
On our end, there is mana management. As in, judge which mobs might be a good one to sit out and say, Medding through. If the rest of the group can handle one mob, then medding through one mob out of 5 is agreat way to not slow down the group. <br>
<br>
I would really like to see wizards get some upgrades, with all the upgrades other classes are getting. Some of our spells lines are useless, outdated or made obsolet with PoP. But we are group friendly, we do have something to offer groups, damage, it's what a wizard is about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dalrenfieryblade>Dalren Fieryblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/31/03 4:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mages and Necromancers have to be nerfed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

At least my wifes wizard damage was showing to my mage.  So this is a step in the right direction.  I never understood why it was too much spam to show casting damage, but not to show Melee damage.  Wizard casts perhaps 4 times a fight, melee swings about 100...  Also, you can still filter spell spam out, and leave the damage because it's being sent as the Non-melee message, not part of the spell message.<br>
<br>
Pure DPS based on mana is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>NOT</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> group friendly unless it's a huge margin above what others contribute.  In the case of showing damage, this may actually work against wizards in the 50s as you will see Wizards hitting for 600-700ish, and mages hitting over 800 all the time, plus they have their pet and damage sheilds.  We can hit for 1200, but Ice Comet is not nearly as mana efficient as a draught, and we do all know it.  For most grouping, mana efficency is the key, since mana regen is so poor in this game.<br>
<br>
Thus the need for a way to help the group, not just damage the mob.  This need not be in the form of a buff.  I bet if you took Haste and clarity away from chanters completely, they'd still get groups easily in any dungeon you care to name.  Since they have an entire expansion slated to come out that is totally dungeons, I believe you'll see enchanters re-affirming their place in the holy triumvarite.  This will be due to mez which is a grouping utility, but not a buff.<br>

I can have whatever opinion I want.  I think Necromancers and Mages are overpowered and should be balanced.  Period.  There are many people that agree with me. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Antrygus, I am glad to hear that damage is showing up on test.  This is a change that should have been a long time in coming.  I hope it makes it to production.<br>
<br>
I pretty much agree with everything you say.  Damaging a mob is one thing.  Wizards don't have much to offer a group setting, and that should be changed...and I agree that buffs are not necessarily the answer.<br>

One of the buffs would give a 20% mana preservation that stacks will all preservation gear while at the same time gives a negative 15% to spell damage (again still stacking with worn focus damage).  This buff would be useful in groups to where efficiency is more important that high DPS.<br>
<br>
The other spell would increase spell damage by 15% while at the same time increase mana cost by 20%.  This would be useful on most raid fights where you need to kill something before it kills your raid, and the fight doesn't really last long enough for the Wizards to come close to using up all of their mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
After seeing some of the effects on PoTime items, there is some potential for some decent spells using those effects as well.  For example make a wizard buff that absorbs 50 spell damage and does not wear off whenever the &quot;rune&quot; takes damage.  It would in effect always lower spell damage by 50 as long as the buff is in effect.<br>
<br>
Second would be a self buff that increases evasion rate by a large sum.  Somewhere in the line of 15%-20%.  It can be roleplayed into being Planar Shift or something to where the Wizards body isn't fully in the plane of existence he is currently fighting on, thus making it harder for melee attacks to make contact with him/her. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~kosmos00/elysig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I like the affressive and conservative ideas. Generally, what ever we have as an AA ability, I assume Sony meant it as a main feature of our class. <br>
<br>
Your absorb damage shield spell is good to. Lately, it seems Sony's answer to making things easier for casters is to combine several spells into one spell. Why not do the same for our two kinds of shield spells? Average the mana cost and have the spell give AC, HP and absorb damage all in one. That way we only have to cast one spell. Hmmm maybe this isn't as good as when I first thought it.<br>
<br>
We can be a &quot;buffing&quot; class if some of our self buffs became group buffs later on. If the effects from the level 54 and up familar also benifited anyone grouped with you, they would get see invis (no need for anyone to cast it while grouped), +20 to all resists, +75 mana, +2 mana regen tick, and reduced fizzle rate. That's alot, and all wizards always have thier familar up. At level 60 it's even more.<br>
<br>
Something else that could be added to Familars, a sort of debuff for mobs. At say level 54, the familar also increased the resists modifier for all none lure spells by -10, at level 60 -15 and so on. <br>
<br>
Or just make this a buff spell line, but make it castable on others. And have it spread through out being a wizard. Starting at 16, the get on that is -5 to all resists. level 29 -10 and so on, up to -20. Maybe even just make them fire, cold and magic based spells. Call it Channeling Efficency or something like that. First this would help wizards get groups in the lower levels, as they have something to offer a group in the way of improving peoples performance. If they get groups easier in the lower levels, then they can make friends, and won't complain about not getting groups in the higher levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=915.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=915.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=915.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=915.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=915.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=915.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=915.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
