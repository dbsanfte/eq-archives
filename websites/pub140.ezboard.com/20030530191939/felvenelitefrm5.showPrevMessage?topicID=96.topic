It was built by the first of those that were made in the Goddess Tunares image so long ago. One of those stoneworkers was a young elf named Olanet Hone. He was a humble man, hard working, and truly loved the Goddess Tunare, as did all her first children. It took many years to complete the building of this fair dwelling, but age rests lightly upon the shoulders of the High Elves.<br>
<br>
Olanet lived in a small hut while construction of the fortress was ongoing. During this time, the elven cousins from Kelethin would bring the wood needed for construction. This would ensure that natures balance would be kept intact for the Wood Elf cousins would plant new trees to replace those felled for their brethren and strengthen them with their treesong. One of those elves was a fair maiden Mignonette Stormwhisper, who would accompany her father with deliveries. Olanet could not help but fall in love with this fair lady. However, he became deeply troubled, as he felt ashamed that another could enter his heart beside the Goddess Tunare. He continued to court the young lady, and both became entranced with each other.<br>
<br>
The two decided that they would marry to start a family on their own, but Olanet wanted to seek the graces of the Goddess Tunare for her blessing to ease his troubled heart. On the day of completion of the two of them would ask the Most Gracious Mother to unite them as She would visit Her children on this day. The city was packed as most of the elven cousins from Kelethin were in attendance to see the fruits of their contributions, and to gaze upon the glory of Tunare.<br>
<br>
When Tunare arrived upon the fortress, Olanet and Mignonette approached and asked,<br>
Most Gracious Mother, may we ask a small boon of you<br>
<br>
Tunare replied, Why of course, my child, come and walk with me and ask what you will as I view the splendor of your work.<br>
<br>
As they walked, Olanet and Mignonette told the Goddess Tunare of how they fell in love, and of their desire to be wed.<br>
<br>
Tunare exclaimed, How wonderful! It will be a grand dedication to honor this day.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Olanet felt cold and as if a heavy weight was being pressed down upon him. He caught a glimpse of shadowy figure in the distance and noticed that he was aiming an arrow at the Goddess Tunare. Without a thought, he placed himself directly in the line of sight and Tunare as the assassin released the arrow taking a mortal wound. Immediately, Tunares retainers and other onlookers pursued the assassin, but failed to apprehend him. Tunare knelt beside Olanet as Mignonette cradled his head in her tender arms.<br>
<br>
My Dear Mother, today is truly the saddest day. My heart is broken that I may not be united with the woman that I love, Olanet stated as a tear trickled from his eye.<br>
<br>
Mignonette wept, My love, my heart, you will always be with me as she tapped lightly upon her chest. I will keep you here, always. You are my first love, and no other shall replace you.<br>
<br>
With that, Olanet smiled and passed into the realm of the gods.<br>
<br>
All had gathered around as Tunare stood and exclaimed, Behold! This righteous child, Olanet Hone, has done the most honorable deed anyone may perform. He has given his life so that another may live, more so, because he did this to save me, his Goddess. Not only did he give his life, but also in doing so this valiant child leaves the one he loves behind. Let his example be one for all of my children. Those who wish to lead a simple life, devout, humble, loyal, and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for another be known as a paladin. For one to be true they must have a heart that knows unending love and devotion without thought or wants for themselves. Those who wish to live this life shall do honor to his memory and be graced with my favor.<br>
<br>
Tunare then knelt and lifted Olanets body saying to Mignonette, Weep no more fair cousin, for Olanet is among the most honored in my household. Please, stand by me. Turning to her audience, The one you seek is a foul minion of Innoruuk known as Count Iblise. Take heed of this warning, for he has been granted powers by Prince of Hate himself and will not hesitate to use them. This place is now known to the evil one, defend it well my children. Tunare then wove her spell taking Mignonette and Olanets body to her own realm.<br>
<br>
Mignonette was in awe of the beauty Tunares personal wooded grove. Tunare then placed Olanets body upon the ground. Still kneeling, Tunare scooped up a hand of soil to trickle over the body as she whispered a delicate, beautiful song. Barely audible to Mignonettes ears, it relieved her of both sadness and grief. To her amazement, Olanets body began to fade slowly until Tunares song ended. And then, he was gone. Tunare turned to Mignonette,<br>
Do not grieve any longer, and she gently stood bringing Mignonette with her out of the grove.<br>
<br>
They proceeded to where Tunare rests upon her throne, and as they entered Mignonette nearly fainted at the sight of her long lost love beaming radiantly as he stood next to Tunares throne. Tunare explained as the approached the throne,<br>
<br>
You see my young cousin, your love shall remain with my protectors in my true realm. Go to him. Mignonette did not disappoint Tunare with wasting time to see her lost love once more, and neither did Olanet. No tears were shed except those of joy.<br>
<br>
She then sat upon her throne and proclaimed, While the corporeal may not bind with the ethereal in the realms of the gods, my gift of this meeting does little to reward you of your sacrifice. I can only bring you together for a short time to mend your hearts. Be it known now, through my graces, Mignonette shall give birth to a son as one of my children from the seed of Olanet. This is only possible because of the love that you share for each other. While this is a small token of my gratitude, it will never replace the loss of your dear love or the life that you two may have spent together. Know that my hand will guide his life, and I shall watch over the two of you until I may welcome you both into my household. Be honored guest and remain in my realm for a time before you must return to your own realm Mignonette.<br>
<br>
Olanet and Mignonette delighted with their time together departed to explore Tunares wondrous realm. After many hours, they stopped beneath a shaded pine, Olanet turned to Mignonette, My love, my heart, only joy and happiness flow through me as I gaze into your eyes knowing that you will bear my child.<br>
<br>
My love, I am beyond joy of knowing that I will bear your child. However, concerned that he will not know or meet his father.<br>
Do not worry love, you must put your faith in Tunare and know that we will both watch over him, Olanet stated.<br>
What shall we name him Mignonette asked.<br>
We shall name him Taishir MaHone, which means glorious son of Hone, proclaimed Olanet.<br>
Mignonette whispered the name as she gently took Olanets glowing hand and placed it on her belly with her own. Smiling up at Olanet, He will make us both proud, my love. <p><b>Taishir Mahone</b><br>
