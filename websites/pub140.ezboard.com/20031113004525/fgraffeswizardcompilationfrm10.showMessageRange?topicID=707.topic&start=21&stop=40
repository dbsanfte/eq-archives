The comment about being oversensitive was a conclusion drawn from this quote:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cleric nukes seem to have just been put there as way to thumb thier noses at wizards. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It was not meant to be an insult, merely an observation.  It really looked to me like paranoia.  The idea that the only reason clerics got nukes was to make wizards feel useless seems absurd to me.<br>
<br>
Up in the Damage Log sticky thread, I managed to get a log from a level 57 nuking druid.  He was nuking, buffing regens etc., and using the epic snare.<br>
<br>
57 Dru ... 10,326 ... 9.53 ... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3.35</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (35.20%) (1084/3079)<br>
<br>
Looking at Armok's chart for an unbuffed 57 wizard using draught of ice and no click nuke, I see that a wizard would be expected to have a TDPS of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 12.160</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This druid did 27.5% of the nuke damage a wizard would be expected to do.  This was a druid spending some mana buffing, and a decent part of combat time snaring, but otherwise he was free to nuke away.  This cleric you are talking about that was healing most of the time?  He probably didn't even come close to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> druid's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> damage.<br>
<br>
Cleric nukes are really not that big of a deal the way they are.  They don't need to be capped at any level, they don't need to be nerfed.  Cleric nukes are only magic based, do less damage per mana than wizard nukes, and now have significant recast times on them.<br>
<br>
btw... Grimstaff, lets look at my mage numbers compared to Armok's predictions.  Armok predicts a level 55 wizard will do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 11.22</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> total damage per second for a 33% uptime.<br>
<br>
55 Mag ... 40,864 ... 37.70 ... 13.27 (35.2%) (1084/3079)<br>
Nukes ... 14687 ... 13.55 ... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4.77</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (35.2%) (1084/3079)<br>
<br>
Uptime is slightly different, but as you can see the wizard would be nuking <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>more</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> than &quot;twice as hard&quot; as the mage, to use the words you tried to put in my mouth.  I had overestimated the amount of damage I did from nukes in relation to my pets.  In this situation, it looks more like 36% nukes and 64% pet.<br>
<br>
Also.... Fynal, what levels were you talking about here?  What level were you compared to this cleric getting the crits?  Levels make a rather huge difference...  You should never compare yourself to someone 3-4 levels higher, you'll often be disappointed... that is the way it <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>should</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/02 2:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> Back to the topic here, but why arn't casting abilities capped for the different classes?  If our melee abilities cap at 110, then why arn't wizards able to go to 253 evocation, with mages and necros at 253 conjuration?  Clerics then would have their evocation capped at 175 or so, and they would have a harder time with casting those high level evocation spells.  Then you could further go in and make it so spells cost less and less mana to cast as your evocation skill goes up, drop the stupid cap on damage as you get new spells(why doesn't my level 1 spells scale all the way up, instead of stopping at level 4.  Every spell is capped, instead of being allowed to grow more powerful as we level, and THAT kills things.<br>
<br>
At level 50, a spell that casts in 1.1 second and does 55 damage isn't much, but for the 8 mana it costs, it would be useful against greenies.  What would be the harm since the high level of spells have a better damage to mana ratio anyway?<br>

<br>
I have said couple times in this thread that after 49, wizards really start to outdistance other classes in terms of nuking. Citing evidence of a druid and wizard in thier 50s, doesn't really dispute anything I have said here. <br>
<br>
The &quot;thumb thier noses&quot; comment was really meant as tounge and cheek. I was not attempting to argue that some guy at Verant did this to say, &quot;take this wizards.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for personal attacks, I really just resent the idea that becuase I have this view that there should be greater seperation in nuking abilities, that it neccessarily means I am jealous or something. Do not make this into something it isn't. I disagree with you on this one, and it's that simple. Thinking that VI went a overboard on cleric nukes doesn't mean I hate clerics. I also don't think wizards should have IvU. <br>
<br>
The cleric was the same level as me, but had more experience as she had put in some AA work. So yes she was more powerful. And no I don't thing dps for dps she would have outdamaged me. Perhaps it just feels very wrong to see someone be able to deal critical heals and critical nukes.<br>

Could we maybe stop dwelling on it?  If it will make your feel better, I can go edit out that part, but honestly that was one sentence of a rather large post and was the only point you chose to address.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have said couple times in this thread that after 49, wizards really start to outdistance other classes in terms of nuking. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You have said so but haven't really convinced me.  Glancing at level 44 it looks like wizards have a decent advantage over clerics.  From my perspective, where small differences on paper often translate into large differences in game, I conclude that wizard nukes are suffeciently better than cleric nukes.<br>
<br>
Now, we can either agree to disagree, and have me make argument after argument for my case with the only responses being restatements of the original opinion or new opinions, OR you can try to convince me that your opinion is better by using reason and facts.<br>
<br>
As I said before, my position is slightly stronger because I am defending what is already in game.  You guys are arguing for a rather significant change, so it is really up to you to convince everyone else that you are right and I am wrong.  The question shouldn't be &quot;why don't they cap cleric nukes?&quot;  That's not something I should need to answer, even though I try.  The question should be, for you, &quot;why <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>should</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> they cap cleric nukes?&quot;  If your only reason is &quot;so that wizards can be secure in their nuking superiority,&quot; then I don't think you'll end up convincing many people that cleric nukes need nerfing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufynalwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fynalwiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 678<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/30/02 4:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> You know what Goladus, I did what you said. I went and looked at cleric nukes on Casterrealms and evaluated them as compared to wizards. Guess what. You are right. In addition to some mana efficiency, the recast delay really is key in holding clerics back from doing wizard imitations. I am going to do what a man should do here--admit I was wrong. At 55 a cleric will not outnuke. At 29 he won't outnuke me either. You have evidence on your side this time. It serves your point well.<br>

Wizards doesnt get any major upgrades 55 to 58, so its only the increased meditation and level bonus on nukes. Going from 4.77 with 35% uptime to 17.07 with 47.8% does seem a big diffrence. Its actualy somewhat better then what a level 58 wizard would do, althou you had druid buff and focus items in the log.<br>

I assume you are talking about my Chardok xp group.<br>
<br>
For the Karnors group I was basically unbuffed.  The only buffs I had were defensive(natureskin, regrowth, etc.)  I was level 55 then.<br>
<br>
Here are the things I had access to in the Chardok group that allowed for such a difference in nuking:<br>
<br>
Koadic's Endless Intellect<br>
Rod of Mystical Transvergence<br>
Burnt Wood Staff (333 damage in 13.5 seconds)<br>
Shock of Steel(Level 57 nuke which checks against conjure, my specialization)<br>
Focus items<br>
Rods + regeneration + a couple of heals came out to almost 6 mana per tick.<br>
<br>
Rods + KEI ~= 6+14 = 20 mana per tick<br>
<br>
So, the 20 mana per tick, at a ratio of 3:1, could account for 10 tdps(14.77, if we add to the previous results).  My nuking effeciency for that night, after focus items, seemed close to 100%, so as a guess, 99 casts of the burnt wood staff gave 32,967 damage in 7840 seconds for a tdps of 4.20.  This brings our total to 18.97<br>
<br>
My guess is that I missed more med ticks using the burnt wood staff so using the 4.77 to build on is not 100% accurate, thus the slightly lower actual result of 17.07<br>
<br>
Playing with the spreadsheet a little to account for 10% damage focus and 10% mana focus, it seems like a level 58 wizard with a velk robe would be expected to do ~27.85 tdps in that situation.  If he only had a solist wand(which would be the minimum required, imo, if we are to compare with the burnt wood staff) then the tdps would be closer to 22.32<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, one of the things Armok suggested were right click nuke items to fill in the gap between the solist wand and the velk robe, and based on this mage/wizard comparison I would have to agree.  <br>
<br>
I think the cast time on the Icicle robe needs to be lowered.   While the Velious robes are much more common than the Burnt Wood Staff(or solist wand, for that matter), they are much more difficult to get.  Adjusting the cast time on the Skyshrin/Kael robes would be a good start.<br>
<br>
It also might be interesting to note that I probably would have done less damage had a wizard been in the group.  I probably would have been spending a lot of my extra mana giving him rods instead of nuking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/1/02 8:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> Actualy, the spreadsheat already asumed you had Velious robe and clarity II. No Clarity II might explain the big diffrence between the 55 wizard damage and the mage one. Specializing in Conjuration is another diffrence. Velk robe shouldnt enter the picture unless comparing with a mage with Velk boots. Right click items doesnt actualy just add to damage. Burnt wood staff makes you miss at least 2 med ticks while using it. Making it a a very efficent nuke (7:1 ratio or better) but not exactly free. Soloist wand isnt even worth clicking at that level unless you time it between ticks or on a horse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1729<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/02 1:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> The number I quoted to Grimstaff was an unbuffed wizard at level 55. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1730<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/02 1:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Actualy, the spreadsheat already asumed you had Velious robe and clarity II<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->First, there is a page that lists wizards without using an item.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  No Clarity II might explain the big diffrence between the 55 wizard damage and the mage one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->again, the level 55 wizard I was comparing the level 55 mage to did not have clarity either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Velk robe shouldnt enter the picture unless comparing with a mage with Velk boots. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, if you'll read my post again you'll see that I plainly admit that the velk robe is more advanced equipment than the burnt wood staff.  I believe I said that the comparison, as it stands, is a pretty good example to use in support of having a new right click item attainable by a 55+ wizard.  ...A wizard equivalent for the burnt wood staff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Right click items doesnt actualy just add to damage. Burnt wood staff makes you miss at least 2 med ticks while using it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, it's not really this simple.  I find that very often, I am using the staff when I would otherwise be doing nothing for aggro reasons.  Maybe this is different when you have a pet, but I usually can't send my pet into combat without first standing up, and I generally remain standing for most of combat time to avoid aggro from adds.<br>
<br>
So, while the burnt wood staff does, sometimes, cause me to lose med ticks, a simple ratio is extremely difficult to determine.  However, two ticks per cast is definitely not accurate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Soloist wand isnt even worth clicking at that level unless you time it between ticks or on a horse. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again, a right click item does not automatically replace meditation.  Often, you stand for aggro reasons anyway, and in these situations you sacrifice very little to use a right click nuke. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 5/2/02 11:24:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br>  Posts: 843<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/02 5:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First, there is a page that lists wizards without using an item.

<br>
For my non-item equipped wizard simulation, I assumed that wizards would meditate for 100% of the downtime, and 50% of the uptime. The other 50% of uptime was spent either nuking or standing to avoid agro. (Have I mentioned that sit agro is stupid?) While this is a very rough estimate, it works out pretty close to my measured numbers (you would expect the med in uptime to go up with more uptime, but the model does not account for this).<br>
<br>
For an item nuking wizard, I assumed that wizards would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be medding while in combat. This matches my experience as well, where I found I was always nuking, concussion, or right clicking. The only time it would have made sense to med during combat is when melees are finishing off snared runners, but this time is inconsequential.<br>

No, it's not really this simple. I find that very often, I am using the staff when I would otherwise be doing nothing for aggro reasons. Maybe this is different when you have a pet, but I usually can't send my pet into combat without first standing up, and I generally remain standing for most of combat time to avoid aggro from adds.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This depends alot on how the group handle adds. I can usualy sit most of the time during combat. I have never had any problems with sending pets in while sitting myself. It doesnt require alot for the tank to out taunt sit aggro most of the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1734<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/02 7:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> I've found that sitting vs. sending pet has a lot to do with the mob(especially level).  When I'm in kael arena, sending my pet too soon without standing is grounds for a summons nearly every time.  I found the same thing in Sirens Grotto with the sirens.  Mobs in burning woods?

If this were the case you'd be screaming &quot;Clerics should never nuke!!&quot;  The answer to why this is true should be fairly obvious, but lets do it step by step so you can see what I mean:<br>
<br>
Class A (Wizard) Nuke, Heal<br>
Class B (Cleric) Nuke, Heal<br>
<br>
These two classes are identical.  Now lets branch out to where we are now:<br>
<br>
Class A no heals, slight utility, teleports, very slight group buffing, nukes<br>
Class B more utility, heals, ressurects, group buffing, plate armor, minor weapons, minor combat skills, slightly better hps, nukes<br>
<br>
er... where did this divergence work out to where you are defending Cleric nukes again?  Here's the advantages each class has clearly and unequivocably over the other:<br>
<br>
Wizard: Soloing, AE Spells, porting<br>
Cleric: Grouping, Healing, Ressurects, Buffing<br>
<br>
There's no supportable position that Clerics should get nukes, let alone nukes at the power level they have in the game. <br>
<br>
&quot;Check your numbers again, Grimstaff. Get some real ones. Show me clerics doing as much damage as a competent wizard in the same situation and I'll agree that wizards have a 'tiny margin of superiority.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, while I can easily do this and you know very well what I'd be talking about, that quote wasn't about clerics.  If you read throught what I said there again you'll see I clearly was referring to the game in general, not Clerics in specific.  Wizards are built around nuking, as you rightly agreed.  The margin of superiority Wizards have in nuking is slight for a class built around this.  That is a big error in the design of the game.<br>
<br>
When beta was put out, the design was solid - other classes nuked but not NEARLY as well as Wizards, not by half.  Wizards were too potent, but the margin of difference was appropriate for a class built to focus on this one thing.  In the game now, only Clerics are built properly in this context, nobody heals nearly like a Cleric.<br>
<br>
And Goladus, take away nukes and Clerics are virtually unchanged.  The fact that you can come up with some odd situation where Clerics will nuke because they have little else do to does NOT change this fact.  Clerics hardly ever nuke, they wouldn't miss nukes if they were taken away ENTIRELY except in very very tiny portions of the game.  That's &quot;virutally unchanged&quot; regardless of how you want to argue.<br>
<br>
Clerics really shouldn't have been given any nukes to start with, except PERHAPS vs undead.  Assuming foolishly like Rombus does above that since they channel their god's power they should blow stuff up is rediculous, you can defend them having tracking, superior combat skills, pets and ANY PART OF THE GAME by saying &quot;they channel their god's power&quot; that's a total non issue here.  If you insist on giving Clerics nukes then there's even less justification for the potency they have - particularly at low levels.  IN NO DEMENTED STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION can anyone defend Clerics having the most powerful nukes in the game for the lowest level, this is utterly indefensible in a game design and role playing perspective.  As a Magician I can't see how you can even begin to defend coming in third behind Clerics for nukes (Forth at level 5-7, behind druids, Clerics, and Wizards - in that order).<br>
<br>
Now, lets move on to another issue:<br>
<br>
&quot;btw... Grimstaff, lets look at my mage numbers compared to Armok's predictions. Armok predicts a level 55 wizard will do 11.22 total damage per second for a 33% uptime.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uptime is slightly different, but as you can see the wizard would be nuking more than &quot;twice as hard&quot; as the mage, to use the words you tried to put in my mouth. I had overestimated the amount of damage I did from nukes in relation to my pets. In this situation, it looks more like 36% nukes and 64% pet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me get this straight, at level 55, at the weakest range in a Mage's career (post 50) that means &quot;In many situations&quot; to you?  You were trying to portray Wizards as outnuking you and your pet the majority of the time, when its possibly true post 50 with the top of the line right click gear (your logs I've seen have been very questionable - a group with you and a shaman not even using damage shields for crying out loud) sometimes?  What was your point again?<br>
<br>
One final point:<br>
<br>
&quot;Also.... Fynal, what levels were you talking about here? What level were you compared to this cleric getting the crits? Levels make a rather huge difference... You should never compare yourself to someone 3-4 levels higher, you'll often be disappointed... that is the way it should be.&quot;<br>
<br>
That depends a lot.  Should a Mage 3-4 levels higher outnuke a Wizard?  Sure, they are damn good at nuking, nearly as potent as a Wizard.  That's what the class is partly built around.<br>
<br>
Should a Cleric 3-4 levels higher outnuke a Wizard?  Sure, the day a Wizard 3-4 levels higher OUT HEALS A CLERIC.  Come on Goladus, are you going to come here and defend Clerics out nuking Mages post 50 next? <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/3/02 9:31:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1740<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/4/02 4:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> er... where did this divergence work out to where you are defending Cleric nukes again? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I believe here..<br>

However, cleric nukes aren't most &quot;powerful&quot; because powerful is not a totally objective term.<br>
<br>
If you actually go play a level 1 cleric and a level 1 wizard you'll discover that most battles are fought toe to toe with a mob.  In this situation, cast time makes a rather large difference in even being able to cast at all.<br>
<br>
I've played both, and with a wizard I can kill a mob using only nukes. Sometimes, I can even do it without getting hit if I kite.  With a cleric, I can open the fight with a nuke, and if I try nuking again I will most likely be interrupted.  Sometimes, on undead, I can fear them and nuke when they come in range, which winds up using up all my mana.<br>
<br>
Whatever the ratios and max nuke values are... irrelevant.  Whoever tuned those spells knew exactly what they were doing for a level one character.  When you play a level 1 wiz, you nuke stuff.  When you play a level one cleric, you melee mostly, and maybe use a nuke here or there when you get the opportunity, or heal if you must. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 5176<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/5/02 9:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> Your quote does nothing to resolve the problem of diverging power I laid out, I don't even understand what you are trying to prove by it.  You can NEVER have enough defense, because the way the game is laid out defense will never be absolute (it never keeps you immune to damage), nor damage absolute (kills anything without you suffering).<br>
<br>
&quot;I've played both, and with a wizard I can kill a mob using only nukes. Sometimes, I can even do it without getting hit if I kite. With a cleric, I can open the fight with a nuke, and if I try nuking again I will most likely be interrupted. Sometimes, on undead, I can fear them and nuke when they come in range, which winds up using up all my mana.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me remind you of what it was like to play a Cleric at low levels, since either you've forgotten or you didn't nuke much and are making assumptions.   I suggest you go actually make a Cleric and Wizard in the same zone and kill a few creatures using nukes, to refresh your memory - because I've done that very thing a few times in the past.<br>
<br>
You are assuming here that<br>
A) the Cleric's spells cast so slowly they'll be interrupted<br>
B) the only way to use nukes is to run about away from a monster an hit them at range.<br>
<br>
For Point A I refer you to the fact that the Cleric's casting time is only .4 (less than half) second difference, and Frost Bolt is actually longer at level 1.  I have successfully and quite often kept casting cleric blasts while being hit, in fact its sometimes easier than with a Wizard because THE CLERICS AC CAN BE MORE THAN DOUBLE A WIZARDS.<br>
<br>
Further, you can sit and fight a monster up close using only blasts, you'll do reasonably well as a Wizard, and just as well as a Cleric - better if you factor in that a Cleric can not only heal themself, but can use a better weapon and can melee better when they are oom.<br>
<br>
But all of this is academic and has nothing to do with the entire discussion.  If Wizards had a blast that was 2 points higher but slower than a Cleric you'd be trying to argue &quot;Wizards are more powerful!!!!  See, it does more!&quot;  The point everyone is trying to make here is that Clerics do TOO MUCH DAMAGE.  Is that clear to you yet?  TOO MUCH DAMAGE, you know as well as I do that mana ratios and damage done are not &quot;irrelevant&quot; despite how dismissing this information helps your attempt.<br>
<br>
You further assume that the designers knew exactly what they were doing when they did the low level characters and I disagree most strongly to this.  I don't believe they were paying that close attention to what they were doing with damage numbers, they reduced Wizard numbers without proper attention to the other classes' damage overall, and we ended up with stupid stuff like level 34-38 with Mages.  However, even if they DID do this carefully, you are assuming that since most clerics don't nuke (some are totally unaware they get nukes) that this somehow justifies in any sense what was done.  It doesn't, the fact that Clerics don't USE this advantage makes no difference whatsoever, Wizards had a strong advantage (thought not clear enough some levels) in AE for a long time before people like Myztic and I were able to get it through to people's heads it wasn't suicide.  Was that advantage not there? <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usiryakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/02 1:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And Goladus, take away nukes and Clerics are virtually unchanged.

False.  I've seen clerics who like to solo.  I've seen evok specialized clerics.<br>

So, most clerics would not miss nukes that much.  I aggree with that.<br>

Mobs are slowed by a factor of 3 to 4 with a shaman -- makes damage shield alot less useful (a factor of 3 to 4 less useful, even!).  Might be still worth it, I'd guess, but I've never played a high level mage -- I'd ask them.<br>

Wizard nukes have been the best nuke at every level.<br>
<br>
Admittantly there is the except where a wizard is 1 level before his next set of spells and the other class is at that level, but *shrug* doesn't bother me.<br>
<br>
Until you all go down line by line, analyze every spell for what it is worth.  Max Damage, Mana Ratio, Mana efficiency, Casting Time, Recast Time, and Damage Per Second.  You will never understand and Verant will never listen to you because you haven't fully analyzed the spell.  You have stuck to one lame point of view of max damage which is so old and means abolutely nothing in comparison to mana efficiency and damage per second in the end. <br>
<br>
And before someone comes back and tells me yadda yadda magician class at level 44 with pet is so much better then a wizard.  First, get a damage log of a mage pet, then combine it with a damage log of spells.  Then tell me how many level 60 magicians enjoy their class as wizards do.  <br>
<br>
Plain and simple, wizards own.  We may need some adjusting in some areas, but in the end, we own.  There was a common precept in beginning, it came from AD&amp;D beliefs.  That wizards were one of the weakest classes to start, it would be a long hard road, and in the end they would be a terrifyling devastating force.  <br>
<br>
Personally I'm happy with most of the results.  I can't say I'm glad our true final spell drops off a mob that has been killed by 3 guilds across all servers.  And that probably 98% of the wizard community will never see it.  Emperor is probably only a couple months off for my guild.  But I still feel for the rest of the community. <br>
<br>
In the end, if you really feel slighted by a cleric nuking ability, you are in the wrong class.  <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">
