It's hillarious to look at the mob while the nukes are landing, reminds me of getting hit by the rocket launcher in Quake.  Boom boom boom dead.  I was so used to it taking 5 minutes and a million mana to kill these same mobs with a conventional group.  <br>
<br>
Wizards save me, the cleric, a ton of mana because the mobs die so fast that I don't have to heal the tank over and over while the melees whittle away the mob's health over time.  I notice these things a lot and it's one of the main resaons I'll always take a wizard and magician into my group if at all possible.

<br>
Why do shammy, dru, enc, mage, necro, bard all get charm and the wiz does not?  We are, other than clerics, the only pure caster without charm. <br>
<br>
They raised other classes DD's and ours stay low.. AT has full resists and high aggro.<br>
<br>
Things like 65th level greater decention make me think whomever did the spells does not even play the game.<br>
<br>
People tend to be self centric... chanters haste me.. clerics heal me, shammys slow the mob and buff me.. other melee are like me.  <br>
<br>
Mages give the clerics rods... even necro's feed the cleric mana so I can bash more.  <br>
<br>
What does a wizard do for *me* .... nothing.<br>
<br>
Untill that changes and wizards &quot;do somthing&quot; for melee they will not be a looked for class.<br>
<br>
And I fear that the new &quot;group tool&quot; will make it even worse, so that rather then add the wiz standing there you can look for a desired class 6 zones away.<br>
<br>
If they build a class into the game they have a resposiblity to make the class one that is seen as a benefit to be in a group.<br>
<br>
SOE's total lack of ablity to grasp the concept of balance has lead them down the path of &quot;skill trees&quot; for EQ2 and no set classes.<br>
<br>
The down side to this is, the optimal tree path will be found and EQ2 will be like SW2 attack of the clones...<br>
<br>
I say someone should form a guild with 1 war 1 chanter 1 shammy and 40 clerics to show how ballanced the game is.<br>
<br>
Go Go 40 procking hammers and massive cheal availablity.<br>
<br>
or you could add a few more chanters for DC pets... la la.<br>

I tend to favor caster-priest groups, with no melees, and with my limited play time I try to get the ball rolling as soon as possible after logging in.<br>
<br>
I have had very good experiences lately partnering with a wizard, doing the aggro kiting thing.  In <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, elementals are not much tougher than a pinata, and absent slow, kiting seems to be the way to go.  But as a mage, I don't really have the tools for kiting, and tempermentally, I am more suited for static fights.  A wizard partner has the tools for kiting, and has root and snare to make adds and pet death much more manageable.  The wizard orbits around me, I nuke, the pet chases the mob, and all is well.<br>
<br>
In a group that has met its style minimums <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(trinity, pet, or kiting)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a wizard is a very welcome addition.<br>

<br>
Groups basically need a tank, a healer, a slower and 3 misc damage dealers. Somewhere in there there needs to be some cc, whether it be fd, rooting or whatever.<br>
<br>
If casters always did more considerably more long term damage in groups than melee (which some people advocate due to melee having more ac, hp than casters), then all melee would be fighting for that single tank spot (and pets can take that role at a pinch anyway). That simply would not be reasonable!<br>
<br>
As it is, if uptime is remotely normal casters *do* do more damage than melee. It's only cos people overestimate uptime in the average group (or simply dont understand the concept) that melee are still desirable there atm.<br>
<br>
Melee, in general, cant solo anything like as well as casters either, especially in PoP.<br>
<br>
And, gee, melee are very aware that they are pretty useless on PoP raids compared to the fast damage from casters, though they know they still contribute on Velious and Luclin raids.<br>
<br>
At the moment, therefore, casters are threatening to dominate solo, group and raid!<br>
<br>
Now, post-kunark but pre-focus items melee *did* do too much damage in groups compared to casters, especially wizards. Right now I think the balance is pretty much spot on post-60 for the following reason:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A higher level damage dealer with a ton of aa and great gear will outdamage a lower level with few aa and poor gear, almost regardless of class.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> And VI have now made it all but impossible to get max aa and gear; I'd be suprised if even 5% of everyone who ever played achieves it. At it's simplest that's why EQ balance has always worked; you can (almost) never reach the limit of your power, regardless of your class.<br>
<br>
One huge reason why people cant agree on melee/caster and caster/caster balance is because people value utility so very differently.<br>
<br>
To the raid whore, damage is all - utility is meaningless.<br>
To the low risk xp grind whore, utility is useful a little, but not much. Mostly damage is all.<br>
To the soloer or adventurer (and that includes groups that explore dungeons and try hard mobs for fun), utility is almost all. The ability to stun/snare/root/ss/burn/evac makes a wizard tons better than, say, a mage or rogue.<br>
<br>
Again, many casters discount their ability to solo as if it is nothing. We take it completely for granted, yet many classes *cannot* solo in PoP, and we would be p*ssed if our soloing ability got reduced to that of, say, a warrior or rogue! We get annoyed that mages can 'outnuke' us at 61 - do people not realise how annoying it is for a tank to be lfg in a PoP zone and see a wizard or druid quadding (sometimes while lfg, sometimes not)? It isnt our 'birthright' to solo yet we treat it as such and ignore it totally when it's convenient to us on class balance. It *urks* other classes.<br>
<br>
Finally, MOST classes find it no easier to get a group than us.<br>
<br>
Most groups want one cleric, but only one per group. Ditto shaman and chanter. As ac, hp and damage grow over time, the importance of these classes drops. Just remember the state of the game with grinding in Luclin.<br>
<br>
Most groups want one of warrior, paladin or shadow knight. They dont usually want two plate tanks in a group.<br>
<br>
That leaves the other 8 classes chasing 2 or 3 spots, which is an identical proportion to plate tanks with their spot. Out of those 8, no class has such a compelling reason to be picked it excludes all others; it all depends on level, gear, aa and uptime as to who will do more damage. Only a n00b would think otherwise.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly, and this has been said before but is worth saying again, the *only* person that gets a group quickly in this game is the person that starts it.<br>
<br>
Having said all of that, I agree with Noonie that if spell damage were shown it would increase the desirability of casters. Imagine the spam from showing dot damage though ugh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 1/29/03 4:26:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=staccatoobligato>Staccato Obligato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/31/03 5:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Perceptions of an outsider</span><hr size=1> I think the problem is perception, and the perception is even changing in your favor.<br>
<br>
Pre-PoP, the best groups were AE.  They nerfed AE pulling (when they changed it so you could get hit more than 4 mobs at once).  From that point on, the best groups were the ones that could fight blues non-stop.<br>
<br>
A puller would go get several mobs, the enchanter would mez the extras, then the group would mow through.  As they were killing the last one, the puller would go get more.<br>
<br>
This non-stop pace of battle made manaless damage the most efficient and effective.  Tailored melee groups ruled.  Nuke classes looked bad in comparrison.<br>
<br>
In PoP, we no longer chain-pull.  If a puller routinely comes back with 3 to 5 mobs, you fire him.  Good pullers do everything they can to ensure they arrive with a manageable number ... like 1.<br>
<br>
This gives a pull-pause pace to the fighting.  Casters get a lot more time to med, and this favors the nukers who can &quot;store&quot; damage during downtime and &quot;spend&quot; it during fights.  The slower pace of the kills is more than compensated by the increased XP in PoP.<br>
<br>
In addition, the outdoor zones also favor the casters on horses.  I've heard casters comment that they can't get low on mana, and the only limit to their damage is agro.  (The casters had KEI + horses + Wind of Marr + some FT.)<br>
<br>
Rogues have already started complaining that mages are beating them as damage-dealers in XP groups.  They're worried about what will happen to them when this becomes everyman knowledge.<br>
<br>
Wizards aren't at that level, but they have moved to the point where I lump them in with the mages, rogues, rangers and monks (and beastlords, but I keep forgeting they exist).  I'm pretty close to Frodlin.  I'm taking a damage dealer now, instead of waiting for a different class to show up later.<br>
<br>
Another thing that's changed my feelings toward wizards is the change I've noticed in wizards toward bards.  In the past, wizards were the most notorious offenders in the &quot;mana song plz&quot; category.  I play one of the most challenging classes, and it always annoys me when someone acts like my sole purpose is to service their mana pool.<br>
<br>
In PoP, I've seen a bit different attitude.  Wizards have fallen in love with Rizlona's Call of Flame (aka the focus song).  This has increased their awareness that there are other bard songs that are highly valuable.  Now most wizards seem content to let me work my songs in the manner I see best, even when it means their favorites are excluded in favor of more necessary songs.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I've just been grouping with smarter wizards.<br>
<br>
Elasto, I enjoyed your post; very well thought out.<br>

<br>
So, how about a line of spells that operate sort of like Haste but as damage instead of speed?  Haste increases speed with which a melee type can attack, creating faster DPS.  This hypothetical spell line would add bane damage of either Fire or Cold depending on the spell and it's level to a melee type.<br>
<br>
Progression could go something like this:<br>
<br>
Level 4: +1 Fire, single target short duration (2 minutes?)<br>
Level 8: +1 Cold, single target, short duration (longer duration than level 4 [3 minutes])<br>
Level 12: +1 Fire, group buff, short duration<br>
Level 16: +1 Cold, group buff, short duration<br>
Level 20: +2 Fire, Single Target, short duration<br>
etc. with high end versions adding up to +5 damage or a +3 damage with a very long duration (you know, to make money with!)<br>
<br>
Thoughts?  Would a spell line like this overpower melee making them too strong vs. current content?  Would it achieve the goal of making wizards more group friendly?<br>

The problem is that Clerics CH, Shamans Slow, Druids SoW and do PotG, Enchanters KEI, Mezz and Charm, Necromancers FD, do undead form and have a pet, Mages have a pet and summon - all lasting experiences since you (as another player) see them <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the time they are used - wizards don't have such a thing besides evac...<br>

The TYPICAL wizard of a given level is a LOT less powerful than the TYPICAL melee of a given level.<br>
<br>
AA skills are where most of the power of a wizard comes from, not from just being a given level.  People can get to level 65 as a wizard by soloing, but they may not have a single big nuke, and without KNOWING the wizard in question, it's a big question mark about how effective the wizard will be.<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Mastery 3 to let us cast more spells before running out of mana for example, or how many AA points we have put into crits(spell casting fury, spell casting fury mastery, Fury of Magic Mastery).  How about spells?  Getting Agnarr's or Strike of Solusek boost our damage output in a major way, even in XP groups if we are careful about agro.  Others just can't SEE where we've put our AA points, there's a minor way to tell, is someone a baron, master, or sage, but who knows how you spent your points, you could have done mental clarity to get to master/mistress).  People also can't see our spell list to see if we have the DPS improving nukes and AAs.<br>
<br>
THAT in my opinion is the key.  You can just LOOK at a melee, and see if they have poor equipment, you can see the equipment on a caster, but equipment except for focus effects and flowing thoughts, don't really do much for us.  Verant needs to realize this and make inspect give that information.  Even for melees, being able to inspect a melee and get their AC and ATK would be helpful.  In mostly single player games like Dungeon Siege, buffs have a visible effect, you can see when someone has an effect on them, even if it's a bit of a glow.  EQ doesn't have this.  You can't tell if the equipment someone has are weak junk, or very powerful.  You can inspect someone, but we'd still need to request that the person link their items, and that's a pain.  It may not be realistic to be able to see the numbers directly, but character ABILITY is secondary to equipment for melees.  For casters, character equipment is secondary to ability.  I'm not talking how skilled the players are, I'm talking the character.  AAs and spells are character abilities.  But what new skills do melees get?  A melee with good equipment and few AA skills is still considered a useful tank, a caster with good equipment and few AA skills is considered weak.<br>

I agree with this 100%, but I like the fact that each and every Wizard is a question mark.  Is this Wizard good, or is he lacking.  I like that you make your reputation of not just being a Wizard, but that you make your reputation by the name of the certain Wizard.  <br>

So true, a Wizard you can't tell when he or she first walks up with their shiny epic.  The Wizard must prove themselves on the Battlefield.  Once they do, they are known by name.  For the Wizard is truely hard to get right, with the equipment, AA points, and the knowledge to use it right.  At 60 I am learning new stuff every day, and something tells me at 65 I will still be learning new stuff every day, but then thats what i like about the Wizard so much, its not a walk in the park class, its always a challenge <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ravenwolde - Guild Leader - Nomads of Norrath</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

It doesn't matter what you really meant, or intended. If someone perceives it one way, to them that is the way it is.<br>
<br>
Yes, wizards are percieved as a solo class. To me, that is a wrong perception, since, there are no solo classes in the game, since the game is not designed to be played solo. Now everyone flame me about that. Yes, some classes can solo better. However, since no single class, can solo EVERY where, or EVERY mob in the game, that is why I say their is no truely solo class. And Sony/Verant never made a solo game, they made a multi player game. <br>
<br>
People are silly in their perceptions. Using the new LFG feature, I sent a tell to someone. The response I got was, Oh, we have a wizard. Um, hello, two wizards are better then one. <br>
<br>
People can't see what wizards do. All melees that I know have other peoples damage on, so they can messure how much damage they are doing compared to themselve. It's a vainty, yes. So I agree, they need to change it so that damage from spells shows up on other people's screen. Having it say &quot;A moss snake skins blisters from magical fire for 250 damage&quot; would make people see what we are doing. <br>
<br>
Often when grouped with less knowledgable melees, they always think they are doing ALL the damage or most of it. <br>
<br>
I don't get aggro alot or often not at all. Many peoples perception of wizards are aggro magnets. Why? Because often it is true. They want to prove thier usefullness, so they start nuking right away, get aggro, run around screaming help help get it off me, the tank only gets aggro back cause the wizard died. Great, rez, wait, med, wait, tank wants to fight. Standing around doesn't get me the xp I need thinks the warrior. Wizards, DON'T RUN if you get aggro. Running does not stop you from getting hit. Getting hit from behind often means more damage. If you don't think so, try it. Stand right behind or next to the tank and cast if you are always getting aggro. The tank will be able to get aggro back before you die. <br>
<br>
Enchanters are just as much an aggro magnet, even more so then wizards. Only what they can do is measureable and visible. Wizards, cast your DS on the tank without being asked to. You will soon see them asking for it. Why? even though it's your spell, they will think it's damage they are doing. They will say, Oh man, that was awesome! everytime I got hit I did 5 points of damage! the thing was beating it self to death! Melees' LOVE DS, so give them your's. And if your going up against fire using creatures, they will have a higher FR. Also, giving melee's your DS means that everytime they get hit, they do damage, they increase thier aggro with the mob. That means the melees, aggro is going up faster. Which means you are less likely to pull aggro. So don't think of DS as damage, but as aggro for the melee.<br>
<br>
Most people's experience with wizards is watching them die. And if a wizard is dying, unless the group really sucks, it's only the wizards fault. For most groups, a wizard means evac. If they don't have an evacer, they stay near the zone and fight so they can zone quickly. <br>
<br>
It's up to each wizard to change a persons perception.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A> at: 3/3/03 10:25:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enoah35>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 626<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/4/03 4:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoP</span><hr size=1> Faramir42:<br>
<br>
Your post shows truth. When I logged my cleric alt ( self rez use only cleric but oh well ), I usually formed a group. Warrior, Wizard, druid, me, mage, and ranger. Yep no slower, but who cares? we had 2 good damage dealers. Well warrior pulled, 2 mobs. Wizard have nuked as soon as the mob arrived, same with mage, sended the pet. The druid didn't snared them... for some reason, nor rooted. Result was 2 dead casters in 10secs, since they simply ran around when they got agro. And of course they had to cast rain spells at melee range which blasted themselves to oblivion. I had to park the mobs with root ( yes me ) and I had to tell the druid to snare them countless times, not to mention to help me back up heals instead of constant dotting, nuking the mob. ( cleric was lvl 49 at the time, my wizard was around 51 )<br>
<br>
I believe many groups had the impresion that all wizards are like this, on their earlier days. It is ok to do this once or twince but if you see this in every single pull of course the reputation and wizard or any damage caster's prespective will have a dark future.<br>
<br>
I have seen high lvl wizard ( growing up in ae groups and such ) don't even own concussion. And they use the big blast nukes all the time in groups, they run out of mana fast. A lvl 60+ wizard who doesn't own concussion when they are in a good capable guild should be shot in the head! Well of course it depends on the race that you are in.. but many overcome that issue to obtain, this must have spell. It shows how much dedication you put in wizard class. Completing epic is surely one thing.. but completing concussion quest is also a big achievement. ( I did this with my bst lord frind and an enchanter friend. Was fun doing the CoM part, Gfluxing myself and me being the puller heheh. ) Got my concussion before getting my epic at lvl 54, since I thought I could nuke more with the spell in my hand.<br>

Lol, well same goes to our alliance guild. We got... 7 wizards in total. 2 of them are 2+ boxed. Only 2, yes 2 of them have concussion. No wonder our guild's opinion against wizards are low... since they are constantly getting summoned and squished. /sigh and I have mentioned to 2 of them to really should get concussion... laziness is evil.<br>
