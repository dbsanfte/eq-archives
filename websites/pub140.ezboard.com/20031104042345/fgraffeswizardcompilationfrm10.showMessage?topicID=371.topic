<br>
There has been so many suggestions as to how we should improve the caster classes importance. Increased mana pool, faster mana regen, harder nukes, faster nukes, more efficient nukes. All of these have side effects , most unbalancing ones. So they cannot be implemented..and shouldnt.<br>
<br>
The solution that suddenly popped into my head is this.<br>
The caster classes dont need any changes at all, what is needed to change is the way some NPCs behave in combat situations. As it is now every single mob in the game behaves the exact same way, it is attacked by you and immediately tries to get as close to you as possible and hit the living..out of you, perhaps casting a few nukes now and then. <br>
<br>
What is needed is this, mobs that instead of engaging the melee gets out of range from them and attacks with magic. The best solution for this would be a yonder type spell but with some degree more control than we have. This shouldnt be too hard to implement codewise as its just a trigger..when hit ..yonder to a certain distance and attack. It could possibly even aoe root or snare tanks to keep them away. What would this accomplish?<br>
<br>
Benefits<br>
<br>
1. It would be required that you have casters in your party that can attack it from a distance which make us wanted and needed. <br>
<br>
2. it does not take away the tanks importance at all since there will be normal mobs around as well of course. (as there are mobs now most casters cant even scratch ..these mobs will be hard for melee to harm). A way to be able to melee in these fights would be to stun the mob thus making the stun type spells very important.<br>
<br>
3. This would not unbalance the game in any way. These are certain types of situations in certain dungeons. <br>
<br>
4. There would be no need to implement super items with clarity, free super dds and so on for casters making us too powerful. (more on items later)<br>
<br>
5. As it is now the only caster classes that actually nuke are wizards and to a lesser degree mages. And its certainly only wizards that aoe. This would give every caster class a situation where it is encouraged and possibly needed for them to contribute to the dmg. Some would of course nuke more than others. Class specifics:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wizard: The purpose is clear..prime dmg dealer in these fights. DD and aoe and stun.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Magician: The air pet would be priceless with stuns of course, and they would DD and get &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp to aoe as they do have decent aoes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enchanter: Possible to mez everything and do the one target attack thing of course but thats &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the boring and chicken way of doing it. Id like to see the enchanter being able to Nuke &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp more..aoe more (they do have some aoes dont they?)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Druid: Dots are priceless, they can nuke, they can aoe, they can heal and certainly more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Necromancer: Dots read above, nuke to some extent..i have never seen a necro aoe..can they?...mana dump! (boring but oh so&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp important in these fights)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shaman: Dots, nukes, heals, much resembling the druid role. And of course buffing as usual.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Paladin: Stun like crazy and possibly use that tiny little DD you have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp who did i miss?<br>
<br>
6. An important thing about meelee vs caster equipment is that melees get better and better things improving their performance in battle to no end and casters see no noticable difference no matter what we get.(well some things does make a tiny difference). Suddenly with the mobs aggro always concentrated on you with magical attacks, your amount of resistances become extremely important. Instead of the AC melee have..you have resists. Thus making equipment necessary and greatly improving your gameplay in common (well more common than the once a month uberfight resists are really needed for now) fights and thus adding another dimension to caster equipment.<br>
<br>
7. Most of the mobs changed behavior shouldnt be too hard to program. Mobs already root..give them an aoe root or snare..mobs already gate..give them yonder.<br>
Mobs already stop to cast..make them stand still and cast longer. Mobs already run to a certain (minimum?) distance to you and bash your head in, make them run to a distance further from you and instead of melee, cast!<br>
One possible spell for them would be the proposed &quot;blink&quot; spell someone wanted wizards to have (an idea i pretty much like btw). A little yonder thats automatic when youre hit or going to be hit.<br>
<br>
Possible drawbacks.<br>
<br>
1. A mob yondering sounds like a nasty thing..it could yonder away into the middle of a group of other mobs, aggroing the whole bunch. Well that is for verant to prevent from happening too often <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  More controlled yonder spells would be of help.<br>
<br>
2. I honestly cant think of more drawbacks. I bet you can hehe<br>
<br>
Last but not least.. SCENARIO 1.<br>
<br>
Two groups of brave fighters enters the new and improved dungeon chardok for the first time. They have the normal group setups of mainly tanks , a cleric and chanter in each and an evacer (thats what we are sometimes<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> and a monk to pull. <br>
<br>
&quot;Raid&quot; leader shouts &quot;Main assist is crackerjack, Secondary is Eolar&quot;<br>
<br>
They send the monk off to grab the first pull of the day, lets call him..claus.<br>
<br>
Claus shouts &quot;Incoming the normal mobs you always see in chardok&quot;<br>
<br>
its dead in seconds, leaving a rotting pile of zonetrash<br>
<br>
Crackerjack tells the party &quot;ooc Bah what kind of improvement is that?&quot;<br>
Eolar tell the party &quot;ooc didnt seem like any difference&quot;<br>
<br>
Claus shouts &quot;Incoming a Sarnak comprehender&quot; &quot;Oh Fun, lets make it pay to have ever been born!&quot;<br>
<br>
Crackerjack shouts &quot;Assist me on a sarnak comprehender!&quot;<br>
<br>
the tanks engage and gets a few hits off. and..<br>
<br>
Crackerjack shouts &quot;Where did it go!?&quot;<br>
<br>
A sarnak comprehender begins to cast a spell<br>
<br>
Crackerjacks feet adhere to the ground<br>
Eolars feet adhere to the ground<br>
Claus feet adhere to the ground<br>
tank4s feet adhere to the ground<br>
tank...<br>
tank..<br>
tank...<br>
<br>
A sarnak comprehender begins to cast a spell<br>
<br>
Crackerjack skin is burnt within the inferno of al'sarnak<br>
Crackerjack has been slain by a sarnak comprehender<br>
Eolar skin is burnt within the inferno of al'sarnak<br>
eolar has been slain by a sarnak comprehender<br>
Claus skin is burnt within the inferno of al'sarnak<br>
claus has been slain by a sarnak comprehender<br>
tank4 ....<br>
tank..<br>
tank..<br>
<br>
well these tanks are very weak and die fast ...not my fault<br>
<br>
<br>
SCENARIO 2 <br>
<br>
2 groups enter chardok consisting of one tank group, cleric and one caster group, cleric, wizard,chanter,wizard, magician,druid.<br>
<br>
Raid leader shouts &quot;Main tank assist crackerjack, secondary assist eolar&quot;<br>
Raid leader shouts &quot;Main caster assist Rhuobe, secondary Silvarium&quot;<br>
<br>
This group is buffed twinked and bitchin ..<br>
<br>
3 comprehenders are pulled. <br>
The tanks engage as usual, leaving them rooted and looking dumb(er?)<br>
at medium range. <br>
<br>
Rhuobe shouts &quot;Assist me with a few a sarnak comprehender&quot;<br>
<br>
You begin to cast pillar of lightning<br>
Silvarium begins to cast a spell<br>
caster 3..<br>
caster..<br>
caster..<br>
<br>
It is an intense fight of the arcane magics, aggro is now on casters leaving them with their resists and clerics as only protection. (Note should be taken that the sarnak does not engage the casters in melee..Until it run out of mana perhaps..but it should be a weak melee in that case)<br>
<br>
The tanks break free and goes after the sarnak, to no luck as he yonders away easily.<br>
<br>
The casters begin to severly stun the sarnak giving the tanks opportunity to engage it with their gleaming swords..and sticks..and fists.<br>
<br>
Needless to say the battle is won and the casters win the purple heart <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
well im done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  in my opinion this would make the game 200 times more fun for us casters .<br>
<br>

I prefer that to &quot;Taxi Driver.&quot;<br>
<br>
Secondly, way to keep the interest with such a long post.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, the only thing I would see a problem with is the dungeon use vs. the ability for the PC caster to hit a target not in view.  A yonder would put them in another hallway which would nullify our effectiveness pretty well.  At least in many Sebi camps that would be the case.  We have a similar situation already with Mob Gating and Summoning.  However, in the current setup, once the mob gates and starts summoning, the group is finished if it can't camp out in time.  I would LOVE the idea of making situations where casters are actually a tool in the process and not an appliance for the cleanup.  Very nice post.<br>
