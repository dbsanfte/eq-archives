The night sky was crystal clear of any erroneous clouds that would threaten the awesome view of the stars and Luclin. He was alone on the ship, that much he was certain of now. As he wandered about the deck searching for something, though he did not know what, the perfect night sky that he had just observed was now gone and replaced by that of a noon day sky. Taken back by this rather sudden and impossible change he grabbed for his sword incase he would have need of it soon. But when he reached down to where he carried his sword, he found that it was not there. Now that he was paying closer attention he noticed he did not have his armor on either. Alarm shot through him when all of a sudden he heard a voice on the wind. <br>
<br>
“Seldrin.” the voice called out in what seemed like a raspy whisper. He quickly looked about to find the source of the voice but failed. <br>
<br>
“Who’s there?!” Seldrin shouted trying to contain his sudden rush of alarm and fear of the unseen presence that he could feel all to well now. <br>
<br>
“Seldrin.” the voice called out again raspy as before but slightly louder now. It seemed to be coming from all around him. The voice started to echo his name all around him now and then it said, “Why do you continue to suppress me?” <br>
<br>
“I am suppressing no one. Show yourself so we might talk and sort this out.” Seldrin stated trying to figure out what the voice was talking about. He looked about desperately to try and ascertain where the voice was coming from when suddenly in the distance he saw some rocks and a lone figure standing on top of them. <br>
<br>
He tried hard to see the figure but even with his enhanced elven sight he couldn’t discern the figure on the rocks. <br>
<br>
All of a sudden the ship came to an abrupt and violent halt that sent the elf stumbling towards the deck. Only because of his combat training and his dexterous nature that was true to elves did he save himself from falling over the side. <br>
<br>
He stood up and fixed his tunic that had been jostled out of place when he took his fall. He looked out and could still see the rocks ahead but there was now a red light emanating from the figure and as quickly as the ship stopped the red light pulsed out in a blinding flash and flooded all around him. <br>
<br>
Then the world went dark and the last thing he heard before he faded out was, &quot;Know thyself as your first challenge approaches. <br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> * * * </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Seldrin awoke violently in a puddle of sweat. Was that just a dream? He thought desperately trying to gain his bearings. It felt too real to be just a dream he thought as he searched the room in which he had been sleeping restlessly. He found all his gear in the corner between the wall and the bed. He checked through his packs and inventoried all his gear. It was all accounted for. He looked out his window that was overlooking the market place of North Freeport. The sun was still below the horizon though it was threatening the night sky, as it was about to break free of the horizon that had imprisoned it all night long. Seldrin walked to the water closet and cleaned the sweat that had accumulated over night off of his body. <br>
<br>
Seldrin was quite muscular for an elf and indeed by many other races standards too. But that was his payment for years of hard work training with the dwarven paladins while studying under them to learn more about the beer swilling stout folk. They were indeed a noble and admirable race. Despite all the racial tensions between the elves and the dwarves Seldrin had determined to try and understand the dwarves rather than just stereotype them away. Indeed the experience was much more beneficial for him than the added strength and endurance they taught him for he gained many friends such as the dwarven cleric Hvyarms Steelfists. As well as the dwarven warriors Thurgaard Flintknees and Korhal Proudmoore just to name a few. <br>
<br>
He gathered his clothes and armor and began to put it on. Seldrin took his time to make sure that every strap was properly and securely fastened. After about twenty minutes he finally finished donning his armor looking in the mirror to make sure he had not missed any straps or belts. When he was satisfied that he got everything, he grabbed his main pack and tossed all the smaller packs into the larger one. Then slung the sack over his shoulder and headed out the door and down the steps and left the inn, not before paying the inn keeper handsomely for his agreeable accommodations. <br>
<br>
After he left the inn he headed for West Freeport. The bards, clerics, and paladins mainly ran North Freeport; it was their little sanctuary from the rougher parts of Freeport. East and West Freeport were under control of the Freeport militia, which was under the leadership of the former paladin Sir Lucan Dlere. Some speculate that it was the absolute power of being the single authority figure in charge of Freeport the largest city in most of Norrath and the center hub of all life on in the civilized world that corrupted him. Others say that it was dark magic by the mysterious dark elves of Nektulos Forest that corrupted the former glorious paladin hero. Either way Sir Lucan was not the just and good man he once was. <br>
<br>
Paladins were not very welcomed in East and West Freeport. As a matter of fact they were liked even less than some of the evil races of the world. So as Seldrin walked through West Freeport he made sure to keep one hand on the hilt of his sword and one eye on every militia soldier he walked by. They in kind did the same though they tossed insults as he walked passed them. He paid them no heed though because he couldn’t afford to lose his temper here. While it was quite true he was fairly well capable of defending himself. He wasn’t near the level of the militia officers that walked by. <br>
<br>
As he walked out the west gate of Freeport and into the Commonlands he let go of the breath he did not know he was holding on to. Freeport made him nervous and rightly so. If it weren’t for the fact that it was the center of travel in the world he would probably never go there without friends. <br>
<br>
Seldrin made his way through the Commonlands trying to avoid the militia that patrolled the lands even though he could, quite frankly, handle them he didn’t need any needless attention. <br>
<br>
While he was walking he started to walk past Nektulos Forrest and a thought entered into his mind. He could go and cleanse the world of a few more darkies. He then proceeded to make his way through the dark mysterious forest that was home to the dark elves. <br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> * * * </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
He made his way to the bridge over the river that ran through Nektulos almost too quietly. He never cared for this place. It always gave him an uneasy feeling. He could now see the dark elf guards guarding the bridge. He made his way closer to the bridge ever so silently trying not to alert the guards of his presence. There were four guards, too many for him to take on all at once. If he shot an arrow at one, two of them would come after him while the other two would stay back and guard the bridge. It was risky taking on two at a time but he thought if he could get it down to the last two he could get one at a time at least. <br>
<br>
With that he took out his ashenwood bow that he himself had crafted out of the finest ash wood he could find. Took an arrow from the beautifully tailored quiver that Kenja Swiftarrow herself had given him as a token of their friendship. Knocked the arrow in the bow, and in a silent, slow motion he drew the string taunt has much as he could, took aim, and when he knew he had a good shot, fired. <br>
<br>
As the arrow flew through the air, the swift silent missile hit its mark so well that not only were the guards surprised but also Seldrin himself was stunned into silence. One of the guards just stood there while the other three looked at him in fear and terror as the guard had just been shot right in the head and the arrow was sticking straight out. <br>
<br>
The guards searched about frantically trying to figure out what to do and who was responsible for their comrade’s sudden death. One of the guards spotted Seldrin in his hiding spot by some plant life. Seldrin quickly dropped his bow and unsheathed his sword. The sword came out of the sheath has silently and fluidly as the arrow had flown through the air. <br>
<br>
The clang of metal on metal rang loudly as the two opponents entered melee. The guard lunged at Seldrin with his sword and Seldrin parried and riposted with a blow of his own. It caught the guard on the shoulder blood came pouring out. <br>
<br>
The guard then took a step back, saw the blood running down his arm and charged Seldrin again with a loud primal yell. He caught Seldrin off guard and hit him the leg but Seldrin didn’t not seem to lose a beat because while the guard had landed a blow on his leg Seldrin had been given a great opportunity and shoved his blade right through the dark elf’s back. <br>
<br>
The guard fell to the ground with as much of a thud as his light build would give out. Seldrin went back to the bridge only to find the other two guards already dead and a dwarf sitting on a pony. He looked back at Seldrin as he heard the clang of metal running towards him. When he saw Seldrin a wide smile started to creep its way across his stout dwarven face. <br>
<br>
“Seld, m’lad. How yah be?” the dwarf asked as he got down off the pony. <br>
<br>
“Hvyarms my old friend. I am well. What brings you to Nektulos? It’s not exactly a dwarven vacation spot my friend.” Seldrin replied returning the grin to his old friend. <br>
<br>
“Nor a high elven one either my friend. I was just helpin’ a friend o’ mine. He’s also a dwarven cleric of Brell, but he is a little wet behind the ears if yah catch my meanin’.” Hvyarms said with a little bit of a grunt. <br>
<br>
All of a sudden another dwarf came running up to Hvyarms. “Hey, Hvy!” he shouted as he continued to draw near. When he arrived Seldrin saw that the dwarf was deeply winded by the little run. <br>
<br>
“Hail!” he said when he reached Seldrin and Hvyarms. “My name is Anders Loyalman. Hvy is my brother. You must be Seldrin. I’ve heard a lot about you my friend. I’m looking forward to adventuring with you.” <br>
<br>
“Well met Anders. Yes indeed I am Seldrin though I’m not sure there is much to know about me.” Seldrin looked up at Hvyarms with a quizzical look. Then looked back at Anders. “Will you excuse us for a moment?” <br>
<br>
“Sure not a problem. I’ll just wait here and make sure that those who come to replace the guards don’t go off and alert the rest of the darkies.” he replied as he sat down by the bridge. <br>
<br>
The two walked a ways off so that Anders could not hear their conversation. When he was satisfied they’d walked far enough, Seldrin stopped and looked at Hvyarms as if waiting for an answer to his unasked question. <br>
<br>
“I need yah ta guide him, Seld. He is still young and rather inexperienced. I’ve helped him as much as I can but there is only so much that I can do.” Hvyarms stated as he pleaded his case to Seldrin. “Besides, I’ve been thinkin’ yah owe me one.” <br>
<br>
Seldrin sighed, as he knew Hvyarms had a point. Back when Seldrin went to go train with the dwarves, Hvyarms vouched for Seldrin and promised to be responsible for him. Dwarves don’t teach their secrets to just anyone. They have to be careful to whom they share their training with. Since then Hvyarms and Seldrin have come to the point of being almost brothers. In fact there were times that Hvyarms viewed Seldrin as more of a brother than even Anders, his own flesh and blood. <br>
<br>
“Alright my old friend I’ll watch after him. Though I am no babysitter so if he does something to endanger himself or anyone else around us I’m sending him back to Kaladim.” he replied with a distasteful look on his face. <br>
<br>
“Thank yah Seld. Tis means a lot ta me.” Hvyarms said with a big grin that showed all his yellow teeth. <br>
<br>
They headed back over to Anders and they said their respective good byes. Seldrin looked Anders over once, twice, even a third time to try and get an impression of him. The dwarf actually seemed rather clean by dwarf standards. His shoulder long blonde hair was combed neatly. Even his beard was neat and trimmed. What a rather odd dwarf Seldrin thought to himself barely containing a smile. <br>
<br>
As Hvyarms got on his brown little pony and started to ride off Anders began to shout to his brother, “Bye, Hvy! Thanks fer everythin’! Just wait till you see me next I’ll be almost as powerful as you!” And then Hvyarms disappeared into the darkness of Nektulos Forrest, and the two new companions were all alone. <br>
<br>
“Well Anders let’s get going then.” Seldrin said as he tossed his pack back over his shoulder and sheathed his sword. Then looked around at the dim forest all around them. “I’d like to get out of this blasted forest before dark.” <br>
<br>
Anders looked up at him and said, “You mean this is day time in this forest?” <br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> * * * </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
They had been walking through he forest for the past five hours. Seldrin had spent the entire time in silence thinking about his new found “friend” and companion. Anders however talked the entire time and what was worse it seemed that he talked about nothing at all during those five hours of talking. Seldrin started to wonder how much longer it would take for his mouth to dry up from constantly being open or if Seldrin would go into a rage and kill him long before then. <br>
<br>
“...and then I said five gold pieces for an hour?! Ye don’t even have a beard! So I took my drink and...” his voice trailed off. A few moments passed in silence and Seldrin thought he was in luck that the dwarf was finally done talking but his hope quickly faded as the dwarf started up again this time with a question. “Umm, where are we going Seld?” <br>
<br>
Seldrin was about to answer when all of a sudden a strange sensation passed through his body. He could “feel” a presence that was not there before. He stopped in his tracks and grabbed hold of the hilt of his sword and indicated to Anders to get ready as well. <br>
<br>
Anders seemed to finally shut up for good now, and got a better grip on his shield and mace. They stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity to Anders. <br>
<br>
“Hah! Seldrin Winglessangel, you obviously are much more attuned to your surroundings and magic than most would believe a paladin capable of.” came a voice from what seemed like all around them. Seldrin uncomfortable that the voice knew his name pulled his sword from its sheath and held it in a defensive stance. Anders followed suit though he was practically able to hide completely under his shield he made it a point not to show too much cowardice. A point for the young cleric Seldrin thought. <br>
<br>
“There is no need for your weapons. Please put them aside as they make me uncomfortable,” the voice said calmly. <br>
<br>
“If there is no need for weapons why hide? Why not show yourself.” Seldrin replied assertively. If he was afraid he was doing a good job of covering it up. <br>
<br>
“Because I’m afraid you, my friend, would not like my appearance as you have proven on more than one occasion to others. But do believe me that I am not here to harm you my friend simply to help you unlearn many lies you’ve no doubt have heard over your long life time and help you embrace the truth.” came the voice’s response. “For example you may or may not knowingly do it. But you serve the dark lord of hate.” <br>
<br>
Enraged by this grievous insult, Seldrin spun a few lines of curses in elvish to the voice. “A shame you don’t have the courage to say that to my face instead of hiding like a spineless dark elf.” <br>
<br>
Unfazed by why Seldrin just said the voice continued, “See it is exactly that type of attitude that has you in this position right now. As a show of good faith I’ll will show myself to you.” A figure appeared. It was blurry at first but then seemed to come into focus in a matter of seconds. He was roughly the same build as a dark elf only slightly taller and a bit paler. “Now tell me Seldrin what is your first reaction to me and what would you do if you just saw me walk up to you like this. <br>
<br>
Seldrin glared at the dark elf then started to look him over. He wore a black cloak with a black robe. “I would have attacked and killed you.” Seldrin finally replied. <br>
<br>
“And why would you have done that. I am unarmed and have not done anything to hurt you or anyone around you. Nor have I hurled any insults at you. Quite frankly I have done nothing in my life to warrant an attack from you. Yet you would have attacked and killed me simply on sight due to the fact that I am a dark elf?!” the dark elf responded as he approached the two although making sure there was a good distance between them. <br>
<br>
Seldrin for his part started to understand what the elf was getting at though his pride refused to admit it. “Because of the sins of your people. You all deserve to die.” <br>
<br>
The dark elf seemed surprisingly amused by the paladin’s answer. “Because you HATE us! And every time you kill out of hate and the longer you hate the more power you give to the dark lord. He thrives on that hate. It is his life force.” <br>
<br>
They stood there for a few moments in silence while Seldrin mulled over in his head what the elf had just said. He didn’t want it to make sense, this was a dark elf, he must be trying to deceive him. <br>
<br>
As if reading his mind the dark elf sat on a near by rock and started to talk again. “Seldrin, you have been taught your entire life to hate dark elves and the dark elves have been taught their entire life to hate all other elves. Quite a situation wouldn’t you say? Two sides that live rather long lives that hate each other with the whole of their being. Doesn’t that sound like a great power supply to the dark lord of hate?” The dark elf paused giving Seldrin time to digest what he just told him, then continued, “Seldrin what do you know about your father?” <br>
<br>
Seldrin who had been debating quietly with himself in his head abruptly looked up and replied, “Nothing other than he was killed by the dark elves.” <br>
<br>
The dark elf nodded and continued, “Yes he was. You were taught growing up that all dark elves worship Innoruuk and that we all hate. Well that isn’t exactly true. There are those of us that reject the dark lord of hate and his hateful ways. I do as well though in secret for I use his powers towards a greater good. You and I are not so dissimilar. We share a common heritage, my father was a high elf and my mother was a dark elf enchantress. She in secret worshiped Tunare and hid it from all other dark elves for fear of punishment. When she was discovered she gave me to her sister to be raised in the ways other than of hate.” He turned his gaze down to the ground as he said, “I have been determined ever since to put a stop to the hateful ways of our race and to embrace the light as my mother and aunt had. As I have. <br>
<br>
Anders walked forward and pulled from his sack a small jug and offered it to the dark elf, “Here my friend try some of this. Might help ease the pain of bad memories.” <br>
<br>
The dark elf declined and then stood up again. He looked straight at Seldrin with a determined look in his eyes. “You must uncover the veil that is covering your past and you must get passed the hate in your heart and learn to love and pity and be merciful. Or else you shall be doomed to a fate far worse than death.” <br>
<br>
And with that the dark elf disappeared. The two stood there for a few more moments in silence then Seldrin sheathed his sword, turned to Anders and said, “Let’s move.” <br>
<br>
“Where we goin’?” Anders asked in vain multiple times and finally gave up. He did a prayer to Brell to watch over the two of them and protect them from evil. <br>
<br>
They did not make it very far before they were stopped by some rather unfriendly looking dark elves. Seldrin’s first instinct was to attack first then sort out the rest after that. But something the dark elf had told him gave him pause. For the first time that he can remember he did not bring out his blade but instead began to talk to the trio. <br>
<br>
“May I help you gentlemen?” Seldrin asked making sure not to show any sign of weakness. <br>
<br>
The dark elves were taken back and hesitated now. “Why would you help us? Aren’t you Seldrin? Slayer of Dark Elves?” <br>
<br>
They are afraid of me. He thought, as a small smile gave way on his face. Then he began to say, “I am Seldrin. How can I help you gentlemen?” <br>
<br>
The lead dark elf viewed him skeptically then began, “We are in need of healing. Our friend was badly injured by a bear attack. We thought are luck was about to turn even worse when we ran into you.” <br>
<br>
Seldrin went over to the injured elf and began chanting a small healing spell to get the fallen elf back up on his feet. As the fallen elf regained consciousness he looked up and at the sight of Seldrin backed up a good distance and drew his sword. From the sloppiness of his sword handling he knew that this elf was not very seasoned in combat and would be no challenge at all for him. <br>
<br>
Anders came forth and began to cast protective spells over the entire group and gave them his blessing of good luck. As Anders finished casting his last spell the group looked at each other in disbelief and turned around and ran as if to get away before the duo changed their minds and decided to have at the young adventurers. They shouted thanks as they ran away into the darkness. Seldrin looked over at Anders half in a daze at what had just happened. <br>
<br>
“This is the first time I’ve met a dark elf that I had the power to kill and did not. Not only that, I healed them and gave them protective magic.” Seldrin said to Anders still in total disbelief. <br>
<br>
Then somewhere in the back of his mind Seldrin heard that voice from his dream again. “The first challenge has been completed.” <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/hero/seldrinwinglessangel" target="top"> Seldrin Winglessangel </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=382499" target="top">  Level 53 High Elf Cavalier of Tunare </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.primalevolution.com/" target="top"> Chaotic Evolution </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;"> Anders Loyalman - Level 53 Dwarven Cleric of Brell Serilis </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> Homeless Drunkard of Morell-Thule </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;"> *On temporary additional duty to the United States Navy* </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Date Nolite Rogare </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - &quot;Give, be unwilling to ask.&quot; </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.navy.mil" target="top"> The World's Finest Navy </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"> - US Navy - </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.navy.com" target="top"> Want to be a feared sailor?
