Things weren't going too well. I feared I had taken my last jibe at Aryllyian, his little 'trick' which had ruined my armour the previous week had certainly taught me a lesson.<br>
<br>
As I passed Freeport's most famous tavern, I heard laughter and singing coming from behind the doors. I went in to find that several large Trolls were there, sneering at each other, and boasting about how they had snuck in without the guards seeing them. The innkeep said he had been paid off handsomely so that the Trolls could drink in his Tavern for one night, and I was angry. I had a good mind to fetch one of the guards from the gate and ensure the Trolls were dispatched, but I didn't. I remembered a comment one had made once about their drinking habits, how they could easily sink a bottle of Brandy and stand to tell the tale. I decided to see if they could actually live up to their word...<br>
<br>
Having ordered a few bottles of Kalish, I started muttering (quite loudly and deliberately) to the barman that the Trolls were no better than the scummy homes they came from. Ensuring they overheard me, I wandered past as if to exit, still clutching my Kalish tightly, when one of them grabbed me by the tatterd cloth covering my chest (I hadn't had the inclination as yet to even think about replacing the BP Ary had ruined). I stopped, and turned slowly to face the big fat uglies.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon me, sah,&quot; I said, in my best &quot;I'm better-than-you-Trolls&quot; accent, &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot; The louder (and fatter, although they were all easily four times bigger than I) of the bunch, spoke up. &quot;We is 'ere to drink the beer, the beer which you cant 'andle, init&quot;. I watched as he downed a Brandy in one, not so much as flinching as he did so. &quot;Proov you are wervy to liv, and we will let yoo go, init&quot; I wondered why I should, since of course I could have them killed with a simple shout to the patrolling guards outside. But then I realised what a perfect oppurtunity this would be to show them up. Little did they know what kind of a reputation I had for drinking. Why, only my closest friends knew that I had slipped into a routine of a 5 hour tavern crawl every night. I was well used to supping until well past the midnight hour.<br>
<br>
30 seconds later, the scene was set: me vs. Oggomukka (weird name, I thought, but then who names their son Bwah? My parents naver gave an explanation for that...) We were sat down, facing one another, with 20 shots of the Tavern's most potent substance. The rules were simple, whoever fell down first was to be ejected from the tavern, never to be seen there again.<br>
<br>
I smiled as we started downing the shots one by one. I admit after the sixth one I did feel slightly bad, but not because of the drink, it was because of the ugly Troll whose face had turned blue. How could he know I was the only Elf who had ever drunk this particular drink, and thus was also the only one who was at least partially immune to its effects? We carried on for 20 minutes longer, each of us taking it more slowly. We had got to the 17th drink when Oggomukka finally collapsed to the sounds of cheering for the Elf. A crowd had gathered by then, and were more than happy to see to it that Oggomukka and his companions left the establishment by the door they came in at.<br>
<br>
An hour later, I was still sitting by myself, eating a snack of Berry Pie, when I saw a familiar figure sneak out of the door. Had she been here all this time? Watching? Who knows. I had heard about Slaini's habit, but also that no one had ever seen her, until now that is. The day I finally proved to myself that I was the best, and couldn't get any better.<br>
<br>
I raise my glass to the Barkeep, and say in a whispered voice, 'To a new beginning'.<br>
<br>
