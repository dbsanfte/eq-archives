I have worked hard and developed my skillks to 55th level, with 5 AA points.  I have defeated the BG and been rewarded with one piece of my epic.  Without a doubt, most of my xp since level 47 has been solo.  Like some others, I would prefer to group for xp since quadding can get quite boring.<br>
<br>
Since I started in the tier 1 planes, getting a group outside of my guildies is, needless to say, quite difficult.  I am said to say I have been focusing on developing my enchanter ever since (slowers always being in such high demand).<br>
<br>
I won't add to the rants on class balance - the issues are quite well known.  What concerns me most now is the xp changes coming on wednesday.  My last opportunity to level up, solo quadding, could be threatened.  I say &quot;could be&quot; because I am not sure.  I fully intend to do some testing this week in CS quadding wyverns for AA - and compare the results before and after Wednesday's patch.<br>
<br>
If my worst fears are realized, then I think we should take a stand.  Pending the outcome of solo testing, and group availability after the patch, I may suggest we establish &quot;A Day Without Wizards&quot;.<br>
<br>
Simply put, it would be a day of our chosing when wizards across Norrath, Luclin, and the planes would provide no assistance to other classes - no groups, no TLs, no trips to Hate or Sky.  Perhaps this has been attempted before, perhaps not.<br>
<br>
This is not something I would suggest lightly, since I am seriously comitted to helping others whenever I can.  However, I know not what else we could do to make Verant address the many issues already present in this forum.<br>
<br>
I am curious what other Wizards think about this.  Can we unite if only for a single day?<br>

For several reasons:<br>
1. People like me, who don't agree with you.<br>
2. Guilded Wizards who don't want to abandon their friends/guildmates on raids.<br>
3.

<br>
It might be a better idea to get a petition going, perhaps with a list of suggestions for improvements, and forward that to the developers at SOE. it worked for the Druids! ( Yea, I know, we aren't the favored class they are, but hey, it might work for us, too. )<br>
<br>
Also, don't expect much support from most of the folks on this forum. There is a clear separation here between Wizards who are casual players in average guilds with the average equipment that they can aquire under those circumstances and the players who are in or have been in the uber guilds, and have aquired the uber gear to match.<br>
<br>
The Well equipped/guilded folks don't seem to have any idea of the problems that exist for the rest of us, as their gear allows them to solo mobs that the average wizard can't, and their guilds allow them to get groups much easier.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the average wizard seems to be in the minority here. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=annoid>Annoid</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/10/03 5:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7241<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 7:52 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards of Norrath UNITE!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, don't expect much support from most of the folks on this forum.

Still upset I see.  No, there is a clear separation between those who feel Wizards are fine and those who feel Wizards are broke.  Many casual, part time, regular all-around Wizards feel they are fine.<br>

Actually you'll fine the 64+ Wizard is in the minority here, let alone the &quot;uber&quot; Wizard.  The average 60 or lower crowd has the most claim to this board at the moment.<br>
<br>
Aanoid, if you're going to spread your propaganda please do so without the anti-&quot;uber&quot; bias, ok?  Just as many (if not more) casual, non 65, non-&quot;uber&quot; guild Wizards have told you that you're wrong and we're fine as the &quot;ubers&quot; ones have so don't make it out to look one-sided.  Ok?<br>

I still think you should switch to another class... it's very clear you can't deal with one of the very few downsides of ours. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:xx-small;">Officer of Triton, Member of Team Ice, Povar<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458434" target="top">Rombus, Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5702" target="top">Rommy, Archon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, it would be nice if we got even half these upgrades. However, let's be realistic.

It's painfully clear that they have no intention on helping wizards in any way. In fact, I'd shut up, before you give someone an idea how to hurt us more.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your also a very bitter wizard, since you always attack any wizard that is better then you, claiming that thier uberness makes them short sited. That the game sucks for casual players.<br>
<br>
Guess what, if you want to play it casual, your gonna be stuck right where you. The problem lies with you. You bought a game that requires a lot of time and dedication, which you can't give, and then complain that it doesn't give you what you want. Basically, you want the game to be something it's not. <br>
<br>
And rather then end this now, making it yet another sad attempt by Annoid to play is fiddle of woe, Wizards not porting isn't going to hurt anyone. <br>
<br>
I agree with being united. I agree with presenting ideas and issues to Sony about wizards. But Sony isn't going to respond to threats. Yes, Absor reads message boards. But he only responds to those that he feels are intelligent conversations.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is, that the current Sony staff doesn't see porting as something special anymore. The fact that two classes had the ability to port has always been a thorn in other classes sides. With Luclin came the spires, which weren't done so well. Every 15 minutes they went off. Should have been five, or been like the books, instant. If they had been, then the books might never have been needed.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen and read about EQ2, wizards and druids won't be a teleporting class anymore, because there won't be teleporting as we know it now, this from a recent intervie about EQ2.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Our current view is that the first time a player travels to any given location, they must physically traverse the wilderness (whether that be land or water-travel, or anything in-between). While traveling, they will encounter teleport spires which they can attune themselves to; and once attuned, be able to teleport to any spire they have visited from any other spire. There will also be other methods of long distance travel, but all of them tend to follow this view. This includes personal and group teleport-type spells. We are implementing these in such a way that non-spellcasting classes are not at a disadvantage. Personal travel spells will not be quite as powerful as before, and will mostly be used as more of the evacuation-style travel. (i.e. Short distance travel out of harm's way into safe spots.) We're trying to avoid long distance teleportation that is not centered around the teleport spires; and with this in mind, most teleportation will be from one spire to another or from inside a bad situation to just outside such a situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
So basiclly, half of our abilites are no more in EQ2. In fact, they have been moving that way ever since pop. Hopefully, this doesn't mean Sony plans to cut out half our spells, with nothing to show for it. Hopefully, they are trying to work out something new for wizards. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A> at: 6/10/03 10:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaasiluclin>VaasiLuclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 10:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards of Norrath UNITE!</span><hr size=1> Responses were about what I imagined them to be hehe.<br>
<br>
I like the petition idea.  So far personal /feedback has only netted the result of Druid Damage Shields no longer overwriting Okeil's Levity (which a few patches ago I noticed started to incorporate a 5 pt DS that I'd never noticed before - perhaps I just had it filtered tho).<br>
<br>
Aside from general class perception (which is something that even Verant can't fix), my only gripe about my class at the the moment is in regards to damage.<br>
<br>
Simply, I went from being able to do 1120 dd, down to high 600s to high 700s (with focus item) when I was forced to move away from using IC as primary nuke to Draughts and Lures.  Resists on IC, even in Luclin zones let alone tier 1 planes, are just too high to justify having it memd - unless there's someone in the party maloing.<br>
<br>
I guess like some others on these forums, I don't see the balance when melee damage increases with level and equipment, and wiz damage decreases.<br>
<br>
On another note - I don't have any trouble getting groups when friends and guildies are on.  Its just that if I want to go to a certain place, pickup groups are hard for this class.  Every wizard I've talked with 60 plus has told me it will only get worse as I increase in level.  Point of fact, I recently changed guilds when mine split - to go with those who would have me in groups as opposed to those who seemingly only wanted me on Raids and Epic fights.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are some other classes that I do have genuine simpathy for - especially Rogues.  Though in the case of Rogues, I think its inexperienced players who dont recognize the incredible DPS of the rogue class.<br>
<br>
In Kunark level encounters, the wiz seemed to be the master damage dealers.  Moving into the planes (where a slower is required as opposed to being very nice to have), it seems I am severely outclassed by Mages, Rogues, and Rangers.<br>
<br>
Oh well, enough griping and back to playing.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They said that the EXP modifier will be reduced in PoP zones, and that the exp Bonus will be changed from 2%-20% for groups to 20-80%, and making is so the exp is only devided by 5 even with 6 people in the group.  <br>
<br>
Here is the Quote from the SoE site<br>
<br>
------------------------<br>
 Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus. <br>

<br>
If you're casting 2 draughts for every 1 spell the mage does (for example) you're still doing more damage for less mana than that mage.  You also have ways of reducing your argo (via concussion), which the mage does not have.<br>
<br>
Also, are you comparing yourself to equally equiped and AA'd other classes?  It's just that if you're comparing yourself to another class that has say 30+ AAs and you have none then it's really isn't a fair comparism.<br>
<br>
I've had a magician out damage me in a PoP group, he was also 65 with close to FT 15, and a ton of AA points.  I had like 6 AA points and FT 1 and was like level 61 at the time.

My L56 Wizard friend still makes a ton of cash off of porting.  Do you know how many people don't like being restricted simply to cities?  There are tons of them.

Yes, it is difficult to get a group outside your circle of friends.  This is true of most classes generally with a few notable exceptions which are always in demand.  People are scared of players they don't know, and wizards in particular because a wizard who is not a skilled grouper is a detriment to the group, and since most wizards solo exclusively, they never developed a grouping strategy.  You have to group with your friends and guildies.  That's what we all do!  If that circle is too small, set about making more friends.  The basic flaw in EQ's structure (too many classes competing for too few group slots) will never be fixed.  You have to come to terms with that and learn to work around it or you will never be satisfied with your class.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What concerns me most now is the xp changes coming on wednesday. My last opportunity to level up, solo quadding, could be threatened. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You will still be able to quad.  No one is removing your AEs from your spell book.  Worst case scenario, it may be slower than it was.  But frankly, the rate at which we can solo has always given us an unfair advantage imo.  I quadded only for a brief time when i was applying to my guild and they told me to hurry up and level.  I went from 54 to 59 in a couple of weeks, back when hell levels were still in place.  Compared to the &quot;normal&quot; progression rate, i rocketed through what were supposed to be the slowest levels in the game.  Pretty unfair to those classes that can't quad.  Not only that, but this is a massively muliplayer game.  The reward for being an anti-social soloer should have NEVER outweighed the reward for grouping in the first place.  So maybe you should redirect your energies to expanding your social network so there are lots of people who know you, who you can group with for fun and phat xp!  Hey you said it yourself, quadding is boring.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Simply put, it would be a day of our chosing when wizards across Norrath, Luclin, and the planes would provide no assistance to other classes - no groups, no TLs, no trips to Hate or Sky. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Um... no.  First off, i think these changes are a good thing, since grouping should provide a greater benefit than soloing, from a pure game structure standpoint.  Secondly, i rarely port anymore at all.  In fact i can't even recall when the last time i got a random tell requesting a port/TL.  So even if i pouted and refused to port it would have no effect.  Not to mention making our entire class look like a bunch of whiney crybabies... &quot;oooh ooooh waaahhh my uber quad xp has been slightly lessened, no port for you!&quot;<br>

The biggest is not always the bestest you know!  I have access to Agnarr's, to Strike of Solusek, maxed FT, permanent focuses and in many situations, i prefer draughts for their low aggro, high efficiency, lower resists, fast cast, and fast recast.  Draughts are an upgrade to IC.  IC is a novelty spell in today's game.  Now, do i think that the pre 60 draughts should have scaled up more?  Absolutely.  But now that there are post 60 draughts, it really isn't possible without rebalancing our spellbooks.  It ain't gonna happen.  The level you are at makes you feel underpowered.  I can sympathise, i remember feeling that way at that level.  The answer remains the same as it always has : level up.  Level up and get access to better spells, level up to give your guild better firepower to take down tougher mobs for better gear upgrades.<br>

The draughts do less DD in single chunk, but your overall DPS goes up when you use them.  Bust out your calculator and factor in resists, cast times, and recast.  And you can't seriously think that your damage will decrease as you level and gain better gear, don't be ridiculous. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sillyjanine.com/mybases.html"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.cestusdei.org/uploads/images/luxysig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3516<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 1:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards of Norrath UNITE!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Simply, I went from being able to do 1120 dd, down to high 600s to high 700s (with focus item) when I was forced to move away from using IC as primary nuke to Draughts and Lures. <br>

You are not realizing something other classes have learned. Bigger is not always better, you need to factor in everything before you can make the conclusions you do. For instance, at one time, the best melee weapon in the game had a damage of 3. And it got nerfed because it was too good. The Draughts do not have as big of damage, but you can hit with them more often and cost less to cast. In reality that means your overall damage went up. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It was never my main source of income. I never ever sat around shouting I was porting for donations. If I saw a shout asking for a port for pay, and I was free, I took it. And I never asked for a certain amount, I always said whatever you feel is fair. Sometimes it was 10, and once 200plat. <br>
<br>
I still get tells asking for ports from people that don't have PoP and don't want to wait for the spires. <br>
<br>
And yes, it's annoying to think that half our spells are basically for ourselves, but guess what? I completely understand why they did it. Traveling was the biggest time sink in the game. You would waste so much time getting some where, and more then likely, you would die, and have to run all over again. I remember these days. Sure, I enjoyed my first run from Freeport to Qeynos at level 14. Even the next few. Um, then, it got kinda boring. <br>

<br>
Those 10 levels were supposed to only grant the equivilent power progression of 1 level.  This was stated over and over again by VI.  This was why the xp was so horrid for those levels--they were AA version 1.0 ...<br>
<br>
So draughts came in as an upgrade to our existing mainline spells of the time: Conflaguration and Rend.  Ice Comet was a special research spell, and intended to stay right where it was in the hierarchy of damage-- #1.  Compared to Conflaguration and Rend, Draughts rock the friggin house.<br>
<br>
Of course, this should have been reviewed as Vellious and the Luclin came about.  Melee power doubled, then doubled again with superior armor and weapons of Kunark and Vellious-- those 10 levels became real levels to the melee, but still saw little in the way of upgrade to casters. Luclin at last added some gear upgrades for casters, but even today it remains more of a good idea than it does an implemented feature.  Focus items pre-PoP are a joke, most being far to difficult to obtain for their intended level.<br>
<br>
I still feel that they should rebalance level 51-59 by moving a few of the big nukes down to fill in the gaps.  Leave Ice Comet at 49 as big ice, Move sunstrike down to 53ish for Big fire, move Elnericks down to 57 for big magic, and start over with Big fire at 60 with Garrison's, and Ice with Ice Spear.  61 could use a big Ice nuke--possibly a bolt a'la level 1 Frost bolt, with the same stats as Firebolt of Talon off a vendor, thus ending that debate once and for all, and making the 61 wizard a very competitive player in the DPS classes, and improving the perception of wizards all around by providing them with the spells appropriate to the difficulty of the hunting zones in the mid 50's. <p><br>
