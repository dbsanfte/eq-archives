You can disagree. My experience from having actually fought all of them is pretty much the opposite, those types of mobs are a minority. You are also mistaken about casters being able to avoid all AE. Again, this is from actual experience, not from some list I read somewhere.<br>

First, there are very, very few mobs that melee suffers badly against.<br>
<br>

I remember before flappy and focus and such and I was a  happy cause I could BOOM.... then focus and flappy and such came and I was happy that I could BOOM BOOM.<br>
<br>
Do we have problems?  yah.... we do need bigger booms.  You like using draughts?  I do too... so use em.  BUT we should have the option of the big boom always.<br>
<br>
So while I dont agree with much of the post... <br>
<br>
(Lord, am I getting Uber???  Do I need to grovel and apologize to Rom for constantly giving him crap??!??!?  AM I... THE MAN now?!?!?!?? AAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!)  <br>
<br>
...I will say that wizards should have bigger less effecient booms to use in emergency burn downs (DRN - die right now, I like it) or just cause we enjoy BIG BOOMS.  Its why I sarted a wizzy.  Am I happy now?  Reasonably, but I think mana regen rate should improve (sheesh... no AA please just do it) in general also.<br>
<br>
So increase mana regen a bit (to help those less AA/phat loot rich folks) and increased DRN via some bigger messy less effecient and high agro nuke additions.<br>
<br>
Note: HIGH AGRO Its your ass if ya use em wrong, but it should be your call as a wizard (MASTER OF FAST MAGICAL DAMAGE!!!) to do so.<br>
<br>
Heh... I'll probably use draughts still.. but the option for a megabig-high-critting blast at the dangerous end of a mobs life should be there.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Ps Goladus... Pets arent only defensive.  Not wanting a debate, just pointing that out. <br>

While I would love to see nothing more than increasing our regen, I do not see it happening.  Why would they give you an intrinsically higher regen when they can make you play much longer by *not* giving it to you?<br>

Rather severely.<br>
You can argue that it's perception of other players that we don't have have anything to contribute to to grps till you're blue in the face, but the bottom line is that that is how we are perceived, and in many cases, it's the truth. We don't offer anything a current Planes grp <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NEEDS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, such as healing, slowing, crowd control, brain candy, etc. We certainly can't take down a PoP level mob fast enough to make us # 1 on the hit parade. With the mob slowed, the melee just has to whack on it a little longer.<br>
<br>
And this goes even stronger for those wizards, like myself, who aren't in the big guilds, and therefore have little or no access to better gear/spells. Last time I even saw Sunstrike in Bazaar on Quellious, it was priced at 100k. And that's only the second time I've seen it offered. SOE won't even give us the tools appropriate to our levels. Why would grps want  us?<br>
<br>
I'm writing this after a day where I spent 6+ hours, LFG and trying in vain to start one in various PoP 1st tier zones (don't even bother trying the 2nd tier) and all I had to show for my time was a lousy 3% of an AA point. And this is by no means abnormal. I can log my cleric or chanter on, and if I have to wait 15 min. before getting into a grp, it's rare. You want to tell me again how we're not broken?<br>

When played correctly they out damage any class, at any level, in any type of fight.  The key word, played correctly.  Do a who all wizard 60 while in the game.  Gather them all up, put them in a arena and compare.  There will be such a vast capability in abilities to deliever damage it will be mind boggling.<br>
<br>
Zuratuli and I had some long debates on the fact that the level 59 and 60 wizzy spells should not be harder to get then the 61 thru 65.  My argument was that in the old school, 60 was the end game, so it was right that the 59 and 60 spells dropped off of the end game critters.  The problem I felt was once PoP came out, the old school mobs were not hunted as much so therefore no more spells on the market.  After listening to Zuratuli's reasoning, and thinking about it, I'm ok with it.  If the Wizards all had everything handed to them, we all would be just alike.  The Wizard I feel is the most individualistic class there is.  In the sence that the name of that wizard is truely known, as either being a great wizard, a so so wizard or one that truely suks.<br>
<br>
If they give us something better, i will be first in line to get it.  I truely hope they continue to make our class the hardest class out there.  Make each and every thing we do a long fight.  It keeps our class known by name, not just another good warrior.  Its cool when a group will say <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Yes, get Gandalf, he is a great Wizard, but don't let him bring that bumbling side kick Zuratuli, he is always breaking mezzes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Hehe, had to throw that in Zuratuli :cheers <br>
<br>
Nope, I'm staying at level 60 for a while, to be able to max out my AA's quickly and then move on.  I'm the leader of a small guild of good friends, so I still only have about 3 of my 59 and 60 spells, but i make do.  I go on raids with others and keep my eye open for spells when doing the AE groups in OS.  The items and spells I do have, keep me productive in groups, for i wear, or use them with alot of pride knowing how hard it was to get them.<br>
<br>
If it was up to a vote, I would vote to keep it the same.  If they want to add some higher DD nukes, I would say sure, make them even harder to get then what we have now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>P.S.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I think that each server should have only 5 of these.  A flying Dragon Steed for Wizard Class only.  Non Lore, non no drop, min level 65 to use.  And if the owner deleats his toon, it respawns back to the hardest critter to kill to date. O yea, and while I'm day dreaming, make it a level 60 fighting pet, with fire nukes from his mouth,  dual wield, two legged kicks and with a tail strike.  O but wait, then all the level 1 thru 64 wizards would claim foul, that they all should be able to buy one at their trainers spell venders.<br>

A good mana manager, consistantly dealing out the damage, the groups will pick up. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the melee just has to whack on it a little longer<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The quicker the mob goes down,the faster the pulls can come.  Won't seem much for the 30 minute group, but when you score a good goup, with a whole Saturday to burn, it will mean alot more exp for all. <br>
<br>
Try this, go to a zone, put on your LFG tags, send out a OOC, make your new hot buttons, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>/who all cleric LFG</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> make one for each class, start pulling them in.  If you cant get a group going in 15 minutes, then go to plan B, plan B should be 2 to 3 quad kiting areas.  While medding in ur quad area with your LFG tags on, continue to make a group.  If by the end of the day you haven't made a group, then you will have alot more to show for it then just sitting with the lower lip hanging out by the zone in of your favorite zone.  Also, the Wizard that leads the group, organizes it and gets them all togther, is one that other peeps will sence is a aggresive Wizard, with good DPS.  Wizard make good natural leaders, and i will explain why I feel this way.  He is able to sit on that little hill watching the battle.  He has to monitor the flow of the battle, for to nuke to early makes it a pain for the cleric to keep him healed.  He is able to type, for the rest of the group is busy with their duties.  He can throw a stun when the other casters get aggroed.  He needs to be able to evac his group to safety.  Saving the lives of the entire group can rest on his prediction of the battle, for the lesser evac takes 10 seconds to cook off.<br>
<br>
There is so much that the wizard does for a group.  In my previous reply I said that a Wizard is reconized by name, more so then any other class.  In your defence i will say it is truely difficult to achieve the good Wizard name.  Some Wizards will complain that all they do is sit, med, nuke, sit, med, nuke.  Those are the ones that get frustrated with the class.  If thats all you do while in a group, then you will find it hard going.  <br>
<br>
Keep your eyes and ears open while in all groups.  Get familar with all classes and their capabilities.  Once you start to lead groups, and lead them successfully, your group pool will start to grow.  It takes time and patience, as with anything that has to do with being the Wizard.<br>

<br>
I would say that yes, your right, only I would put it like like this:<br>
<br>
Wizards get:<br>
Fire/Ice/Magic <br>
dd, pillars, spirals, rains.<br>
<br>
Magicians get<br>
Fire/magic<br>
dd/rains/dd + dot<br>
<br>
Enchanters get<br>
Magic <br>
dd<br>
<br>
Necromancers<br>
fire/magic/posion<br>
dd/dot<br>
<br>
And so on.<br>
<br>
The thing is, often, most people do not want wizards using thier area based spells. This is where our mana efficancy is. <br>
<br>
Ok, I just randomly picked level 29 for this example. The rain spell is Energy Storm three waves of 96 damage, that's 288 total (let's just assume they all land) for 162 mana. Inferno shock is 250 for 135, and Thunder Strike for 247 for 150. <br>
<br>
If a group pulls 3 mobs, and at least one person is attacking each mob face to face, and you use a rain spell, that's like a DD nuke to both of them for the cost of a little over one. Which means I did 288 damage to three mobs, for 162 mana, rather then 250 damage to each mob for 405 mana. <br>
<br>
So if I cast Energy Storm again, that would be 576 damage to three mobs for 314 mana, rather then 500 damage for 810 mana. Which sounds better. <br>
<br>
What has be come the &quot;norm&quot; is this: everyone attack the same mob. Kill it, move onto the next. Make sure you have an enchanter, to mezz any adds. Recently, I've been playing with some players that don't do it this way. They will split up the mobs between the melees. Once all the mobs are engaged, I can use a rain spell and hit all of them for less mana. The idea that tanks should stand there taking every hit is not the best. All it does is drain the cleric of his mana faster. People say casters slow a party down? HA! I hear more clerics saying LOM and OOM more often. When a cleric is low on mana, it's often ok to sit and rest and med. <br>
<br>
Yes, getting a group that can pull 2-4 mobs and having each person engage them close enough can be hard. But isn't what the lower levels are good for? Finding players you like and learning to work together?<br>
<br>
I've got friends now who say Lets do it your way, pull 3 and take them down with area effect spells. If your group knows how to do this, it will make things so easy. Rather then worry about pulling only one, now you can pull two, and not worry about that.<br>
<br>
So wizards aren't just about fast damage, they are about spreading damage all over the place. The problem isn't so much that wizards are broken, it's that most of the game has been wittled down to Tank, Cleric, Enchanter as the SAFEST way to do things. There are more then one way to play the game. I've been in successful groups that had no cleric. A druid, or shaman and once, just a paladin for healing. And we spent hours taking down mobs. The idea that the cleric should just be pooring his mana into the tanks is silly. First, they have to buff everyone, then we all wait while they med. Then you pull a few and the cleric is OOM. So you wait (but in this case, it's the good kind of waiting, cause it's healing mana) Then a few more pulls. Oh have to rebuff, now med, now fight, OOM. and so on. <br>
<br>
I once had an Ogre warrior tell me in Runnyeye, oh just sit through a few fights and think of it as free Xp. This was rather offensive to me. Then he said, I'll be brutelly honest, I don't care about offensive mana. IE, he liked clerics and enchanters. Cause one would heal him, and the other kept extra mobs off him while he hacked away. I told him, well, you better start caring about this casters offensive mana cause it's gonna be the mana that pulls your butt out of the fire when you over pull and save it with an evac, which I won't be able to do if you never give me a moment to med. Sure enough, he laughed, pulled 5 goblins, and even though I evaced as soon as I saw the bad pull, in the time it took to go off, down he went. Me and my other friend, the cleric, laughed at him behind his back. We also didn't group with him much anymore. <br>
<br>
So wizards, take control and teach the people you group with how to group with a wizard, and show them what you can do! Don't let Norrath push you around! We are the masters of damage!<br>

<br>
The problem is, he's not being unreasonable.  For a warrior, your extra damage is meaningless, you make him no better, no more survivable, no safer than he was without you.  Evacs are a pretty rare thing to cast, and quite honestly if he'd had an enchanter around you wouldn't have NEEDED to evac.  That just proved his point.  Lower level damage casters, especially Wizards, just don't fit in the game very well because twinking makes melee characters nearly invulnerable to damage - assuming they can get some heals and haste.  Focus items are supposed to help some but they don't really matter very much in the long term, they just help casters keep up in damage output and not run out of mana quite so fast.<br>
<br>
There's no question there will be times you'll be useful, but there's no question that the majority of the time you're not only easily replacable, you are flat out extraneous.  Playing melee enough gives you a totally different perspective on all this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/3/03 2:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: funny ogres</span><hr size=1> Grimstaff, I do play melees, but I play my wizard more. But I don't entirely agree with your assement. Saying an enchanter would have saved the ogre at lower levels is not entirely true. Four mobs to mezz at that level is a lot for and enchanter to keep calm. All it would have taken was one resist to get a mob on him. It's always said the enchanter is the first to die, since their spells are such high aggro. <br>
<br>
If the enchanter dies on an over pull, then the ogre is still dead, and so is the cleric, since now there is no evac. Enchanters are not full proof. Mezzes can be resisted.<br>
<br>
Yes the Ogre can chop through mob after mob, all the while draining the cleric of mana. A wizard can shorten the length of any battle. Shorter battles mean less damage to the melee, which means less healing.<br>
<br>
What I often found, at the lower levels is that the many melees couldn't deal out damage faster then they were taking it. Mostly because they weren't twinked. Or if they were twinked, it was in a way that made it to easy to get XP fast, Like buying some weapon that did great damage but was very slow, and they didn't have any haste item. So their skills weren't maxed, so they weren't hitting very much. Nothing is more laughable then a melee that can't hit and you can actually see the mobs HP slowly climbing back up cause of it's natural HP regen, and the Melee saying NUKE IT NUKE IT! <br>
<br>
Melees also think that all the damage comes from them. They have no clue as to what wizards are actually doing unless you crit. They think when the mob suddenly loses over a bubble of health, it was thier crit for 50 damage.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=annoid>Annoid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/3/03 5:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: funny ogres</span><hr size=1> Ok, simple question for those of you making various arguments why Wizards aren't broken.. yada yada yada this, yada yada yada that... and on and on and on...<br>

<br>
The truth is, while Enchanters aren't foolproof, neither is evac, and for every scenario you construct where things could go wrong for an Enchanter, I can come up with one for a Wizard.  What we have to work with is what usually and typically does happen.  You seem to want people to pull, tank, and kill multiples, pointing out truthfully that your AE spells are more powerful and efficient in that situation than single target spells - yet seem to believe that it means instantaneous death to the tank if one creature resists the enchanter?<br>
<br>
Melee are right when they shrug whether a low level Wizard is in a group or not.  It is a flat out bottom line fact that they simply aren't as benefitted by a Wizard as they are a Shaman or Cleric.  If you've played melee you know that well.<br>
<br>
See the argument usually goes (and already is starting to) like this:<br>
A points out Wizards have troubles<br>
B exclaims that THEIR Wizard is fine because they do fine, and you must suck<br>
C notes isolated situations that they did great in<br>
D calls everyone names for disagreeing with their flawless opinion<br>
<br>
The problem is, saying &quot;Wizards need work and aren't as critical as some other classes to a group&quot; is not even remotely beginning to hint that WIzards suck, are broken, that they NEVER are useful and that Wizards add nothing whatsoever to a group.  That's as absurd as the knee-jerk reaction claiming the above is what is being said.<br>
<br>
Lets make it clear: Wizards don't SUCK they aren't BROKEN and they can help a group out.  There will be situations where you are the life-saver and are awesome.  Does everyone read that?  Wizards can help a group.<br>
<br>
But melee are very very correct when they say &quot;not as much as these classes which I'd much rather have around.&quot;  Think about it, as a melee character, which is more useful to you: the guy with heals to keep you alive and buffs to make you kill better, or that guy in the dress that stands up a couple times in a fight and makes sparklies?<br>
 <br>
This is less true as you go up levels and the monsters get absurd hit points and attack power.  But at lower levels, where Wizards have always had some issues, its gotten worse by melee twinking which allows them to pretty much wade through stuff we used to fight hard against in the old days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=annoid>Annoid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/3/03 7:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: perceptions</span><hr size=1> I do agree that a large part of the problem is people's perceptions.

They need to do something to change that perception, even if it's something like simply requiring a wizard to be in the grp for any one in it to get XP.

We get one at level 44 which is almost never more useful than the nuke of that level.  The only real reason to use the DoT is for the 1-foot knockback component.  We also get one in the 50s which is marginally more useful than the level 44 version, but by then I would say my categorization is more accurate, again I was talking 50+.<br>
<br>
I intentionally did not include AE spells.  I wanted to make the point based on single-target nukes alone.. and rains which are often used in place of single target nukes.  But when you include AE spells the variety is even more pronounced.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;mana check&quot; debate...  there are a couple factors to this.  First of all, too often melees do, in fact, underestimate the importance of nuker mana.  For a basic encounter, you can measure the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of each group in terms of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>dps * hitpoints</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Lets take an imaginary group.  <br>
<br>
The tank has 5000 hitpoints.<br>
The tank and melee combine for 150 dps.<br>
The wizard can burst for 300dps.<br>
The mob has 15000hp<br>
The mob deals 75dps against the tank.<br>
The mob power is 1,125k<br>
<br>
To figure out what the tank hp needs to be to win.. IE how much healing you need, we set up the following equation:<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
150<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:x-small;">x</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> = 1,125k
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:x-small;">x</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> = 7500</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
<br>
The tank needs only 2500 extra hitpoints to win, that's one complete heal.  However, you can also look to add damage.<br>
<br>
Assume no complete heals, and this time we solve for damage.<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
5000<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:x-small;">y</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> = 1,125k
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:x-small;">y</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->=225
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
<br>
The wizard only needs to deal 75dps to achieve the exact same thing the cleric achieves with one 2500pt heal.  75dps is WELL within the range of our wizard here.  If you didn't read the math, basically what I am saying is that given a fairly reasonable scenario like the one above, nuker mana can be just as useful as healing mana when it comes to winning a fight.<br>
<br>
The difference is that melees see themselves being healed, and don't always percieve the mob being killed more quickly.  The main advantage of heals are that they are reliable.  Heals <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do their job.  Also, when there is a need for a heal, having a heal there is critical, the consequence is death.  If you run out of damage, you can at least fall back on healing and know it will last.. once healing is gone you know you are at great risk of death.<br>
<br>
But..  The point remains that damage is worth a LOT in terms of winning an encounter, and a damage dealer can replace a lot of cleric mana for a given encounter.  Ignoring damage dealer mana very stupid.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, often it seems to be the case that I don't want the group adjusting itself to my mana.  Sometimes I'm content to be at 5% mana while the cleric is 50%.. I just nuked hard on a fight of my choosing, and now I want to sit back and rest while the melees do their job.  The only reason we've got the mana to keep fighting is because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was nuking hard 5 minutes ago, and I don't mind sitting out now.  If the melees think that I'm getting &quot;free&quot; experience during that time I'm sorry they're wrong, they are getting xp now thanks to ME.  If I hadn't been there they would either be dead or waiting on the cleric to med enough to pull again.  This isn't even getting in to nuking hard on multi-pulls in order to ease the pressure on crowd control.<br>
<br>
When a damage dealer says &quot;lom,&quot; that doesn't mean to hold pulls.  That just means make sure you know I'm low mana.  Don't pull anything more difficult than you and the cleric can handle on your own.  Without cleric mana the group becomes unstable, and I have no problem using cleric mana as the ultimate baseline.  But if you're ignoring my mana altogether then you're just stupid.  So anyway that's what I think of idiot melees who don't pay any attention to nuker mana.<br>
<br>
As for low level balance...<br>
<br>
I have a level 30 ranger twink, and I've taken some small bits of data and I hope to get more.  My initial impressions are that the situation is not as bad as some of you seem to think.  But to look at it in terms of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
A melee twink will be able to lower the DPS portion of a mobs power.  Perhaps even to the point where no additional healing or DPS.  When you don't need any extra healing or dps to win, the only thing to worry about is effeciency, specifically damage per mana.<br>
<br>
If a melee+healer combination can deal a certian amount more damage per mana than a nuker, then the nuker is weaker.<br>
<br>
For example, if a melee can deal 1000 damage for each 200 cleric mana, that's 2.5 damage per mana per person.  A wizard would have to get 2.5 damage per mana in order to be as effecient as the healer*.<br>
<br>
In the above example, there is a warrior and melee combining for 150dps, and a mob dealing 75dps.  Suppose we have a cleric landing complete heals at 25% of the warrior's hp, so every 4000 damage from the mob the cleric spends 400 mana on a heal.  The mob takes about 53 seconds to deal 4000 damage, and during that time the melees can expect to deal 8000 damage.<br>
<br>
8000damage/400mana/3people = 6.67 damage/mana/person<br>
<br>
For the wizard to match healing mana effeciency, for this specific, contrived scenario, the wiz would need to beat 6.67 damage per mana (unspecialized).<br>
<br>
It's quite possible that at some stages of the game, the damage/mana/person of a healer is vastly superior to the damage/mana of a nuker.<br>
<br>
One last thing:  This isn't the &quot;well melees need healers&quot; argument.  This isn't about melee vs. wizard dps it's about healer vs. wizard mana, those are related through melee dps.<br>
