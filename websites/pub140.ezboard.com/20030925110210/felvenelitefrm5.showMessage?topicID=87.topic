Some were too big, others deserted.  At one house, she came in and rested, asking for a cup of water from a well-stocked bar.  She watched with a smile the busy activities of the guild.  Dwarves drank beer at a short table.  A pair of casters pored over a parchment in a corner.   A group of hunters came in, half stopping at the bar, the others continuing to the back of the house, talking about baths.  A handsome human rogue took the seat next to Seyah, smiled at her, and asked if she had any questions.  Before she could answer,  a large barbarian lass, clothed only in a towel which she clutched to her ample chest, came running into the hall, laughing.  Hot on her heels was a dark elf male, and Seyah stiffened, still nervous around dark elves.   The dark elf, white hair flowing around his shoulders, bare chested, held a towel in his hands which he extended corner to corner, snapping his wrist and letting fly at the barbarian, who squealed happily, dodging out of range.  The room exploded in laughter.  As the dark elf dodged around tables in pursuit, Seyah realized he was completely naked.  Self consciously she glanced around the room, and noticed she was the only other female besides the large lass.   She slid off her stool and quickly made her way out the door,  relieved when she realized she’d escaped unnoticed.   Maybe that guild was a bit too sophisticated for her.  <br>
        Several days into her search a bard caught up to her with news from Laenyel and a box of white chocolate muffins.  She nearly wept with gratitude.   Speaking with strangers day after day had worn her courage thin, and she eagerly turned her steps toward the elven city.<br>
        Back in the library, the scholarly wizard was finding nursing not to his liking at all.  “Stop picking at the rug, Krushh!” he exclaimed in exasperation one morning, after tripping over the frayed edge on his way into the room.<br>
        “I’m sorry, Laenyel, “ Krushh said with chagrin, self-consciously folding his hands together.   He was recovering nicely, according to the visiting medics, but was still weak and prone to odd lapses in consciousness.<br>
        Laenyel maintained his outward equanimity, but seeing the normally stalwart tank recuperating on his floor made him uncomfortable.  That and the invasion of his normally silent library.   Clearly Krushh was not enjoying the experience any more than he was, however.   He had an idea.<br>
        “Krushh, I have an extensive library.  Can I get you something to read, maybe, to pass the time?”<br>
        Krushh looked at him blankly for a long moment, and Laenyel quickly thought to his words.  Had he used a language Krushh understood?  Yes, Krushh understood elven, he’d taught him himself.<br>
        “I don’t read,” Krushh said, and Laenyel cursed inwardly.  Of course not, he thought, warriors had no need to read.  What did he have with pictures?  His eyes fell upon his largest books, too large even for his shelves.  He lifted one and carried it to the ogre.  “You might find this interesting, Krushh.  It is an atlas.   A view of Norrath as though from a flying dragon.”<br>
        Setting the book in Krushh’s lap, Laenyel flipped the pages until he found a place he knew Krushh would recognize. “See?  This is Guk.  This is the entry.  Here is where we swam.”  Krushh peered at the parchment, brow furrowed.  <br>
        “That’s the place with tiny ladders?”  he pointed with a massive finger.<br>
        “Exactly”<br>
        “What’s this?”  Krushh pointed again.<br>
        “That is the word for the place.  Guk.   See?  Here it is ‘Lower Guk’ and here again ‘Upper Guk’.”<br>
        Krushh grunted in understanding.  Satisfied that his friend had something to occupy himself other than demolishing the rug, Laenyel returned to his own pursuits.  Days passed and Krushh gradually gained strength, but remained fascinated by the maps, turning the pages delicately and occasionally calling on Laenyel to read the names.   <br>
        When Seyah arrived back, Krushh was nearly recovered, though still in residence on Laenyel’s floor.  Seyah smiled warmly at him, and came forward to clasp one of his large hands.   <br>
        “I am so glad to see you hale, friend,” she said.<br>
        Eyes twinkling with mischief, Krushh raised one of her hands to his lips for a kiss.  Blushing hotly, but laughing, Seyah exclaimed, “What is this?  Laenyel!  You taught him that to tease me!”<br>
        Laenyel and Krushh both laughed and Laenyel protested, “Nay, not I.  He’s been watching out the window to pass the time, and has made a fine study of elven manners.  He asks a lot of questions.”<br>
        She settled herself in the deep chair, and her expression sobered.  “Well,” she said, “that incident with the drake has convinced me that we need a new guild, preferably with a population greater than three.  But I need a better idea of what I’m looking for.  Krushh, you once told us you were promised to a large house.  Do you join them, soon?”<br>
        The question hung in the air.  Krushh cleared his throat, looking at the floor.  Then he lifted his leonine head and held Seyah’s gaze with his yellow eyes.  “I would like to stay with you two,” he said simply.  <br>
        Seyah nodded and exchanged a glance with Laenyel.  It would have to be a vigorous guild to keep Krushh busy, but quiet enough for Laenyel’s quests.  For herself she wanted someplace not totally godless.   A tall order.<br>
        Someone knocked at the door, and Laenyel rose to answer it.  Seyah was startled to hear her mother’s voice, and she rose from her chair.  <br>
        “What is that!?”  the Lady Althia, pausing in the doorway of the library and staring at Krushh.  “Gracious, Laenyel, is that an ogre in your library?”<br>
        “I’m not an ogre, I’m an elf,” Krushh responded, in his accented elven.<br>
        The Lady looked at him in astonishment.  Seyah had to smile, remembering her own confusion when Krushh revealed his language skills.   Krushh smiled at the high elf, and sweeping one arm in grand gesture, he bowed low before the lady in a giant imitation of a proper elven courtesy.  Seyah blinked with surprise, but her mother recovered quickly.  She knew how to cope with gallants, no matter their size.  <br>
        “You’re no elf, you’re a rug,” she remarked tartly, commenting on the chest hair boiling from the V-neck of Krushh’s cloth shirt.  He glanced down, and cooperatively amended,  “A hairy elf, aye.”   Lady Althia smiled at the deference, and moved forward to speak to Krushh.  Seyah snapped closed her mouth which had gone slack at seeing her mother so quickly charmed by an ogre, and moved over to query Laenyel.<br>
        “What’s with the ‘I’m an elf’ thing?” she asked him in an undertone.  <br>
        “I don’t know exactly,” Laenyel responded, “He’s said a couple of things like that since you’ve been gone.  Some of the time I assumed he was still raving with the poison.   It seemed easier not to argue about it.“<br>
        The next day Seyah resumed her weary search for a new guild.  Her mother and Krushh had suggested some she hadn't visited, and this morning she was trudging through the Faydwer forest, looking for a house of elves.   Emerging from a thicket into a green clearing, she realized she must be at the back side of the hall.  Across the clearing rose a stone wall, windowless.  Doubtless the practice yard, she thought, and prepared to follow it around to the front.   A slight motion caught her eye, and she paused.   A high elf was kneeling in the clearing,  his bright armor marking him as either a paladin or a cleric like herself.  His helm was by his side, his hair close-cropped, but as red as her own.   She could hear his voice, and noticing the large two-handed sword stuck in the ground in front of him, she realized he must be a paladin, and he was praying.   She kept a respectful distance, and skirted around him to follow the wall.   The house was clearly going through some changes.   Where the wall ended there were signs of new construction.    Better than the dust and decay of many halls she'd visited.   She arrived at the front door, and the scene inside froze her in her tracks.   An ogre was standing by the great fireplace, holding a protesting dwarf up by one leg.   Used as she was to Krushh, Seyah still hesitated to approach a strange ogre, for fear he could be drunk, or otherwise dangerous.  She heard someone approaching from the side of the house where she had come, and she turned to enlist their aid.   It was the red-headed paladin.  Seeing her look of distress, he hurried forward &quot;Milady?&quot; he said, and mutely she turned to direct his attention to the scene inside.  <br>
        &quot;Orin!&quot; he exclaimed in exasperation, and Seyah sighed with relief.  From his tone of voice she could tell the ogre was no threat, only mischievous, perhaps.  The paladin hurried in and supervised the dusting off of the dwarf, who energetically kicked the ogre in the foot before laughing and scurrying off to the back of the house.  The paladin returned to her, solicitous.  &quot;I hope our warrior did not cause you too much distress, milady,&quot; he said.  &quot;He is quite harmless, I assure you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;He is your guildmate, then?&quot; Seyah inquired.  &quot;Do the Elven Elite admit non-elves?&quot;  <br>
        &quot;Some...,&quot; he began, but then interrupted himself. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;I am Aryllyian&quot; and executed a beautiful elven bow.  &quot;May I know your name?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Seyah,&quot; she replied, returning his bow with a curtsey.<br>
-------<br>
        She cried the day she took off her Adepts guildtag and replaced it with that of the Elven Elite.   The change was for the best, she knew, but it tore at her heart to admit by her actions that the Adepts were dead.   To herself she promised she'd never again stand idly by and allow her guild to evaporate.  If it were to happen again, she would go down fighting.   <br>
        Beside her Krushh was examining the new guildtag, and chuckling to himself.  <br>
        &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, drying her face on her sleeve, and trying to look cheerful.<br>
        &quot;I'm an elf.&quot; he stated, grinning.<br>
        &quot;Krushh, you're not an elf.  I don't know why Laenyel let you go on like that.  You are far too big to be an elf.  Look around.&quot;   She didn't know whether to be exasperated or worried.  Krushh looked around at the elves, wood elves, high elves, half elves, all head and shoulders below him.  <br>
        &quot;Aye,&quot; he conceded, still grinning.  &quot;A big elf.   A big, hairy elf.&quot; <br>
