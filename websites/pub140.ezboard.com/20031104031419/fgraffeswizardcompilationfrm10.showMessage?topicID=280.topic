Wizard balance<br>
<br>
<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I've been reading the Boards trying to figure out what may help our class out. I believe Nanaeve comes the closest to what I beleive.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First let me say that when I hear a Wizard shout &quot;Looking for a group&quot; I don't even want to group with him. I'm sorry to say I feel this way and I'm a Wizard myself. It's a shame I feel this way and is just plain not fair. I would group with any other class first. This is terrible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I'm in a group sitting and medding every other fight, I feel guilty taking experience. I'm sure the other members of the group feel the same way. I'm constantly mana managing and deciding if and when I should cast. I know the other group members see this and become to resent watching me medding while they are fighting. &quot;Master of D&amp;D&quot; that seems funny at times when I'm low on mana, which is always in a group. I have been tempted many times to cast my level one spell  &quot;They think I am helping&quot; SO THEY KEEP ME IN THE GROUP, BECAUSE THEY WONT KNOW IF I HIT FOR 10 DAMAGE OR 500 DAMAGE ANYWAYS. At least it looks better than sitting there medding.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The solution I feel the most comfortable with, which has been suggested by others, is to give Wizards a mana regeneration bonus when grouped, per members in the group. It has been suggested anywhere's from 10% to 20% per person in the group for mana regeneration.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This would accomplish 2 things, #1 Would help with the fear VI has of a Wizard becoming a solo machine if they make spells more powerful. #2 It would make a Wizard in a group able to cast more than Once or twice in a fight and maybe actually do an even amount of damage to a mob as others in the group. I for one would become a searcher for groups, just for the extra mana regeneration. Wouldn't it be nice to see a Wizard actually casting in a group instead of holding back . The group would appreciate the extra casts also and maybe bring into line the &quot;Master of D&amp;D&quot; so that a group may actually believe that a Wizard may come close to that truth.<br>

It basically involves us accepting we are a flawed class and lets Verant off the hook from fixing us. Mana regen yes - but if it's just group only to make us more attractive it's a bit like putting rouge on a tart.<br>
<br>
We are offensive casteres - fix our offensive capability and let us do more damage. Faster mana regen yes - but not on someone elses terms because we feel guilty about being equal.<br>

They do not really want to increase our ability to solo..and I tend to agree.  What they have failed to notice is what makes soloing (i.e. kiting) work:  The ability to snare a mob, run away, then begin casting and have the spell land BEFORE the mob is within melee range, then running away again to repeat the process.<br>
It's a rather simple equation once you look at the variables involved.<br>
A.  Melee range of Mob_01.<br>
B.  Snared running speed of Mob_01.<br>
C.  Cast time of the Wizards' spell.<br>
D.  Range of the spell.<br>
<br>
A_Mob_01 is at coordinate 0,0,0 with a melee range of 25.<br>
A_Mob_01 can run at snared speed of 100 in 5 seconds.<br>
Kiting_Spell_01 casts in 5 seconds.<br>
Kiting_spell_01 has a range of 200.<br>
<br>
This means that I can stand at coordinate 200,0,0 and snare A_Mob_01.  It will take A_Mob_01 8.75 seconds to reach melee range.  Immediately after snaring, A_Wizard_01 casts Kiting_Spell_01 which takes 5 seconds.  When the spell hits, A_Mob_01 is now 3.75 seconds away from melee range.  A_Wizard_01 now has 3.75 seconds to move out of melee range.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verant can triple our damage output, increase our mana regen by an insane amount, cut our resists to zero and not unbalance us by simply changing the cast times so that the casting time is greater than the time required for a given mob to travel the distance between the casting range and melee range OR change the casting distance so that the current recast time is still means the mob gets within melee range just as the spell lands.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but knowing that every time I cast a spell while kiting a snared mob means it gets at least 1 attempt to pound my little brains in would deter me from soloing..but it would not affect hinder my performance in a group.<br>

But I also agree with the group specific additions to our class.  Right now, it isn't even a question of whether we solo well or not.  I DON'T WANT to solo anymore.  Been doing it forever and it has worn thin.  However, if verant were to nerf it, they would nerf away the only thing that we have been consistantly able to do to get ourselves consistant exp.<br>
<br>
I still believe the issue goes along the line of group effectivness.  I can honestly say that increasing our mana regen or damage output would NOT increase my desire to solo.  I hate it, its antisocial, and this is a community oriented game.  (so they say.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  But it WOULD make it so I can actually PARTICIPATE in the group setting rather than sit 75% of the time... AT LEAST!  I think the group based mana regen idea is actually quite good.  Is it the only possibility?  No way.  But it makes us a touch more effective in the setting.  That way, we can actually pull our weight, but it does nothing to enhance soloing.  Yes, there are more things that are needed.  There is no SINGLE fix that will correct our numerous problems.  This idea really only applies to the standard exp group.  Not epic raids, uber gods, etc.<br>

A typical group needs 1-3 tanks, 1-3 casters, ench/bard, cleric, but only needs 1 evacer which there are lots of druids so wiz get left out alot of times. <br>

Rather I would prefer they took AWAY the snare line (Bonds of Force and Atol's) both invaluable to kiting, and just left us with root.  In soloing without snare, root poses a very decent threat, if it breaks, you only get one shot to recast it (maybe) and if it doesn't stick you get hammered on.  Remember the root and nuke tactics before you hit 29 or had Jboots? Well anyway if they increased us in other ways so we could assist the group with more mana, faster regen and better damage, they could gladly take my soloabiity away, but in return they'd have to make sure that I was desperately needed by a group like a cleric or warrior.  They have to make up their minds, either make us gods at soloing or make us valuable to a group, I'm sick of being stuck in between.  I just want to be good at something other than &quot;breaking mez with AoE spells&quot; (another line of spells helpful in quad kiting/soloing but very few groups know the value of or the place for it).  Make me valuable to an xp group please (=<br>

<br>
I've been forming my own assumptions that they just don't want to speed up the game any.<br>
<br>
So if that's the case, there is a major difference in opinion...our arguement is that giving us more damage potential will actually INCREASE our group-ability.  VI is thinking quite the opposite.<br>

The problem lies in our efficiency, not in mana regen, etc.  The same regen rate is 2 times as effective if your spells cost half the mana.  What they need to do is shorten SOME cast times, and then mana requirements across the board.  This should be something like half the mana required (ie IC should take 200m, not 400).  I feel we should significantly outdamage any melee but a rogue, and even then only fall a bit short, maybe 10 percent?  Give any of the mobs that you would be in fear of us multi-kiting slightly faster run speeds to compensate (also helps the true problem with quad-kiting druids) for the aditional damage we can do on a bar of mana.  There is NO excuse for any class doing more damage than us over  (with the exception of a rogue long-term).  We should not however outdamage a rogue, as we have the ability to pick more precisely when to apply the damage.  Upping mana regen would result in less time on our butts between fights.  Upping efficiency would result in the same time for a full med, but the ability to do twice that damage.  I would much rather be up and participating in a group the entire fight and then med than to fight 1min, sit on my butt for 5, and then add a couple nukes again. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=6029">Azlinon Seflarian</a> of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony">Divine Symphony</a><br>

Do NOT suggest nerfs until they fix the damage/regen isues or you'll be seeing increased casting times..and no fixes.  FIX first, and THEN nerf solo ability IF needed.  Antecedent, consequential relationship on these patches.  No more nerfs..kiting is only desirable part of wizard right now.  Why nerf it anyway ? It is very difficult and dangerous to master..alot of things can and will go wrong.  AE's use would be what then ?  I live on a PvP server, so AE's in combat with group do not work, and even if I couldn't use AE's in group battle's..you want cast time increasesd ?  Hmm seems that would adversely affect the damage/time ratio even further..A familiar with scaling abilities with levels seems very cool, or just better mana efficiency would work well as well..casting times..leave them alone.  Anyway, what is wrong with the Wizard soloing some of the time ?  Wizards of lore were ussually reclusive.  I understand your attempt here, but Verant needs to get over this supposed unbalanced soloing issue.  This is what is KILLING Verants incentive to fix this class.  Try soloing Wizards from 1-29 (level you get BoF), before you can effectively Quad kite (even twinked, is very difficult) ?  Now, try soloing a Warrior (esp a twinked one) to 29..compare time played..OK, so we never get to solo better than a warior if you nerf quading and that is fair ? This is not a Flame, but Verant needs some positive direction..let's not even suggest more nerfs please, even if it may &quot;allow&quot; verant to make positive fixes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uneyfearedanymore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neyfeared anymore</A> at: 3/16/01 3:27:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ublastum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blastum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/01 2:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> why not make us better at soloing?</span><hr size=1>   Why all the fear that a wizard with more mana could solo, say, two mobs in a row.

If you have enough mana to blast every mob from 30% to dead, even velious mobs, then you're doing great.  Aggro won't be an issue, because the beast lays in a smoking heap of ashes.<br>

Combine this with total fix / removal of spell resists, mana regen and (possibly) larger mana pool and you've got wizards who dish out damage like a warrior.<br>

I agree with all of the other people who put the emphasis on the resists and not the aggro.  The aggro wouldn't even be an issue if the spells hit because they'd be DEAD faster.  Aggroing an equal amount for a resist as a hit is simply rediculous.<br>
<br>
Does a melee class get aggro'd on a miss?  NOPE.  I mean really.  If a tank walked up to a non-KoS mob, and started swinging, when would that mob start attacking???   AFTER THE FIRST HIT!  So someone could argue, well missing isn't the same as resisting.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's all we have.  Why should a caster with less HP, AC, etc... have MORE chances to aggro?<br>
<br>
Either way, I don't give about aggro if the spell HITS in the FIRST place.<br>

Lets say I cast Ice Comet on a Froglok in Lower Guk.  That's a noticable chunk of its hit points, yeah, he's gonna be peeved at me.<br>
<br>
Now I find me a nice Ice Giant Elite, blue at level 47, has around 12k hit points.  Ice comet barely dents his hit points.  Then we go to Nagafen, Ice Comet is 1/32nd his hit points (we're assuming no resists here).  Then we get to the bizzarely healthy creatures like Velketor and the Dain.  200k+ hit points.  Ice COmet is like a snowball thrown by a paralytic.<br>
<br>
Each one gets equally pissed at the damage done.  Why?  Because the formula for aggro is arithemetic, add this plus this.  That Frog, Giant, Nagafen, and Dain all get equally pissed at the equal damage.  Now, if I had over 2 HUNDRED thousand hit points, that ice comet is a tickle, I'm gonna be annoyed, but not as annoyed as the Froglok.<br>
<br>
Then there's the perception of damage issue.  Verant won't budge on this (primarily because it would be a lot of work).  That Moss snake knows you COULD have done 1120 hit points, but only did 2 because of the resists.  he's NEVER gonna forget you.  Now, I'll buy that a Dragon could know what spell that was and what it might have done, if it hadn't been resisted.  But not EVERY creature should know.]<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this:  Raising the damage would only help us in soloing because we can't do our max damage NOW.  It sucks too much mana and aggros to heavily.<br>
<br>
Raising the mana in our pool lets us solo better, two guys per mana bar instead of one.<br>
<br>
Making our spells more efficient makes us solo better because then we don't use as much mana to take down x creature.<br>
<br>
Basically the way Verant sees it, any way they fix our damage, we solo better.  And despite their obvious work to the contrary, they SAY they don't like people soloing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uteclisen31.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teclisen31</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/29/01 1:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Also agreed...</span><hr size=1> Think about it this way:<br>
<br>
<br>
The way class's are balanced is simple. <br>
<br>
1) A class must have a weakness and a strength (ie balanced)<br>
<br>
2) The way this works in everquest is/should/was is that a <br>
<br>
Tank: Has more hp, can take more hits, HOWEVER doesnt do much damage,<br>
<br>
Offensive Caster: Has lesser hp, cannot take too many hits, however far outdamages tanks,<br>
<br>
PROBLEM: Apparently verant thinks the only way to continuely upgrade this game is to create more items/armor that people want. The upgrade in weapons has drastically changed this game to something totally different then diablo/ff/*insert any rpg*<br>
<br>
TANKS NOW DO MORE DAMAGE THEN WIZARDS AND TAKE MORE STILL<br>
<br>
This maybe fine for enc's, there still left with essential buffs, and debuffs and secondary abilities like crowd control, <br>
<br>
Its fine for mages because they can still transfer mana using mod rods, And have the ability to do damage at all times with their pet. <br>
<br>
Its fine for necro's because they still have the ability to do damage at all times w/pets, BUT at the same time also regen mana quicker<br>
<br>
HOWEVER its not fine for wizards for many reasons, were the only class that cannot do damage at all times...Thats not neccasaraly the complaint however, WHAT IS is that the amount done cannot match a rogue/monk/warrior/mage/necro/ranger/paladin anymore,<br>
<br>
SO verant..Wheres your balance now? where is the advantage of taking no damage? Whats the advantage to having a cost to do our damage? (mana) What makes us &quot;balanced&quot; in this game if EVERY single other primarily offensive caster can outdamage and out tank us? <br>
<br>
theres a simple answer, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THERE IS NONE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
We have not one advantage to our class anymore, verant seriously needs to take a look at exactly what is considered &quot;balancing&quot;<br>
<br>
A simple fix: Verant most likley sees this as &quot;unbalancing&quot; but its so much simpler, Take every 50+ offense dd:<br>
<br>
Incrsease the damage by x2<br>
<br>
Lower the mana cost by half<br>
<br>
Increase our self mana regen at increasing level's<br>
<br>
Up our bane spells to 3.5k<br>
<br>
Is that really unbalancing? <br>
<br>
No its not, the hp of mobs has gone up so that regular mobs can have 8k health, if you keep the damage we can do to 1/8 their approxamite health, its not unbalancing, its simply balances the fact we cannot take damage, therefore we can do massive amounts, when we become oom, its because weve done a fair amount,<br>
<br>
Simply put in lame-mans terms a neat little graph:<br>
<br>
hp of mob 50+<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
damage done now <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
hp of mob 50- (pre kunark)<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
damage done<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Its obvious that our ratio has dropped and due to the length of battles every other class's has increased leaving us without any &quot;evolution&quot; to combat the mobs,<br>
<br>
Wizards fall perfectly into darwins theory survival of the fitest, we cant adapt therefore are slowly being eleminated and replaced by class's more suited to survive (MELEE)<br>

BUt how much improving honestly makes a difference???<br>
<br>
Scenario:<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the best solo exp between levels 53-58 is Raptor Island.  Now, on my server, there are ALWAYS four people splitting the 15 spawns.  Usually two druids splitting the 6 on small, and two others splitting the large spawns.  Using this setup, here is my situation.<br>
<br>
I only have four spawns to camp.  They spawn at a regular interval as always.  When I pull them, I am able to kill them with my current mana pool, without clarity, and usually without using harvest.  Then I sit and med.  By the time I am full mana again, my harvest is back(if it was used) and the four spawns are within 20 seconds of being back.  Almost timed perfectly.  This is with NO clarity, C2, or manaskin.<br>
<br>
Conclusion, increasing our damage output would only make the kills go faster.  But we'd still have to wait for the next four to spawn so no real advantage.  Extra mana regen would make the medding go faster.  But we'd still have to wait for the next four to spawn so no real advantage.<br>
<br>
I understand that this is an isolated situation not experienced by everyone, but this makes it so increasing those aspects of our class would do absolutely nothing to the soloing.  The islands would HAVE to be empty for me to experience any REAL advantage, which never happen.<br>
<br>
We can ALREADY solo efficiently.  In fact, we are almost FORCED to under the current setup.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sarcasm&quot;  Yeah, thats just what more damage would do for me.  Make me want to solo MORE!  Whatever.  Raptors are a boring, lonely, tedious, and antisocial camp.  Which I'm sure many of us are ALREADY very good at.<br>
<br>
I would simply like to see myself be a bit more damage and mana efficient during those massive raids that I rarely go on anyway.  But with the new spells, I have to wait until 60 just to experience it.  Do any of the melee classes have to wait until level 60 to get some of the better haste, AC, and attribute armor?  uh...<br>

Completely.  Every now and then, its simply healthy to rant here even if its futile.<br>
<br>
I also think that its this kind of knowledge of our own class, that makes it so people who play high wizards as mains, actually play other classes better than most.<br>
<br>
The wizard class is like one huge Beta Test that never made it to production.  All this troubleshooting, and no resolution.  How disturbing.<br>

<br>
Hehe before I finished reading your first sentence, I thought you had arrived at the same conclusion as I had. But I wasn't thinking about long cast time; spells WITH SHORT RANGE was my conclusion.<br>
<br>
And I'm not talking about changing current spells.. just adding a few of those hard hitting, efficient spells that works basically in close range (so close that it's impossible to kite with them.) Because I like the 3 sec cast time on draughts.<br>
<br>
Here's an example:<br>
BadAssDD<br>
DMG: 1300<br>
Mana: 250<br>
Cast time: 3 sec (same as draught)<br>
Recast time: 0 (5 sec or so is acceptable to me)<br>
Range: 35 feet<br>
