  I have a 300+ AA druid who would get a group invite about never, however when I'd log on my anon cleric for 5 minutes I could end up with multiple group invites from several different zones.  Shut off anon, particularly in LoY and rez requests start rolling in, not to mention all the times I'd have to log my druid or wizard to run my cleric somewhere to rez some alliance mate.  For whatever reason, people's perception is that druids just don't cut it for groups (face it, you'll always take a cleric for a healer over a druid or just about anyone but a cleric over a druid as a damage dealer) so druids have trouble getting groups.  With the latest soloing nerf SOE figured that hey, maybe they can't just ignore druid's grouping problems any longer because they can go solo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1008<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> Actually Milaru, this one time i would enjoy it if you would have fre access to the druids lair... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The problem with the druids is, that they in most cases on their board demand only, but they don't offer something to give up for an improvement. I remember a post by a VI official (if i am correct here) way back in the old days asking several classes what they could imagine to give up to get some improvements for their class. It did affect us as well.<br>
<br>
Well the common druid does not want to give up something, instead he wants even more.

 <br>
  Actually, you're wrong.  There is quite a bit of useless crap in the druid class that most druids wouldn't mind losing at all.  Spells that only effect summoned mobs anyone?  Treeform which hasn't worked since Luclin's release (oh, but thanks for the new treeform spell in PoP, SOE you dumbfucks).  Wolf form which stacks with about nothing and doesn't work indoors.  Strength buffs which are nearly useless.  PoP has also rendered regen nearly useless and it's loss wouldn't be missed, damage shields are right up there too as mages will do them on raids and an extra 40 damage in a group against a mob hitting for 600+ isn't going to add a lot.  Also there are &quot;fun&quot; spells which are basically useless although druids probably wouldn't want to give them up, bearpet, rain stopping and plant charming for instance.  Then there are the completely redundant spells.  Why are there evacs to zones that druids can just port to, and porting to Misty Thicket (a clicky effect on velious legs and luclin quest earring) is pretty redundant with the book sitting right beside the ring.<br>
  <br>
  With all that useless crap it's hard not to think that Al'Kabor was actually a druid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1011<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> Lol i was talking along more of the lines of versatily.<br>

-Druids,.. one of the three healing classes (and yes a druid can keep a tank in an exp group alive in PoP, i think we agree on that. Well at least the druids i group with can do it.)<br>
-Druids, the class with some of the best buffs. SoE, Cr, FR, Po9 comes to mind Regen, etc etc.<br>
-Druids, one of the three most powerfull DoT classes in the game.<br>
-Druids, the class that debuffs nicely!<br>
-Druids, the class, that has access to some often usefull skills.

<br>
But the short answer is that a magician can nuke AND use a pet, while Druids Nuke OR Heal(etc).  Given a single bar of mana, a druid can spend 75% nuking and 25% healing, while a mage can spend 99% nuking and the pet gets added on top.<br>
<br>
Druids are generally far more versatile than magicians, but that in itself isn't cause for a huge extra penalty, because there is an automatic penalty in that everything a druid does costs mana, aggro, and time.  <br>
<br>
That's the non-whiny answer. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A> at: 6/11/03 12:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1014<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 12:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Druids are generally far more versatile than magicians, but that in itself isn't cause for a huge extra penalty, because there is an automatic penalty in that everything a druid does costs mana, aggro, and time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is the same for a Wizard, except we have much much less versatility than druids, who can do literally everything (except meleeing at high levels).<br>
In accordance to that, i wonder why they get an upgraded cold based nuke version and we did not (except the draught).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, they have now that much versatility, took so many abbilities from other classes, that it is just not justified in my opinion to have Druids better nuking than Mages. (What they did at some points in the game... for a long time.)<br>
<br>
The problems to upgrade druids and tofollow their suggestions is, that they can't be easily upgraded without overpowering them (since they have already so many possibilities).<br>
A lot of suggestion on their board will not help them to group neither. (Lol, enhanced tracking?)<br>
The only possibility i see is, if they agree to give up A LOT of their abbilities to get a real upgrade in one aspect and become a little bit more specialized.<br>

Just figured I'd quote this and say, this is true.  It's all perseption, same with wizards and any other class that is seen as below the number one rank in something.<br>
<br>
People have a mind set of why get the second or third best when we can have the best.  And when there are only 6 group spots, alot of people fall in the second or third best spots.  Now sometimes by necesity people will settle for second best but in pick up groups some spots people will never let a percieved second or third best class have a shot even though they can fill the shoes effectively. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1348<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 4:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> When groups start getting overpowered vs mobs they start moving from choosing primary classes to all-rounders.<br>

Did inner last weekend with a druid prime healer, worked perfectly and got more xp than if we'd had a cleric. This is one of the big problems clerics face - they can heal the best but often that healing simply isnt needed. And they cant solo.<br>
<br>
People arent dumb. We are right on the cusp of druids vs clerics prime healing balance atm. On PoV and under, druid is preferred for better xp/hour (esp. if you have a pally for resses and shaman rather than chanter). On Tier3+ clerics probably are still better no matter what, though even there druids can be preferrable in a strong group.<br>
<br>
This represents about as good a balance as is possible in this complicated game. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 6/11/03 4:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 8:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1>  Druids heal pretty well in Tier 3 as well, Tactics, HoH, BoT, the other extra skills they bring, drops the mobs quicker so not as much healing is needed.<br>
<br>
 Im not sure how the AE's are in elemental planes but Druids should be able to handle it depending on the group make-up. Clerics can make life easier with people who have less hp, so-so gear and if burn a little more than I should.<br>
<br>
 I think the poster a few post back was being a little unrealistic, in a pickup group a Cleric will be picked first over almost any class. People usually start by making the group with a Cleric because they think it will bring in the fastest exp, while it is possible it may, you can get exp as fast with a Druid healing.<br>

 Before the Mini-Ch went in and the PoP spells were added it was obvious that Druids needed an upgrade, now they can hold their own. It may be pointless to continue much longer, Druids have it in their mind they suck and no one will be able to convince them otherwise, just hope SOE does not listen to some of their insane suggestions before they realize how good  they have it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rexlar>Rexlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 9:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Since soloing was nerfed and we wizards are a good soloing class don't we need lots of stuff too?<br>

There is a tool for binding (Soulbinders)<br>

There is a tool for ports (PoP stones)<br>
Heck you can go to the temple and pay an NPC for a cure rabies/poison, you should be able to pay for a res too!<br>
<br>
It fits roleplay even!<br>

Tons of people played wizards for the ability to solo, do loads of damage, quad for xp, etc.  Now there's an overabundance of wizards making it difficult for all of us to get groups.<br>
<br>
Evidence to support this.<br>
<br>
PoK - This made our secondary ability, next to nukes, nearly worthless.  We were not compensated in any way.  I used to be able to get groups at times because people wanted to go somewhere to xp.  Not anymore, they just click on a book.<br>
<br>
Nerf of solo xp - They could have simply increased the group bonus.  Instead they chose to make soloing less attractive, even though grouping was already more attractive than soloing.  No doubt about it, xp in BoT in a good group was better than solo, and with that comes a chance at loot.  I would never pass up a group to solo, most wouldn't.   Is this change going to get us groups?  Doubt it.  Really really doubt it.  There's still too small of a percentage of core classes that are necessary for a group and too many filler classes.<br>
<br>
Recast time nerf - This hit us harder than any other class as we could use our flux staff to increase our dps.<br>
<br>
Horse nerf - As a soloing class wizards benefitted most from horses.  Because we needed models on all of us who had cheap horses could no longer use them for quadding/kiting.  And many of us can't afford 100k horses.<br>
<br>
No new pillar spells - Sure, we could still quad with our old ones, but by not giving us new ones they definitely made quadding less attractive.  Lots of wizards I know solo mobs now.<br>
<br>
Manaburn nerf - No nerf to death touch or lifeburn.  Hrm.  Man it sickens me to watch an SK in a group DT for 7k every how every often it is, and it's really often.  That ability is SIGNIFICANTLY better than my manaburn, and it's not nerfed.<br>
<br>
Ok, you can argue that there are some great enchancements we get from focus effects.  BUT....  how many wizards have ID4?  Or any form of anger item for that matter?  How many have MP4, preservation of xegony?  Etc, etc.  Not many.  The majority of us have been nerfed and screwed.  They want to dwindle our numbers.<br>
<br>
Look at ALL the nerfs to our class.  What have we been given? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milaru00>Milaru 00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1703<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 4:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My opinion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Look at ALL the nerfs to our class.

<br>
the retards that somehow think that they are trying to trim the wizard population.<br>
<br>
How often did wizards bitch about port beggars, then we get pok and you whine about not having people to port.<br>
<br>
Recast time isn't a big deal, its not a nerf, its fixing a bug in code.<br>
<br>
Horse nerf isn't a nerf, its fixing a bug, again.<br>
<br>
manaburn: play something past PoI and you will figure out why manaburn was nerfed, understand other classes and you will figure out why HT and lifeburn weren't.<br>

the majority of wizards are stupid and moronic, dwindling the numbers is a good thing, then we will have less people making posts like that one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taelenskychaser>Taelen Skychaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ah</span><hr size=1> &quot;the majority of wizards are stupid and moronic&quot;<br>

So, what you are saying is most of us are stupid and moronic, where as you are enlightened and all knowing?<br>
<br>
Bullsh...<br>
<br>
Yes I was exaggerating, dumbass.  Yes, I can fling names too.<br>
<br>
The reality is these bug fixes hit our class, the majority of us who don't have FT15, MP4, ID4, etc, etc for focus effects.  We are not morons or stupid.  Many of us just don't have the time it takes to get into a guild which can get us the focus items you speak about which make our class so much better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26835.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26835.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26835.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26835.topic&start=81&stop=95>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26835.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26835.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26835.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to receive email notification of replies</a><br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a><br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.242<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
