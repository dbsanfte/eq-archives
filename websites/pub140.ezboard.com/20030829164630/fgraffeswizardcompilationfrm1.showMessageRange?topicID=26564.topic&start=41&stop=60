VI has given enough thought to bullshit level 4 issues. The very low level game has been around for 3 years, and with the leveling mechanisms of today people who started fresh on my server - on its release - were getting 30 by day 3. I remember when the low levels were a considerable amount of time, but the amount of dev focus that seems to be going towards newbs is just ridiculous to me now. Do we really need large bats updated to large 'n fuzzy bats every other month and revamped coyote loot tables?<br>
<br>
I would hope that the focus would shift towards what people have standing concerns for...you know- players who have been here for years and play for months just to see that some door has been fixed in ancient zone that saw its last heavy usage back in the velious era. LoY is another example of mostly wasted effort, an expansion that brought little or nothing to the game. I dont know for sure that much attention was payed to all of this, but it surely seems so. If anything, I would prefer to have more focus towards higher end issues, anything below 30 doesnt need to be looked into. Hello: would the game really be that much more dynamic and interesting with better quests for levels that take a day to get out of?<br>
<br>
my point is that I'd like to see more rescource/focus going to the area where players have more strong concern. level 8 quests, who really cares or notices it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loganwolfxev>LoganwolfXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 12:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> Actually, I am quite happy with EQ myself.<br>

Because so many people have 1 or 2 high level and 7 or 6 low level characters on one account. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yes, it is obviously the very wrong way to calculate the average level of charactes in game when it comes to reality, but if that's what they're doing, making stuff to level 8 seems to be catering to biggest audience. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Old wiz, quite a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nmnh.si.edu/paleo/dino/">dino</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> :)<br>

<br>
    The alternative is not having content you can mow through, it's having content period. <br>
<br>
     The entire LOY expansion could have been additional POP zones, with enough content and quests to last us until today. <br>
<br>
     How many people go to LOY zones? Not many, and why? Because no high end guilds go there to &quot;publicise&quot; the zones to the masses. In most cases, the casual and mid range player don't explore as much as the high end raiding guild, and tend to go to &quot;proven&quot; areas most. <br>
<br>
      There could be a Vex Thal like key quest or similar in LOY, and no one will ever find it because the uber guilds don't explore there. <br>

Uberguilds do the same three or four things themselves. They are hardly the great pioneers of innovation. There are a few guilds that are, but the number of guilds that use strats that are more or less what they read other guilds do is very, very high. Yes, many of them also have a new wrinkle or two, but let's not kid ourselves that the new content is always getting broken in by the ubers.<br>
<br>
The first attempt at the new Maestro on Vazaelle wasn't by Promethian Order or Caer Cadarn, for instance. It was by my guild and our old buddies in Resurgence of Kin. (Damn those accompanists!)<br>
<br>
As for Legacy of Ykesha, the expansion has been scoured by low and mid-level guilds. The reason you don't hear much about is because it's unfinished. The Stone From Beyond ISN'T THERE. When you get to Hate's Fury, the pirates there talk about someone stealing the stone, and taking it off the ship. Where is it? Who took it? Who the fuck knows? I'd guess either Luclin or Antonious Bayle, since we're never seeing either of them any time soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bangkirai>bangkirai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 5:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: newb fixes = me on back burner</span><hr size=1> The biggest problem nowadays in EQ, is that the xp in POP zones is WAY and WAY too good compared to older zones.<br>
<br>
I was with a 56 bst in Chardok, i though hmm, dungeon, must be good xp. So i killed there solo, till the gatehouse then went back to zi. <br>
But after some hours, i noticed, xp barely rises. So i loaded up my OT gate hammer and procced to my lovely outpost book.<br>
And then i just went to POJ zone-m for solo xp, which was way and way better. YET, it was also easier!!<br>
<br>
This is one of the reasons people don't go to old zones that much anymore, the xp reward for the amount of efford is way out of balance compared to the xp reward for the amount of efford in a pop zone. Pop zones are easier i think. Sure mobs hit harder, but it takes less efford to get better xp.<br>
<br>
Other problems with older zones:<br>
<br>
First, people want fast a group, so they go to zones, that are very close by. They do not walk to chardok/kedge/sebilis/solB and such to see if there is an opening there.<br>
Solution, put again more books in different zones.<br>
<br>
Second, a lot of people don't have loads of cleric/necro friends around. So if they die in a dungeon, with no graveyard, they got a SERIOUS problem. I really suggest to put graveyards in all zones. It's plain stupid, that only the highest level people have graveyards in their xp zones.<br>
<br>
Third, the xp is barely worth it anymore.<br>
I noticed lvl 54 to 60 is way and way tougher to get then 60 to 65 plus several aa.<br>
<br>
Fourth, about loy zones, these zones have way and way too many mobs around. There is barely a place where you can set up a camp. And NO, people don't want to set up camp on spots, where a mob can respawn in the middle of their camp.<br>
We just want to have fun and no stress about camp-spawn-adds.<br>

Because there is zero evidence that its not on the back burner!<br>
<br>
Planes of Power, upon release, had a rich and engaging storyline that hinted at conspiracy, corruption and collusion among the very gods themselves!  We had interactions with NPCs that had both personal stories of strife with the gods but with an overarching theme that interconnected each of these individual tragedies into a more concrete whole : a conspiracy against Zebuxoruk the very enlightened mortal who first brought godlike power ot mortals like us the player-characters.<br>
<br>
Everyone was pumped about both the intriguing content (GRummus was a deceptively HARD mob to kill!) concepts as well as the evolving storyline as they progressed quickly through the inital stages of PoP....  far TOO quickly as it turns out because rich evidence of the intermingled plot vanishes once the playerbase ran smack into the Rathe roadblock.  Even without the Rathe issue there is precious little evidence of the plotline anymore as guilds have spent months and months on the same &quot;page&quot; of the storyline...so long in fact that nearly everyone has forgotten why they were there in the first place!   Time itself (from what I have been able to glean) which should have a BIG recap of the plotline to date when you first enter the zone and do the initial encounters starts out with a 4 elemental + undead minion encounter that seems to come out of left field and involve ZERO major characters!<br>
<br>
Now with flagging being removed for everything pre-Elemental as well as cutting out any required flagging for Time access it seems the Dev Team is just throwing up their hands and saying &quot;fine you win...go nuts!&quot; and tossing the tattered remnants of the plotline on the ground.<br>
<br>
Legacy of Ykesha had a central plotline in all the Flash-episodic prequels that teased us prior to its release...but ZERO plotline when you actually get into the expansion area!<br>
<br>
SoE has a massive trackrecord now of building up a new plotline trhough use of Hammerfel's wonderful puzzles and websites and not following through on any of them by releasing unfinished products that then only ever get made workable in the sense that there is a dungeon and loot drops there to make people satiated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Everquest expnasions to date are a series of novels that no one has ever finished.  <br>
<br>
Ruins of Kunark -- a novel about a elven princess kidnapped to a land ruled by evil lizardmen and where Dragons exist as the power behind many thrones.... only we never see the princess much less rescue her and the Ring of Scale are just a bunch of mobs that drop nice items.<br>
<br>
Scars of Velious -- a novel about exploration into the frozen wasteland of velious where Veeshan's claws first struck Norrath and where her brood reside.  Along the way the characters encounter the war between the Ice Dwarves and the Giants as well as the conflicts between the Giants and the ancient Dragons who make their home in Veeshans Temple.   Tunare has her own inroads into this frozen continent for reasons that no one seems to understand and the Prince of Mirth Bristlebane has a completely unfinished zone dedicated seemingly to a puppetshow with no plot.  The conflict with the Dragons just leads to another slaughter of Dragons for loot without even a lick of flavor text.  The Ice Dwarves and giants have a series of epic encounters but it fizzles out with the plotline ending with the final shawl quest.  The Avatar of War is a penultimate encounter with no follow through!   Everyone stands in Vulak's chamber after he dies and goes &quot;errr what was the point?&quot;.... Oh and the world gets annihilated after the Sleeper is Awakened, but actually waking him up doesnt seem to change anything and several years after doing so everything is pretty peachy keen so it seems rather silly that anyone bothered to lock him up in the first place!<br>
<br>
Shadows of Luclin -- All about what happened to the ancient empires of Norrath, the Combine Empire and the Shissar are both exiled to the surface of one of Norrath's Moons.  Trapped there by the machinations of...well its presumed Luclin herself only we never SEE Luclin, or Tsaph Katta, or get any good reason why Luclin suddenly becomes reachable etc.   Its nearly 2 years later that someone bothers to touch on the Takashi - Khati Sha connection and weave that back into the plotline that links the Grimlings to the Shissar...maybe in another 2 years Luclin will appear and explain why she was Torturing Grieg, who Katta really was, and why she has interfered in the destiny of mortals down on Norrath by trapping people on her moon.<br>
<br>
Plane of Power I touched on above and no one has seen Zebuxoruk much less rescued him, but all the fine detail to plot and the complex story that was setup with countless man hours of flavor text and chatty NPCs upon release has degraded into tuning mobs that drop elemental molds.<br>
<br>
<br>
E3 came and went and there was NO new official announcement of an Everquest expansion or even ackowledgement that the game, as it exists, is no longer fun.<br>
<br>
Everytime a solution is added to the game that essentially just involves keeping the players happpy with token ube loot that pushes people further and further towards other games.  <br>
<br>
There are people who could and WOULD fix many of the problems that are endemic to Everquest from a play-value aspect, the fact that it hasnt been done is proof that its on the Backburner as far as SoE is concerned and by willfully letting it continue it has critically damaged SoEs reputation as being able to provide quality entertainment.<br>

<br>
they retuned pet classes then went to preists and hybrids now they are going back to tanks?<br>
<br>
<br>
They try and push us to group more in pop with a limited spell lineup they have no PBAOE or pillar upgrades in Pop for us but give higher damage PBAOE to other classes ?<br>
<br>
I see more and more the line bluring on other classes geting our abilitiees but we get no real upgrades on our spell lineups<br>
<br>
<br>
yes we are much more effective with our mana to damage ratio but we would like to have spell upgrades along with the rest of the eq classes<br>
<br>
Fix useless spell lines  al krappors make it hit 8 mobs or scrap it <br>
<br>
familiar agument / enhancement this spell has NO value <br>
<br>
WE need single target version of rain spells with additional waves?<br>
<br>
make the familiar enhancemet spells Buf the familiar or wizard sword into a real pet for a limited time ? commandable with appropriate hp and mele abilities <br>
<br>
Class utility group friendly aspect?<br>
<br>
Extend eye spells duration to ue the fixed invibility of improved invisibility eyes suppose to be a scouting tool now fix its duration and movement on ALL turane<br>
<br>
Wizard Mass group buff for portals for entire raid party?<br>
<br>
Remove Portal fragments from game or extend venders that sell them ? to maybe someplace wiz can port directly?<br>
<br>
i see no reason to keep portal fragments for a spell that only benifits other classes as you cant TL yourself with the addition of pop the wizard class shoul have recived a no portal fragment upgrade on all translocates with all the availability of portals in POP<br>
<br>
Clarvoiace spell line ? awarness of mobs of equil level or over in a zone?<br>
<br>
Familiar resistance buffs and mana regen effect given to group memebers ? (tie in a small stackable mele slow and it would be a great addidtion ) the effect could be a bard type gruop buff effect based off familiar buff so it doesnt eat a buff slot<br>
<br>
harvest spell and AA abilities with a group effect ? mass group buff ability ? <br>
<br>
Raise the the level limit on disintigrate <br>
<br>
maybe more of a combination spell line similar to EEOI<br>
Root nuke<br>
<br>
Fire based Nuke (dot)<br>
Ice based Nuke (mele slow)<br>
magic based nuke (manatap)<br>
Singel target snare + dot<br>
<br>
line of site directional teleport spell port to target or to area curor clicked on last <br>
<br>
oh and lastly FIX Z AXIS for casting and fix the 2 sec madatory refressh or give us a chanin casting AA or discapline to dule cast 2 nukes at once if we preset it to go off ?<br>
<br>

By spending so much time on issues that people have very little interest in, SOE sends the message to me that major high level issues are less relevent for their time. It's the classic VI/SOE statistics thing. I remember when, on my bard in the kunark era, VI accidentally broke bard instruments for a week- not only that, they knew the change was going in and wouldn't emergency patch it. That fundamental part of bards caused a lot of people to outright stop playing them for being so whacked, but 2 weeks later about VI changed shriok packs, then suddenly put through an emergency patch to reverse the change.<br>
<br>
That sucked pretty bad. I think the same thing is going on today- as it pertains to the 'back burner' issue. Mostly irrelevent changes are taking up perhaps 3/4 of a patch's message, while several months are taken to correct stuff like the rathe, potime, even that annoying super-regen bug. The last one was in there for what, 8 months and reported on forums the day it happened? New giant bat loot tables, give me a break. if you want to prove that your dedicated fanbase is not on the back burner, focus on us- we care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 12:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: noobissues!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Blizzard announces World Of Warcraft beta will soon be opening and that it will take at least 8 months.<br>

Uberguild_004 might have been pissed that the Rathe encounter took 5 monthes to be fixed but lets say you play WoW... your looking at possibly waiting twice as long. <br>
<br>
Players will fly threw the content not matter how much they try to avoid it. I also heard they were trying to eliminate the timesinks that are apart of EQ. Great, its those timesinks that help fill the gap between one expansion and the other. People bitch that people flew threw PoP but how many guilds actually flew through Luclin? The top guild on my server barely finished VT in time for PoP to come out. In fact going back even more they killed AoW just a couple days after Luclin came out (server started post Kunark).<br>
<br>
I can't wait! Were gonna beat the first release and then they will announce a 6 month beta testing for the next expansion. Now what the hell will you do for the next 6 monthes? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12873<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: noobissues!</span><hr size=1> WoW is also advertising a much higher density of content than EQ has.

I don't see this changing anytime soon. Each expansion is becoming less and less finished at the time of release, this is very evident. <br>
