As for why stay in EQ1?  It's familiar, people have invested countless hours in the game, and there's still stuff for quite a few of us to do.  Loosing all that time investment when transferring to a new game doesn't appeal to many people. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587299" target="top">Seuinye Whitewater</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> 31 Wizard, Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12408<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 1:12:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> If I were level 31, I'd agree with you, but the people 60+ aren't saying there's a lot left to do, because there isn't.<br>
<br>
There's 0 zones in the old world I haven't explored. There's 2 zones in Kunark I haven't entered and 2 more I haven't done decent exploration on yet. There's 2 zones in Velious I haven't entered yet. There's 1 zone in Luclin I haven't entered yet. I haven't gotten to the top half of PoP (although I've been to most of the lower tier planes) and unless I joined a guild with a playstyle that I cannot live with and am not interested in, I'm unlikely to, although I am hoping I can tag along as a tourist at some point to see Sol Ro's Tower.<br>
<br>
If EQ2 started tomorrow, the lure of a new world, a new era, and new challenges would be greater than wanting to see Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, the Plane of Mischief, the Plane of Tactics and the Plane of Torment.<br>
<br>
If they issued a Kunark-size EQ1 expansion where you could colonize the new continent and build towers and cities, that would keep my interest for a while, though. Or adding a lot more events like the Velious ring war (just ran it last night, fourth consecutive win for my guild), which is possibly the coolest thing in all of EQ1. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 855<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 1:24:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> I've been playing since June 1999, and probably will be playing EQ until PoTime is seen and conquered.

<br>
And who cares what people have in EQ1 in 2005, in 2003 everyone can get to Nag/Vox/Fear/Hate of which 2 didn't exist in summer of 1999. But the difference is that some people saw Nag/Vox/Fear/Hate in 1999 where some people saw them in 2003. Just like ele planes, some people saw those in 2002 and some people are going to see them 2005 or so.<br>
<br>
But back to original... the start cities like Felwithe rarely saw much people at one time. Way back when the usual population in city was 3-10... and just few minutes ago there was still 11 people in there. So from my point of view, my hometown is as active as it was about 4 years ago.<br>

On ECI just this past month 3 or more semi high end guilds disbanded and folded, mine included.  I went looking for a guild and there arn't that many choices.  There are still a few but not many.  I also certainly don't feel like putting in the effort to make a guild just to leave it in a few moths when EQ2 is released.<br>

Things will be interesting when EQ2 is released.  If its as good as I think it will be, I can see alot of people leaving and quitting EQ1.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I've been reading on the EQ newsgroup that a good bit of ppl think EQ is already starting to die. Many are just bored of the game and are quiting or getting ready to, others are getting tired of Verant changing everything and some of it is for the worse. I've read where they are saying it's too late to save EQ, some even say even the new addon will not save it cause it'll still be the same game with just some new things.<br>
<br>
And yeah it might spice it up a bit, but for how long, I give it 3-4 months tops. After 3-4 months the power gamers will already have the extra lvls, everyone should have been in all the new zones, had a chance to play the new lizardman race. So once that happens it's gonna be right back to where it is now.<br>
<br>
Some are waiting for Asheron's Call and others are waiting for Middle-Earth to be released. Will AC or ME finish off EQ? I guess time will tell but since theres like 3-4 other RPGs coming out by the year 2000 I say one of them will put an end to EQ. And if EQ does die too fast it's no ones fault but Verants for not listening to the paying customers, they listen to a few but not the whole.<br>
<br>
Even tho EQ is a very good game it can't or won't be around forever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
EQ aint dying now any more than ever <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
<br>
The only thing that could kill EQ could be EQ2 and would that really mean it had died? Personally I think a very significant number of powergamers will stay so the two games will live alongside each other.<br>
<br>
The biggest threat in my mind is Brad's new game from his new Sigil firm in 2 years time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 4/20/03 5:21:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaelonxerxentis>Kaelon Xerxentis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/kaelon/wand.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 3:58:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.kaelon.com/images/kaehead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> I don't think that EverQuest II will specifically appeal to &quot;casual gamers&quot;, but I also think that the style of playing advocated by EverQuest I -- endless, repetative leveling that creates considerable disparity in skill, only to lead to endless, repetative timesinks to advance to competitive content that leads to disparity in wealth -- is not likely to succeed again in future games. SOE has already announced intentions to appeal to a broader audience. However, I do not think that there is any altruism in this design decision for EverQuest. The purists left with Brad McQuaid to form Sigil Games. You can expect Microsoft (who has contracted Sigil Games to make their post-AC2 MMORPG to compete with SOE and Blizzard) to expect McQuaid's team to stick to their guns in the same way that they did EverQuest.<br>
<br>
Those that are left at SOE are largely pragmatists - and incredibly skilled at making compromises to keep their current, dwindling player base happy. Similarly, they realize that the design team at Blizzard is dedicated to getting MMORPGs into the mainstream by eliminating timesinks, streamlining competition and creating relative bases of power, rather than absolute comparisons. The implications for this design choice are considerable and can have wide-reaching effects across the industry.<br>
<br>
In the end, though, one constant holds true. Subscription-based games rely upon people to continue playing for extended periods of time in order to generate income. Those hoping for a quick ending or instant gratification, regardless what game they play, will find themselves quickly disappointed. Like DikuMUD variants, EverQuest capitalizes on this successful mantra. Keep people addicted, and make it harder to break that addiction by placing never-ending goals. It remains to be seen how Star Wars Galaxies, or any other SOE game, will differ from that model, given just how successful EverQuest has been.<br>

I'd also like to see the array of things set out for casual gamers- losing the hardcore raid portion of EQ in exchange for the casual part wouldn't be worth it for me. Largely, I play to build up my guild, progress to new things, collect phat loots, and work in the raid enviornment thing- lots of people, mixing lots of different abilities and tactics... grinding along can be ok for awhile, but just grinding will wear you out. Perhaps it's that mix of new places, abilities, and gameplay that keeps it more interesting- but I don't think I'd be playing EQ right now if the only thing I had to do was xp for the 300th point of AA.<br>
<br>
I've been playing EQ since release. I think the level-level-level and only-level thing has been overdone quite a bit. Longer interest in the game for the hardcore(I suppose), requires something over than what I've probably spent more than a year of my life doing. EQ raids, the SB siege thing(only played the beta), and other ideas add interest. it depends on the person, though, but im sure the xp-grind only should be on its way out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xasbik@graffeswizardcompilation>Xasbik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 4:55:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My Suggestion</span><hr size=1> They need to make the bosses of cities actually drop loot!  That would be great and spice up the zones a bit.  My guild went and kill Kane Bayle for the hell of it last week because he just recently started spawning again after being bugged for nearly 4 yrs.<br>
<br>
Fight lasted ~1 hour.  he had a crap load of hit points, know what he dropped?  Fine Steel 2h Sword, Crappy Qeynos Kite Shield and human blood.  Would it kill them to add some decent items to him that a level 50-60 would use?  <br>
<br>
They could do the same thing with the King of Akanon, and the King of Kaladim, add some worthwhile items to them.  Heck, make them interesting encounters also, say when you engage  King Akanon he spawns for clockwork adds at 50% that have ae slow.  <br>
<br>
They could also make other NPC's in the zone drop stuff.  A lot of the NPCs dont even require tuning since they are Guild masters and already extremely tough for their era (original EQ).  And yes, Guild Masters have way over 32k now (no, it's not just fast regen, they are way over 32k).  Make the Monk Guild Master in Qeynos and in Cabilis drop some decent stuff, their are lots of oppurtunities to bring life to the old cities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12447<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 7:04:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Suggestion</span><hr size=1> I would love to see fully itemized cities, but they'd need to make sure they could do so without disrupting people using the starting cities for their normal usages.<br>
<br>
But just having run the 10th ring war again Friday night, I'm struck by how much I'd kill to see an event like that played out in the Tox forest, or in GFay, or in the Nek. That would be an amazing way to give new life to the old world, and a reason for everyone to come home again.<br>
<br>
Imagine if every city had a series of quests similiar to the Qeynos badges, with quests designed like them or the progressive Coldain quests. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=burnreich>BurnReich</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 11:55:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> If your a tailor or a smith, you would be returning to your home city now and then.

And actualy have it so it takes place in side the qeynos newb area and at the city gates and you have to protect the city gates.  Would be hella fun to have rangers with their bows up on the towers shooting arows down on the enemies along with spell casters throughing there spells down from the walls while tanks and clerics battled it out on the ground.<br>
<br>
Just thinking about it brings a tear to my eye.  Heck I don't think the newbs would care either if they got slaughtered, there under level 10 mostly in that area and don't lose exp or items for death and would probably enjoy the show.<br>
<br>
And if you lose the fight the qeynos paladins come back with mustered forces and drive the enemy off.  I guess one way to work that would be have everyone thats in raid mode get a temperary flag when the event is started.  Moment last person in raid that had a temp flag is dead the qeynos paladins come in and finish the job.<br>
<br>
Or even have almost all of north qeynos get wiped out if you lose the event so that newbs can still use the bank and such in south qeynos.  Then say the paladins came up from south qeynos just in time to drive the enemys off before they flooded south qeynos as well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/21/03 1:15:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12458<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/03 1:39:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just thinking about it brings a tear to my eye.

<br>
I think with even less to lose (i.e. no XP loss possible), people in newbie zones wouldn't mind at all, so long as it wasn't a constant thing that prevented XPing. Maybe a once a day spawn for the NPCs to start the event or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jather>Jather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 725<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/03 1:46:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> So many ideas, and so much lack of effort by SoE.. <br>

<br>
Here's the thing...<br>
<br>
Every single game that has tried to do &quot;EQ without the sucky parts&quot; has seemed flat by comparison.<br>
<br>
Let's talk DAoC, since that's where I spent a fair amount of time. (I was a guild leader on Gawaine for a while and a member of a pretty good alliance)<br>
<br>
You want an end-game that's not just fighting computer AI? Fine, we'll give you Realm versus Realm. However, the graphic engine couldn't handle the masses of people. Also, zerging each other was pretty much the most effective tactic. Level meant absolutely everything because of level-based modifiers (although these were taken out after I left, so perhaps it's better) Finally, &quot;losing&quot; at RvR was pretty much meaningless. Dying didn't cost you XP or gold...only time, and that's if you weren't able to be rezzed on the battlefield. Losing a keep or relic ultimately didn't really impact you...one dungeon in the game was &quot;shared&quot; and could only be entered by the &quot;winning&quot; team and that came later in the game. Not sure about the loot in there versus the loot elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Tradeskills. Let's talk tradeskills. Mythic listened to folk who didn't like having to collect components or travel to do tradeskills. Instead, doing tradeskills in Camelot pretty much consisted of standing in one spot 95% of your time. (you had to be near a forge or other appropriate location) When you ran out of raw materials, you scooted 20 feet over to the NPC and bought more and scooted back. When combining, a timer bar would pop up --- as the recipes got harder, this bar took longer to move. That was it, for well over a year. Has that gotten any more exciting or challenging? There was talk of adding in drops from critters for better recipes or of having ingredients in RvR only zones, but I don't think those ever flew.<br>
<br>
Boring.<br>
<br>
You're a caster? You automatically got all your spells every level. No research, no dropped spells, not a penny spent to buy them. I always found that kinda sad.<br>
<br>
Boredom is the game killer...and making things too easy and convienient makes it dull. Some of the very things that the casual player whines about (and I am one) are the things that give EQ depth. Yes, yes, yes...some of the tedious aspects can be dispensed with. Boat travel is cute the first few times, but the Kunark boat was downright painful. Melee having to beg for binds sucked...the soulbinders went in shortly after my cleric got Bind Affinity and I grumbled about not being able to charge...but got over it quickly as my ranger benefitted. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ also has tons of fluff...like the booze code, fishing and other things that other games may throw out as &quot;extra, we don't need&quot; but that ultimately make the world a richer place. In my flirtation with Anarchy Online, for instance, I spent some time trying to get a pair of sunglasses. Did they actually do anything? No, but my character looked really cool with them. Does my wizard nuke better because he has a Fisherman's Companion? No...but people love it when I start passing the ale around!<br>
<br>
Again, my opinions....I find the difficulty and somewhat brutal nature of EQ one of it's charms. I know that I've earned my stuff and my levels and I've done some really cool quests in game.<br>
<br>
I am one of those younger folk, level wise, that Whizbang hints towards...my wizard is 38 and he's my highest character ever. You may read that last sentence and outright dismiss all my opionions, as I'm &quot;still a n00b&quot;. But I've also seen this stuff from the other side, having run one of the most popular NWN persistent worlds (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nordock.net">www.nordock.net</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->). When your content is shallow, the userbase gets bored and either starts to eat itself (PvP or other forms of abusive behavior) or moves on. I think EQ is still the deepest game in the genre and will hold my attention for quite some time to come.<br>
<br>
And to answer the original question, I still pop into Ak'Anon on a semi-regular basis. I know the vendors and eveything is at the proper height. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2n6q6/morlar.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
