Jiva, Xuzl, Riz, Dres, Lyxir, both the loots the drop and the flags for solro's chamber you get from them, are the reward for killing the lower tier Gods. These little bastards are another block in the road to the Elementals, I personally have a contempt for the way flags are awarded through this event, and a loathing for jiva greater then that of any other mob.<br>
<br>
I do not want to see a guild that cant kill tier 2/3 mobs running amok in SolRo killing the reward mobs.<br>
<br>
Tactics would be a bit better if you couldnt enter the areas the Zek's inhabit unless you had the MB flag.<br>
<br>
side note - If you dont have access to any plane because &quot;you chose to do other stuff instead&quot; then tough. Do trials, or spend 30 minutes in PoS, or whatever, and get the flag to get into the zone. Earn your keep.<br>
<br>
Your $12 + no work gets you Knowledge, Tranquility, Disease, Nightmare, Justice and Innovation. <br>
<br>
My $12 + hard work gets me everything but Time atm.<br>

<br>
My guild stormed through Velious and Luclin, with quite small numbers, and peaked just after PoP was released with killing Emp and going to VT. After a few clearings of VT, we decided to try to advance in PoP. PoP seems to have a vanishing effect on older EQ players. People got tired of trying out new tier1/2 bosses and wiping, waiting for spawns, and learning new tactics for killing PoP mobs which is totally different to anything previously. We started to lose members, mostly through leaving the game, but also the odd one or two to the guilds that got into the elemental planes. We are slowly rebuilding now, but were still too small to advance any further in PoP atm due to lack of people on. To kill the bosses, we need every single member, and we have about 15 MIA and more absent for reasons we know about. The zeks are next on our list, which are already killed as soon as they pop by a few guilds, so its tough to get a shot.<br>
<br>
If this patch comes in, then every newbie who has paid 15 bucks can go into Tactics and get in the way of our raids like they do when we go to PoV to kill AD or PoI to kill Behemoth. Let alone the fact that all our PoP advancement will count for nothing now, as all the flags we have will be given out free to anyone with an account.<br>
<br>
This is my view. If i was in the elemental planes, i might not care so much, but SOE really have to think these things through more thoroughly from every angle. Xar's suggestion is spot on, and i would love to see that take effect, but something tells me were gonna be stuck with pickup RZ raids =/<br>

<br>
The fact of the matter is in order to enter Sol Ro's chamber you don't just need the minis, you need Rallos Zek to enter. Getting the flags from the Minis amounts to absolutely SQUAT for a mid-range guild.  If you've killed the Sol Ro tower minis, you know the loot from it is really mediocre at best.  And in my opinion, is perfectly fitting to the reward of the hard work a mid-range guild would have to put in to get there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=acillatemzoso>Acillatem Zoso</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 2:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> I am in a casual guild.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know what exactly that means, let me tell you.<br>
<br>
We have 1 60+ ENC (65).<br>
ZERO 60+ Rogues<br>
2 60+ Monks<br>
3 60+ Rangers<br>
1 60+ CLR<br>
2 60+ WARs<br>
2 60+ WIZ<br>
1 Active 60+ SHM<br>
ZERO 60+ Mages<br>
An assload of Druids<br>
1 60+ BST<br>
<br>
I usually play 1-2 hours a day.  Sometimes I go 3-4 days without playing at all, and I'm considered one of the more &quot;active&quot; members in the guild (61 WIZ w/ 44 AAs - only 2 other people have more AAs than me in my guild 51 &amp; 55 respectively).<br>
<br>
We've killed Vindi, we've killed Va'Dyn, we're currently working on ToV.  99% of us are flagged for CoD and average guild level is around 61.<br>
<br>
Add to the fact we play on a PvP server, meaning your guild is ALL YOU GOT pretty much when it comes to accomplishing Trials/Key Quests etc.<br>
<br>
It is very hard for my guild to do the PoJ trials.  I've been actively working on getting people horses, MP3 items, Mastery 3, Fury 3 etc.  Everything I can to help in the Trial situation, but fact is - it's a once a week thing to get ENC, WAR, CLR, + 3 DPS people online, AND have the proper &quot;assistance&quot; classes (MAG rods, DRU buffs etc).<br>
<br>
Whizbang's argument makes sense.  If you set down goals you can accomplish them.    In the same time tho - it's pretty hard for some people to &quot;have the right people online&quot; to do these things, and being PvP (and roleplaying) we cant just sit in PoJ and wait for someone to zone over and help us.<br>
<br>
CoD key quest is EASY.  Especially with the latest patch.  Any guild 55+ (hell prolly 50+) could quite easily do this quest.  It took us 2 weeks to get about 20 people keyed BEFORE they changed it to group keying.<br>
<br>
I think the frustration comes in that casual people hafta work just as hard as the top tier people, but with less resources, and less time to do it in.  When my guild is spending all it's time and resources levelling, and buying people horses and spells so we can do the trials, and STILL have inferior gear compared to other people (I think I'm barely breaking 240 INT with KEI).  It's kinda hypocritical for &quot;ubers&quot; to say we don't deserve it.<br>
<br>
In all honesty I think a better solution would be implementing key quests similar in difficulty to get into CoD, with possibly a boss mob type encounter of &quot;relative ease&quot; (comparable to a Kunark Dragon).  Ubers can just do the Trial and bam get in, whereas casual guilds will hafta spend a bit more time doing the quest - a quest that culminates with a boss mob comparable to what many casual guilds can &quot;barely&quot; handle.  Kunark dragon might be too easy - maybe something similar to the Va'Dyn encounter.<br>
<br>
Either way, that would prolly be a better solution to the problem.  Casual guilds usually suffer from members who can play only 2-3 hour chunks at a time tops.  And even harder is getting the &quot;right people&quot; on for those same 2-3 hours.  An alternate quest like described above would allow casual guilds to take a week to do what ubers would do in 30 minutes tops.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt mind alternate quests like that - ones that require timesinks - as long as the timesinks aren't &quot;extreme&quot; and as long as we (casual players) arent given every opportunity to skip over content simply becuz other people &quot;whine&quot; about it.<br>
<br>
I think simply opening up PoV/S with a quest similar in ease to CoD would be a good enough start IMO, and NOT the 8-10 zones they are discussing making &quot;free for all&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12722<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whizbang's argument makes sense.

Wow really? I failed the trial 47 times before getting in. And that was at the release of Planes of Power. It's a learning curve. I believe SOE should not remove any flag requirements at all. You want to exp in these zones then earn it. Don't complain because your casual it should be just given to you thru lesser means.<br>
<br>
There is a progression every one must go thru. It's designed to level you up not only character wise but also in knowledge.<br>
<br>
Old EQ World<br>
Kunark<br>
Velious<br>
Luclin<br>
Planes of Power<br>
<br>
Progress in this fashion and i garuntee there is no way your guild can fail. The old world content may be easy to us &quot;Ubers&quot; now but it wasnt always so. We started out just like you all and progressed thru the content. We didnt just skip it because it was too hard. Learn the Curve then progress. You can't expect to go from wearing kunark armor to go right to the best that there is. Im sorry but thats unrealistic. Take the time to develop your character(s) properly and then earn the right like the rest of us did to be in these zones. It may be hard but the end result is well worth the extra effort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teluas>Teluas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> OK, correct me if I'm wrong here, but it looks to me that your &quot;compromises&quot; intend to make it easier for the ubers to back-flag, but hardly change anything to make it better for the mid tier and casual people.  Am I the only one who finds that to be the rantings of an elitist snob?  Just because uberguild_01 has new_recruit_01 that needs to catch up in flags, why should that person (or select # of persons) get special treatment regarding flags while the rest of us who actually have to find our own way through get screwed?  I'm not saying there SHOULDN'T necessarily be a way to make back-flagging less of a bitch, but what about the rest of us?<br>
<br>
Also, if I'm not mistaken, the quests for these zones that are already in place allow you to get in there to use it as an EXP zone, but not access to the major encounter there (i.e. the CoD flag... still need to kill grummus to access Bertoxx, yes?)  For someone that seems to know an awful lot, you don't take into consideration that VI may just be bypassing the need to do a quest to get exp.  I for one, am ALL FOR opening up all these zones on the list to ALL players... for exp purposes only.  If you wanna do the major events, get yer flags the right way then.<br>
<br>
OK, gonna summarize my thoughts here... on a huge caffiene buzz atm (4 hours of drinkin coffee at work), and reallycan'texpect ppl to follow my logic atm.  lol....<br>
<br>
-PoJ trials... leave em in.  I for the most part agree that it doesn't take much to pass one of them.  However, make it so that the trial does this:<br>
*Opens up PoV/PoS like it always has<br>
*Opens BoT as though you've done the PoS quest (I say this because there really is no other way to open it other than that way that I can think of)<br>
*Opens HoH, PoTactics, PoNb, PoTorment, and CoD as though you've done the quests allowing you access... which allows you to go in there and get exp and maybe kill a few nameds that don't usually give flags.  If you want to do that flagging event in those zones, go get yer standard pre-flag first.<br>
<br>
Now, I wouldn't doubt if there was flaws in my logic, and would love to hear input as well.  My only thing is that those of us who aren't in the &quot;top tier&quot; category should have a little easier of a chance too.<br>

We are from a small guild with around 50 people. My best freind plays and skyrockets threw lvls compared to me. He wants to play with his freinds and guild mates but gets little or no exp. When he does guild stuff he hurts himself by wasting his time for a blue of aa during a 4 hour period. If he does not do guild stuff and does his thing in POV or whatever then it builds guild resentment towards higher ups like him for being elitist. <br>
<br>
The other reason is some of my guild mates went through POJ trials close to 100 times before they finally got flagged and asking them to relive that experiance every time a new guildy gets to an appropriate lvl is like asking Willie Nelson to do your taxes. Most likely very painful for both hehe.<br>
<br>
Finally, let me say this last bit is not to be mean or condescending to any of you guys who have played much longer and are much better than me. The trials and key quest are not difficult to a guild of mostly 61 plus with all Luclin no drop gear and better. To the average guild it is quite an accomplishment to get their 3 to 6 guys of 61 plus flagged. This is fire power those guilds count on to get no drop gear for lesser members who are not up to par equipment wise and stregthens the guild as a whole. Which group should be hurt the 3 to 6 are needed by the rest so they can gear up for bigger encounters or the rest are making the 3 to 6 slow down to a near crawl so they can catch up.<br>
<br>
One final note here, I have another freind who went through the POJ trials 81 times and he is in ubber equipment by most players standards. He had the worst luck in the trials period and 99% of the time it was not his fault they failed. He was ready to quit the game. He got flagged for CoD one week ago and now all the sudden he loves the trial system and hates Sony for removing it. I reminded him of his past 4 monthes during trials and he admits that he simply does not want to share with a bunch of Newbs. I remind him that those newbs pay the same ammount of money as him, and admits he does not care. I remind him that after a week or so 90% of those newbs will be tired of dying like dogs in the soon to be unflagged zones and leave. He says a week is too long. I tell him he is being an ass and just deal with it. He says yep but I am better than them. I say you are a hypocritical ass and I will never group with you again, and drop him on my ignore list. I lost all sympathy after that for any argument to not remove the flags or any compromise what so ever. <br>
<br>
<br>
I may not be better equipped but I know how to play my class and that elitist crap gets old real fast. I know that some of you looked forward to the day you could gimp flag mobs and prevent others from getting to your hunting grounds. I know some of you looked forward to rubbing it in the nose of every unflagged person you could. Maybe just maybe this is what is known as karma coming back to bite some elitist basturds in the ass. I hope those like my ex friend get trained by newbs a bunch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12728<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 3:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Acceptable Compromises to Flag Removal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but hardly change anything to make it better for the mid tier and casual people. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Speaking as a mid-tier person, we're fine, thanks.

That's why I divided my ideas into sections.  perhaps you skipped over the parts that I mentioned for Casual players and Mid-level guilds.<br>
<br>
A key quest that does the same thing as the PoJustice trials, that is able to be done solo. (I found the idea of a boss mob interesting, but it needs to address the casual guildless players)<br>
Key quest pieces for Crypt of Decay that drop in Plane of Disease to be made Droppable, buy your way into Crypt of Decay!  That'll make the people that want in, and the farmers happy.<br>
Make the Block of Perillium drop more often in PoI, and be made droppable, as well as the Agony Mephit Heart droppable.  Same thing, the only other thing you need is the Crystalline Spider Brain (which I've seen drop quite a bit in Plane of Valor) and the souls in PoJustice which is really of mild difficulty.<br>
Make the requirement of entry to Bastion of Thunder one of two quests, the Esoteric Medallions, or the Beard, Sash, and Bone.<br>
PoTactics is really high reward vs. risk so the key quest I think should not be made much easier, but still mildly altered.<br>
PoNb is boring and stupid.  it's not an exp zone.<br>
PoTorment I need info on the key quest. and if there isn't one, there should be one.<br>
<br>
This IS a comprimise, because if the zones are just opened up, many players WILL BE OUTRAGED. It's selfish of them, certainly, but even though they understand that casual players want to see these zones, they won't consider it fair.  I'm trying to come up with ideas to avoid this happening.  I feel that dropping the key quests to just above the level of 'no-brainer' is a perfect comprimise.<br>
<br>
Mid-range guilds thrive on the wonderful feeling of Accomplishment.  Opening these zones will rob them of that. What will they have to work for now? If all those zones are just open for everyone, where does the mid-level content go?<br>
<br>
One point of view that often gets overlooked as well is Sony's point of view.  They have so much to do and handle, they need to do the least possible to satisfy as many people at once.  It's a company, that's the way they need to function to survive.  I'm laying things out in a very simple manner.  From Sony's side all they would need to do is make a few items droppable from no-drop, add 2 Key quests, change a couple spawn and drop rates, and add the backwards flagging.<br>
<br>
What if the PoValor/Storms quest required collecting 4 ground-spawn items on a 30 minute timer from PoKnowledge, PoTranquility, PoInnovation and Podisease, which you have in to any Tribunal in PoJ to prove Mavuin's innocence?  The PoI and PoD spawns will be in places where you would need to fight to and also fight mobs to keep the camp.  How's that?<br>
<br>
I'm not being elitist, I'm just trying to come up with solutions that won't piss off a ton of people in order to make some people happy.<br>
<br>
&lt;==EDIT==&gt;<br>
REMEMBER!  Key quests flagthe GROUP that does them.  If you have a friend that is higher level, outgoing and is able and willing to do these quests several times for his friends, you can rely on this ONE person to flag everyone else rather quickly. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0000;">S</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF1D00;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF3A00;">g</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF5900;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF7600;">X</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF9400;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFB100;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFCF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FFEC00;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:ECFF00;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:CFFF00;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:B1FF00;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:94FF00;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:76FF00;">N</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:59FF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:3AFF00;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:1DFF00;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF00;">l</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF1D;">f</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF3A;">l</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF59;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF76;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FF94;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFB1;">,</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFCF;">N</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00FFEC;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00ECFF;">k</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00CFFF;">a</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:00B1FF;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0094FF;">i</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0076FF;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0059FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:003AFF;">o</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:001DFF;">f</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:0000FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:1D00FF;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:3A00FF;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:5900FF;">6</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:7600FF;">5</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:9400FF;">t</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:B100FF;">h</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:CF00FF;">D</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:EC00FF;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00EC;">g</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00CF;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF00B1;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0094;">e</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0076;">B</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0059;">u</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF003A;">r</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF001D;">n</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:FF0000;">s</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It kinda sucks logging on, seeing everyone exping in tactics, HoH or Bot and not being able to join them. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, I am very proud of all of their accomplishments, and think it would be kinda crappy to see it all for naught. I mean, kinda seems like a waste of months of flagging peopel just to end up with everyone having a free ride. <br>
<br>
The only real problem I have with the current system, besides back flagging issues, is the setup of the PoJ trials. While I really enjoyed the encounter, my luck was horrible at it, and after spending weeks and weeks trying it, or looking for a group for it, or soloing sentries while waiting for a trial group, I am still without a mark to my name. <br>
<br>
Now if this were CoD, for example, I could have just did the key quest. Sure, it would have taken me those weeks and weeks anyways, and lots of deaths as well solo, but I would not have had to put my guildmates through trials over and over because of my bad luck. As much as I hate not being Storms/Valor flagged, I hate being a burden on my guild even more.<br>
<br>
So hell, put in a Storms/Valor key quest. Make it take a month of serious effort, and extremely challenging for a decently equipped lvl 60 solo if you like. If I'm not mistaken, once Valor/Storms is attained there are keys to be had all the way to Sol Ro if one wants. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't even mind if I had to go back and do trials anyways to progress to Sol Ro and beyond. I would just want a way to get beyond PoJ on my own merits, without having to constantly drag guildies back to try a trial once again. As much as my guildies didnt mind the contant trials, I minded, because it really sucks feeling like a burden. <p>Horanaf Stoutheart<br>

Now BoT is a zone that has been well thought out in terms of protecting blowable content.  Many folks are already flagged for BoT, and many people have already expressed an opinion that the zone is &quot;the new KC&quot;, with some justification.  However, the zone is separated in such a way that noone is going to be able to grief the Agnarr event very easily - two keys are required to even get near the event, and the first part of the event itself is not really going to be done by anyone short of a full raid.  Noone is able to accidently blow these spawns.  Tactics and HoH to name 2 examples, however, are a different story.  HoH trials don't have a particularly long respawn time, but it's long enough that if someone blows the trial it can throw out a guild's plans for the night.  RZtWL is another example that has been brought up quite a few times.  With these events as they currently are, opening up Tactics and HoH in particular could cause all sorts of problems.  It should not be done until something is done to lock off access to all events unless the people trying to access them have the appropriate flags.  Leave access to mini-bosses, but make sure only Tactics-flagged folks can access VZ/TZ/RZ.  Same goes for the other zones on the list to be possibly opened up.<br>
<br>
I think allowing access to Sol Ro's Tower might be going a bit far for unflagged folks. Make them do a quest to get access to all the zones that they intend to open up, this would make them work for their reward.  I suggest making it so that the pieces (to be obtained in all the tier 1 planes) are all doable by 1 non-uber group.<br>
<br>
Something should be done about Torment as well.  Even after opening up all the zones, I'd be surprised if many people went in there that weren't raiding. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104344">Uglukson Umberfists</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I'm just gonna ignore you trying to goad me into starting an argument thanks.<br>
<br>
Remember something.  I'm proposing these changes so SoE DOESN'T remove the flags on all those zones, I think you're ignoring that fact.  And I agree, Sol Ro Tower is a reward zone.  My guild right now is almost in the Elementals and at the Mini farming stage, and the loot we're getting is crap compared to other stuff we can get.<br>
<br>
And you have to think in the realm of the Mid-level guild.  Have you ever worked on the Key quests with a mid-level guild?  Have you ever worked on ALL the key quests?  have you considered how much time and effort goes into getting those keys, and how much effort getting the Sol Ro Tower key quest would involve?<br>
<br>
You said yourself your guild couldn't be bothered to camp greens for Vex Thal, well why the hell not?  VT gear blows away almost everything pre-elemental.  how many mid level guilds could you see getting completely flagged for Sol Ro Tower?  And if your server is heavily populated with them, how many would have the capability of setting up Sol Ro Tower mini raids?  The Minis drop two pieces of pretty good loot and a Rune each in my experience, and if a mid-level guild is able to fight up there and kill it, that's the equivalent of an Elemental capable guild taking out Bertoxx or Rallos Zek.  Makeing a key quest for Sol Ro tower would give mid level guilds something to Strive for, something they haven't had in a long time, and it really doesn't affect high end guilds at all.<br>
<br>
You don't want mid-level guilds getting into Sol Ro because they haven't gone through all the work of killing the planar bosses to get to Sol Ro Tower, yet you ignore how much work and dedication they've put into camping keys for these planes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=istari@graffeswizardcompilation>Istari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/03 8:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> imo...</span><hr size=1> in my opinion you should have to kill:<br>
