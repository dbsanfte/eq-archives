I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser – cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <br>
<br>
As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <br>
<br>
The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to &quot;Anchor&quot; an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch<br>

if this enchancement actually goes in the game though i will be retiring from eq altogether. <br>
i became a wizard to dish out damage, not to become crowd control, otherwise i would have played a freakin chanter, i dont have the nerve to do that, not after so many weeks of anxiously waiting for some sense to be kicked into verant. apparently no one is kicking. <br>

I will not be purchasing these shitty ass spells ( but they will probably be mob dropped and uber rare LOL). Mobs can be stopped from gating by simply using a DAMN STUN. On larger mobs, simply have everyone attack from one side. This is so stupid lol and you dont even have a 100% chance of it working. I cant remember the last time an enemy gated and caused a problem accept on one POG raid. A tranquil treant decided to leave the party and caused a mess. Other than that, give me a break! They better start making EVERY single mob in this game gate. That way they will NEED to have a wizard. This is totally insulting and they dont even listen to us at all! Masters of transport has nothing to do with another NPC in the game. Stopping someone from porting has nothing to do with transportation. I wonder where you got your education and listening skills from. You should be fired from Verant ASAP. How about Verant hires one of their customers who actually plays the game!!?? Make sense??? This in NO WAY helps up get groups and I take this as a slap in the face. /rude Verant and all the employees.<br>

How about for our upgrade, as sad as it is, make our damn epic barrier of force not self only! there you go.....<br>

The new enhancement is pathetic.<br>
<br>
Not being harsh, or exaggerating.  It truely is pathetic.<br>
<br>
It addresses none of the core problems with the wizard class.<br>
<br>
In the 'enhancement' post he went as far as to say our damage output is fine.<br>
<br>
When a rogue can dish out an Ice Comet worth of damage every backstab cycle .... over and over and over again, VI seem to think that a wizard, who is ALL about damage - nothing else, should be able to KEEP UP with a melee for 20 SECONDS before having to med and DO NOTHING for 10 MINUTES.<br>

For crying out loud.<br>

If I can stop something in ToV from gating and returning with a pile of its winged friends, I'll take it (cause folks stun DOESNT work on them, and all fighting on one side is not 100% effective either).  I'll take it for dragons in WW (Alerin, you let Von gate, again.....).  I can sympathize with people that feel that this enhancement is not going to help any wizards but those playing the high end game - you're right, it wont.  Then again the class balance for wizards below 50 is not as grossly misalligned as we are post 50.  I rarely had trouble getting a group in say SolB, where our evac ability usually landed me a spot.<br>
<br>
And I DID see the idea of a spell line that would prevent gating mentioned on the boards here as a possibility.<br>
<br>
Like when the Bane spells were announced I am excited to obtain these and try them out.  I just hope that they will A. not be quest, and B. not require an obscene component, and C. not turn out to be as disappointing as the Bane spells have been.<br>

However like many others, I fail to see how this will improve our grouping abilities in single exp group. A few accidents aside, when's the last time any group had a problem with gating mobs in seb or hs or any other exp places...<br>

At least the sorcerers will be happy now<br>

<br>
This spell will make wizards alot more disireable for peak encounters and also dungeons like DN.<br>
<br>
I think your idiots to be complaining about this upgrade because this upgrade seriously can revolutionize the tactics in this game.<br>
<br>
For example, why wait for trak to get in the right position, when you can just pull him to the bridge and kill him there.<br>
<br>
Have trouble keeping Hoshkar from gating?  Not a problem.<br>
<br>
ToV gating, solves so much issues like the post before mentioned.<br>
<br>
Just a number of things this spell will help out with.  The only thing im worried about is how well it works, and whats the mana/component cost?<br>

How does this help me get a GROUP?? I dont remember doing an exp group and pulling trak for exp.....Again I repeat... Gating can be stopped by attacking the mob on one side... this means rogues too... EVERYONE attack on one side... 99% success rate. Dont use pets with this either...<br>
