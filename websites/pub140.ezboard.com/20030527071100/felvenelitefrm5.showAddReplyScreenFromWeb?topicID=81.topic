I was confused. For the place I woke up was not where I had gone to sleep. I had gone to sleep in the world of men and woken up in the world of elves and dwarves. The last thought I remember having was that I was ready for a tale of gnomes, dwarves, elves and sprites. And now my bed was no longer a firm and yet soft wonder, it was now a warm pile of pelts and hand woven cotton. My clothing was no longer jeans and tennis shoes but a robe. A pair of soft, well-worn boots stood in the corner.  A candle stood on a low table. Texts littered a small desk in the corner of the room. A beautiful staff stood in the corner next to the boots. A small mirror and basin stood in the corner. Unlit candles were in sconces on the wall. A small window let in beautiful morning sun. I knew I wasn’t home. Home was my bed with my comforter that I cherished for the time it had been with me. Home was my other half and a houseful of kids and pets. This wasn’t home. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Eliani” Slaini called from down the hall. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ‘Gah Slaini, now I have really lost it’ I thought. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I rose, unaware of what my morning rituals should be. Where would I be without coffee and my dog and a hug from my other half in the morning and how could I get back? I had often wondered what this world would be like and was about to know. I did the best I could with what I could find to get dressed with. I found a red worn robe that I recognized and put it on. I put on the boots and looked around. A heavy pack lay next to the boots. There was NO way I could carry that all day. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I contemplated the pack and decided to leave it there for the time being. I opened the door and wandered down the hall. Voices from another room told me I wasn’t alone. I smelled warm delicious kitchen smells. I walked into a large open room and found about eight of the elite standing around. Slaini was in the corner. She walked over with a warm mug for me. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This is the closest you’ll get to coffee but I know how you and Nalitra are in the morning about coffee.” So Slaini knew that I was having a rather odd experience. I had never seen an elf up close before. Slaini was about the most beautiful being I had ever seen. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Can you explain to me what has happened and where my real life is?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No Sister, I cannot. But Tunare told me to watch out for you. That you were going to have a grand time.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yet you know that I am not Eliani.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know you as Eliani but you only know her as an avatar. That is the word, I think. Yet you see that the Avatars you create are more than figments of your imagination. I am fairly confused here. This is all information from Tunare. She says you are the one who gave Eliani life and that this is her’s and Eliani’s gift to you. She says you will be guided and know what to do here. Just tell the others that this is Eliani’s gift. A sharing of herself. They will understand.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wow, okay. I won’t worry as much then.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slaini laughed, “Yes you will, but we’ll take care of you. Come with me and we’ll hunt up some breakfast.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I didn’t really know what to say yet. So I just looked at her. She guided me to the other elves and I realized first hand how tall a BHE truly is. To see these people with my own eyes was almost too much. I needed Seyah to walk in and tell me that this was a dream and I’d be back to normal when I woke up. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seyah of the flaming red hair did walk in, but she didn’t utter those words. She hugged me and asked how I was this morning, like she was used to seeing me here. Maybe they didn’t know. I had no idea. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The last time I saw Eliani this quiet was when she was about 8 years old and got so ill she couldn’t speak” Slaini said, laughing. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So I knew I had to somehow explain this. “I have no idea how I got here. I went to sleep in a different world and woke up here. I am utterly confused. As far as I knew, you were all people I played an online game with.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone looked. Slaini explained to them all as best she could. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh this will be an adventure, then” Irislilly said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oooh we get to show you around, where do you want to go?” asked Aryllyian.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well I don’t like bugs or snakes. So, someplace without those.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Inyiin snickered at a table, “lets take her to Hate then.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Orin offered to shake me and see if that helped. Seyah glared at him and everyone laughed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well Bob will take care of most anything that would hurt you. I don’t think you have to worry.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well that does it, we must explore today. We’ll show Eliani the sights” someone said. Everyone agreed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was even more anxious than I had been before. But at least they knew. And they counted me as a friend either way. This would be a day to remember.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ummm , just be careful stepping out of the door. The ground is a long way.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone laughed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To be continued....<br>
(You may add to this if you like... this was inspired by a dream.)<br>
