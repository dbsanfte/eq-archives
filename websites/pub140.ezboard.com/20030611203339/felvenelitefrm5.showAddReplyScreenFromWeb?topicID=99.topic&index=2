<br>
The Pond</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The oracle Willius strolled casually along the cobblestone streets of Felwithe. It was the start of summer and a pleasant heat tinged the exotic night. Hints of festivity teased the barbarian's senses. Colorful, paper lanterns were strung across the facades of gleaming buildings and between them as well. Delicious aromas and the noise of mirth-inspiring music filled the air he breathed. With such sensation all around him, Willius couldn't help but channel the cheer that filled his spirit through the generous smile that split his handsome face. He allowed scent and sound to guide him through the winding streets and deliver him to the source of the merriment.<br>
<br>
Various faces were gathered along the banks of the city's shimmering pond. The light of the moon and hanging lanterns cast a flattering glow thatenhanced smiles and was partially dismissed a few grim looks. Still some distance outside the gathering of merrymakers, Willius took pause to survey the crowd before melting into it.<br>
<br>
He breathed a long sigh as he considered this body of mostly familiar faces that was the Elven Elite. It was the guild that had been his home until only recently. The Northman's memories came to celebrate with him, recalling the great battles, the hard struggles, and deeply satisfying victories of his tenure with the Elite. It was not an unpleasant moment to remember the good times and the bad. Willius was not a being to regret his past as he knew that it was the sum of his experience that made him the shaman he was today.<br>
<br>
&quot;Willius!&quot; a voice from the crowd interrupted Wilius' reverie. His thoughts returned to the present and his senses scanned the crowd briefly before finding the crier who hailed his arrival.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aryllyian!&quot; He greeted the shining, High Elf paladin with an enthusiastic salute before the two clasped hands, both chuckling at his formal greeting. At Aryllyian's side was the high priestess Irislilly, whom Willius greeted with a toothy grin and a respectful bow.<br>
<br>
Willius chuckled as humor re-shaped the Erudite priestess' smile, &quot;We've been friends too long to stand on airs now, Willius.&quot; She told him before seizing him with a hug as warm as the smile spread across her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;So true, Iris,&quot; he said, heartily accepting her welcome.<br>
<br>
Aryllyian waited for their embrace to break before speaking again, &quot;I'm so glad you could join us tonight as we honor the solstice and each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Willius replied, laughing loudly. &quot;Any reason ta celebrate with stiff drinks and good friends is just fine by me!&quot;<br>
<br>
The attention of the two brought on the notice of the many and Willius soon found himself on the receiving end of a line of welcomes, salutes, handshakes and hugs; and the majority of them sincere. The barbarian was no wallflower and responded with the humor that had won him such a list of friends and a few enemies. And though warmed by their greetings, Willius quickly tired of all the social niceties and found himself wishing the lot of them would just return to whatever distractions were being had before his arrival.<br>
<br>
It was quite a bit of time before his wish was granted. In the end he found himself standing against the wall of some quaint building, his fourth pitcher ale in hand, surrounded by a few laughing faces. His company consisted of the High Elf Spindley and his recent bride Lorrelei, and the Wood Elf lovers Giltaav and Kyeneia.  It was the ranger Giltaav who looked after the smiles that lit their faces with the telling of some recent adventure. Willius was only half-listening however. The bulk of his attention moved through the crowd, observing and searching through the various cliques.<br>
<br>
He considered Seyah, Krushh, Eillail, Sparkes and Laenyal as they conversed near the forge, noted their seemingly pleasant expressions and spent no time musing over the content of their discussion. He glanced a small assembly at the water's edge to find Wood Elf Wyture sandwiched between the contesting, hard looks of the Troll Nanbkek and his rival, the Half Elf Muzzic as a few others looked on with grinning expressions. Willius' thoughts lingered on the threesome at the heart of that group and he couldn't help but speculate on what words or regards were moving between them. He grinned as well.<br>
<br>
An explosion of laughter reigned Willius' attention back to his to the motley of friends before him. A light blush filled his cheeks as he realized the small group had swelled and now included the Vah Shir Nalitra, the High Elf cleric Spiritene and their respective companions, both Barbarians, Lucman and Jaered. Willius shook his head and secretly hoped his distraction was not so obvious.<br>
<br>
Where is she hiding? The question swam through his frustrated mind as he breathed what was meant to be a slight sigh, but sounded out as a hard grunt. More than a few pairs of eyes turned to regard him, the expressions surrounding them amused and curious.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to move around,&quot; Willius grumbled. He peeled away from the wall that supported his back and ignored the giggles of a few knowing souls in the crowd around him.<br>
<br>
Willius walked away from the crowd, away from the pond entirely and wandered further south through the city. It was his hope that a brief walk would calm the growing empty feeling that upset his belly. It was a futile exercise he knew, but he couldn't bear to stand still any more. He was not at all accustomed to waiting games. What little patience he knew was already spent and a knot of frustration had been left in its place.<br>
<br>
He moved briskly through the tunnel that bridged Felwithe proper with its south end only to find the object of his frustrations standing just beyond its egress. The sight of her brought him to an immediate stop. He absently muttered her name, &quot;Candra.&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius peered at the human enchantress before him, looking her up and down. Her long, dark hair was brushed smooth and fell down her back in an elegant line. She wore a black gown that teetered on the razor's edge between style and scandal and contrasted sharply with her creamy complexion. But all this was merely a frame for the twin masterpieces that were her eyes. It seemed to Willius that they caught the wan light and reflected it back a hundred fold; sparkling, mesmerizing violet.<br>
<br>
Willius knew he could lose himself in those eyes. What he didn't realize was that he already had.<br>

<br>
Candra took in the mountain of a man standing before her with an easy smile. His heart was beating faster than it should, making him ruddy and flushed. Beads of sweat wet the red moustache and the muttonchops that added to his barbarian flair and rough edges. She idly wondered if his excited state was the product of the liquor that she smelled on his breath, the thickening heat of the summer night, or the enchantment of adoring grace that always surrounded her. She made a guess that it was a combination of the three.<br>
<br>
Willius seemed satisfyingly surprised by her approach, although shock soon gave way to a wave of hungered emotions Candra took in with the pleasure of a gourmet sampling a new dish. &quot;Willius,&quot; she spoke his name the way he liked to hear it; soft and slow.<br>
<br>
The barbarian shaman responded with a hungry and boring grin of lust. His thoughts, in all likelihood never strayed beyond his most base desires. His only reaction was to shift his stance to shrug off his obvious discomfort. &quot;Good ta see ye again, lass. It's been some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Candra's cherry lips parted in a smile meant to thrill. &quot;It's been only a day since we last spoke, Willius.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A very long day,&quot; Willius replied. He peered about curiously then looked at Candra with a question &quot;And who is yer escort tonight? I doubt ya came alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Doubt? No, but you certainly hope</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The enchantress kept that thought to herself, but did not try to conceal the mischief that brought it to mind. &quot;I arrived on Jeez's arm, but it seems Fayeth has stolen him away from my side to discuss matters of faith and devotion. Having no genuine interest in either quality and feeling the onset of a mild headache I excused myself to take a quiet stroll away from the solstice celebration.&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius grunted his assent. Candra could read the frustration in his expression. It wasn't so long ago that the barbarian standing before her gifted her with a ring and the promise of his eternal, unconditional love. Despite her deep affection and the powerful passion she felt for him, Candra decided against marrying Willius. The two remained good friends still. Since then Candra had become engaged to the High Elf Jeez, though in the span of time leading from that announcement to the present moment that engagement had fallen apart and Jeez was now married to another. Candra kept both rings in a jewelry-box she purchased to hold her impressive collection of such keepsakes.<br>
<br>
Candra's skin prickled as Willius' jade-green gaze moved over her body. She could feel the heat of his regard scanning the curves of her body and the cut of the gown that dressed it. He seemed lost to the sea of creamy flesh immodestly displayed by a daring neckline. &quot;Carryin' on with a married man, Candra? Yer flirtin' with scandal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly,&quot; she laughed softly into the air between them, her eyes rocking slowly against their lids. &quot;We're just two friends enjoying each others' company at a very public affair. There's nothing salacious about the night's arrangements.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you say, enchantress. So you say.&quot; Willius' voice trailed off as if he was lost in thought. Candra couldn't but notice how his gaze lingered on her chest, but it was a few before she realized his attentions were not focused on her womanly attributes, but the locket resting against them.<br>
<br>
Candra flinched noticeably as she fought off the instinct to grasp protectively (or perhaps possessively) at the piece. A sense of growing desperation placed an ache in her belly and she struggled with the feeling for the sake of maintaining her cool, calm façade. There were more subtle ways to distract his attention from her latest acquisition.<br>
<br>
Candra brightened her smile and focused her attention on the larger-than-life Willius. Or, more properly, she focused his attention on her. The blood in her veins grew hot and she pulled his eyes to her. To her flesh, her eyes, her hair. Her voice breezed over his subconscious mind. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Am I not beautiful, Willius?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Willius reacted, certainly. She saw admiration, lust, even fascination, bloom in him. His pupils dilated and his neck produced a few beads of sweat. His hands shook just a bit. He licked his gaping lips to wet them and murmured absently, &quot;Most beautiful...&quot;<br>
<br>
Candra grinned at Willius like a cat with a belly full of mouse. &quot;You should go now, darling.&quot; Her voice was soft and sweet, even gentle. The power that rode it, however, was demanding. That power transformed her enticing request into the charm of command. &quot;You're awfully tired and it's so late. Go to your bed now and sleep. When you wake you'll remember only that you had a grand time in my company before taking your leave. You'll forget about my necklace along with any thoughts regarding its design or nature. Understood?&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius seemed transfixed as he replied, &quot;Yes, mistress. I should go,&quot; he leaned forward to place a kiss on her lips and Candra let him. Though she would never admit it, Candra savored the simple joy of being with him and felt the undercurrent of passion long denied building anew. She allowed the kiss to linger for longer than was prudent, but eventually found the will to break their embrace. She was more than a little surprised when Willius hold of her tightened and held her still.<br>
<br>
The barbarian grinned wolfishly at her, &quot;I said 'I should go', not that I would.&quot; He quickly stole another kiss before the enchantress could react. As her small hands pushed and her womanly shape struggled against his muscular form, Willius found it impossible to hold back the loud, bellowing laughter that had been building inside him since the enchantress' charm had faded. He finally set her free as her futile tantrum only made him laugh harder and his belly was aching from the excitement.<br>
<br>
Candra in turn reacted with an anger that brought brilliant color to her face. &quot;How could you?!&quot; the velvet was slipping away from her voice now and revealing cold iron beneath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy now, 'chantress. Let's not forget just who should be tha one upset here.&quot; Willius was still laughing as he attempted to arrest the situation. &quot;We agreed that ya would keep yer mind tricks to yerself.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was little to argue about and Candra was fully aware of that fact. The embarrassment for her folly and anger for her failure left her feeling warm and flustered. She took a moment to catch her breath before making a feeble attempt to save face. &quot;You kissed me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya let me,&quot; Willius countered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I didn't. It wasn't like that.&quot; An obvious lie, but she remained unwilling to live with knowledge of that truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;And ya liked it, I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Arrogant bastard!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Candra was losing ground with this argument and she knew it. She'd lost the upper hand and with that control of the situation. She needed time to think and that was the one thing Willius was not willing to give her. With a sigh she turned about and cast her gaze towards the heavens to take in the velvety night sky, the diamonds that twinkled against it and the silver sorcery of the full moon.<br>
<br>
Willius laid a hand on her bare shoulder and she shivered. His hand was rough, but still impossibly gentle. “Tha spirits grow restless in yer wake, Candra.” He turned her about to see her face, search her eyes. “They murmur of dark deeds and even darker sorcery. Tell me, lass, what have ye done?”<br>
<br>
Candra was barely aware of her arms folded over her chest or the tension that was moving through her body. She was uncomfortable under the scrutiny of the shaman’s powerful gaze. His Craft was something she could not fathom, born from a realm she could not access and entities she could neither charm nor control. Talk of spirits made her nervous. “I don’t have time for this prattle, Willius.” She started to leave, but Willius’ grip on her shoulder held her fast and forced her to look at him.<br>
<br>
“Yer a fool if ya think yer alone, Candra. The spirits surround ye, slumbering in yer home, nestling in yer clothes, kissing you through that comb in yer hair. They’re everywhere. Ye can’t see them, but I can. I can hear their cries,” his green eyes darted to the locket resting against her breasts then returned to her eyes, “I can feel their pain.”<br>
<br>
“Enough!” Candra clutched the locket against her chest and shrugged off the barbarian’s touch. “You don’t scare me with all this talk of nonsense, Willius.”<br>
<br>
Intense color crept into the rough edges of Willius' countenance, his ears and cheeks and neck. Candra could feel the heat radiating from his mountainous body. Still he showed remarkable restraint when he spoke. “Yer no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mystery</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ta me, Candra. I see ya for what ya are. Ambitious, lying, conniving. I’ve never once complained, never once thought ta interfere with your schemes, or to turn ya from these strange ways. But there comes a time...”<br>
<br>
Candra had heard enough. Her ego, her fear, her guilt and greed – none could bear the burden of shame that Willius was attempting to evoke. It took only a moment for the enchantress to connect with thoughts, the fiery passion that drove him and snuff it out like some candle whose light was no longer needed. He stood before her, mesmerized and impotent. A slick of drool ran from the corner of his mouth.<br>
<br>
“Remember nothing, Willius.” She commanded and he had no choice but to obey. The barbarian blinked as his memories fled and the enchantress along with them. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 5/21/03 7:52:10 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
