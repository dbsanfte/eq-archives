<br>
As a young man seeking to apprentice myself to the wizard guild I arrived in Freeport wide eyed and full of awe. I had never seen so many people in my life! People were running everywhere so fast I could not stop anyone to ask for directions. I saw a kind looking man at the front gate whom I approached to solicit some assistance. As I was marveling at the wonderous items he had on his person I was startled to have him glare at me and mutter &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; I was trying to apologize and explain that I did not mean to stare but that I was simply new to the city when he challenged me to duel him to the death! I knew I would be no match for him so I wandered off, scared that I would be a victem of the city before I had a chance to learn how to survive.<br>
<br>
Eventually after wandering the streets I came across the Academy of Arcane Science. With new found encouragement I rushed in to find Opal Darkbriar, a powerful Sorcerous that I had been told to seek out. Opal gave me a robe marking me as a trainee and a dagger as well as teaching me two begining spells. After a few quick moments practicing my skills with the dagger I was sent to help clean out the vermin outside the city gates. On my way out I approached a guard to ask him a question, apparently he thought I was attacking him!! He hit me so hard that I did not regain conciousness for several minutes. Luckily I did not have any possessions to be robbed of while lying face down in the street.<br>
<br>
Armed with my offensive and defensive spells, as well as my trusty dagger, I set forth determined to rid the city of its pests and prove myself worthy of advacement through the ranks at the Academy. As I approached my first victem, a rather large rodent, I set a small chunk of ice at him, ice called forth with the basic magic I had been taught by Opal. What a thrill it was to see the ice shoot forth from my fingers and envelope the unsuspecting rat. How quickly my thrill turned to terror as the rat turned and ran at me teeth bared. I tried to call forth the magic only to find the words slip from my mind as I was unable to concentrate under such a ferocious assault. I tried to no avail to use my dagger on the beast but it was so enraged that my feeble jabs only seemed to amplify his ferocity. Realizing that my life was in danger I fled towards the city guards hollaring for help. They dispatched the rat with a knowing smirk shared between them and returned to their post. To my wonderment I watched as my wounds began to disappear and realized that it was due to magic coming from a young, scantily clad, female with pointy ears. After healing my wounds she introduced herself as Kloey and her companion Zolac, a tall fellow also studying the magical arts. He was studying conjuration and was hopeful of one day becoming a Magician. I was both curious about Kloey's strange features and at the same time captured by the beauty of them. She told me that she was a Wood Elf from a the city of Kelethin across the ocean. She had traveled far and had just arrived in Freeport herself. Both she and Zolac had also been assigned the duty of exterminating the vermin around the city so we joined together and began a wholesale slaughter of the little beasts. As our night concluded we bid each other farewell but promised to try to find each other again so that we could continue to develop our new found friendship, if only we could have known how close we would become.<br>
<br>
As the seasons passed and we continued to journey farther and farther from the safe confines of the city we met another young magic user by the name of Seperith. Sep knew more of the lands we were now traveling in and became a great asset to our team. The four of us now scoffed at the rats and beetles that crossed our path and had moved on to slaying meddlesome bears that were troubleing the inhabitants in the areas near the city. As we continued to advance our reputations with the local population so did we advance in our power. I myself had been back to the acadamy to continue my studies and had learned a powerful spell to shoot a ball of fire from my hand! I knew I was well on my way to achieving the power I was seeking.<br>
<br>
One day as Seperith and I were traveling about in the commenlands near Freeport we heard a young human being persued by two lions shouting for help. We quickly dispatched the lions and made sure he was ok. He introduced himself as Flyer and told us he was an enchanter and a jewel crafter. I knew at that moment that Flyer was someone that I would know for a long time, call it fate or call it instinct but I was sure we would become fast friends.<br>
<br>
Soon I met Anathn and Adarr, a couple of crazy travelers who came from the continent across the sea. I had been getting the itch to see more of this world and agreed to travel with them to their homeland. After an eternal boatride we arrived at the shores of Faydwer, home of the Gnomes, Dwarves and Elves, and they took me to see many strange new places. We fought valiently against the orcs and minotaurs that plagued this continent. We found many treasures and, unlike the creatures I was used to fighting, these dropped a little coin as well. Feeling stronger and wealthier I was ready to go back to the Academy to see if it was deemed I was ready to advance in my studies. New powerful spells were given to me and I finally felt like a true wizard, although I knew I had far to go.<br>
<br>
Soon our group of friends headed towards the Oasis, a lake in the middle of the desert south of Freeport. By now we were comfortable traveling together and had learned to fight as a team. Upon arrival in the oasis we encountered a skeleton. We had slaughtered many of the foul undead and were not concerned as we join the battle but soon we realized this was no ordinary foe. His strength was incredible and he combined magic with his steel to give us a fierce battle. Suddenly out of nowhere two strangers joined the fray. One was an ogre, 8 feet tall and 500 pounds, he was a fierce looking creature but later we found him to be gentle and playful. It was amazing to watch this gentle giant go from telling a joke and drinking a beer to a fiercesome fighting machine. His companion was even more perplexing. He was a dwarf, Aidin was his name, and like all dwarves appeared to be gruff and stoic but there was a twinkle in his eye and a dry wit that showed a caring soul beneath the crusty exterior. The other amazing thing about this fearless fighter was his ability to enter into battle with an axe in one hand and his ale in the other. Not only did he never spill a drop but he managed to enjoy his drink even in the middle of the battle. We sat with our new friends sharing stories and beer, I am still amazed at the quantity of beer these two could put away, and discussed the land we lived in and the evils that could be found in it. Suddenly a lumbering giant made his way towards us carving out a path of destruction behind him. We quickly got to our feet to get out of his way and to our surprise Aidin and Cass, slamming a beer and uttering a gutteral war cry, charged in and attacked the giant! The giant did not even pause and cut both of our friends down in one fell stroke and wandered off across the desert. I could not believe our new friends were gone so fast. I did not know what to think or do when suddenly I felt a small tug at my sleeve. A gnome was standing there and asked if I would like to have my friends resurrected. I had no idea what she meant and I could not speak due to the lump in my throat but I must have nodded because she began to cast a spell in a magical language I did not recognize. Shocked I watched as Cass and Aidin rose to their feet, dusted themselves off and, laughing about their attempt on the giant, went off in search of a fresh beer. What in the name of Mithaniel Marr was that I asked? Cass snickered and Aidin explained that the gnome was a cleric and they had the power to restore life. Apparently Cass and Aidin were regularly brought back to life by these samaritans.<br>
<br>
Time passed and our group of friends grew closer. Through my studies at the academy I had heard that a group that was deemed worthy by the gods could be marked so as to be distinguished from others and recognized as a group favored by the gods. I knew that no group of friends could be more deserving then these that I had met. Nightly I prayed to the gods that this group, that had become like family to me, be deemed worthy enough for this distinction. We were hunting in the Western Commenlands when I voice boomed inside my head like thunder. &quot;You have been summoned by the gods&quot; it said and I found myself suddenly standing in an incredible place that awed me. I huge gate stood before me with a sign that read &quot;Discord Reigns Within&quot; I do not need to tell you how afraid I was! A tiny dark elf came out from the gate and explained to me that my friends and I had been noticed by the gods and that we were to be tagged with the emblam &quot;Mirth and Mayhem&quot; so that all would see that we were favored by the gods for our actions. I blushed a deep red when she told me that I was to be there leader. I nodded as she explained to me that I was to keep them whole and healthy and that I would be held accountable for their actions. She asked if I was prepared to accept such a grave responsibility. &quot;I am&quot; was all that I could manage too utter when suddenly I felt a change come over me. I do not know quite how to explain it, suddenly I felt taller and prouder. I was honored to lead this group and knew I would do my best. I did not notice but along with the jubilation there was also a small weight now inplanted on my shoulders, a weight I would begin to feel in the years that followed.<br>
<br>
Seasons went by and the ranks of Mirth grew. We became known through out the land as a group of charitable, fun loving, noble and friendly people. Our membership swelled to a point where we could not accept any new members although many wished to be part of such a fine group. I finally reached my 20th season and was taught the secrets of traveling by Opal and the other wizards at the guild. What a wonderous gift! By summoning the magic around me I was able to create a shimmering portal in the air and step through it to travel to lands across the world. Additionally powerful new spells were added to my offensive arsenal. Creatures that had terrorized me in my youth were dispatched with a spell and a yawn. Power corsed through my veins and yet it was not enough, the more I learned the more I craved. Sleepless nights were spent trying to prove that I had mastered what I had learned and that I was ready to be taught more. With my new powers, the ability to travel, and the finest guild in Norrath behind me I felt like I was destined for great accomplishments.<br>
<br>
An army without a war soon grows restless and I searched for a task that would challenge our fighters and healers and casters. An appeal came from the lands of Qeynos to help eradicate an evil clan of Goblins that lived near by. These goblins had built themselves a fortress near the city and named it Runny Eye (at the time I did not appreciate the implecations of the name). These goblins were launching atacks on the locals in the area and several children had come up missing. We prepared to invade this cidadel and wipe out these goblins to save the residents and to win their favor. Preperations were made and we began our march across the Karanas to Runny Eye. We traveled through a massive gorge where the cidadel was alledgedly located. Firocious minotaurs were met and quickly defeated as we continued our march, nothing would stop us from our self appointed duty. Finally we arrived at the stronghold and cautiously made our way inside. A few goblins near the entrance were quickly dispatched before they could raise an alarm and soon our entire force was inside and ready to penetrate the depths of the place. I selected a small rogue, Thistleknot by name, to scout ahead and report back what he found. Thistle was a halfling and capable of disappearing into the smallest shadow so I was shocked to hear his cries for help shortly after he ventured away from us. Thistle came running around a corner towards us with no less then 15 goblins chasing him. I had never seen such a hoarde and a great battle ensued. The goblins were eventually defeated but not without cost. I looked around me and watched as our clerics went to work. I had never seen so many of my comrades defeated before at one time and although we had won the battle the weight that had been inplanted on my shoulders grew greater. Several more battles insued and we began to learn the ways of the goblins and were able to astain less and less damage through each fight. We began to venture deeper and deeper into there lair and our confidence continued to rise, surely nothing could stop such a noble cause. A long hallway streched before us and decend rapidly into the earth. Cass turned to me and said &quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot; and I could not help but agree. I sent Thistle out once again to scout ahead but after 5 minutes he had not returned and the silence of the place became deafening. Soon another rogue was sent out to scout and as soon as he rounded out of site his screams of pain filled the cavern. Abruptly his cries were silenced and around the corner came a gigantic disembodied eyeball! It was at least 5 feet across and I immediately recognized the words of magic coming from it. I tried to shout a warning but my words were cut short as a blast of fire filled the hallway and the black shroud of death enveloped me. Accounts of what happened afterwards vary but apparently the goblins had gathered there forces behind us and we were pinned between the eye and the goblins. A couple members managed to get out alive but most were wiped out. A long process of recovering bodies ensued and the clerics went to work. When everyone had been healed and resurrected we departed from the city and headed home. The goblins would not venture out of their city in pursuit but they stayed at the gate jeering and yelling threats at our backs until we dissappeared from site. Our mission had failed and the weight grew once more.<br>
<br>
I knew that I must do something to lift the spirits of my friends so a party was thrown at a beautiful lake south of the lands of Karana. Matches were held and prizes given for those that could prove their skill in the arena. Great quantities of Ale and Beer were consumed (mainly by Casser and Aidin) and all had a great time. The evening culminated with a gigantic free for all fight. I uttered the words &quot;on your mark, get set, go&quot; and watched in horror as the entire guild turned and made sure I was the first one out. A good time was being had by all until &quot;he&quot; showed up. His name was Xenon and he was a powerful wizard. I had heard rumors about him from my guild leaders and it seemed even the gods knew of his reputation for causeing trouble. He walked into our celebration and began killing people just for &quot;fun&quot;. We tried to attack him in force but like a coward he would just run away and then come back. A tear came to my eye as I watched Aidin, full of pride, step forth and challenge Xenon to a duel to the death, a duel he had no chance of winning. No sooner had his body been resurrected then he was back in front of him challenging him again. A plan was made and a trap was set. Xenon was taunted into the arena where he quickly found himself rooted to the ground by a powerful druid that had come to aid us. His name was Graywulf and once again a friendship was formed that would survive the test of time. With Gray's help in preventing the coward from running we quickly swarmed over him and laid waste to him. We danced on his corpse and raised our glasses in salute to one another. Once again my heart was filled with pride as I watched this guild rise up as one, as brothers, as friends and defeat the evil that had dared to draw their wrath. Graywulf decided to join our cause and be marked as a member and again we became stronger. We left the arena happier, closer and of course drunker then we had ever been.<br>
<br>
Seasons came and went as did our members. Some disappeared from Norrath forever while others simpky went in search of different adventures. Together we had adventures and victories, friendships were forged that will last forever. Alas the weight on my shoulders had grown to a point that it was almost unbearable. I would not have changed any of the events that had led me to this point, they made me into who I was, but I knew it was time for a change for me. A powerful spell was made available to me, a spell that would rip open the fabric of time and space. This spell would transplant me to another world that was an exact duplicate of the one I had grown to love so much. This spell could only be cast at a certain time when all the planets were aligned, a time that was drawing close. I agonized over the decision of leaving so many behind that I loved. Finally I decided that it had to be done, the weight was too much for me to continue on as leader. I could not bear the thought of the goodbyes so I decided to keep my departure a secret, a cowardly move but one I had to take. The eve before I was to cast the spell I sat with Zolac and Kloey and explained to them my intent. They begged me to reconsider but my mind was made up. We hugged and cried til I could not take it anymore. I said my goodbyes and left to prepare myself for my journey.<br>
<br>
The spell is cast and I am now wandering a new world, new but the same. The weight is gone and I am a seasoned wizard now. I am able to wander the world and seek out adventure and new friendships. The burden of leadership is gone and I have discovered a new love for life.<br>
<br>
Every once in a while I return to Freeport and I will see a young wizard apprentice standing at the gates looking around in amazement. I smile when I think back to my youth and me standing at that same spot, all the things that were going through my mind. I will approach these young wizards and tell them, &quot;Embrace the magic, embrace this world and most important embrace the people you will meet in it. Prepare yourself young wizard, an incredible journey awaits you.&quot; <br>
