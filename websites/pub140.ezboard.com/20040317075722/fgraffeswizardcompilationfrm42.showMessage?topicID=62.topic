<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The sands of time have run out.  The shadow that has fallen upon Norrath now recedes.  The age dwindles and falls, claiming with it another civilization to conflict.  As mortal armies rush blindly towards defeat, the Burning Prince comes to consume all.  The heretics shall fall before His wrath.  The followers shall fall upon fools.  And His spear shall be lifted unto the heavens and all of Norrath will tremble before His burning power.  The echoes of war shall sound throughout the land and all of Norrath shall be consumed in a never-ending inferno.  Thus will the Age of Flame begin.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
It was that time of year again.  That time always came.  Possibly one of the few times the Koada'Dal and Feir'Dal put aside their pride.  For a week, the gnomes and dwarves were not seen as inferiors, but as friends.  It was the single time of year where the average elf could treat a gnome or dwarf with respect without an awkward sense.  It was time to celebrate Tunare.  All the believers reveled in the days of celebration, and on the last evening of the festivities, all the non-believers were invited to come.  The idea was to try to convert them.  Although, truth be told, the gnomes just turned out for the women, and the dwarves the ale.  <br>
<br>
Ikeya grimaced.  It was his least favorite time of the year.  The paladins would round up all the local non-believers and lock them up in one of the inns and not let them out until the last day, for their chance to be converted.  Then there were the gnomes and dwarves; tiny little creatures, running drunkenly around his knees.  Ikeya shuddered at the thought.  It wasn't that he hated gnomes or dwarves; it was just that he hated large groups of them.  Sadly, it always seemed their entire population showed up for the celebration.  Sighing, he opened a scroll and began to read... and wait for the paladins to come and take him away.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Tearis Thex sat on his throne, his advisors giving details on the upcoming festival.  The paladins would be coming shortly to ask permission to lock the heretics away.  Tearis winced.  Every year there were some new people who converted, but there were always many more who refused to.  He sighed.  The festival was meant to be one of the most joyous times of the year.  Indeed it was; however, the refusal by a few of his brothers to submit to the Mother weighed heavily upon him.  He frowned, remembering one of his brothers, who last year had cursed Tunare's name.  He had shouted that he was a follower of Solusek Ro and would not change his path.  Tearis winced again in mental anguish.  The memories of Takish-Hiz came flooding back to him at the thought of the Burning Prince.  The white marble towers, the trees that lined the streets, the grand forest at the city's edge.  Takish-Hiz was the most beautiful city in all of Norrath... until Solusek Ro destroyed it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, now is not the time to dwell upon the past</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Tearis thought, shaking his head to clear his mind of the memories.    He looked up and saw the double doors to the room swing open. Marching in was a group of paladins.  Tearis noted that one of them was carrying a scroll.  Waving a hand toward one of his advisors, he beckoned for a quill so he could sign the order granting the paladins the permission they needed to imprison the heretics.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
It was a knock on the door that woke Ikeya up.  He considered not responding, but frowned.  If he didn't respond, the paladins would just enter his home anyway and look for him.  Ikeya focused on the door. It bounced open and slammed against its frame with a loud crack.  The two paladins that had come to take him away were clearly shocked.  Ikeya permitted a smile as he saw their expressions.  After a few seconds, they regained their composure and walked into the room.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We request that you come with us,&quot; one of the paladins said bluntly.  <br>
<br>
Ikeya wrestled with the thought of not acquiescing to the request, but the result was never in doubt.  If he refused, the paladins would just start reciting the annoying order the king signed that gave them permission to collect the 'heretics.'  Ikeya nodded indifferently and stood up, hunching his shoulders to stretch out their stiff muscles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we?&quot; he said politely.  The paladins stood on either side of the door, waiting for him to pass.  He glanced at the soldiers as he walked by, and saw two unfamiliar faces beneath their silver helms.  They had to be new to the order.  He chuckled to himself.  It would explain their reaction to the way he opened his door… after all, he greeted the paladins the same way every year.  The self-satisfying salutation was costly, however, as he had to replace his door each time. <br>
<br>
His smile vanished as the paladins ushered him into the group of heretics waiting outside.  He nodded at the motley crowd.  They were all familiar with each other, though their numbers dwindled each and every year.  Ikeya found it somewhat ironic that the Karana worshippers were also rounded up, seeing as Karana and Tunare were supposedly allies.  Apparently, the feeling of unity didn't extend to their followers... or at least it didn't to that fanatic fool Thex.  As the paladins pushed him into the middle of the group, he saw a face he didn't recognize. <br>
<br>
&quot;So tell me, stranger, what brings you among our rebellious crowd?&quot; Ikeya asked the newcomer, as the group began walking under the watchful gaze of their sentries.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Jather.  I've spent the past few hundred years off of Faydwer.  I just came back a few months ago.  It appears my timing was... poor,&quot; the stranger replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed it was.  They gather all of us up, whether we worship Solusek Ro, Karana, Mithaniel Marr – any of the gods besides Tunare. They just collect us and throw us into an inn for the week.  Not exactly an event I'd say the Koada'Dal should be proud of,&quot; Ikeya concluded softly, lest he attract the attention of one of the high, noble, and easily affronted paladins.  &quot;So tell me, who do you follow?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jather stood up a bit straighter and assumed an aura of pride as he said, &quot;I am a follower of the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Ikeya held back a smile.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah... the young and prideful...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Ikeya thought.  He used to be like Jather.  He was still proud to be a follower of Solusek Ro, of course, but the years of the festivals had taken their toll on him.  His patience was wearing thin.  Not with the festivals themselves, but at the blind passion with which the old king followed Tunare.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah... so there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> other followers of the candlestick,&quot; a condescending voice interjected.  &quot;I bet Ikeya is thankful for the company.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jather's head snapped toward the direction of the voice.  Ikeya simply nodded his greetings to Aurianne.  Aurianne was a follower of Karana, and the only reason Ikeya tolerated her was because she was rounded up with the rest of them.  Aurianne tolerated him only because the paladins seemed to make it a point to give him a hard time.  Jather was about to make a retort, but one of the paladins ordered a halt to their march.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You will all be staying here for the week,” the leader called. “Food and drink will be provided daily,&quot; he said as the rest of his men pushed the cluster of elves into the inn.  He slammed the door and continued on his way.  They were only heretics after all.  They didn't warrant his attention.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Ikeya clapped his hands together, surveying this year’s roundup.  <br>
<br>
“So, what are we going to do for the next six days?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Nothing that involves you and fire,” someone shouted.  “We’ve destroyed enough inns.”  There was a burst of laughter from the assembly as they remembered the countless times Ikeya or someone else had managed to devastate the inn they had been assigned to.  It was amazing that Felwithe continued the practice, since the cost of containing the so-called “heretics” often rivaled the cost of the festival itself.  The collateral damage was usually extensive.  Locking up wizards and magicians in a tightly compact room wasn’t the best idea to ever come down from the royal court.  On the other hand, the destruction usually paved the way for renovation of a city block.<br>
<br>
“Now, you know the last time wasn’t strictly my fault.  It was Aurianne’s lightning bolt that started that fire,” Ikeya called back with a small smirk.<br>
<br>
“Only because you moved,” Aurianne sneered.  “Had you been gullible enough to stand on the ‘X’ that fire could have been avoided.”<br>
<br>
Ikeya snorted.  <br>
<br>
“Yes… but that doesn’t change the fact that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> missed.”<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Thex eyed the group of heretics, who stood in a large cluster near the edge of the forest.  The week seemed to go by fast.  It was already the last day of the festival, and the heretics had been brought out.  They seemed to be in good humor this year, which really didn't surprise him.  He wasn't completely oblivious to what happened in Felwithe.  The non-believers had made quite a mess of the inn they had stayed at.  The wine cellar of the inn had exploded and made a mess, to say the least.  They had also managed to set the kitchen on fire.  Thex wasn't entirely sure what they were trying to make, but it obviously hadn’t gone as they had planned.  He grimaced.  Now it was time for him to make his speech to try and convert the heretics... and bring one to punishment.<br>
<br>
One of the followers of Solusek Ro stepped down from the platform.  Her answer after Thex's long and boring speech was the same as it was every year: she would not renounce her loyalty to the Burning Prince.  <br>
<br>
As the king prepared to call the next one forward, a roar came from the back of the crowd.  Apparently, the dwarves had found an untapped keg.  The gnomes were busy elsewhere setting up their fireworks for the end of the festival.  He smiled.  While the dwarves and gnomes were never considered the equals of the elves, they were dependable and friendly.  He took a deep breath and his smile vanished.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ikeya, step forward,&quot; he said.  Ikeya hadn't taken on his family's name, or a surname of his own.  For hundreds of years he had been known simply as Ikeya.  Some people said he had taken on a surname for brief periods of time, but he often discarded them.  When asked as to why he did this, he only responded that his name was not important, only his faith.  Thex took another breath.  &quot;Ikeya,&quot; he said nodding at the Dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;King Thex,&quot; Ikeya replied matter-of-factly.  His voice was calm, indifferent.  He did not pledge his loyalty to Thex or Tunare.  The only respect Thex got out of him was his title.  Thex began to sweat.  Now it was going to get interesting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ikeya, I know your answer,&quot; he began.  He raised a hand to stop Ikeya from speaking.  &quot;I did not call you forward to attempt to convert you.  I have called you forward so that you may be punished for your actions,&quot; he continued.  Ikeya's eyes blazed with anger for a moment, but the flame was quickly subdued.  &quot;The punishment for your crime is exile,&quot; Thex declared.  The crowd was silent.  Dwarves had put down their glasses, gnomes stood like statues, their fireworks forgotten.  The other elves were overcome with shock.  &quot;Have you anything to say?&quot; Thex finished.  <br>
<br>
Ikeya’s eyes flickered as he sorted through his countless memories, recalling his crime.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“I don’t understand this obsession you have with Solusek Ro.  What is it that drives you toward him?” a paladin asked him, setting his wineglass back on the table.<br>
<br>
Ikeya swirled his goblet idly as he considered the question.  <br>
<br>
“Well… For one thing, he is the patron deity of wizards.  And his doctrine puts an emphasis on power.  Something everyone strives for.  The more power one has, the better off one is.  Why deny the truth?  Solusek Ro is power.”<br>
<br>
The paladin gave him a puzzled look.  <br>
<br>
“That’s absurd.  You realize you are claiming loyalty to the god who scorched the Elddar Forest and destroyed the Tunarian Empire!”<br>
<br>
“What better display of power is there,” Ikeya replied, smiling at the paladin, “than to set ablaze one of the mightiest creations of the Mother of All?”<br>
<br>
The paladin began coughing violently.  Ikeya smirked at him.  He must have choked on his wine.  The paladin finally recovered himself and look up at Ikeya, his eyes seething with contempt.  <br>
<br>
“The power of creation is infinitely greater than destruction,” the paladin said, his voice reflecting the contempt in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Ah… another blind follower of Tunare it seems.  The Mother of All will never rival The Burning Prince.”<br>
<br>
The paladin stood up suddenly, grabbing a hold of Ikeya by the cuff of his robe.  <br>
<br>
“Arrogant brat!” he shouted, throwing Ikeya into the wall.  “It’s pathetic excuses for Dal like you that will be downfall of our kind.”  The paladin punched Ikeya across the face, sending Ikeya to the floor.  The paladin staggered over to the fallen mass that was Ikeya and kicked him in the chest.  Ikeya gasped as the air rushed out of his lungs.  He moaned in agony.  The paladin picked Ikeya up by the back of his robe before knocking him to the ground with another punch.  Ikeya rolled onto his back and began to crawl back away from the paladin.<br>
<br>
“Are you mad?!  For the sake of Faydwer, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>think</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Does a paladin of Tunare assault a fellow Dal for stating his belief?  Are you drunk with pride?” Ikeya shouted, as best he could with his pained breath.  The paladin ignored him and continued to advance on the retreating Koada’Dal until he was standing over him.  Once more, he picked Ikeya up by his robe.  <br>
<br>
“So be it…” Ikeya whispered.  <br>
<br>
He lifted up his arms and grabbed onto the paladin’s wrists.  A fire ignited around his hands, encompassing them and the paladin’s forearms in flame.  The flames quickly spread until the paladin was engulfed in them.  The paladin released Ikeya and shouted in agony, twisting and turning wildly, trying to find anything to smother the fire.  In foolish panic, bystanders began throwing their drinks on the paladin, vainly attempting to put out the fire. But the alcohol only fed the blaze and left burning puddles on the ground.<br>
<br>
The paladin dropped to his knees before falling to the floor, the pain becoming unbearable.  Then as quickly as the flames had encompassed the paladin, they faded.  Only a charred corpse remained.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Ikeya's eyes blazed as he stepped backward.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Fool!&quot; he roared.  &quot;Foolish crusaders of Tunare!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;You will suffer! You will all suffer!&quot;  Even as the nearby guards stepped towards him in alarm, there was a thunderous crack that knocked down those nearby, and sent the audience scattering into the nearby forest.  A sword of flame appeared in Ikeya’s hand as he marched towards the dazed king.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s advance halted abruptly as a silver blade slid itself gently across his throat.  He could sense nature’s power emanating from the metal.  <br>
<br>
“Firiona Vie,” Ikeya greeted the elf princess, without moving.<br>
<br>
“Extinguish it,” Firiona commanded.  <br>
<br>
Ikeya smiled as the silver blade pressed harder against his throat, threatening to slit it open.  He dropped his blade of flame and quickly stepped backwards.  The blade began to spin as it fell.<br>
<br>
“Xuzl,” Ikeya muttered.  The flaming blade’s fall came under control.  The blade whipped upwards and slashed towards Firiona.  Firiona lifted her blade and batted the flaming sword aside.  The sword of fire corrected its course and came back at Firiona, dancing in a brilliant display.  Firiona’s blade shifted left and right, blocking each swing the sword made, scattering sparks and wisps of flame in every direction.  Firiona gritted her teeth.  She just had to hold out long enough for the magic empowering the blade to depart, or for Ikeya to lose his concentration.  She wasn’t sure how long either of those would take.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Whizbang sat up, shaking his head.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What just happened?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought.  He stood up, gaining a few inches in height.  Whizbang was a gnome who had a reputation among his peers for making inventions that didn’t always function correctly.  He brushed off his tunic and looked around.  Most of the audience near the platform was still on the ground, or struggling to their feet.  Groans and moans echoed throughout the forest.  He tried to recall what had happened before he hit the ground.  There was a heretic.  The heretic was going to be punished for something.  Then the heretic… exploded?  That was a very odd punishment.  But then again, the elves were odd creatures.  He glanced toward where the heretic had been standing.  His eyes fell upon a sword of fire twirling around a woman he recognized as the Koada’Dal princess; the king was still sprawled on the ground in a daze.  Beyond the princess, the heretic stood unchallenged, his hands and fingers gesturing, ordering the blade where to strike next.  <br>
<br>
The gnome’s hands began to feel around frantically for his staff.  He had to help the princess.  Instead, his hand came to rest upon one of the fireworks the gnomes had brought.  He scrambled around and oriented it to face the accused.  While it wasn’t any powerful magic, it would have to do.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Firiona gritted her teeth as she fought the blade.  She tried to keep it in front of her, but all too often it would slip behind her and try to strike from behind.<br>
<br>
“Foolish girl,” Ikeya spat through teeth gritted in concentration.  “You all pledge your blind loyalty to Tunare, the ‘goddess of creation.’  Bah!  It was in fire that Norrath was created. Fire shaped the world.  The might of Fennin and Solusek Ro created Norrath, not your precious Tunare.  It was in fire that this world was born and in fire it shall be consumed!”  <br>
<br>
Small orbs of flame began to appear around him.  He hurled them casually at Firiona.  Firiona rolled behind a tree, the orbs exploding as they slammed into the trunk, setting it aflame.  She rolled again and lifted her blade upwards and blocked the Xuzl sword from splitting her in half.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly, there was a loud crack, followed by a loud, shrill whistling sound.  Firiona heard Ikeya bark a curse.  His bombardment of her ceased and the sword of fire vanished; the only remaining hints of its existence were smoke vapors.  She glanced over at Ikeya.  He was on the ground, a small object sticking out of his arm, where his skin was badly burned.  He was moaning.  Firiona looked around.  Her gaze fell upon a gnome who was holding the launcher of a gnomish firework.  She smiled at him and returned her attention to Ikeya.  Two paladins were “helping” him to his feet.  Ikeya grunted whenever the paladins roughly jostled him.<br>
<br>
“Throw him in the prison.  We can decide his punishment later.  Right now, we have to help these people,” Firiona ordered.  The paladin on Ikeya’s left nodded and brought the hilt of his sword down on the back of Ikeya’s skull.  The last thing Ikeya saw before the darkness overtook him were the marble walls of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Mirxa’s gaze focused on the elf in the cell.  His skin was pale, even by Koada’Dal standards.  He was of average height and build.  He sat with his back against the wall; his eyes were facing the floor.  His white hair was in disarray. Mirxa gasped and jumped back as the elf looked up at her.  She couldn’t see his eyes; they were hidden behind the shadows of the cell.  <br>
<br>
“Have you come to strip me of my mana today, enchantress?” he hissed.  <br>
<br>
Mirxa found herself seeking her voice to answer, but she couldn’t find it.  The elf’s voice was so full of contempt that she could not bring herself to respond to his question.  She inhaled a deep, steadying breath and began to chant.  Slowly, a blue aura began to pulse around the elf and strands of mana began to leak from his body into the air.  They collected into a ball before dropping into a vial Mirxa held.  She capped the vial, trapping the magical essence and left the room, twitching with guilt.  She cast her gaze on the floor as she ascended the twisting staircase that led out of the prison.  Her thoughts were elsewhere and didn’t notice the other elf until she bumped into him.  As she stumbled back, she caught sight of who she ran into.  The elf was dressed in royal clothes, and two armored hands were steadying him.<br>
<br>
“Your pardon, my lord,” Mirax begged.  By embarrassing chance, she had managed to run headlong into Tearis Thex.  He simply smiled forgivingly at her.  She bowed her head and hurried up the steps past him.  <br>
<br>
Tearis continued down the steps, until he arrived at Ikeya’s cell.  He nodded to one of his escorts, who promptly opened the cell door.  Thex strode in and came to a stop, towering over Ikeya.<br>
<br>
“What has happened to you?” Thex asked, addressing Ikeya in a concerned, sympathetic tone.<br>
<br>
Ikeya looked up at him.  He smiled faintly.  <br>
<br>
“Nothing has happened to me, dear Thex.  I am who I have always been,” Ikeya replied with a falsely amiable tone.<br>
<br>
“You aren’t Ikeya.  Who are you?” Tearis demanded.  “Ikeya would have never have done what you did.”<br>
<br>
A faint flame danced in Ikeya’s eyes.  <br>
<br>
“I am Ikeya of Ro.  Who are you?”<br>
<br>
Tearis frowned, searching for an answer.  He blinked as he realized he didn’t have an answer to that question.  Who was Tearis Thex?  Did he have an identity other than the king?  He frowned at Ikeya and kneeled down.  <br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are you?” he breathed.<br>
<br>
The faint, eerily disconcerting smile was still on Ikeya’s face.  <br>
<br>
“I am a messenger.  But what am I messenger of?” he asked.  His smile suddenly vanished and all hint of friendliness was gone.  “If you are here to attempt to convince me to repent and accept Tunare, you can save your breath.  Your daughter’s lectures are annoying enough, I don’t need to hear one from you.”<br>
<br>
Thex sighed and stood up.  He turned his back on Ikeya and took several steps toward the door.  As he reached the open cell door, he glanced over his shoulder at Ikeya.  His head had returned to facing the floor and he seemed oblivious to Thex.  He sighed and left with his escort, leaving Ikeya in darkness.  <br>
<br>
“Just wait… my dear Thex… soon you will learn… soon you all will learn…  It is merely a matter of time…” Ikeya whispered.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“Do you mind if I join you?” Firiona asked quietly.  <br>
<br>
Aurianne jumped.  She had been so lost in her meditations she hadn’t noticed Firiona’s approach.  She glanced up at the other elf and smiled. <br>
<br>
“Of course,” Aurianne replied.  “What can I do for you?”  Her mind raced, trying to discover a reason as to why Firiona Vie would be visiting her.<br>
<br>
“I just want to ask you a few questions about Ikeya.  How you met him, what life was like at the academy, and if you can possibly tell me where his fanaticism came from?” Firiona spoke softly, but with a hint of command as she sat down next to Aurianne.<br>
<br>
Aurianne frowned.  It wasn’t what she had been expecting.  On the other hand, she shouldn’t have been surprised.  Ikeya’s attack on the king three days ago had created widespread rumors throughout the ranks of those who didn’t strictly follow Tunare.  They had dubbed him a variety of things, from a champion to a fool to a lunatic.  She breathed deeply, wondering where to begin.  She didn’t want to tell Tunare the whole story of her life as a wizard.  She wasn’t ready to share that with the Daughter yet.  She inhaled deeply.  <br>
<br>
“Hmm…  I suppose I first met Ikeya a few seasons after I joined the wizard’s guild.  At the time he seemed to be a devout follower of Tunare.  I saw him often coming from the royal palace, sometimes escorted by the paladins – or my father,” she hesitated before saying that last part.  “Ikeya was ah… supportive of the students of the academy.  He wasn’t the strongest of the wizards there, but he always seemed to be willing to help anyone out.  The master had always said he would be remembered by the academy forever, not for his power, but for his wish to see the students succeed.<br>
<br>
“He always seemed to have a natural affinity for the element of fire,” she continued.  “No one ever knew why.  It took him far more effort to channel raw magic and ice magic than it did for him to control a flame.  None of that really mattered, I guess.  Everyone just assumed he was gifted.  He wasn’t the only student who had difficulties or talents with particular elemental magics.<br>
<br>
“And then something happened… he had traveled to Tunaria.  He had said he was going to try and find any scrolls that might have survived the burning of Takish-Hiz.  Some of us… scoffed at his idea, to say the least.  Very few of us remember the burning.  We doubted he would find anything, assuming anything even survived.<br>
<br>
“He came back some months later… changed.  There was something different about him.  He isolated himself from the rest of the guild, focusing on his personal studies more.  The spark he had for helping others was gone.  One of the masters confronted him about his new attitude one day.  Ikeya snapped at him and called him a heretic.  Needless to say, this put the entire academy in an uproar.  No one had ever insulted a master before.  Ikeya began to preach about the doctrine of Solusek Ro.  Some seemed interested in it; some accepted it; others flat out refused it.  Still more were impressed with his courage and declared their faith in other gods.  Ever since then, the academy has never quite been the same,” Aurianne finished.<br>
<br>
Firiona nodded, standing up.  She had another piece of the puzzle.  <br>
<br>
“Thank you,” she said graciously.  “This information will be of great help.”  <br>
<br>
Aurianne nodded at Firiona.  The princess smiled at her and left, returning to the palace.  Now she had to find out what had happened to Ikeya during his venture to Tunaria.  And the only way she would find that out was to ask him.  This would not be pleasant.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Tearis Thex leaned back into his throne as he considered his daughter’s request.  She had valid reasons for wanting an audience with Ikeya.  He hesitated at the thought of bringing Ikeya back into the palace.  He wasn’t sure how Ikeya would respond.  <br>
<br>
It pained Thex to recall the fond memories he had had with the wizard.  Ikeya had served as an advisor for Tearis and had been a close friend of the royal family.  The royal family and Ikeya’s household and often gone to the outpost the Fier’Dal had in the Ocean of Tears to escape the pressures of monarchy and running Felwithe.  He remembered being forced to expel Ikeya from the palace for his radical ideas when he had returned from Tunaria.  It had been one of the darkest and most difficult days of his monarchy.<br>
<br>
He sighed.  If they were ever going to solve this puzzle, they would need to confront Ikeya about it eventually.  He nodded at his daughter, granting her permission to bring Ikeya to the palace.  He would have to increase the number of guards if he were going to survive this.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Firiona’s torch dimly lit the descending spiral staircase into the dungeon.  The stairs creaked as she and her companion traveled down to Ikeya’s cell.  After several minutes of a seemingly endless descent, the staircase ended and opened into a hallway filled with doors to cells.  Most of the cells were old and falling apart.  They were neglected, not being used for dozens of years.  She placed her torch in a holder and stalked down the hallway to Ikeya’s cell.  She couldn’t see him inside.  That fact didn’t disturb her.  Ikeya was often in the shadows of his cell, hiding from sight.  <br>
<br>
“Ikeya?” she asked into the darkness.  She waited for a response.  “Ikeya?” she repeated after several long seconds of silence.  Again, there was no reply.  Her expression darkened and her hand snatched the cell door.  She gave the torch to her companion and began to fumble with the key.  Her coordination with her hands suffered from an overwhelming sense of panic that swelled up in her.  Finally, the key slipped into its hole and Firiona flung the cell door open.  She ran into the cell, her companion behind her.  Her eyes widened.  <br>
<br>
“He’s gone!” she shouted.  “Quickly!  Go and alert the paladins!” she ordered.  “We have to find him!”  Her companion nodded and ran off, reflections of the flame dancing on his silver armor.<br>
<br>
Firiona began to frantically search the ex-prisoner’s cell, trying to discover the means of his escape.  Her hands searched the floor frantically, groping for anything that could explain this phenomenon.  Her hand came to rest on something that sent a chill up her arm.  She grabbed it and brought it into the light.  It was a rod of some form, golden and etched with magical runes.  She had never before seen such a thing.  Perhaps Aurianne could shed some light on it?  If not her, then someone at the academy could.  Someone had to.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Aurianne was, quite literally, shaken out of her meditations again.  She opened her eyes, to find herself staring into the face of Firiona.  <br>
<br>
“I’m awake, I’m awake!” she muttered.  “What is it?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I need to know if you can tell me what this is,” Firiona answered, presenting her finding.  Aurianne looked it over, a look of familiarity coming to her face.<br>
<br>
“It’s a modulation rod.  Magicians summon them.  The rods work as a combination of necromancy with an enchanter’s magic,” Aurianne answered.  “Magic users use them to exchange some of their life for mana when they are in a tight situation.  It’s not the most efficient form of mana regeneration, but it gets the job done.  Why?  Where did you find this?”<br>
<br>
Firiona’s blood ran cold.  Someone had smuggled this to Ikeya so he could regain mana.  Enchanters had wiped Ikeya’s memory several times to make sure he wouldn’t remember any of his spells.  The fact that he wasn’t in his cell meant that same person had smuggled him his spell book so he could escape.  She bit back a curse.  This was not good.<br>
<br>
“My lady?” Aurianne ventured worriedly.<br>
<br>
Firiona shook her head tiredly.  <br>
<br>
“It’s Ikeya.  He’s escaped and we can’t find him.”  She watched Aurianne’s face pale.  “Do you have any idea where he might be?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“No… No I don’t,” Aurianne answered.  She suddenly felt cold, and the world seemed less safe.  With a religious fanatic on the loose, most likely on a quest for vengeance, she doubted that anyone in Felwithe would feel safe again.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“I’m not so sure this is a good idea,” Jather said quietly as he looked at the entrance of Mistmoore Castle.<br>
<br>
“Of course it isn’t a good idea.  Very few ideas in history have been,” Ikeya replied, eyeing the vampires that stood guard.  He took a deep breath.  The vampires weren’t the serious problem.  It was the Tier’Dal that inhabited the castle, pledging their service to the Vampire Lord.  They still held some fledgling loyalty to the Prince of Hate, and he doubted that his proposition for Lord Mistmoore would be readily accepted as long as Tier’Dal were present.  No, he didn’t doubt it.  He knew.  Behind him laid the charred corpses of several Tier’Dal who weren’t exactly pleased by his arrival.  He took a deep breath and the magic that wrapped around him to keep him hidden from the undead vanished.<br>
<br>
One of the vampire guards popped its head up and looked at Ikeya thoughtfully.  <br>
<br>
“Food?” it asked stupidly.  Several other guards turned their attention to Ikeya, a look of hunger taking over their faces.  The guards began to spread around Ikeya, forming a crude circle.<br>
<br>
Ikeya remained adamant in his goal and strode forward. Jather was following him, still protected by his invisibility to undead spell.  One of guards lunged forward, the hunger overcoming its common sense.  Its advance was cut off as a pillar of flame erupted in front of it.  The vampire reversed its direction, landing on its back from the sudden change in movement.  <br>
<br>
“I seek an audience with Lord Mistmoore,” Ikeya shouted.  “You will take me to him or you will suffer.”<br>
<br>
One of the vampires eyed him closely, wondering which was worse: fighting this elf… or confronting its master.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Mayong Mistmoore gazed down at the skirmish that was rapidly tilting in favor of the Koada’Dal.  He swirled his wineglass casually. The guards were screaming and cursing at the elf, trying to find a path through the blazing firestorm that protected their supposed victim.  Although, in all practicality, Mayong felt that his vampires were the victims here.  He watched with interest as the Dal swept his hand in a wide arc, dust scattering as an invisible force rushed forward into a cluster of vampires, hurling them into the castle’s wall.  Another two vampires leapt forward.  The space around the elf began to glow an eerily bright green.  He raised his hand upward into the sky and the vampires were catapulted into the air as if by an unseen giant.  Mistmoore grinned.  He had seen that spell used before on his vampires during a siege of his castle.  Gravity Flux.  Not a very popular spell among the arcane wielders, but it was quite adept at rapidly sowing confusion within enemy ranks.  He gestured for one of his Tier’Dal servants to come forward.  He pointed down at Ikeya and the recently appeared Jather.<br>
<br>
“Bring those two to me,” he ordered.<br>
<br>
“My lord?” the Tier’Dal replied.<br>
<br>
“Are you questioning me?” Mayong asked darkly.<br>
<br>
The Tier’Dal shook his head weakly.  He bowed shortly and ran out, hoping to avoid his master’s wrath.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Mayong had to admit he was slightly amused.  One of the two High Elves was pale with dread and apprehension over the current situation.  The other… the other’s expression was cold and determined.  He had the look of a being with a goal, and someone who would not stop until he had achieved it.  Mayong leaned forward, feigning interest in the story the cold one was telling him.  He his lips peeled back in a feral smile, baring his fangs as the story finished.<br>
<br>
“Yes, all very interesting.  But why do you come here?  What do you want?” Mayong demanded.  “Why shouldn’t I just have the two of you killed now?”<br>
<br>
The pale elf blanched even further, to a color Mayong didn’t know Koada’Dal could change to.  <br>
<br>
“To put it simply, I want revenge,” Ikeya said.  “I have my reasons and in my mind this is truly justice.  But to others, I am sure it seems otherwise.”<br>
<br>
“And how does all of this involve me?” Mayong inquired, his eyebrows arching upwards with curiosity.<br>
<br>
“I need an army,” Ikeya answered bluntly.  “The Crushbone Orcs are weak and lack the numbers that I seek. Not to mention their inherent stupidity.  Your army, however—”<br>
<br>
“Will not be used in your crusade,” Mayong interrupted, standing up.  “Do you think I offer some sort of mercenary service?  I am not in the business of hiring out troops to random adventurers who seek revenge, treasure, glory, or other foolhardy ideas.  Go to the orcs.”<br>
<br>
“I can give you Tearis Thex,” Ikeya whispered.  That stopped Mayong cold.  Ikeya smiled slightly, pleased at having caught Mayong Mistmoore off balance.  <br>
<br>
Mistmoore sat back on his throne, his face taking on a feature that possibly resembled deep thought for a vampire.  His crimson red eyes burned into Ikeya.<br>
<br>
“What do you need?” he answered at last.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s smile dimmed and his voice assumed a lighter tone.  <br>
<br>
“I simply need a legion.”<br>
<br>
Mayong nodded.  <br>
<br>
“Very well, then a legion you will have,” Mayong promised, standing up and extending his hand.  Ikeya stood as well and took the hand.  Mayong bared his fangs as the two shook on the deal, Jather was standing to the side, shaking slightly.  “They will be ready in two days.  Until then, I’ll have quarters prepared for you.  You might find our accommodations are not exactly ah… <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>suited</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for High Elves, but I’m afraid it’s all we have.”<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“I don’t like this,” Jather whispered in the darkness from the balcony.<br>
<br>
“What don’t you like?” Ikeya asked, glancing up from a tattered and worn scroll.<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,” Jather answered, sweeping his arm across the view, encompassing the gathering army.<br>
<br>
“Ah.” Ikeya rolled up the scroll, thinking of how he could calm his companion.  “Well, I can understand your reluctance to make war upon your brothers and sisters.  I cringe at the thought of making war on Felwithe as well.  But you have to understand,” Ikeya explained as Jather walked into the room and sat down on a dusty bed.  Dust sprang up and clouded around Jather, causing him to sneeze violently.  “But they are heretics nonetheless.  Their practice is nothing more than some sort of pathetic attempt at maintaining their blindness to reality.  They must realize the truth.  Their blind faith in Tunare will not protect them.”  Ikeya placed the scroll on a shelf and walked over to where a torch hung from the wall, lighting the room.  <br>
<br>
“Now go to sleep.  Our quest begins tomorrow,” Ikeya ordered, smothering the flame.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“We found no trace of him in the Butcherblock Mountains.  Likewise, the dwarven outposts claim they have seen no elf resembling Ikeya,” a ranger reported to Thex.  Thex sighed.  It was becoming a common report.<br>
<br>
“My lord,” a knight ventured, “perhaps he has left Faydwer?”<br>
<br>
Thex gave another sigh.  No, he would not be that lucky.  His eyelids closed for a moment as he sank back into his throne.  He was tired.  For the past three nights he had not rested easily.  Something was gnawing at him, consuming him slowly.  He couldn’t identify what it was, but he knew something horrible was going to happen soon.  He was jostled out of his trance by shouts outside his throne room.<br>
<br>
The twin doors flung open, a small creature dashing in between them.  A trio of guards was chasing it, their crouched movements made ungainly by their armor.  The creature was short and bald.  He stood just under half the size of an average Koada’Dal.  His movements were unrestricted by his clothing, a simple tunic and pantaloons.  The creature was a gnome, Thex recognized his race immediately.  The guards on either side of his throne stepped forward, drawing their swords.  The gnome’s pace suddenly slackened as he heard the ringing sound of the blades being drawn.  <br>
<br>
“My lord! My lord!” he shouted as he jumped to the side to avoid being grabbed.  “I must speak with you!”<br>
<br>
Thex raised his hands and the guards stopped their pursuit of the nimble creature.  The gnome’s eyes flickered over to the guards, relief overcoming him.  <br>
<br>
“You wish to speak with me?” Thex prompted.<br>
<br>
The gnome brought his attention back to Thex. <br>
<br>
“Yes, my lord,” the gnome answered.  “My name is Whizbang Dustyboots.  I come from Ak’anon bearing grave news,” the gnome explained.  “I was present at the festival and witnessed the attack upon you by the elf Ikeya.  As I speak, an army of undead under the banner of Mistmoore marches toward the Greater Faydark.”<br>
<br>
“And what does this have to do with Ikeya?” Thex asked, an overwhelming sense of dread invading him.<br>
<br>
The gnome blinked, gazing at the king.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Surely not even elves are this dense,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Whizbang thought sourly.  The answer should have been obvious.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Are they really that high-strung?  They can’t even spot the obvious.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  “Ikeya leads it,” Whizbang said slowly.<br>
<br>
“What is their destination?” Thex demanded.  Whizbang shrugged.  Thex was on his feet in an instant, his finger jabbing at the ranger.  “You!” he shouted, the name of the ranger escaping him.  “I need you to go Kelethin and alert the Feir’Dal of this!”<br>
<br>
The ranger bowed quickly.  <br>
<br>
“Yes, my lord,” he replied.  He stood still for a moment as a lupine aura surrounded him.  He raced out of the room, his speed matching that of a wolf.<br>
<br>
Thex could not believe it.  How could a Dal have fallen so far?  He ordered his men to summon his generals as quickly as they could.  Time was of the essence.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“Can we safely assume that Felwithe is his target?” a general ventured.<br>
<br>
“Well, it’s obvious his target is us.  He was disgraced at our festival.  If he is out for vengeance, he will come to us,” another commander countered.<br>
<br>
“And what if it isn’t us?  We don’t know for sure that we’re his target.  If we are to ensure the protection of the Greater Faydark, we must strike them first!”<br>
<br>
And with that, they were arguing again.  It was the fourth repetition of this particular argument among the generals about what course of action should be taken.  Thex glanced out the window.  At the rate the defense of Greater Faydark was being planned, Ikeya would have subjugated it by the time the generals agreed on anything.  The door to the room swung open and a Feir’Dal ranger stepped in.<br>
<br>
“My lord… our scouts report that the army has entered the Greater Faydark,” he reported.<br>
<br>
Thex looked into the eyes of his generals.  Some flinched under his gaze, others turned their heads away, shame and guilt at their bickering indecision plaguing their minds.  <br>
<br>
“We make our stand here, at Felwithe,” he said sternly, crushing the argument for good.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“What are you doing?” Ikeya snapped at a vampire.<br>
<br>
“Felwithe,” it responded, pointing its finger down the well trodden path that led to the castle.<br>
<br>
Ikeya shook his head; his patience was wearing thin with the foolishness he had to put up with during this march.  <br>
<br>
“No,” he said.  “For the last time.  Felwithe is not our target.  Kelethin is.  I can not deliver Thex to your master if you and your kind bounce blissfully off towards the bastion of the High Elves.  Kelethin is the target.  It will be easier to lay siege to,” Ikeya explained.<br>
<br>
“Well, that has to be one of the most idiotic statements I have ever heard.  Kelethin rests in the trees.  They will have the high ground, and the Feir’dal city is crawling with archers.  They will pick us off at their leisure,” a Tier’Dal interjected.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s gaze fell upon the foolish dark elf.  His mind began to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of burning the dark one down where he stood.  <br>
<br>
“Yes, they have the high ground.  Kelethin is a city in the trees, like you said.  But what important property do trees have that marble does not?” Ikeya asked.  The dark elf looked at him, his face twisted with either thought or contempt for Ikeya’s antics.  “Trees <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>burn</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,” Ikeya answered himself.  “It will be much easier to bring the Fier’Dal city to the ground that it would to break into Felwithe.  And while you lay siege to the Kelethin, I can sneak into Felwithe and claim Thex.  You get to kill countless Fier’Dal, and I get Thex.”<br>
<br>
The Tier’Dal smiled, baring small fangs; possibly an early symptom of his slow change to a vampire.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
The army’s arrival at Kelethin took the Fier’Dal by surprise.  Shouts of surprise echoed throughout the forest as the army encircled the city, dodging the arrows that rained from the sky.  Once under the relative safety of the platforms, detachments would set to work, starting the fires that would bring the massive city to the ground.<br>
<br>
The Fier’Dal were no fools, however.  At the first signs of smoke, entire regiments of warriors, rangers, druids, and other defenders began to descend the lifts, charging into the undead army of Mistmoore.  Swords clashed with claws, animals fell upon the undead by order of the druids, fire and arrows rained around the ground.  Soon, the entire forest beneath Kelethin was embroiled in a battle that would decide the fate of the grand city.<br>
<br>
Jather looked on, petrified at what he was seeing.  He could not believe this.  He could not believe that he would be held responsible for this.  He could not believe that he was overseeing the slaughter of brothers and sisters.  Slowly, he willed his limbs to move as one idea filled his mind.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Run</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Tearis Thex stared into the forest.  He was becoming anxious.  Ikeya’s army should have been here by now, laying siege to the castle.  A shout, once again, shook him out of his thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Someone’s coming!” a trooper shouted.  The sound of swords being drawn rang between the trees of the thick forest.<br>
<br>
“It’s… It’s a Fier’Dal!” Aurianne shouted.  Thex had met Aurianne through his daughter, who had gone to her to learn of Ikeya’s background at the academy.  She, along with other wizards, magicians, and enchanters were aiding the clerics and paladins in the defense of the castle. Religious differences were placed aside in the face of danger to the city itself.<br>
<br>
A worn figure stepped over the hill and nearly collapsed upon seeing the assembled army of Koada’Dal.  Two paladins rushed forward, the clinking of their chainmail was the only sound heard.  They exchanged a few words and another paladin rushed back, pushing his way through the troops until he came to a general.  He told the general what the Fier’Dal had told him. Thex couldn’t hear them.<br>
<br>
The general paled and turned to his king.  <br>
<br>
“My lord… ah…” he stopped, his voice quivering. “Kelethin…” he began again but his voice failed him.<br>
<br>
“What about Kelethin?” Thex demanded.<br>
<br>
“It’s… burning.  Mistmoore’s army completely ignored us and went straight for Kelethin,” the general said.<br>
<br>
Thex felt himself go a few shades paler.  <br>
<br>
“Go…” he whispered.  No one moved.  “Go!” he roared.  “Rally to Kelethin!”  With that, a massive silver mass detached itself from Felwithe and began to pour into the forest.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Thex strolled down the garden, silently appreciating the beauty of it.  However, he couldn’t enjoy it.  Not with the knowledge that there was a battle raging on at Kelethin.  Elves were dying.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Because of me…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought.  Lightning flashed overheard, illuminating the garden.  Then the rain began a storm of Karana that would make even the most powerful druids envious.<br>
<br>
“Sir? We should go in,” his guard suggested gently.  His only guard.  Most of the palace guard had taken up watch throughout Felwithe, keeping order while most of the paladins and clerics were gone.  Thex nodded, turning his back on the garden, he strolled towards the palace door.<br>
<br>
The sentry hurried ahead of him.  He reached the door well ahead and stretched his hand out to open it.<br>
<br>
“Amazing, isn’t it?” a voice interrupted.  Thex looked up and wished he hadn’t.  There, standing on top of the palace wall, was Ikeya.  A bolt of lightning came down from the clouds into Ikeya’s out stretched palm.  The bolt arced out from his palm, slamming into his guard.  The soldier shrieked in agony as his body was thrown against the opposite courtyard wall.  Ikeya smiled, stepped off the wall, and floated down to Thex.<br>
<br>
Ikeya held up a small orb of fire and Thex cringed, fearful of what Ikeya was going to do with it.  Ikeya smiled at the king’s discomfort and lowered his hand, the orb of fire remaining stationary in the air.  Slowly it expanded until it was almost the size of the wizard’s head.  Then the flames in the center parted and were replaced with images.  Thex quickly recognized the scene as the chaos beneath Kelethin.<br>
<br>
“What… what do you want?” Thex breathed, unable to tear his eyes from the view of the battle.<br>
<br>
Ikeya smiled at him.  A smile deprived of mirth.  <br>
<br>
“Your faith,” Ikeya said simply. This made the king’s eyes leave the scene of battle to focus on the robed elf.  Ikeya made a gesture and Thex felt himself thrown across the grounds, as if a giant, invisible hand had tossed him.<br>
<br>
Thex groaned, picking himself up from the earth, and turned to face Ikeya.  Slowly, he unsheathed his sword and held it in a close defensive position.  Ikeya gave Thex a smile and raised his hand up into the air.  <br>
<br>
“Staff, return!” Ikeya ordered.  Thex heard something come through the wall behind him and he dropped to the ground, covering his head from the falling debris.  He glanced up and saw a staff twirling through the air.  Ikeya’s staff.  They had found it in his quarters while looking for any clues that might have suggested where he had fled.  And of course they had brought his staff back to the palace, with the rest of his belongings.  The staff slapped itself into Ikeya’s waiting hand.  <br>
<br>
He gave a wide, horizontal swipe with it, two flames falling from it.  They touched the ground and immediately erupted into twin pillars, cascading towards Thex.  Charred dirt was thrown from the ground by the erupting flames.  Thex murmured an ancient Tunarian enchantment and his blade erupted in shimmering fire of its own.  He now wielded the Fiery Avenger.  He caught the two pillars on his blade and was pushed backwards by the force driving the inferno, but the pillars themselves were quickly dispelled after contacting the blade.<br>
<br>
Thex charged Ikeya, his blade held in a position where he could easily shift to block any more attacks.  Ikeya lifted his staff into the air and then brought it down, parallel to the earth.  Earth was once again thrown into the air as an invisible force was launched from the staff.  It slammed into Thex, barely weakened by the magic of the Fiery Avenger.  Thex heard and felt several bones snap under the pressure of the shockwave.  Pain flooded his mind and he could see Ikeya as if he was standing in a dark fog.  Thex couldn’t tell if Ikeya had indeed summoned a fog or if the pain was blurring his vision.  He slowly became aware that was he on the ground, resting against the distant palace wall.  Ikeya walked towards his, the sound of his staff tapping the narrow tile that formed a walkway was echoing.  Ikeya made another gesture with his staff.  Thex felt himself being lifted into the air by an unseen force.  Ikeya’s eyes burned with an unquenchable rage.  <br>
<br>
“I want your faith,” he said again.<br>
<br>
Thex felt himself getting warmer.  At first, it seemed pleasant compared to the chilling rain.  However, the temperature rapidly increased and Thex was soon screaming in pain as his armor channeled the heat directly to his skin.<br>
<br>
“Father!” a voice shouted.  Thex fell to the earth as Ikeya lost his concentration and turned to face the newcomer: Firiona Vie, her blade drawn.  Her gaze was fixed upon Ikeya, hatred burning in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Ah, Princess,” Ikeya greeted.  “How fitting.  The king and the princess shall both burn in the same night.”  Flames suddenly danced in the air and a sword formed.  Ikeya grabbed it with his free hand and charged the princess.  Firiona lifted her blade.  Ikeya was no master swordsman, and his flaming weapon was swatted from his hand as he attempted to cut the princess in two.  Firiona took a step forward, pushing Ikeya down.<br>
<br>
She leveled the tip the blade to his throat, murder in her eyes.  <br>
<br>
“I will stop you,” she whispered, drawing her sword back in preparation to impale the rogue wizard.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s eyes burned.  He pushed his staff forward, a lightning bolt arcing from it and slamming into Firiona.  Firiona skidded across the floor, screaming in agony, sparks still arching across her pale figure.  <br>
<br>
“Neither you nor anyone else can stop me!” Ikeya roared.  His feet left the floor as he floated up into the air.  He gripped his staff in front of him with both hands, closed his eyes, and began to chant.  A ring of flame spread out on the floor, twisting upward into the sky to meet a similar ring above Ikeya’s head.  Soon, the entire palace would be gone, burned to ashes.<br>
<br>
“Ikeya!” a third voice interjected.  Ikeya’s eyes snapped open to see a ball of ice cascading through the air towards him.  He had no chance to counter it, no chance to prepare a barrier, no chance to do anything but roar in impotent rage.  The ice ball slammed into him, knocking him to the floor.  The last thing in Ikeya’s vision before an icy darkness overtook his sight was a gnome.  Whizbang Dustyboots.<br>
<br>
Whizbang smiled grimly to himself, glad he had taken up the king’s offer to stay in the palace.  Had he refused the king’s hospitality, the Elven Empire would be in ruins.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Leave to a gnome to get the job done,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Whizbang thought contentedly.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Ikeya awoke to the sounds of waves lapping against the shore, the sour scent of fish in the air.  He groaned as he stood up.  He immediately wished he hadn’t awoken.  There, standing along the pier and the beach head were dwarves, elves, and gnomes.  Before him was Tearis Thex, Firiona Vie, the gnome who had caught him by surprise, and a large cluster of guards.  His hands were bound.  He could barely wiggle his fingers, let alone make any gestures needed to cast a spell.  To his side was Jather.<br>
<br>
Jather had been found in the middle of the Faydark forest, forming incoherent sentences and pleading for forgiveness.<br>
<br>
“You are to be exiled,” Tearis said.  “Now go,” he said, pointing behind Ikeya.  Ikeya glared at Thex one last time, as if it could burn the elf down where he stood.  He turned his back on the king and walked down a line of dwarven guards towards a boat that was waiting for him.  Guards infested it as well.  As Ikeya stepped onto the boat, a belated regret overwhelmed him.  He knew he would never be able to step foot inside his home ever again.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
The boat slipped out of view, and with it, the threat to Faydwer.  The army of Mistmoore had been defeated.  The fanatic exiled.  Once again, the land of the elves was in peace.  The sun set below the horizon and Thex breathed a sigh of relief.  It was over at last.<br>
