<br>
I'm having problems doing it though.....not exactly sure how this will balance the continuing influx of low delay/high damage melee items that are in game.  Since these weapons can mostly be twinkable, the damage is done at far lower levels than 50; but, I think they view these as seperate issues from the post 50 ones.<br>
<br>
When a Dragonclaw Shard shows up on a 20th level warrior in Highpass it unbalances the game.  Totally.   See, because now that melee (even with the cap) is doing a phenominal amount of damage that the game wasn't designed to adapt too.<br>
<br>
THIS IS IMPORTANT!! -- In my experience, Mud admins deal with characters having the ability to do phenominal amounts of damage by 'buffing up' the mobs HPs, resists, and generally making them more difficult to kill.  EVERY TIME they do this, wizards become less and less wanted because we are do a FINITE amount of damage.  That's the problem.  We need to do more because they're raising the damage that mobs can take.  They've provided the means for melees to handle it.  Now it's OUR turn.  I wish they'd fix us instead of patronizing us.  Those of us who have been waiting patiently were expecting them (naively I guess) to truly consider the implications of their actions.  Right now, I don't think we're even speaking the same language.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, no amount of avoiding letting mobs gate (post 50) is going to get us in groups -- especially since groups are doing just fine with enchanters and paladins stunning gating mobs as it is.<br>
<br>
There was, quite simply only one way to fix us as far as I'm concerned.  In a group of 6 in xp grind, I should do AT LEAST 1/6th of the damage.  I'm a wizard.  The powers of the arcane and destructive are open to my call......wait, no...that'd be a rogue or melee class.<br>

However, I don't think this will help our brothers and sisters in getting groups, usually you have an enchanter with you and gating mobs just make it so you don't have to go pull more mobs, they just come to you.<br>
<br>
I belive these spells, however,  will be very usefull for the high end raids.    Someone had posted that fighting on one side of a mob will keep it from gating, however I think the estimate of 99% is a little extream.   I like the idea of a mob NEVER gating and starting to summon people one at a time to they're death.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure if many of you realize your stuns are 100% usless on mobs over level 55.     Mobs above level 55, whether is be a giant or a drake, are 100% unstunable.    Currently, all my stuns have been retired to about page 20 in my spell book.<br>
<br>
My only hope is that this spell,  like many spells the casters have, will not work on mobs over a certain level, if this is the case then this spell will have a one way trip to the back of the book.<br>
<br>
I really have hopes for this spell and the tactics that can be generated as a result of this spell.<br>
<br>
So, Is this the silver bullet for our class? No, definitly not.    But, I do think it's a start.<br>

Its truely pathetic when you make an &quot;enhancement&quot; that NO ONE is going to even NOTICE!  This spell is just as worthless as True North.  Seriously, as its been said before.  PAY ATTENTION to the wizards, we are TELLING YOU what is wrong witht he class.  It seems we're the only class still in Alpha stage.  And that was what LIKE 4-5 YEARS AGO?  Drop some mana off our nukes, that'll balance some serious issues.  And make Translocate not group only.  These are things that will make people happy, and make the game more playable for a wizard.<br>
<br>
Sorry if some of you don't agree, but you obviously haven't been playing a wizard that long if you don't understand where everyone is coming from.<br>

<br>
Ok, sure gating MoBs are a bad thing, even more so if they get away, but the truth is, not all MoBs are casters, and not all gate.<br>
<br>
Again, these spells are designed for the same people the bane spells were invented for. The High End players. It'll be nice to have a 'chance' to stop some of the unstunnable MoBs from gating, but there are so few of them in the game under 50 that coming up with a whole line of spells just devoted to those encounters tells me those encounters were too hard to begin with.<br>
<br>
I've stated in my past posts regarding the fixes we've gotten so far being specific fixes for specific things, but this is crazy.<br>
<br>
So, with what I know now about the &quot;improvements&quot; just over the horizon, here's how I would fix them before they try to release them to us.<br>
<br>
It appears they will be three different spells with three different resistance checks. Why do this? So the Mob has a chance against resisting each &quot;Anti-Gate Debuff&quot; on its rolls.<br>
<br>
They make them stack so you could have three wizards casting a 33% chance at nullifying a MoB gate so it requires three wizards to make them work correctly. Meaning you need more Wizards in your group, more than just one. Three being the magic number.<br>
<br>
Three wizards in one group will destroy just about every normal MoB they come accross. That right there gives players the chance to see what wizards really are capable of. Unfortunately Most players don't want to group with Wizards, and they would much rather just have one in the group and give the other two spots to other classes, making the group more flexible. Forcing a group to have three wizards for 5% of the encounters in the game just to keep them from gating is just plain silly.<br>
How they're making it require 3 different wizard to make it work is interesting. It sounds like they're making it three different spells that will not stack with each other when casted by the same wizard. But if there are three Wizards, then they will stack. Kind of interesting, considering they told Necromancers they couldn't do this (for their DoTs).<br>
<br>
Now, if these spells did something like, a 33% chance at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  silencing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the MoBs, wizards would be praising Lawrence Poe. In that mode, three wizards would be needed to have three chances at 33% chance of silencing a MoB from casting ANY spells. Yes, Lawrence Poe would be getting Christmas cards from me.<br>
<br>
Think about this:<br>
<br>
As the spells are described now, there are three. Each are based off a different resistance check, most likely Fire, Cold, and Magic.<br>
<br>
So at level 51, lets say you get &quot;Gate Crashing: Fire&quot;. This would give you a 33% chance at interrupting the MoBs gate spell.<br>
At level 55 say, you get the next in the series; &quot;Gate Crashing: Cold&quot;. Since you can't cast both of these spells yourself (they overwrite each other if casted by the same player) you need a second wizard to improve your odds of &quot;Anchoring the Mob&quot;. These spells stack, but they don't give you a single 66% chance at &quot;Anchoring&quot; the MoB. They give you two chances at 33% each of &quot;Anchoring&quot; the MoB.<br>
Then at say, level 59, you get &quot;Gate Crashing: Magic&quot;. Once again, it's only useful when stacked with other wizards casting the other gate crashing line. With this third version being cast, you'll have three chances at 33% of causing the MoB to not gate.<br>
<br>
In otherwords:<br>
<br>
It takes 3 spells to make most any mob not gate. Each of them are on a different resistance, so each has a chance to be resisted right away.<br>
Because of the way these spells are being coded, you can't cast all three spells yourself. They don't stack with each other when cast by the same player. So you need two other wizards to cast one of each of the spells.<br>
Lets say each spell gives you a 33% chance at crashing the targets gate spell. It doesn't mean if you have three wizards casting each in the line, that you'll have a 99% of the MoBs gate spell not working. You actually have three chances at 33%. There is a big difference.<br>
<br>
Now, if they'd change the &quot;Gate Crashing&quot; to &quot;Silencing&quot; (The MoB not being able to cast at all) I think Wizards would be VERY pleased. It wouldn't be overpowering due to the fact of the three different castings by three different wizards. It would also have three chances at being resisted, and Three chances at not working for each spell the MoB wants to cast.<br>
<br>
In otherwords:<br>
You have 3 wizards in your group. The Main Tank pulls a casting MoB. The Three wizards would cast their three different versions of this spell. Throughout the fight, in order for the MoB to cast any spells of those types of resistances (Fire, Cold, Magic) they would have to roll higher than a 33. If they rolled lower, they couldn't cast that spell at that time. If they rolled higher, the spell would go off as normal.<br>
<br>
So if you have a creature that casts Ice Comet, you could cast &quot;Silence: Cold&quot; and have a 33% chance of interrupting each time they try to cast Ice Comet.<br>
<br>
Tell me this wouldn't make you drool?<br>

Wizards are not a group or buff class, period. We dont buff, so if you were expecting some form of group buff spell line as our enhancement, then guess again. If you want that, play a dr00d or something. Personally, I'd be livid if i got a buff line because i really cannot be arsed to buff.<br>
<br>
This new spell line will help in velius a great deal. I know some people say you can just have all melees attack on one side of the mob (eg, a dragon) to stop it gating, but in my experience that method is very hit and miss, and in many instances causes raid wipe out. It is not reliable, not consistant, and people tend to avoid certain gating mobs just so that they aren't systematically summoned to it for their turn at being killed.<br>
<br>
If one, or two, wizards can cast this new spell on a gating dragon to stop it, then i say this is more than a group enhancing spell, its a RAID enchancing spell. Places will open up because of this.<br>
<br>
In summary:<br>
<br>
1. This does not help the pre-51 wizard game.<br>
2. It helps the post 50 wizard game at the raid level, not the group level.<br>
3. I dont think it will help you get more exp groups, because when you are fighting mobs for such exp groups you can generally use stun or draught of jiva to interrupt the mob and stop it gating. the levels of mobs that have too high an MR such that this new line of spells will be used are at raid level on the whole. Unless you decide on a group in DN of course.<br>
4. I'll take this new line of spells thanks.<br>
<br>
I hope they dont make them spell drops or their usual almost impossible wizard quest approach. These should be on that vendor in Sol Ro temple or something, just like they made the class balancing spells for dr00ds and mages available on vendors.<br>

<br>
&quot;Take Off Your Pointy Hat:<br>
Whoops.. we don't have pointy hats in Everquest. Oh well, how about a nice round of applause congratulating Lawrence Poe for shedding the 'Associate' title and being promoted to full-fledged Game Designer on Friday! Keep up the good work Poe, you earned it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lawrence Poe, i hope VI finds out the truth about you and fires your sorry ass (that truth being that you sit around and masturbate all day instead of producing good code).  better yet, i hope VI promotes you.  that way it will speed this sorry game to its inevitable death.<br>

wanting to say but one thing is very clear this<br>
new enhancement is not for getting groups. It's<br>
for certain encounter that are harder to control<br>
than the normal hit the mob a lot o keep it from<br>
gating exp mob. Now I know all the level 60<br>
peeps will like this spell most likely since the exp<br>
struggle is over for them for now. All you have <br>
to do is wait for the spells and do the insane<br>
quest that accompanies it so really it's over for<br>
you in the caring about it getting us groups<br>
department. You're probably just looking for<br>
ways to be more useful on raids and such and<br>
no one would blame you but please see it from<br>
the point us lower level wizards are at. We still<br>
gotta get to 60 to even get use out of all these<br>
new uber spells. While this new line of anchor<br>
spells will be from 51 and on it will probably go<br>
cold/magic/fire since the first two are the most<br>
resisted in the places now that you would need<br>
to use them. Unless they make some lava filled<br>
island that has nothing but fire resistant jerk<br>
mobs then velious is the place to go for using<br>
spells like this for raids. And this will end up<br>
making us wait for the useful anchor spell until<br>
about level 60. All I'm saying is we need <br>
some spells that start out at level 1-12 and<br>
build the line in strength until you are level<br>
60 and it you get the awesome form of the<br>
spell. Just jamming any new enhancement we<br>
get in the higher levels where we have the most<br>
trouble grouping, I guess, won't help much.<br>
I thought they learned with the bane spells but<br>
I guess not. I mean it's just a difference of <br>
opinion when they add a spell and some<br>
wizards say it sucks and some love it but I<br>
mean jeez, everyone hates all these new spells.<br>
I wish they'd get a clue. By the way, new spells<br>
excludes the translocs and other teleports we get.<br>
These are just gravy right now since we are<br>
needing combat usfulness and not more ports.<br>
If we get more good, if not who cares. Sigh,<br>
I really do hope they change the premise for<br>
the new line before it's in. I wouldn't ever think<br>
of quitting but all this hoping for a damn bone<br>
to be thrown to us is wearing me down to where<br>
I could almost care less.<br>

No MOB 56+ can be interrupted. They can only be mesmerized by Glamour of Kintaz, and a great many can't be mesmerized anyway. As such, a binding spell such as this becomes helpful.<br>
Unfortunately...it IS a raid spell. Unless someone wants to do a high level xp camp with gating, uninterruptable mobs (myconid adepts=) will they intelligently take a wizard over a druid as their evacuator, ever. <br>
Again, we have to use this enhancement as a stepping stone for higher desires and needs to fix the Wizard class.<br>
<br>
As a final note, MOBs that resist stuns will probably resist this spell as well. The only difference is those that are 56+ that don't resist...though there is always Glamour of Kintaz; an interrupt that can be used against CH too. =-)<br>
I hear Trakanon gates. That's 8khp restored and one hell of a ping pong. =P <br>
But he is STUNNABLE! It's feasible to have 3 paladins try to interrupt...<br>
Oh well, rambling on here.<br>
One last point:<br>
Verant keeps stating that our damage potential is balanced. We did and have not been fighting against that point...it is rather paramount and crucial.<br>
<br>
Thank you for the spells Verant=)<br>

<br>
This spell is really a decent spell on one end of the picture.  This increases our need again to be on raids.  Many high end encounters do gate and there is no way to stop them pretty much besides all fighting on one side.  But these mobs have such high channeling that this method doesn't always work, nor is there alwasy the room.  As long as this spell doesn't have terrible resist rates and doesn't use all our mana trying to stop the mob so we can concentrate on doing damage.  Then it will be a great Raid spell.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand in a group situation, gating is rarely ever a problem.  And veteran dungeon crawlers know how to deal with gating mobs and they are usually not a problem.  Will this increase the wizard desirabilty in dungeons, ever so slightly.  And most likely with the more novice dungeon crawlers, which will probably get the wizard killed anyways.  <br>
<br>
Generally Verant still doesn't know how to seperate making wizards a COMPLETE RAID class and not a group class.  We are great at Soloing and great at Raiding.  With still the exceptions of pathetic damage output on 200k+ hp mobs.  In grouping we have fine damage output in Kunark, and low output in Velious.  This gating spell will not really help much at all in group areas.  In Multi-Group raid areas it will.  The only single group area that I can think of this will help would be Siren's Grotto and you need a really experienced group to venture there.  <br>
<br>
Overall, our raid desirability increase another good amount, while our grouping desirability increase is nil...<br>
<br>
My Guess at other possible enchancements along these lines:<br>
1. Stop mobs from Summoning<br>
2. Translocate with Hate list clear on mobs.<br>
<br>
Verant, you really need to look at the big issues that have been trailing this class since day one.  If one class constantly is saying the same thing over and over again for 2 years, which there is no other class then the wizard class that has.  Maybe you should think that we're right for once... <p><TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 BGCOLOR=151B40>

While I was camping Groups in Seb the other day I struck up a conversation with a few melee classes, asking them if they had seen the &quot;enhancements&quot; and what they thought about them and thier usefulness in groups.  30% had no clue what I was talking about and the other 70% laughed at me :P <br>
<br>
Hey Verant get this! Here is a little Enigma for ya. How the hell am I expected to use these new spells in Higher End Raid situations when I CANNOT EVEN GET A DAMN GROUP to get the Freaking Keys to get to the High lvl Dungeons that I need to be in ...  <br>
<br>
As many of you have said this is not a fix, hell it is not even a bandaid. Verant has Succeeded in giving us a fix to a problem that doesn't even exsist.. ppl have been stopping gateing mobs for enons before this spell was even concieved. It is a flat out joke... I seriously doubt I will even stick around long enough to even try out the new spells.. Of course knowing Verant in all their Infinite wisdom they will conjure up some damn near impossible quest for them. Personally I would rather have got a Pointy hat, or Black and Yellow Checkered Robe, that way atleast ppl could tell I was a wizard and quit asking me for Clarity  * sheesh*  <br>

Give us something to protect the clerics and enchanters and we'll immediately be needed in every group.  You could give us a spell that prevents SUMMONING that would be cool.  If I could ward a Cleric or Enchanter and keep them from being summoned by a mob, i've suddenly become very useful. <p><center><a href="http://www.deliveranceforever.com"><img src="http://www.vinfi.com/izra.jpg"></a></center><br>

I've seen Paladins ask for a spell to keep a MOB from gating, but I haven't seen any Wizards requesting this. I've seen a request for stopping summoning, but not this.<br>
<br>
If Verant gave us these anti-gate spells...dear lord, what a great celebration there would be in North Freeport! We would fall over drooling in happiness.<br>
<br>
But Verant has given &quot;our&quot; upgrade to Wizards. You've got a role near the end of the fight: Nuking the MOB down. Paladins don't really contribute much at the end of fight. Also, we don't mind the &quot;silencing&quot; effect; we still have some damage output and tanking abilities even if our spells are locked up.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the bone. Even though we did ask for a nice meaty steak bone, you threw us a cheap store brand generic biscuit as usual. Now I suggest you go back and READ all the things that were suggested on those threads YOU initiated and go back to the drawing board. You must have us confused with the Paladins again since they seem to be the only class that wanted this &quot;Enahancement&quot;. <br>
<br>
This is in NO WAY my idea of what I wanted my wizard to become. I started a wizard to deal DAMAGE, not do crowd controli. Masters of DAMAGE is why I started a wizard 2 years ago, not so I could be a glorified taxi driver for raids or stop mobs from gating. While I am casting your stupid 'anchor&quot; spell, I am not dealing DAMAGE. I have fought in just about every high lvl zone but Sleepers at this point and I can tell you gating is not a huge issue if you know what you are doing.<br>
<br>
After you READ those posts from us again (Not just count them this time), I would like you to make say a lvl 58 wizard and head to Seb to shout for a group with your new anchor spell (Please have a watch handy). After you fall in a coma from waiting til hell freezes over, WAKE UP and READ those posts again. Gating mobs is not our problem, DAMAGE output  vs. other classes such as Rogues and Magicians is the problem. We can not do anything that another class can not do better in some other way, shape or form. We are not unique at all, we are the generic. Sorry TL's do not make us unique, we just do less zoning now.<br>
<br>
As with the Bane spells, I will not be wasting my time with this line of spells either. I have gotten this far without them and and I do not forsee any real usefulness of this spell line. I would rather have had a harvest upgrade then this bone you threw us. <p>Deanara Darklager <BR>
