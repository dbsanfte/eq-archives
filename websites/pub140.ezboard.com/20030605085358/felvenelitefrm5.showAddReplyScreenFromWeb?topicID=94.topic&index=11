<br>
The myth is that Galain Whitegloves is an elf of impossible patience; that the seas of his mind are consistently placid. The High Elf carried himself with a quiet dignity that lent strength to such beliefs and a rather aloof mien, as well. <br>
<br>
The reality is that his waters are shaped by his environment, his moods by the times in which he lives. Many seem thrown off by his calm approach, failing to realize the powerful currents and trials of life constantly playing out in his depths. <br>
<br>
Every once in a while a storm gathers and rolls in over his sky. Its terrible affects upset the calm waters and shape powerful waves. <br>
<br>
The tempest currently rocking his mind was named “Candra”. She was a force of nature for sure, but to what end Galain had no clue. The human enchantress to whom he was married was, as she had always been since the two first met, a complete and utter mystery. <br>
<br>
Typically, that trait fascinated him. He appreciated her way of being completely intimate while remaining just out of reach. He didn’t mind the dalliances that played out in his absence or the various intrigues she perpetuated as amusement. <br>
<br>
There was still, most definitely, a limit to the Conjurer’s patience. <br>
<br>
“Don’t feed me this coc and bull story about the greater good, Nin’Seron. I know you, and obviously better than you think.” The two stood in middle of a large circular room on the first floor of the tower that was their home. A warm fire crackled the score for the scene and cast a golden glow over the room and its guests. They faced each other, Galain’s stern face showing his anger “You don’t do things for the ends, but for the rush the means provides.” <br>
<br>
Candra’s soft features were shaped by an indignant feeling “I did it because it was worth the risk,” she countered. <br>
<br>
“Because risk gives your life meaning and what you perceive as boredom is death?” A single brow quirked steeply, echoing the mocking sentiment of the question he posed to her. <br>
<br>
Passion coursed through the enchantress’ expression. She clenched her jaw, narrowed her almond-shaped eyes to show her disapproval of this chastisement. <br>
<br>
The display didn’t stop Galain from continuing with his point. “It’s always about the risk with you, Candra. The stakes are never so high that they can’t be made higher. As long as there’s a thrill in it, you’re willing to pay almost any price. Paybacks are a bitch, though, and you’ll get in over your head sooner or later.” <br>
<br>
“It’s my life to do with as I wish.” She spoke the words slowly, the warning obvious for her tone. <br>
<br>
Galain surged forward, so fast that Candra barely had time to register his movement at all. She was only vaguely aware of the sound of rustling silk. In an instant he had taken her by the left wrist, the action more rough than he intended it to be. He jerked her hand slightly, lifting it so that the room’s available light shined through the diamonds on the wedding ring adorning her slender finger. <br>
<br>
His gaze didn’t break away, the intense emotions bled through his eyes. “This says differently, Nin’Seron. This ring on your finger and the vow you pledged makes our lives one! <br>
<br>
“You could have been killed!” He released her with the same ‘gentle touch’ that took her. Galain’s frustration was getting the best of him. His wife’s recent trip to Wakening Land to meet with the dragon Wuoshi left the mage feeling something he didn’t care to admit to...fear. It was flooding through him now on a current of rage. <br>
<br>
Overwhelmed by his emotions, Galain turned away, putting his back to her and his face to an unadorned wall of stone. “It’s my turn to be a little selfish now, Candra. What if...you had died? Where would that have left me?” <br>
<br>
Candra stood there pouting as she stared at Galain’s back and rubbing her wrist. She could hear so much more than just the anger now and knowing of those feelings made it difficult for her to argue...but not impossible. “But I didn’t die!” <br>
<br>
“No, not this time.” <br>
<br>
Long moments passed without words. Neither seemed willing to give in to the other’s view and both feeling they had said enough. After minutes of silence passed, it was Galain who moved to settle things. <br>
<br>
The mage turned about slowly to face his wife. The anger had fled him at last and what remained was concern and just a hint of curiosity. “Your life is too precious to waste, Nin’Seron. I would like to hear of what the dragon told you. I would like to know that, at the very least, your gamble was not taken in vain.” <br>
<br>
A part of him always regretted these fights. Not for the exchange of heated words, but for the way they always ended. Candra like to win and she always did. It only took a look into those beautiful violet eyes and suddenly his clarity of thought blurred; his cause suddenly not so important. Truth to tell, Galain thought it was a trick of Candra’s magic. He had even taken to giving her his back in effort to avoid her beguiling gaze. It was to no avail. <br>
<br>
<br>
“All the ancient tongues have a name for ‘It’, Galain,” she spoke slowly, her voice soft as feathers and still somehow strong with confidence. “To translate them all into the Common-tongue would be to name our foe ‘Enemy’. It is an entity as old as any of the races, born in the Plane of Nightmare and a natural appetite for blood and souls. This Enemy lives for one single purpose that eludes my mortal mind. It wishes to murder the world, devour the realms.” <br>
<br>
Galain arched his brow to those words. “I can’t imagine this, Candra. It hardly seemed powerful enough to..” <br>
<br>
“Be careful with your assumptions, Galain,” she interrupted. Her expression was dire. “In ages past, Enemy was a power to be recognized. It was a demi-god whose power was backed by a small, but zealous death cult that followed after its agenda with unwavering devotion. When the Immaculate Order of Dragons put the horror down, much of its power was lost. Its Faith was hunted down and put to their deaths. <br>
<br>
“As a creature of spirit and not of flesh, Enemy relies on an able host to carry out its plans. My chat with Wuoshi leads me to believe that during all this time of quiet, it has replenished itself and recovered much of what it lost. I doubt that is has become the force it once was, but I’ll not take for granted its potential to become that kind of power again.” <br>
<br>
“And there’s no accounting for a few straggling devotees who may have escaped their due rewards.” Galain mused, his fingers moving across his chin as he spoke. “Enemy may well be assisted.” <br>
<br>
Candra nodded to show she concurred with Galain’s reasoning. <br>
<br>
Galain’s frustrated look returned. “How do we stop it? What does it want from me?” <br>
<br>
Candra said nothing still, replying with only a shrug of her shoulders. <br>
<br>
“Bah! Your chanced peril leaves me with more questions than answers, Candra.” Galain stepped over to his wife and planted a brief kiss against her forehead and then another against her lips. “You will not take another such risk without me, Nin’Seron. I respect your desire to unravel this mystery, but you will not do this alone.” <br>
<br>
Galain pulled away to search his love’s eyes, “Agreed?” <br>
<br>
Candra smiled into her husband’s face adoringly and lied. “Yes, Galain.” <br>
<br>
Ignorant of her deceit and satisfied with her reply, Galain pushed a long, tender kiss against Candra’s cherry lips. “And seeing that you crave adventure, make yourself ready to travel to the Wood That Burns. <br>
<br>
“I seek a wurm that holds the Embers that never die. I have been told these may hold a clue as to the fate of Magi’Kot and his seemingly fruitless attempt at mastering the Elements.” <br>
<br>
Galain turned away before indignation molded Candra’s features into something disagreeable. She hated being bossed around and he took quite a bit of pleasure in holding the reigns, if for only a moment.<br>
