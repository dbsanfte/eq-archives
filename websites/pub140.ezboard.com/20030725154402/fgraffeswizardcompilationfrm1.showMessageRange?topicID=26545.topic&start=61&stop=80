Like most Blizzard games, there is barely an original idea to be seen, that they have announced so far, anyway. And based off their track record, real innovation is not Blizzard's strong suit - they take a well proven idea, then make that idea the best it can possibly be. Even Warcraft 1, their first &quot;big&quot; game, was just a refinement of the previous generations of RTS - barely a single innovate feature in the entire game - it was just done better than anyone else had done before. I think WoW is running the risk of suffering the fate of every single other MMORPG that tried to be &quot;EQ but better&quot;. People simply won't leave their investment in their current game to try another game that is not that different from the previous one. People will flock to it in droves, realise its not that different from what they were playing before, and leave in almost as large droves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hmm but there's very little new about WoW? WTF are you smoking? WoW is going to be the game that EQ should have been. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mitebe1>MiteBe1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 716<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 9:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1> The real reason I hold out hope for WoW over other games and EQ2 in particular is the history of the company. Blizzard has a history of delaying the game to get it right the first time and releasing quality enjoyable software. Verant/SOE had (has?) a history of releasing software in a late beta state and attempting to patch on the fly. The improved quality of PoP is, to me, more an indication SOE's awareness of impending competition in the marketplace moreso then a genuine love of the game. They figured that to retain customers and extend the brand's good name they would need to improve customer relations by improving game play/quality.<br>
<br>
Now of course this is a new type of game for Blizzard but as long as they adhere to their basic tenets that got them this far I see no reason to expect anything other than a good game. The biggest challenge for Blizzard is coming up with enough content to keep people interesting in the game beyond the first few months. I have read that this is in fact why they are not releasing the game at this point as the gameplay movies seem to show a pretty sound engine. <br>
<br>
Time will tell who will win the next round but suffice to say that this next year will see SOE's first legitimate competition from more than one company and many of them with as deep if not deeper pockets than Sony. It may very well be that everyone will win because it may just be that the marketplace is big enough to have more than one company survives in this genre.<br>
<br>
I like the graphics from both games. I like the realistic look of EQ2 and I like the cartoony character of WoW. The real proof of the pudding will be content, gameplay, quality (read lack of bugs) and customer support. Blizzard has always had the first 3 nailed but this will be their first real baptism of fire in an MMORPG type game. SOE has decent content, has steadily improved gameplay and has questionable quality and CS, and EQ2 has different gameplay due to the reworked character development.<br>
<br>
I think one thing that everyone can agree on is whether you are rooting for and ultimately choose WoW, EQ2 or BrandX, we (the customer) are the ultimate winners of this increased competition. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1842<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 9:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think one thing that everyone can agree on is whether you are rooting for and ultimately choose WoW, EQ2 or BrandX, we (the customer) are the ultimate winners of this increased competition. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
So... I like the realism of EQ2.  But I rather like the artful look of WoW.  It adds character and style to the game.  Which EQ2's graphics lack for me.  They both have great graphics stylistically and it is the difference in them that make each stand out.  I will say that I prefer the artistic look of WoW to EQ2.  However, I want to see more of the spell effects.  The few I have seen have been unappealing when compared to EQ2.<br>
<br>
As to which game will be better and who has the better experience with what.  Well, that will all be seen later.  Yes, Blizzard has an amazing track record for nearly every topic that can be mentioned.  But they have zero experience with MMOG's.  VI/SoE has 4 years.  Blizzards CS has always been very good, even excellent.  However, they have never dealt with an MMOG before.  It is reasonable to assume that they will continue to do so and I have faith in that.  Still, this is new for them.  They are not impervious to making errors.  It also bares mentioning that since SoE purchased VI, things... they are a-changin'.  EQ has become a better game as a result.  I have personally never had any issues with GM's.  They have always been polite, reasonable, and prompt.  I did have an unsavory experience with phone tech support.  As it turned out though, it was a problem with my machine and not their code.<br>
<br>
Preferences is what this all boils down to.  Do you prefer the World of Warcraft or Everquest II.  These games are not out yet.  Wait until they are to decide.  It sure is fun to talk about them though!!  =D<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Calling them a compliment, Parker welcomes comparisons to Warcraft III. Heavy on story and tightly scripted campaigns, Lords of EverQuest bears more resemblance to Blizzard's blockbuster than any games previously seen from Sony Online's internal Verant studio. The comparison is also fitting because it's a piece of this competitor's mass-market and primarily single-player-driven pie that Sony, already a pioneer in the online field, wants a slice of. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Blizzard is getting on the bandwagon and we will see another big title hit the market but without a well thought out mid to end game product ala DAOC.  Then a couple months later things changed in a big way for WoW.  They took on some of the top players of EQ (6-7ish months ago) and put them to work on the mid-end game content along with all the gripes we have talked about for years.  That in itself is the biggest difference I see between SOE and Blizzard.  Taking the high end-game player base from EQ and putting them to work.  The biggest name I saw go to work for Blizzard was Tigole of LoS.<br>
<br>
I don't see SOE doing that with their own product.  I don't know why they wouldn't, but that is the difference I see and think will make the biggest impact between the two companies and their products.  Don't get me wrong, I love the graphics of EQ and what I see from EQ2, but I also don't mind what I'm seeing from WoW.  When WoW comes out, I will be trying their product.  The little things like the tradeskills will help in what product I decide to stick with.  I've put 3+ years into EQ.... 3 developed characters and their skills.  It won't be easy to say goodbye to EQ, but if WoW gives the player base a strong foundation for action along with the all other traits then I will make a change.  Again with former top end-game players from EQ working on content for the mid to end game levels I believe WoW will offer to the players unbelievable content.  <br>

I run eq on a p2 350 - 448 megs of ram and a geforce 2mx 64 meg card. It actually runs half decent, even able to run more then one instance for xp and minor crap. That said I have sound disabled, no luclin shit models on, texture qual on low and 8x600 reso.<br>

I have little faith in eq2 after seeing even a p4 2.4 with a radeon 9700 chug along on a raid with 50 people on screen, with a whole 2 luclin models enabled.

Gameplay is basically all that matters to me because I would not have played EQ so long if all the features weren't in it. DAoC has much better and looks to me faster graphics than EQ does but my god is it ever boring as crap. Has a certain charm for people who like PvP but otherwise screw it. I still play muds myself and especially any new GodWars muds that come up. Ah well, here's hoping the future of games goes for gameplay and not graphics.

I am more partial to liking EQ2's graffics more but think WoW has the potential to be an awsome maybee better game the EQ2.  One thing has been nagging at me though in reguards to WoW.  What people will the game attract?<br>
<br>
I don't know if many of you have played Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 on the net.  But there are a LOT of idiots that play those two games that will probably flock to WoW and my only hope is their parents don't let them play it tell they are 18 have their own methods of payment and grow up.<br>
<br>
For all those here that hate the Dr00ds and Dood speak, probably 90% of what I've seen on diablo 2 chat channels is nothing but that.<br>
<br>
So if your thinking of going to WoW (and I am planning on trying bolth wow and EQ2), be afraid, be very afraid.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The difference is, all those thoughtso EQ killers were made by relativly no nameds. WoW is designed by one of the most well known company in gaming business.<br>

The main complaint is not the customer support anymore. its SOE releasing unfinished expansions because deadlines are more important to shareholders. <br>
its the awfully designed content. The mindnumbing timesinks, the ultra rare droprates of some quest items.<br>

How about posting your resume and specific skills that relate to:<br>

a) designing and creating 3D Game engines, <br>
b) working with directX, and Microsoft development<br>
c) or if your not a game developer, your specific software engineering experience would be useful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I dont need a certificate to say I had awful framerates with the luclin engine on my highend computer, do I ?<br>
Sorry, but you are just being an elitist here.<br>
Just because you've been working for EA that doesnt make you the only person here allowed to talk about game engines.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the new SoE game &quot;lords of everquest&quot; has some very similar looks as say Warcraft<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
looks even count less in an RTS. <br>
considering how fucked EQs class balance is, I guess the balance of units in Lords of EQ will just be horrible.<br>

<br>
btw, Blizzard lists fohguild.org now as an E3 Coverage site for WoW <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Sage Quineloe<br>

Your only as good as your last game!<br>

WoW is dead meat by birth, face the facts....

<br>
I am an old Diablo II play who got borred because it was sooo much hacks and cheats all the time. In the end i started to cheat as well and lost two accounts but my friend lost all his accounts.<br>
But it was a question of everyone does it so then i can cheat to.<br>
Blizzard made a lot promises that they should and stuff each month to make the game play better but nothing happend... And now they are about to release the 1.10 patch... hope it will be better but i dont know if they can run a game like WoW...<br>
