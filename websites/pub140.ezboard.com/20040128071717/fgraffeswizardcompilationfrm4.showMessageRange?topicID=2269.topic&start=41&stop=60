I mentioned the flags I had not to impress gimps like you but to establish that any wizard I would group with in elemental planes would necessarily be in a raiding guild, or at least have accompanied a raiding guild on multiple raids.  I would therefore expect any such wizard to have concussion, and if they don't then they are lazy.  This is my opinion.  If you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself.  Also, I don't expect to just heal the main tank.  I heal whoever needs healing.  If the reason they need healing is because they can't control their own aggro however, and they make no effort to do so, then they won't be in my group to receive heals very long.<br>
<br>
I've never grouped with Ikeya.  STFU Bitch.<br>
<br>
Rombus - Wow, thanks for the insight!  OMG, I see now that I am completely wrong and you are completely right!  Your well reasoned argument for why I am wrong is just amazing!  Tell me again though why I should just sit there quietly and heal the wizard when the wizard is chaining nukes not using concussion and tanking 50% of the time, making the mob a ping-pong ball?  I suppose you would say I was a nitpicking ass if the warrior was shooting arrows at the mob the entire fight instead of taunting and meleeing and I had the *AUDACITY* to criticize them for it.  Why don't you wait to open your mouth until you actually have something to say?<br>
<br>
Kaisann, how did I disregard anything you said?  You asked how I had a problem with mana regen and I explained why mana regen is incredibly situational, to demonstrate that in SOME situations mana regen can be critical.  I didn't even bother to go into the fact that if I am not using my mana to heal the wizard I can do many other things...  mark of kings, mark of righteousness, pet, I can yaulp/melee with a proc hammer (which reduces mana regen but increases damage a LOT), I can nuke, it gives me more mana to buff my groupmates without making them wait for me to get a safe margin again after casting said buffs, etc...  I am not going to waste my time listing everything.<br>
<br>
You also claim that you have no problems keeping people such as overnuking wizards alive with just a celestial healing...  sure that may work in valor or BoT or something, but if you are xping in earth, trash mobs hit for 700s VERY QUICKLY, have nasty procs, etc...  so you're telling me that you can keep a wizard alive using just a 300hp/tick elixir when that person is taking ~700 DPS?  Supernal Elixir at 500/tick won't even keep up with that, not to mention that by the time you start casting that wonderful 3-4 second casting time spell, the wizard has already incurred one round of melee.  So 3 seconds later when the elixir lands the wizard is down about 3000 hps or more of their 4-5000 hp, putting them in or near low life frenzy aggro range, at which point they get pasted.<br>

<br>
The entire point is:  Wizards had two claims to fame. Not necessarily listed in any order: 1) Ports (which for convenience sake got us invited to groups, to a lesser degree but still)<br>
<br>
and 2) Massive damage output.<br>
<br>
The problem?  PoP scratch idea number one..the albeit small but ever present &quot;Wizzies can port&quot; factor is negated.<br>
<br>
The BIG problem?  Wizards have but on major usage.  Damage! Damage! Damage!  Hmm We cannot but buff (thank goodness!), we cannot heal (That belongs to the other classes), we cannot pull (in most cases, besides, Rangers need something to die for /snicker), nor can we CR very effectively.  But we can dish out the punishment!  Er we used to be the best at it. <br>
<br>
Thing is now, a Ranger with AM3 can really dish it out too as well as host of other useful skills.  Magician, although they whine and moan (like the rest of us) they are heavy damage dealers.  They can CoH, debuff and the pet is great dps.  They also have some very nice rain spells and some good DD's (slower casting and more mana but still they have the nice pets let's not forget..WHICH they can also heal!).  The Rogue, ever hear a Rogue say, &quot;Med break? OOM!&quot;  Nope and that is not a problem with the Ranger either.  If the Mage is OOM, no biggie, his/her pet just keep embarassing the groups tank.  All three can do more than the Wizard and all three can rival or come darn close to our damage output with little or no OOM.<br>
<br>
This is why Wizards cannot get groups.  The current game conditions and situation literally make the Wizard not needed and less than desirable until we make 60 plus and obtain certain AA abilities.<br>
<br>
Sad but true.  <br>

I'm aware of all this!  As I said, I've played a 65 cleric _extensively_.  I even specifically stated that I can think of a single situation (no CC and no slower) where I would probably ask a wizard to back off if he consistently drew agro.  Other than that?  Not too likely.<br>

We seem to *mostly* agree here then.  Note that one of my examples of varying mana regen situations was no slower/no CC.  I agree with you that some situations you have so much mana that it really doesn't matter that a wizard is overnuking or whatever...  and typically in those situations if I have to heal a little more because of overaggro, I may suck it up for longer before I start getting indignant.  On the other hand, it is still shoddy playing and I may eventually say something as a matter of principle...  you don't want to set a precedent here that shoddy playing is ok.  When you *DO* need a wizard to control aggro finely, you can't wait for them to learn how to do it...  they need to have practiced and to be aware of when it is imperative to do it without being told.  Which lends itself to the next question, which is 'If controlling your aggro is a fine and good thing in tight situations, and can be the difference between the cleric having enough mana to keep the group alive or not, why not do it all the time if you can?'  If everybody in the group decides not to put in as much effort and play crappily because they have that margin, not only does the group efficiency and therefore kill rate go way down, but when you get a couple adds and suddenly have to switch from lazy mode to kickass mode, it may already be too late, or you may not make the switch fast enough...  Playing well all the time &gt; Playing well only when you have to.<br>

Sorry, we were talking about wizards overnuking and having to be healed (among other things) and you made a statement that you 'never had to mem SR at all and was often able to keep people alive using just celestial elixir' so I took that to mean wizards some of the time too.  Arbitration is arguably the best cleric xp group ability in the game, I love it to death (which it usually saves me from) and yeah it is great to stack an elixir on a wizard and arbitrate them back into a safe HP range...  but arb only refreshes every 3 minutes and if the wizard overaggros again in that time you may not be fast enough...  besides, why should I have to waste my arb healing a wizard that shouldn't be getting owned in the first place?  If a lazy wizard sucks up my arbitration, I can't use it next time a mob adds and pastes the chanter unexpectedly or slow resists or any of the other myriad situations where arb is useful.  Nope.  It's gone, because some wizard who *COULD* have kept from getting aggro, didn't care enough not to.  This leaves supernal light as your only remaining targetable fast heal... which isn't an ideal choice, it is twice as slow casting as supernal remedy, less mana efficient, generates more aggro, and usually heals more damage than the wizard has taken.<br>

<br>
i am quite aware of these testimonies, but i still think that concussion has no effect when it's resisted.  the only reason i think it even might seem to have an effect is the fact that the entire time you're casting the concussion that's being resisted, you are not nuking and the tank is building up hate.  you'd get the same effect if you just sat there and did nothing for that 7 or so seconds between nukes.<br>
<br>
i think that even though it is resisted by a lot of mobs, concussion is one of a wizard's most useful, if not the most useful.  however, i still believe you are a dipshit for thinking that you can tell someone else how to do their job.  there are a lot of different ways to deal damage to a mob, and to each his own. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=492380" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jomarti8/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 1103<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/25/03 9:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> You just proved you know less about wizards than you think, or you would be aware of all the testimony that shows that concussion has an effect whether it is resisted or not.

Just proves us that you can easily get 65 and ele access while being totally ignorant as long as you play cleric. Then again a meth head ninja looter cleric on BB also has ele plane access, since ele-level guild needed clerics.<br>
<br>
Eupharates, couple of points for you, maybe you'll be able to understand them if you read them few times:<br>
<br>
1. SoS is more efficient than draughts/rains/other spells in ele+ levels.<br>
2. Concussion does nothing when resisted.<br>

Now, you had some feeble attempts in 2nd post to cover your ignorance, but as long as you take lessons from Quon, you'll end up being worst cleric ever to visit these boards and trying to stir shit up. Heck, I'm willing to bet even Sam plays 10x better cleric than you do hand has 20x the knowledge of EQ.<br>
<br>
And for your benefit, yes, I'm ele flagged and time flagged, so I do know what gear and what mobs there are to fight. Yet, I also know that ele-plane wizard can tank fire/earth/air mobs even without massive healing (water is more tricky with interrupts). After slow those mobs aren't anything spectacular and if only we'd have super-rune like enchanters do, we could even tank them without heals. But it clearly says something when wizard is tanking a mob and cleric is using CH. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But thank you for the insight, I didn't believe there was that any newbie clerics in eleplanes across servers, but you managed to show that there is at least one. And thank you for the laughs!<br>

<br>
First of all, learn to read.  Where exactly did I say Strike of Solusek is inefficient.  That's right.  NOWHERE.  How about YOU STFU, lol.  All I said was it was *eye candy*.  It *is* eye candy...  it is your largest critting spell.  Did I say using Strike of Solusek AT ALL was a problem?  Again... NO I DIDN'T you illiterate fucktard.  If you can use strike of solusek and control your aggro without getting summoned and poned every other nuke, then I am very happy with you using it.  I know wizards that can and do use it to great effect.  So please, spare me.<br>
<br>
As for concussion and resists...  well I recall several people parsed the emperor fight with and without concussion (concussion gets resisted every time on emperor) and all of them found that even with resisted concussions interspersed between nukes they were still doing more damage before being summoned and dying.  There was also much anecdotal evidence.  As I recall the main argument against it was that you aggro mobs with resisted concussions if you try to pull with it, but that was expected because concussion would have added you to the hate list, then reduced your hate, but you would still have been *on* the hatelist.  So the bulk of the evidence presented makes me lean towards concussion still having a de-aggro effect when resisted.  I don't see how you can fault me for this however even if I am wrong, since you wizards aren't even in agreement yourselves.<br>
<br>
Ok, so you think I am a noob then because you claim I said something untrue, which I didn't actually say, and because you interpreted the unfortunately not airtight concussion evidence differently?  Wait a minute, would a noob even *know* about the concussion discussions?  I will patiently wait for you to stop frothing so you can actually say something based on reality.<br>

But to support my claim, consider the following:<br>
<br>
DPM = Damage Per Mana<br>
<br>
Strike of Solusek: 2740 dmg for 640 mana = 4.28 DPM<br>
Tears of Marr: 850x3=2550 dmg for 425mana = 6 DPM<br>
Tears of Marr: 850x2=1700 dmg for 425 mana = 4 DPM<br>
Tears of Arylixir: 645x3=1935dmg for 420mana = 4.61 DPM<br>
Draught of Ro, E'ci, etc: 950 dmg for 255 mana= 3.72 DPM<br>
<br>
Tears of Marr stacked with Draught of E'ci:<br>
850x3=2550+950=3500 dmg for 425+255 or 680 mana = 5.14 DPM<br>
or<br>
850x2=1700+950=2850 dmg for 680 mana = 4.19 DPM<br>
<br>
Ok so stacking a draught with a rain, even with one wave resisted (get malo) comes out to fractions below the damage per mana efficiency of strike of solusek alone.  If you get all 3 waves, the rains come out ahead by far.  And using rains stacked with smaller 1k sized nukes makes your aggro spread over time instead of being an almost 3000 point burst of aggro.<br>
<br>
I will remove the illiterate fucktard award I attempted to bestow in my above post and award one to myself for not addressing the true point and instead getting caught up in the 'OMG you said strike of solusek sucks' argument.<br>

<br>
For SoS we get 25% mana save item (silk gloves, most rotting of all ele pieces).<br>
For SoS the ID items also have an effect.<br>
For rains we get innate 20% resist rate, regardless of debuffs on mobs.<br>
For rains the ID items do not have an effect.<br>
<br>
So... for SoS ele wizards get 30% (15% avg) ID item, 25% (12.5% avg) mana save and for rains we get 15% (7.5% avg) mana save and no ID.<br>
<br>
SoS is 2740x1.15 / 640x0.875 = 5.62 DPM<br>
ToM is 3x850x0.8 / 425x0.925 = 5.20 DPM<br>
ToM+DoE is 3x850x0.8 + 950x1.3 / 680x0.925 = 5.21<br>
<br>
As you can see, the rains/draughts efficiency isn't there for ele+ wizards. Furthermore with concussion and spell casting subtlety, the aggro isn't 3k big huge chunk and with SoS/Conc chain we bust out more dps, more dpm than with the rains/draughts you seem to favor. Next time you want to teach a wizard how to play their class, maybe you should think before opening your virtual mouth.<br>
<br>
I don't think wizards are telling you to use CH only, because it is the most efficient heal you get. And if you are using SL/SR, aren't you going against your efficiency speak?<br>
<br>
And as for Eye Candy crits, we get SoM for those, as with it one can do 7k+ crits, while with SoS we're stuck to sub-7k.<br>
<br>
But before accusing people being illiterate, maybe you should take a step back and actually read what you wrote yourself. Posting few times, contradicting yourself in different posts doesn't sound too smart, now does it. You do have some hope still. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 1105<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 9:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Quon-wannabe</span><hr size=1> And yes, there is typo in ToM+DoE combo.

<br>
ToM+DoE is 3x850x0.8 + 950x1.15 / 680x0.925 = 4.98<br>
<br>
For DPM, one can always go with ADoI+ISoS+DoE chain:<br>
<br>
1200x1.3+1200x1.3+950x1.15 / (250+300+255)*0.925 = 4212.5 / 744.625 = 5.66<br>

and that DPM is divided over time, but dps is lower. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=2269.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=2269.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=2269.topic&start=61&stop=62>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=2269.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=2269.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=2269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=2269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
