<br>
Some tips that I've noticed that haven't shown up in this thread:<br>
<br>
Make sure your chanters have ToT up.  In a big pull, where you go back for mobs more than once, chanters can last a LOT longer if they mana tap a caster (seb is very good for this) while stunning.  This is especially important if you have 2 enchanters because the bigger the pull, the more efficiently you use Wizard mana.  <br>
<br>
As an extra trick, mez a caster at the end of the fight, and don't kill it.  Use that mob for your enchanters (2 taps) to regain mana faster.  You can kill it on your next pull.<br>
<br>
Use AE tash on the boss mobs or the higher-level ones.  Dont bother ae tashing all of them, (ae tash hits 4-5 mobs tops).<br>
<br>
For pulling, use a bard.  AE snare is an excellent way to pull and with jboots or (far better) run speed 3, you can easily outpace snared mobs.<br>
<br>
Level 59 bards get a pbae dot that reduces MR.  That's an ae tash for every mob.  Very handy.  I usually will twist that dot, AE slow/snare, Rune song (45-50 point rune) and mana song/regen during a pull, and two mana song in downtime.  A level 55+ bard can regen you 2.5 times as much mana as C3 with the new songs from luclin, and will cut your downtime in half.  Bards also get mez, at level 60 group DA (excellent for those times that your enchanters both get resists at the same time and also for pulling).<br>
<br>
Crap buff your puller (i.e. your bard) when pulling.  Nothing sucks more then getting annulled a few times and having aego/symbol get dispelled when 15+ mobs are on your ass.  Keep your puller crap buffed during each pull and this will save you some puller deaths.<br>
<br>
Manage your pulls.  With one chanter in sebilis you can pull maximum 15-18 mobs, if they are low level (e.g. no krups).  Anything more you're asking for trouble.  I highly highly recommend having 2 enchanters, and I tend to pull 20-30 mobs at a time in this configuration.  If you pull 30 krups at a time, you have about a 50-50 chance of having the enchanters die, so try to limit the number of high level mobs.  That being said, I hear that 40-50 mobs are doable, but that' has got to be very difficult in sebilis (almost exclusively the only place I will ae due to the cash drops).<br>
<br>
Ae groups rock.<br>

<br>
Yes, their spells are slightly less efficient damage-wise, but they can have a much greater mana pool by piling mod rods on the ground and using them between two AE's.<br>
<br>
However, it's best to get a mage with the upgraded mod rod as the 1st version doesn't give a lot of mana (only one charge), the upgrade is much more powerful. (1 rod MK2 = 220*3 for 300*3 damages for a casting cost of 400)<br>

<br>
Corrections:<br>
hmm where to begin?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For the nukers, wizards are the main players. However, mages can be substituted as well if high enough level to cast Point Blanks. Necros and Clerics can also do damage if the mobs being pulled are undead. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Obviously you don't know that Mage's highest and only PBAE above lvl 50 is at lvl 51: Scintillation. This spell has 1:1 mana/dmg ratio thus sucks. Necros have no place in an ae group, period. There are no undead-specific pbae's in the game, period. And necro's highest pbae is at lvl 39 that does 155 damage. Clerics get their last pbae at lvl 52: upheaval. The ratio is also around 1:1 however it's a good backup.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You can use your Eye of Zomm to pull random trains in dungeons by casting it through the wall<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
Comments:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If you plan to pull more 8+ mobs, then...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you plan to pull less than 8 mobs, then it comes down to about 1 mob per person per pull. In another word, it's exactly like everyone soloing 1 mob each. The exp will simply suck. If you don't pull at least 15, consider it a waste of mana.<br>
I can see that you are working with a low level enchanter. One lvl 60 enchanters can hold 15 frogs safely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just as a sidenote, don't be affraid to grab a mage as a 2nd nuker when you, for some strange reason, can't find a wizard or you want to AE deep and wish to keep your puller safe with CoH.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Mage can definitely work as the 2nd nuker... if you like to ae green cons! Plus CoH is overated. Do you know it costs 500 mana and 5pp? If the group has to resort to CoH to keep the puller alive then you should get a new puller.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes, their spells are slightly less efficient damage-wise, but they can have a much greater mana pool by piling mod rods on the ground and using them between two AE's.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Their ae has 1:1 ratio. Ours have nearly 2:1. Calling it &quot;slightly less efficient&quot; is an understatement. Dropping mod rods!!?? So much is wrong with doing that. First, if the mage helps nuking, he would end up lom just like everyone else. So everyone would recover to FM at around the same time. If you are suggesting that the rest of the people rest at FM while mage summons rods AND med back, then you are just not very smart.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, it's best to get a mage with the upgraded mod rod as the 1st version doesn't give a lot of mana (only one charge), the upgrade is much more powerful.

Secondly, the first mod rod is merely a mediocre mana transfer method. It costs MORE mana than it gives. Mod rod 2 has no place in an efficient group other than for emergency either. Because mod rod will take away your hp and thus requires the healer to heal you. This will cost mana for the healers (unless they have free heal equipments) and thus is still a mana transfer spell in a sense---from the healer to you. And again if everyone is lom at the end of the battle, everyone would regain FM at about the same time. Transfering mana in between members will only result in more down time.<br>

<br>
At 60 I don't ae without 2 enchanters...why?  More mobs. Simply put if your only pulling 8 mobs in an AE pull that is a waste of time and mana. Also, all enchants should have all the stuns loaded you never know when your gonna get a resist and cause the whole group to die. With the extra stun you have a safety net, so to speak.<br>
<br>
As for the best place to AE....Hands down Acrylia Caverns is the best. Tons of caster mobs (low HP's) fast respawn (around 5mins) and can easily get 45+ mob pulls with the right puller. <br>

<br>
Well, in my time i've done a ton of AE groups, and from my experience the group i'm about to explain is the best i've ever seen.<br>
<br>
Zone to AE in = Acrylia<br>
<br>
1 wizard (has to be good and epic recommended) &lt;lvl 60<br>
1 bard (also has to be an excellent puller and rec lvl is 59 60)<br>
3 enchanters (for massive pulls like 60  mobs, pref all 3 be 60 but 1 or 2 can be 58 59)<br>
1 cleric (pref 60 with clicker to reduce down time)<br>
<br>
With this group the bard can pull 20  mobs in one pull and the wiz can do 3 pulls of 10 mobs or so then the bard go in on a 2nd pull and pull whatever is left.  It's very efficient and as long as the wizard is a good puller you'll get 60  mobs on every pull.  Well, the bard has to be a good puller also but most bards are, it's the wizards that you have to worry about.  Then with the bard mana song and c3 the down time is short so when the mobs repop in 5 or 6 min you'll be ready to pull them again. This tactic equals MASSIVE exp and a lot of fun =)<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Hey everyone.<br>
<br>
I am a retired wizard and have not played EQ in nearly a year now.  I used to play on Vazaelle and I remember what a chore it was to try and get an AE group going.  Eventually I was able to get a somewhat consitent group on the go. It seems like times are finally changing and AE groups are becoming much more common. <br>
<br>
As I am sure you all know, nothing beats an AE group in terms of pure excitement, making money and exp.  I remember bringing a few new people into our little group and they were simply AMAZED.  We had an night where ALL of our group members (except for the puller of course) were encumbered just from all the PLAT we gained from the frogs in seb.  Looting was always a chore since you had 10+ mobs to always loot and this took precious time away from medding.<br>
<br>
So I have had some pretty extensive experience in the AE areana and would like to add a tid bit or too.  I am already beginning to ramble <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I better get this post moving.  I will try to keep my comments to those which people have not yet mentioned or to things I disagree with or am adding to.<br>
<br>
1.  For new groups, or if you have a few people who are new to AE tactics in your group, take it slow.  There is nothing worse than having your first AE pull go really wrong.  It ends up putting a foul taste in your mouth about AE tactics and its something we wish to encourage in other players, not discourage.  So just start off with a simple 6-10 mob pull.  Do this a couple of times so everyone has a good feel for what their rolls are.<br>
<br>
2.  Your enchanter is the king pin of the entire operation.  One night we had a different enchanter, of the same level, but could not keep the mobs stunned.  We could only pull a max of 10 mobs (at best) which was pretty sad.  As someone already mentioned, a good enchanter will have 3 of their best stuns memmed and cycle through these.  They will also have their fourth fasting casting stun spell memmed (the lowest level one) to fill in the gaps when they get a few resists on the regular stuns.  A single enchanter can keep as many as 19 lower level frog (no krups) stunned.  I believe this was our maximum with one chanter.<br>
<br>
3.  Everytime people new to AE tactics start getting a 'taste' for the massive killage the group can do, WE ALL start getting overly excited.  Well, at least I know I did and every person I met who was new to the tactic also got overly excited.  This leads to doing things that are just beyond the groups capabilities.  ie: puller trying to get too many.  This is the #1 cause for deaths in AE groups I found.  It mostly lead to the puller dying, which is not as bad as a group CR, but it still means you have to do a rez, etc... etc...  It sometimes also led to the whole group dying... ie: too many mobs for the chanter to keep stunned.<br>
<br>
4.  I noticed our group started coming up with our own little vocabulary for AE tactics.  In particular we started always talking about &quot;pushing&quot; and &quot;parking&quot;.  Once we started to get pretty good at AEing, we were trying to figure out ways to increase the number of mobs without having the puller die.  So we came up with the term &quot;pushing&quot; instead of pulling.  Pushing simply means that the tank runs to a designated spot in the zone, getting as many mobs to follow him as he can.  The rest of the group then follows the tank to that designated spot, being careful not to follow too closely so that they don't get agroed from the stragglers of the train.  I noticed some of you have mentioned this tactics.  The other is stun &quot;parking&quot; which I think everyone is familiar with.  The chanter simply stuns the mobs in place while the tank gets more mobs.  If the tank gets beat up from the first pull, he gets a heal before he heads out again.  If he heads out without a heal, you should have a designated wizard to help with aggro control. ie: throw in an AE on the parked mobs to get some of the mobs off the chanter.  This worked well for us.  AE tactics can get pretty detailed.  You have to be able to react to the situation.<br>
<br>
5.  Don't be too worried if you can only grab 8-10 mobs in a pull.  Ya, its not as exciting or effecient if your used to 12-19, but it sure beats having to rez your puller or stealing mobs from other groups.  Besides, even if your pulls only consisted of 8 mobs for the entire night, your still gonna out loot and out exp regular &quot;one at a time&quot; style groups.  With 8 mobs in a pull, your enchanter will rarely have to park so he/she will use little mana.  Your tank will not need as much healing, so your cleric mana won't be taxed.  Your limiting factor is your wizard's mana.  This leads for very little down time.  If your group is really good, your cleric will even throw in an AE or 2.  If your doing the &quot;big&quot; pulls, then your cleric will have to pay really close attention to those hp bars and won't be AEing.  Your chanter will have to park which will take up more of his/her mana.  This more or less evens things out and is the ideal situation in terms of effeciency I think, but is obviously more risky.<br>
<br>
There we some nights we were working like a well oiled machine.  We would start out from the entrance of seb, &quot;push&quot; a train to the bridge and park the mobs there.  Our tank would pull all mobs from the exit and the wizards would pull some frogs from across the bridge.  This was a good 15+ mob smack down.<br>
<br>
Next we would push a train towards the disco and would usually have to stop before the castle.  We would park there, and tank would pull all mobs from around the castle.  This was usually around 12 mobs.<br>
<br>
So in a total of &quot;2 pulls&quot; we were at disco 1.  Everyone in the group was always so flabbergasted at how fast we would get there (and we would kill all the mobs from the exit which isn't necessary if you are just tryiing to get to D1).  &quot;How can I go back to killing em one at a time after doing this?&quot; was always what we would say.<br>
<br>
Next we would pull all of disco 1...  Thats right.. all.  This includes the side rooms.  This was tricky because there is that damn Ilis wizard always in that pull.  This can be handled pretty neatly if you get your tank to aggro the Ilis wizard after his/her pull.  This could be tricky because you want to pull the wizard on the second pull and get the side rooms on the first.  We would sometimes do 3 parks making the chanter park a lot of mobs for a pretty long time which is pretty risky and I would not recommend doing that often ;-).  All of D1 mobs would be like 15-16 I think but we often split this up.  So if we felt there was too much risk, we would do 1/2 of d1 and then do the other 1/2 plus the hallway and the siderooms towards d2.   (I think that was called the pickle room.  Man its been a while ;-) ).  When we would split, the first pull would be about 10 (with the Ilis).  The second would be about 12-13.<br>
<br>
By this time, mobs would start to respawn at the castle and tunnel (sometimes we were so fast that they had not respawned).  So we would then push our way back and would usually stop part way up the tunnel and park there.  We would then pull a few more mobs from further down the tunnel.  Again about a 12-13 mob smack down.<br>
<br>
The next one was always cool.  We usually got quite a bit of mobs out of this one.  One of the wizards would gate out, jboot himself and then reenter seb.  Then we would time it so our tank and our wizard would both &quot;push&quot; to the top of the ramp on our way to seb's exit.  We would park there.  The tank would then pull the rest of the exit.  This was sometimes risky if the wizard got stunned on his way down.  One stun, with 3 mobs on your butt, will pretty much take our your shield and then some.  Its then a pure run to the park spot.  But we would almost always make this one.  I think we would get 16-17 out of this pull.<br>
<br>
So now, we would head towards the bartentender (we would never actually go all the way to him though).  This is where we reached our record of 19 mobs with 1 enchanter.  We would push to the jail room, park there, tank would pull the rest of the jail, the wizards would go flux stuff further towards the bartender, being sure to flux something thats as far away as possible.  These pulls were pretty risky but were just an absolute blast.  We would then repeat the process and head back to D1. We just hauled ass that night.<br>
<br>
We turned quite a few eyes that night.  I remember getting a few tells from other people, who where in seb that night, about getting into an AE group.  You would get the regular &quot;camp check&quot; from people coming into the zone.  There were only 2 groups in the zone, us and some other single pulling group.  Our response was something like &quot;we are camping, seb entrance, seb exit, seb tunnel, d1, part of d2, tunnel towards bartender, jail and surrounding area.&quot;  People would say, &quot;WTF&quot;.  We just laughed.... It was just awesome.<br>
<br>
We never even did &quot;Thunderclap&quot; pushing into a corner or some of the other awesome comments I have seen in this thread.  Its great so see the enthusiasm.<br>

<br>
If you have a level 60 enchanter and the rest of the enchanters are lower level. Let the 60 enchanter cast Winds of Tashani (Or Wind of Tashanian, one of those 2 is level 60 PB Tash) This will make sure that the lower level enchanters have more stuns go through. Very wise when using it against the 51-55 level pulls. <p><center>

<br>
I've only done FG ae, but I always hit the puller with Divine light.  Never Celesial heal/elixar.  I will tend to elixar the puller and enchanters if they take any damage after the pull.<br>
<br>
Also, make sure to bedlam your cleric on each pull.  After healing the puller, all the mobs bee-line for the cleric  =)<br>
<br>
On the nuking end, I do keep up upheaval.  If the mobs are stunned stable, its fun to throw an upheaval when the mobs are about half health.<br>
<br>
I also keep up an ae stun, just in case..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvaleerxev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ValeerXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/3/02 10:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> What AE stun spell do clerics get? <p><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=115485>Valeer, XEV</a></b>

<br>
With the new group tap spells, necros can also make a killing in AE groups.<br>
<br>
With the group mana tap, well, that's self explanitory.  Zevfeer's, the 720 point group lifetap (over time), they can easily help heal.<br>
<br>
Two invulnerability spells make pulling very easy, and should they get damaged they can heal themselves, as well.<br>
<br>
Don't talk smack about word of souls (147 damage), it can be chaincasted with word of spirit (103 damage).  Its not 500+ damage, but they are fast casting and low mana cost.  And for a necro gaining 35+ mana/tick its not like it is going to break the mana bank.<br>
<br>
Then we move on to pets.  Pets add damage, nuff said.  When y'all out of mana, the pet keeps fighting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And then there's the lame mana dump spells, but no self respecting necro would use them. *cough*<br>
<br>
The moral and point is, don't be so quick to discount a necro's role in an AE group.  Clearly it is not on par as a wizard's or enchanter's, but then again not every class is supposed to be the same. <p><hr width="10%" align="left">

Key here is to not cast your stuns too early, or they have no effect.  Next is to not pull so many mobs that are melee, so that they can't stun the enchanter.  Key is to start stunning before the mobs come up.  This way, you have like half of them stunned, and the others still running up.  Don't worry, you'll get them stunned very soon after.<br>
   One enchanter is stunned, its pretty hard to get back stun chain.  If all else fails, get another enchanter, then it's np.
