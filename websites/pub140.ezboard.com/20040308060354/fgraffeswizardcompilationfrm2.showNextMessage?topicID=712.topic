Just wanted to get the details posted here as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am not sure this is a wizard quest, but it does involve at least one wizard NPC.  And he mentions scrolls he was working on in collaboration with another NPC who he actually betrayed or killed.  So there could well be something to do with wizards with this quest.<br>
<br>
Quests are fun anyways, so what the hey?  Credit goes to Eliezer of Erudin, brother of Komaru, for tipping me off to this quest.<br>
<br>
The quest starts near the Erudin docks area.  The NPC you want to find is one Brianna Falsruinay, who is upstairs in one of the rooms in the building near the dock with the merchants.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'Hail, Brianna Falsruinay'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Hello Traveler, I am afraid I don't recognize you to be a local around these parts although I could have been buried in my work. I have been quite busy since [Elisi] turned up missing.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'Where is Elisa?'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Elisi Nasin is a very well known enchanter and courier from Erudin. It is part of her trade to travel to Qeynos and share knowledge with the residents of the Order of Three. She often travels once or twice a month to deliver and pick up her most recent workings.  However, she still has not returned from her most recent [travel]. We fear the worst for her; pirates have been rampant around these parts lately. We should send [someone to Qeynos] soon but have not had the time to do so.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'I will travel to Qeynos'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Your offer is quite gracious Lunal, I do have a good feeling about you. If you wish to help us figure out what has happened to Elisi please travel to Qeynos. I believe the person she used to exchange magic with was named Jalorin. He is a member of the Order of Three so you should be able to find him there. Present him with this medal so that he may know you are sent from us. Please return to me if you should discover anything about Elisi's disappearance.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She then gives you a non-equippable, lore, no drop item called a Tarnished Erudin Medal that identifies as Item Lore: Tarnished Erudin Medal.  <br>
<br>
Now you need to go to South Qeynos to a building near the bank and find an Erudite male named Jalorin Tar’Visgur.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'Hail, Jalorin Tar`Visgur'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Yes? What do you want I am very busy with my studies. I have already paid my taxes this month so do not even tell me that Sneed sent you. That will not work anymore.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At this point I gave this turkey the medal from Brianna.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Ah erm. Yes of course. You have been sent by Erudin am I right?'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'I was sent by Erudin'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Well what is it you have been sent for? Go ahead I don't have all day I must get these [incantations] to the council and I am not finished with them yet.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'What incantations?'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'You certainly do not look like you could read the scrolls I have been working on so I am wondering why you are questioning what they are. I am waiting for some scrolls from my friend Elisi. The last time I saw her she gave me this [parchment] but I am waiting for her to complete it, would you be able to [return] it to Brianna for me? It is quite clear that she trusts you so I suppose I should as well.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'I will return the parchment to Elisi'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Very well here you are. If we are done here please excuse me for I have much work to do.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jalorin gives you a non-equippable, lore, no drop item called Scribbled Parchment that identifies as Item Lore: Scribbled Parchment. <br>
<br>
Now go back to the Erudin docks area and talk to Brianna again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'Hail, Brianna Falsruinay'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Hello Traveler, I am afraid I don't recognize you to be a local around these parts although I could have been buried in my work. I have been quite busy since [Elisi] turned up missing.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Apparently Brianna suffers from some kind of early-onset Alzheimers disease.  I handed here the parchment from Jalorin.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Jalorin gave this to you? This is quite odd because this is not Elisi's handwriting and there is clearly something wrong. I really do think for some reason that Jalorin is involved so if you are [still willing to help] I would like you to help me find out if he is being truthful. I must warn you though, if Jalorin is infact involved with her disappearance this could get dangerous.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'I am still willing to help'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Very well Lunal, please take this note to Jalorin. I would like him to provide us with some of Elisi's scrolls that she has brought him recently. If he can't provide you with the scrolls I have listed here then I believe he is withholding some information and we could alert the Qeynos council of Jalorins possible involvement.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She hands you a letter that is lore, no drop and identifies as Item Lore: Note From Brianna.<br>
<br>
Head back to Jalorin but before you do prepare for a good, ole fashioned wizard battle.  This guy will end up fighting you.  I loaded up Draught of Ice and Ice Comet because I heard he was resistant to fire. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'Hail, Jalorin Tar`Visgur'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Yes? What do you want I am very busy with my studies. I have already paid my taxes this month so do not even tell me that Sneed sent you. That will not work anymore.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do all of these Erudites suffer from Alzheimers or what????</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You make a rude gesture at Jalorin Tar`Visgur.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At this point I handed Jalorin the note from Brianna.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'Brianna must think I am stupid to trust a complete stranger with the most powerful spells I have ever collaborated on with Elisi. I will not give you the parchments that she asks for, but I will give you a fair warning to stay out of my business. If you do not leave me be and [forget about Elisi], I will grow quite angry.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'I will not forget about Elisi!'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur says 'You know, Elisi was a bit like you she didn't know when to quit. You and her will soon share the same [fate] I should think.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You say, 'What fate?'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Let the battle begin!!!!  This bloke is definitely a wizard, at least level 29, because he cast Thunder Strike and Bonds of Force.  He got the snare to stick on me, too.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur begins to cast a spell.<br>
You begin casting Draught of Ice.<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur was hit by non-melee for 721 points of damage.<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur is caught in a torrent of jagged ice.<br>
You resist the Thunder Strike spell!<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur looks uncomfortable.<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur begins to cast a spell.<br>
You begin casting Draught of Ice.<br>
Your feet slow down.<br>
Bonds of force bind your feet to the ground.<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur was hit by non-melee for 721 points of damage.<br>
Jalorin Tar`Visgur is caught in a torrent of jagged ice.<br>
You have slain Jalorin Tar`Visgur!<br>
<br>
---You have looted a Faded Map of the Sea.—<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The item you loot of the corpse is lore, no drop item called a Faded Map of the Sea.  It identifies as Item Lore: BROKUN SKUL ROK.<br>
<br>
Now head back to Brianna and hand her the Faded Map of the Sea.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Brianna Falsruinay says 'Oh yes something is extremely wrong, It is at least good news that you have disposed of Jalorin. I knew he had to be involved in this one way or another. This map appears to have some dull writing on it but I cannot make it out correctly. While you were gone, my husband reminded me that Elisi always wore her medallion given to her by her mother and her guards carried the finest blade ever presented to a Sentinel of Erudin. If you could find 3 of these guardian blades along with Elisi's medallion I believe that we could come to a conclusion on Elisi`s whereabouts. The sad news is that if you should recover these items there is no doubt in my mind that she is dead because she would never give up her medallion willingly. Oh and here is the map you took from Jalorin, I have no use for it.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I can only guess that the items drop in one of the pirate villages or another pirate enclave in Dulak maybe or Gunthak.  I have no idea, though, but will be on the lookout for these items.  Any help would be appreciated!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><font size=-1><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=113375" target="_blank">Lunal Toadsnatcher</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163741" target="_blank">Gnome Evoker of the Notorious Bear (58)</a><BR>Tholuxe Paells</font><BR><font size=-2>Leader of <i><a href="http://pub63.ezboard.com/btheelectoftholuxepaells" target="_blank">The Elect</a></i></font><BR><font size=-1>"<i>I now enjoy the fairy tales better than I did in childhood: being now able to put more in, of course, I get more out.</i>.

<br>
Neriak and Ak'Anon are examples. Though, since one item appears to drop in Nadox I would think the charm would be of a higher quality than Neriak's.<br>
<br>
My advice would be to check on items dropped in LoY from a site with items database that you can list by zone and then check for a suspicious medallion and no quest linked to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=703.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=703.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=703.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=703.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=703.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=703.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
