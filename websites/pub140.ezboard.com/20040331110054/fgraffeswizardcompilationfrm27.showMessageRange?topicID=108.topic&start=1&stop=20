Manaburn will continue to be usable in PvP, however no looting rights will be given to the victor. The loser's corpse will appear at their bind point with all their items intact.<br>
Basically, Manaburn will be a tool for removing players from a zone.<br>
<br>
2. Looting rules will be changed so that if your character  can't use an item (Race/Class), you can't loot it. Coin loot will remain unchanged.<br>
<br>
3. On top of the 66% spell damage reduction in PvP, will be level based spell damage reductions when attacking lower level players. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Target is your level: You % damage remains unchanged<br>
Target is -1 levels bellow you: You lose 5% damage<br>
Target is -2 levels bellow you: You lose 10% damage<br>
Target is -3 levels bellow you: You lose 20% damage<br>
Target is -4 levels bellow you: You lose 30% damage<br>
<br>
4. Resistance &quot;debuff&quot; spells (currently set at 150% functionality) will scale depending on difference in levels between your character and your target.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Target is +4 levels above you: You gain 40% to debuff effects<br>
Target is +3 levels above you: You gain 20% to debuff effects<br>
Target is +2 levels above you: You gain 10% to debuff effects<br>
Target is +1 levels above you: You gain 5% to debuff effects<br>
Target is your level: You gain 0% to debuff effects<br>
<br>
5. City Zones will be Non-PvP areas, excluding Greater Faydark, The Overthere, and Fironia Vie. Arenas in city zones will remain PvP areas.<br>
<br>
6. Victors in PvP will have a PvP faction hit with the loser, and /consider will reflect it. If a players faction with another player drops bellow dubious, they will not be able to group together. Duels are excluded from PvP faction hits, as are victories in arenas.<br>
These faction hits are strictly for PvP, and have no bearing on PvE factions. Players can forgive (reset another players PvP faction with themself) by using the /forgive command.<br>
<br>
7. Victors in PvP will have a PvP faction hit with the losers guild (if the loser belongs to a guild), and /consider will reflect it.<br>
If a players faction with a guild drops bellow dubious, they will not be able to group with any member of the losers guild, or join the guild unless invited by the Guild Leader. Duels are excluded from PvP faction hits, as are victories in arenas.<br>
These faction hits are strictly for PvP, and have no bearing on PvE factions. Guild leaders have the ability to pardon (reset a guild members PvP faction with their guild) by using the /pardon command.<br>
<br>
8. Joining a group renders you PvP immune to attacks from fellow group members unless you're dueling or in an arena.<br>
<br>
9. Joining a guild renders you PvP immune to attacks from fellow guild members unless you're dueling or in an arena.<br>
<br>
10. Joining a raid group renders you PvP immune to attacks from fellow raid members unless you're dueling or in an arena. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A> at: 1/28/03 3:12:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agozrz>agozrz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/24/03 11:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> I just skimmed it...<br>

Actually, I think at one point they didn't care. Now I think they're clueless as to what changes need to be made.<br>
<br>
Think about it; They've gotten rid of basically 70% of the original Verant that supposedly &quot;doesn't care&quot;, and replaced them with new people.<br>
In the last year, we've seen more things that the old Verant said was either impossible, or said will never happen.<br>
<br>
So, unless you work for SOE, lets assume that they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> actually give a damn about the PvP servers, just for the goof.<br>

<br>
Faction in the game is designed for PvE, not PvP. The only point of factioning up in cities is so you can attack players in cities and have the guards assist you, which in my opinion shouldn't happen.<br>
Anyway, faction would still allow you to hunt people in the noobie zones, and the guards there will still assist you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The point of PvP faction hits is so that you know who has attacked you or your guild (if you belong to one) by /consider.<br>
Each time a person attacks and kills you, they get a PvP faction hit with you, which would lower your &quot;opinion&quot; of them.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Joe the wizard kills Bob the warrior. Joe takes a faction hit with Bob, and from that point on, if Bob considers Joe, he will see that he's been attacked by him before (his consider message would go from being indifferent or &quot;neutral&quot; to apprehensive).<br>
If Joe kills Bob a few more times, Joes faction will drop so far down that he can no longer group with Bob (players can no longer group together after they hit threatening status).<br>
<br>
If Bob belongs to a guild, Joe will take PvP faction hits with Bob's guild as well. After Joes faction drops to threatening with Bob's guild, Joe will no longer be able to group with any member of Bob's guild.<br>
<br>
Now, in the event that Joe makes amends with Bob, Bob can forgive Joe, which resets his faction with Bob, allowing them to group. However, Joe would still not be able to group with Bob's guildmates unless the guild leader of Bob's guild pardons Joe.<br>
<br>
The reason I came up with this rule is to deal with random PKs. I know of many players that will randomly kill players, and then a few weeks later they want to group with them, or members their guild. So, in order to give players a little more control over these situations, the random PKs are penalized. This prevents them from getting away with randomly killing players, and then hanging out with a victims friends.<br>
<br>
As for those PvP immunities regarding groups, guilds and raids, what downsides do you see? <br>
I really can't see any problems besides the fun of smacking your friends around during downtimes, but that's not really a downside. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=velaelsoulrender>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>The Snuggly SZ'r!</span><br>  Posts: 1034<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/25/03 12:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10 suggested changes for Rallos Zek PvP rules</span><hr size=1> If you didn't have the spell damage nerf for PvP, PoP lures would be absolutely unreal (as opposed to just a bit overpowered now).

In response to the third post in this thread...<br>
<br>
Go to any, and I mean ANY messageboard from a PvP server (has to be a PvP guild, no ascending duds here) and ask them if they think that Verant gives a flying fuck about the PvP servers.  The only explanation that I can think of is that there are 4 PvP servers and, a helluva a lot more blue servers.  EQ wasn't mean to be a PvP anyway.  I don't know why for sure, but either way, Verant doesn't care.<br>
<br>
In response to the no PvP in cities part...<br>
<br>
The bazaar/nexus are spots for people to sit unharmed.  Its the place for gankers to go afk for a few hours and wait for manaburn to refresh so that they can port somewhere, burn, and instant nexus gate only to repeat the process.  Its the place where anyone is safe, and rallos stops becoming a PvP server.  It isn't a 95% pvp server, it should be all or nothing.  This is also the general consensus of at least the Rallos Zek community, pks and anti's alike.<br>

On top of the 66% spell damage reduction in PvP, will be level based spell damage reductions or bonuses. <br>
<br>
So it should be a penalty to be a higher level Wizard in PvP ?<br>
<br>
4. Resistance &quot;debuff&quot; spells (currently set at 150% functionality) will scale depending on difference in levels between your character and your target<br>

Think there are some level effects when it come's to saves already<br>
<br>
5. City Zones will be Non-PvP areas, excluding Greater Faydark, The Overthere, and Fironia Vie. Arenas in city zones will remain PvP areas.<br>

Yes, you're penalized for attcking lower level players. It's a called a handicap, and if you don't want to deal with it, attack someone the same level as you, or higher level than you.<br>
<br>

<br>
True, but I'm talking strictly about debuff spells. Currently they are 150% effecient in PvP. With the system I suggest, it depents on your level as to how useful they'll be. They're more useful on higher level players than lower level players.<br>

Dear clueless wonder. I like to work on tradeskills. I like to socialize. And guess what? I can't do that in cities when I've got some punk ass cating on me while I'm making batwing crunchies or putting stuff in the bank. Also, there's that whole faction game that PKs like to play, where they spend weeks getting to max ally with a city so if they attack you and you retort, the guards assist them. Lame, lame, lame.<br>
<br>
Cities aren't PvE zones, so why should they be considered PvP zones? Hrm?<br>

You know, I love when a person makes a dumb ass comment like this without providing any reason to their response. If you can't explain your posisition, don't reply.<br>

And obviously you didn't read closely enough. If you're going to group with someone, are you going to kill them after you group? No. If you join a guild, are you going to PK your guildmembers? No. If you're in a raid, are you going to PK a fellow raid member? No.<br>
You ever wonder about using AoEs in raids? You know, like rain spells, or Mass PBAE groups? I do all the time. I'm sick of having 3/4ths of my AEs be completely useless in PvE encounters because of some dumb PvP rules. I'f I'm grouped with a player, I shouldn't be able to hurt them. If I want to hurt them, I'll disband. Simple as pie.<br>

Honestly guys, if you can't be constructive, don't reply.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=znailvh>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/26/03 8:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Quote by Jarnin:<br>

Yes, but how do you prevent someone lower level then you from attacking you then, as they will have an advantage over you?<br>
<br>
Even if the modifications was changed to be a bit more balanced then the suggested ones so is it impossible to make all fights fair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stanex>Stanex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/26/03 2:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> a) Most of the rules are retarded.<br>

<br>
You can't. Like I said, it's called a handicap, which means lower level players attacking you have an advantage over higher players attacking you.<br>
See, we all know that someone 4 levels higher than you attacking you now has basically all the advantage in the world, and someone 4 levels lower than you has no advantage at all. So tossed in a handicap system to even it out a bit.<br>
<br>

Without a clear reason why you think the rules are retarded, your post is pointless.<br>

Look, if you don't support any change to RZ, that's fine. I'm just trying out some ideas which <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the general playerbase</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would benefit from. I didn't make up these rules thinking of the people that PvP 24/7 on RZ. They're the minority, therefore I didn't cater to them.<br>
If you like PvP but aren't a hardcore PK, these rules would help you more than hurt you, unless you like expoiting the current rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agozrz>agozrz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/26/03 7:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> They're not going to get changed.

That isn't an explaination. It's nice try though.<br>
<br>
Yet another person saying VI doesn't care about PvP. You guys sound like broken records. Everytime someone says they don't care, it just proves that you know dick about VI.<br>
<br>
If they don't care about PvP servers, why keep them around? Why not make them into blue servers, where they can actually increase the players on them, and draw more money? Explain that one if you would.<br>

Your suggestions just changes it so someone 4 levels lower has the advantage.<br>

Actually, no they don't. They're still going to have to deal with resistances. They're still going to have to deal with getting hit by higher level spells, and deal with better weapons. So in essence, it puts everybody in the same boat.<br>

The person that used to handle PvP was Lady Daegarmo. He left SOE in April of 2002, and since then there hasn't been any BotB tournaments or Test of Tactics events.<br>
<br>
So you might be right. SOE might not have anyone that deals with the PvP aspects of the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=108.topic&start=21&stop=37>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.threadControl?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PvP Discussion & Tactics</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
