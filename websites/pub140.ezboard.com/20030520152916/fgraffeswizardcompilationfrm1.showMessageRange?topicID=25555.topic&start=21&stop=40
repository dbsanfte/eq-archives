<br>
Pro's graphics are pretty good not great but good. <br>
<br>
World is lots more dynamic than EQ cities and towns can change new buildings and towers and such. My pal liked this the most about the game as he feels EQ is much too static an enviroment. We spent 20 min digging him about building a grand wizard tower so that we could lay siege to it and distroy it for him :-)<br>
<br>
Con's experience was not shared equally among group members during beta...made it almost impossible for non combat classes to level up in a group setting. Shivers thinking about a world full of tanks and casters and no one wanting to play healers. Makes me wonder where solo classes will fall out in this mix. <br>
<br>
Agro system and combat engine is fubar which was his biggest complaint. He could not put into words how uncomfortable feeling this portion of the game was as compared to DAOC and EQ. He mentioned that if anything kills the game it will be this area. I will try to get some more details from him regarding this topic the next time he pokes his head into EQ. Those who are playing it please add your thoughts regarding this portion of the game mechanics. :-) <br>
<br>
He feels the economey is going to way out of wack...as yard trash for newbies was dropping insanely wild amounts of gold pieces. Kind of diablo like where you end up with hundreds of thousands of gold pieces and pay wacko amounts for items and gear. <br>
<br>
All this was second hand information and was all related to beta testing, so loads could have been fixed and or changed in the last 3 weeks since i talked to my friend last on EQ. <br>
<br>
Please post some thoughts as I am looking at trying out this game but I would like to know more before I drop the cash on this one. <br>

no idea what you saying here, i grouped with healers and stuff. We all get about equal the exp, so it's probably fixed? Speaking of groups, I get 950 exp per kill with a group and we mow the red mobs down. I get 60 exp per kill solo and needs to rest after a couple. So yeah find groups whenever ya can:P<br>

Hmm the combat seems pretty good, weapon and skin actually make contact and blood spills out. It's a pretty standard system of hitting for xxx damage etc. Not sure about aggro, it's funny though sometime watching casters opening up with a blast then the mob ran pass the entire group and wack the caster dead in 2 hits.<br>

I agree, as a level 5 newbie all I did was go run around in level 30-40 player zones and loot some of the junk, made about 100k in less than 1 hr, suffice to say money will never be a problem for me. Also anyone can loot all corpses, so just wait in those high level zones and when a group wipes go graverobe it and that's like 100k gold right there too. Money will soon lose its meaning in the game. <br>

They fixed some major lag and stability issues in the last month of beta. A lot of the complaints about unstablility/lag made by the beta tests are not true anymore.<br>
<br>
Leveling is also way too easy, guess it's just a byproduct so you can get to the pvp part. I got the game this afternoon and am level 19 now<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Serverside is just fine, especially now with connections getting more stable every year. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is true.  To have the most 'honest' online game, you can have almost nothing clientside, because there's no way to trust the client.  There's an online gaming maxim: &quot;The client is in the hands of the enemy&quot;.  Adversarial, but true.<br>
<br>
Even if the server waits for an ACK on a mob hit, that is too much information clientside.  People will install stream filters to block ACK packets on hits and be effectively invulnerable.<br>
<br>
Early on, much of EQ's actions took place client side, through beta and even into release, more and more of these functions were moved serverside in order to counteract cheating.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that there are always people who don't want to play fair, because the distributed processing power in a game's clients basically goes to waste for want of player honesty.  This also means that many things will always be impacted by network latency and packet loss.<br>

What other gameplay related functions were the client fully responsible for in the past?  Offhand I know of skill triggers (server used to sometimes trust the client if it requested you use a skill you didn't even have), zone initiation, character movement (ENTIRELY client side, if you want to get across a dangerous area just pull the plug, run across, and plug back in heh).<br>
<br>
The dumber the client, the less chance for cheating - but of course the more work the servers have to do.  AC2 (and possibly others?) validates movement server-side, so you occasionally see a situation where the client thinks you can keep moving but the server vetos it and warps you backwards (one of the most annoying glitches in that game).<br>
<br>
I dunno about the whole &quot;monster lags out too&quot; thing in SB though.  That seems *incredibly* hard to implement in a way that wouldn't be exploited, perhaps Gaga can let us know about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1151<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/29/03 12:16:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25555.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shadowbane - keeper</span><hr size=1> I still remember when they moved fizzles from client side to server side.

<br>
Played a Mage Level - 10 became warlock sounded cool.. but it appears warlock is the &quot;enchanter&quot; of SB.  Killed that one off<br>
<br>
Made Healer - 12 became a priest.  Pretty cool class and fun.  No res accept / cancel button though.  So could walk around to graves casting res and summoning people without their consent (could been 4 hour old grave..... long looted and forgotten, grave still stays when empty....)  <br>
<br>
There was one GM event on Sunday, it involved a Horde of Undead attacking a small village outside of Knightsbridge.  We destoryed those undead and fought them back to the &quot;portal&quot; and on the other side of the portal and killed the boss that sent the undeads..  The event was very well run and wasn't a big gank the GM event that eq GM events turns into.  There were about 30 pcs and about 300 Undead level range 5-15.  EVERYONE who took and active roll in the event were given their next level free.  (I dinged 11 while fighting some of the undead and at the end the GM made me and everyone in my group 1 level higher.  I also died 2 times healing the GM from agro and I got a res each time from GM..<br>
<br>
The big down side and account cancler for me was.<br>
1. LAG - Holy bat turds batman!  5 Minutes to move 10 feet in Knightsbridge (big city) and sometimes out in the middle of no where....  I have GForce 3, 512 meg ram, 1.33 GHtz  should have been no problem....<br>
2. Death System. -  Good god what a P.I.T.A. <br>
Well when you die, ANYONE, Grandma, satan, you fing thieving group mates, some level 2 newbie dork, can all loot your grave.  They can take all gold and items in your inventory.  The items you have equipted have a random chance of falling into your inventory when you die to be able to be looted.  I don't like it, but its a PvP game and you have to have some consequences for dieing, I was willing to accept that, just bank often and never carry anything of value...  BUT You start out on &quot;Newbie Island&quot; where you can not PvP until level 20+ so there is no recourse for getting back at people that loot your grave.  You can kill anyone, best you can do is make a list and use it if they ever get 20+... BUT that is if you can find out who looted it....  You do not get any messages, your grave doesn't record who looted your corpse, so you have no idea if it was a random dork, or you group mates.  Upsetting as a newbie to collect 5k worth of gold, die, RUN FOR 15 minutes getting back to your grave and your gold and items are gone.. <br>
<br>
3. World is EMPTY.  You can litterally run for 15 - 20 minutes without ever seeing a mob.  All mobs are clustered together into little camps...<br>
<br>
4. Binding 1-9 bind only in out skirts of the major cities.  At 10-19 can bind out skirts or in the major cities.  At 20 or 21 you get booted of the Newbie island and have to pledge to a Player run guild/city or there is 1 game runned PvP city but you can only be bound there from 20-35 after 35 you have to be in a player run city. (these are all in the PvP area, after 20 its PvP all the time wether you want to or not.<br>
<br>
5. Friend played a Paladin to 21, logged for the day and when logged on the next day he got booted from newbie island to the PvP area's and had to find a player city and pledge there and then 10 minutes later was killed by a player in the game guild.....  <br>
<br>
<br>
hope that helps some. <p><BR>

I assume you mean graphic lag. I have an amd xp system with geforce3 and 600+ ddr. Played on 1028x700ish resolution, shadows off, graphics at 16 bit,  textures medium. This setting still gives me very good graphic and zero lag even in crowded cities. Just fiddle around with the settings until you find one that's good for you, display setting in sb is very detailed with tons options. I havent experienced too much connection lag, there are some rubberbanding once every few hrs but nothing major. <br>

Psst, you not in disneyland anymore. Death must have consequences and graverobbing is a profession to many thieves. Items you wear do not drop into your inv when you die. You only lose stuff in your inv. A bunch professions get summon (which is like coh) at level 20ish so they can just coh you right back after you die. Keep a scroll of recall with you and bank once a while. When you get out of the level 10 range, group members rarely graverob your corpse. Reputation is everything in this game, last thing anyone wants is to get banned from a player city after 35. Have a scout in your group to avoid getting graverobbed by sneak professions. Plus you can never die in SB except from pvp. Kiting mobs is a joke, they never outrun you even without using sprint, and stops following you after like 15 sec.....<br>

The game is designed around city building, the vast empty lands are for player built cities later on. It is also more realistic to have pockets of mobs instead of a rat every 2 feet.

Then your friend must not be too bright. If he somehow got booted to a ruin, all he needs to do is talk to the runemaster and be ported to one of the 3 major cities. It is not until level 36 that the game kicks you out of nonplayer cities.<br>

Hope that cleared something up.<br>

<br>
Installation:  Flawless.  Registration...flawless.  *boggle*<br>
I found 1 crash bug which had to do with a specific option in a specific menu.  Other than that...zero crashes.  My second system was running EQ and I crashed 5 times over the course of the night.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My only gripes thus far are:<br>
1)  Limited skill trees.  Unlike EQ where you have 200 different spells and some 60 AAs + regular skills, SB only has a fraction of that.<br>
2)  No first person.  I love first person for immersion.  <br>
3)  UI difficulties.  There's quite a few &quot;annoying&quot; things in the UI.  Nothing game breaking but little stuff all over.  They'll get these hammered out, though.<br>
4)  Too easy to level.  Game's been out a week and people are already 50+.<br>
<br>
They just fixed a client-side leak (last night?) and it's been running good so far.  It is graphics intensive though...I had to drop textures/lighting etc to get it to run well.  I'll trade the little bit of eye-candy for the extra playability though.<br>
<br>
Looting is a pain in the ASS.  Graverobbers suck.  Reminds me of the old MUD days.  <br>
<br>
HINT: Make a mule char (or two) and just stock back some extra gear.  Make some friends and group with them and your looting problems are virtually solved.  As someone above pointed out, money is really not a problem.  As a level 13 in an<br>
xp group I pulled about 10k no problem.  Cash flows like Diablo2 (good analogy.)  We'll have to see how the player-made item economy adjusts.  It's all scale, though.  You're not working any harder/easier, it just shifts the scale.<br>
<br>
XP groups:  While there's a hard-cap per-person on how much xp you can get from a kill, there is ZERO splitting of xp.  Everyone receives full amount even if you're sitting for the whole battle.  Mana regen's pretty nice, but you actually use STA in SB.  Kinda sucks for casters.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

but if you set your level to 50 you can see all of the skills.<br>
<br>
I maintain that even with /disc runes, base class and specialization that there's less the EQ.<br>

But they do have flight and good archery/LOS rules, so I'll play with it.  <br>

<br>
The skill system is actually pretty huge and it's not like eq where you get certain skills, max them then you're done(just like everyone else who plays your class). What you don't see on paper is the fact that each skill is actually a fairly powerful entity and you cannot just simply train all of the skills your class/combo gets with the finite amount of points you get to spend. So in that regard the skill system is much more complex than EQ because the skills and stats mean much more and have a more drastic effect on your character. I would further add that each class can actually branch off into several very different skill patterns.<br>
<br>
So far everyone seems to think the skill system is actually very well balanced that I run into and there is *not* a proliferation of &quot;power classes&quot; running around. If it is in fact balanced and flushed out (as it is appearing to be)then I can totally see why this game took so long to be released. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaziqueal>Kaziqueal</A> at: 4/3/03 3:54:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12290<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 2:08:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25555.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shadowbane - keeper</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What you don't see on paper is the fact that each skill is actually a fairly powerful entity and you cannot just simply train all of the skills your class/combo gets with the finite amount of points you get to spend. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Sort of like Diablo II or 3E. Which isn't to bag on the idea -- I think it's a GOOD idea to rip off. EQ has a few tentative steps in this direction (specialization and trade skills) but they're either so clearly slanted towards a single right choice (or two equally good choices in the case of two classes) or they're irrelevant.<br>
<br>
I'd love it if, say, when spending AA points, you could EITHER be great with crits OR have lowered aggro OR use less mana on your spells. We'd see some genuinely different high level wizards, instead of everyone ending up at more or less the same place in the end. And that's a pretty minor way to differentiate; I can imagine fire-focused, ice-focused or lightning-focused wizards, for instance. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz_toon.gif" height="104" width="390" alt="stats" border=0></a>

<br>
But its very complex and still has a few things to hammer out such as instead of epics for classes you have new classes.<br>
<br>
In my set up a shadow knight would have an epic quest and instead of getting an item the quest would completely chage the character into a death knight (would also change the look of the character).  Which would also effect factions and abilities.  There would be down sides to being a death knight such as being undead and being KOS to a bunch of citys and people regardless of your previous faction.  Also as a Death night you wouldn't be able to be healed by players sence your undead.  On the plus side as a death night all your attacks would have an automatic built in life tap that gave you life and you'd be immune to fear affects and spells and you'd have see invis becase your undead and automatic enduring breath.  Also your harm touch would be changed to a death touch that can only be used on certain level things and of course some mobs would be flagged as immune to death touch.<br>
<br>
But I have a bunch of interesting things lying around that would be for every class.  So basicaly people would actualy decide rather they would want to do their eppic or not.  Do they realy want to be an undead death knight or stay a shadow knight?  Each would have its ups and downs but the ups for the epic class change would still out way the downs to make it a worth while quest.<br>
<br>
Anouther thing I'd add is the ability for all casters to buy or make special parchment and ink so they could actualy scribe spells they know and give the scrolls of spells they make to other players to learn and even cast spells from the scrolls at a reduced mana cost.  Say jo wizard has garisons superior sundering with the right ink and parchemnt they can make copies of it themselves and trade it to other wizards or even cast the spell using the scroll at a greatly reduced mana cost.  So that people arn't getting spells to easy you'd have a geneirc parchemtn and ink that is vendor bought and relatively cheep for making No Drop parchemnts and spells for your own use so you can cast spells from scrolls easy.  Or you can have ink and parchment from mob droped items that is harder to get and make to scribe tradable spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 6:15:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25555.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shadowbane - keeper</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I can imagine fire-focused, ice-focused or lightning-focused wizards, for instance.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Especially if it works like D2 where each element has different characteristics and affects mobs in different ways.  Not just that but there was even room to specialize within each elemental tree.  Of course they'd have to add Raiden-like electricity arcing around lighting wizards' hands, frost flowing off ice wizards and fiery footprints left by fire wizards.  Now that would be cool.<br>
<br>
Of course one the most rapturous moments ever was after headbutting the brick wall o' EQ wizardry for months and then seeing Warmth at level one.  Too bad Blizzard hasn't touched the game since LoD but at least they don't rebalance it every week. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ulot>Ulot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 10:22:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25555.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shadowbane - keeper</span><hr size=1> Reason why I haven't bought Shadowbane yet is PvP.  Not that I don't like PvP, but that is really the bulk of the &quot;end&quot; game and very few people of seen it.  They beta tested 200 people battles, but the PvP enviroment never really settled in.  The reason why I have worries is because so much of the enviroment is affected by PvP.  When massive alliances of guilds start to form, (and they will because numbers always win in these games) I don't expect my hard earned house to stay around long.  Even if you do join an alliance yourself you still stand a good chance of losing everything in one fail swoop.<br>
<br>
The idea of running around with a huge group and stomping a person or two at a time doesn't really appeal to me.  Just as being stomped on because I wasn't in a huge group at the time.<br>
<br>
When the PvP becomes settled and people can do something besides bend over to the huge alliances while they are on, then I'll consider it more.  Until then I'm not going to lose hours of game play because someone can stay on all day long and wait till I'm gone to destroy everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaziqueal>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 10:52:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25555.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shadowbane - keeper</span><hr size=1> That's not how it works.
