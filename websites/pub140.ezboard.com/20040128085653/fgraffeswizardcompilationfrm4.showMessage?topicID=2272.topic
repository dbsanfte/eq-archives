I was actually happy that I left the game. It was so losing its appeal and I had nothing absolutely nothing to do on my new server that I recently enrolled on. I was a naked wizard and the guild i was applying to collapsed. Most other guilds guilds had requirments that made it very very time devouring for me to become a full member. For example make a good friend to sponsor me. I will have to equip myself, and no loot till I become a full member. Now after having to go through previous application process I wouldnt dare app to a new guild. So I left..<br>
<br>
Soon fucking Verant decided to add incredibly hot ( good ) new game improvments, such as new flag drops, new charms, new &quot; spell auto scribing of pure al'kabor pwness of Wizard Arcane History &quot;. I mean come on why the hell does everything have to go good after I left? Veksar's now open live. Charms for more planar progress which I heard was an excellent charm. What other new things are these people going to add to the game to only  draw more users? I'm slowly getting drawn back to the game. Not sure for those who have quit to. But these new features are great.<br>

This reminds me of all the people that post about &quot;I'M GONE! I'M TAKING MY LIFE BACK EQ!&quot;.  I mean, probably half these people are just going to play a different video game or watch a movie or tv for hours on end, or read a fiction book, or go out to a bar and get drunk or play D&amp;D or some CCG or something.

I left EQ about a year ago and my life has been much better off.  Right after the bailout I would play Ghost Recon a couple hours a day, but eventually games had less and less appeal and now I haven't played anything in days.<br>
<br>
What do I do with my spare time?  I finally setup a functional and useful Linux box (I had only toyed with Linux in the past).  I got a kickass new job.  I'm on track to get my CISSP certification.  Oh, and I'm finally reading books and learning again (an aspect of my life that EQ STOPPED COLD FOR YEARS).<br>
<br>
Have I ever missed EQ?  Maybe once or twice.  Then I remember my job and education and I don't regret it at all.<br>

And I must say, the high did wear off after 4 years of full blown hard core gaming. Now on the other hand I have time to do alot of stuff i've been meaning to do but never did, like ask this girl i like out and the relationship is actually going well, also going to the gym, keeping my grades up and getting into university. Sometimes you do look back at EQ and how good it used to be, but then I can look at my life now and how great it is and how little i miss eq. Only on those days when i have no social outing to go to, or no work or school, do i really even think about eq. Good trade off imo.<br>

I'm picking up a lot of my old hobbies too, like reading books, writing music, writing computer programs, listening to music, singing, and working out.  (Although I did work out some while playing EQ).  I'm making real lunches and dinners and going out to eat occaisionally, as opposed to having american cheese sandwiches and cereal.  I'm doing my laundry.  My desk is not a pigsty anymore.<br>
<br>
The next step is quitting these boards, though.  I waste as much time here as I did in EQ.  Although here I sometimes get a bit more of a sense of satisfaction and self-improvement than with EQ.  In the end, EQ just took too much time, committment, and energy to have any fun-- even with their new improvements or maybe even because of them.  If I was going to do something as boring as grinding XP, I may as well get paid for it.<br>
<br>
In some ways I really do regret ever picking up EQ in the first place.  I've definitely met some cool people and maintained some college relationships that would have otherwise fallen apart, but I started playing EQ to take my mind off of a girl that I was depressed about.  That was a really bad idea.  The relationship had been terribly one-sided had caused my grades to suffer, and EQ only made matters worse.  While due to monetary concerns I may not have been able to go to grad school anyway, and trying to finish two drastically different majors might not have been the brightest idea, I have almost no doubt that the results of my Music Theory GRE are because I played EQ while doing practice the tests.   Had I taken the test the year earlier, pre-EQ, I'm pretty sure I would have owned it.<br>
<br>
But really I try not to dwell on it.  Some people can handle EQ a lot better than I could, and I don't like to feel as if I'm judging someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valtser>Valtser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice... forever!</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/03 9:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I quit EQ and it only gets better!!!</span><hr size=1> Whoa!

You're 24 now. If I were your age I'd have begun playing EQ at 20. If I had done that, I likely would not have met my husband and the entire course of the last sixteen years of my life would be uncharted territory.<br>

Unfortunately EQ is not the type of game that can be played in moderate doses. This is what I feel is a major flaw with the game. Every time I logged on to play for just a &quot;few&quot; hours it turned into 4 or 6 hours.

I am 24 aswell, working 10hours dayly. Got 3 frigging position in my office: Translator (I am japanese, lived in spain for 20years and I went to English schools most of the school years), IT Technitian, and also accounting is part of my job. Its almost a year since I started this job and my time to play EQ is getting shorter and shorter.<br>
<br>
EQ imho, to enjoy the game you need time and commitment. At the stage where you get to the high 60s, gaining experience and gear is very hard to do by yourself. Since my time is quite limited, finding group is also a pain too. Tradeskills and such also requires time as well as patience. After near 2 month of break, I have logged in 3 days ago and I did participated the raid with my guild (surprisingly they were raiding at 3am in their time which is very rare occation), well I have not enjoyed much. All looked the same. (ok not many enjoys VT raids)<br>
<br>
I understand that I should go out more to see the world but the job I am in and the positions I take gets alot of stress and most of the free time I feel like I would like to be left alone, doing my stuff. Currently I am practicing my drawing. I still suck big time since its been uh more than 2 years that I have not drawed a thing. <br>
<br>
EQ consumed too much of my time now that I think. The person who introduced me to EQ is long retired (he was a ranger), many friends that I had also retired and my guild being on asian time doesn't help me much. I have seen many guildies changing in their attitudes and characteristics since we have started raiding in SSra and VT. More people turned greedy, bitchy and whinning all the time. The new expantion is out this fall I heard, however the concept sounds good its a bit too late for me.<br>
<br>
I have yet to find and discover what I really want to do. <br>

I am 30, single(but have had the same GF for a year), work full time, make good money, have a nice new 2003 Sunfire, great dog, and what I consider a nice life.  I played EQ for almost 3 years and quit 2 months ago.  I miss it sometimes, but have lots to do in the meantime.  Balance is the key.  <br>
<br>
I remember my first day I didnt have EQ I got off work and was like...uhhhh now what.  Typically I used to get off work, hit the gym and login, or on days where I didnt go to the gym just login.  Since then I bought a new HDTV, new Sony surround sound Receiver/stereo and play PS2 and other computer games until SWG comes out.  <br>
<br>
Made me realize EQ is no worse then watching TV or playing game consoles.  Most people who play EQ and quit to &quot;get their life back&quot; dont all of a sudden become carpenters or start a fortune 500 company, they just switch their EQ hobby to something similar.  <br>
<br>
The thought of starting a new character, getting to level 65, working on abil points, getting all my keys again, etc keeps me away.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=murel>Murel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1546<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 11:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I quit EQ and it only gets better!!!</span><hr size=1> For me, one of the biggest things that happened when I quit EQ was the change in what I thought about. When I was playing EQ, I'd think about things like mobs, my guild, characters etc. Without EQ, my mind tends toward things that are much more satisfying, like philosophy, writing, religion, and so on. <br>
<br>
Generally, thinking about life is more interesting than thinking about EQ. It also helps that I quit because I was sick of the game and not because I forced myself to.<br>
<br>
From time to time I think about getting back into it, especially on the new Stromm server. But then I think about how it took me 10+ days /played to get my wiz from 1-53, and he started fairly twinked from an earlier character, and I wonder where in the hell I'm going to find 240 hours to blow on a game, even assuming I was twinked and picked a class that levels insanely fast like a wiz. Screw that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=murel>Murel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1547<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 11:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I quit EQ and it only gets better!!!</span><hr size=1> And yes, I know 10 days /played is NOTHING compared to the average 65 character.<br>

Those can effect us which still play the game, and that isnt fair, because you dont play anymore, therefore dont know much about today's EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=490410">Dalren Fieryblade of Tarew Marr</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
