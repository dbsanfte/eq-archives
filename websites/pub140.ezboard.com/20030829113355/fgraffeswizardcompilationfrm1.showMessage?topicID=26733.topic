<br>
A) Progression in the game takes place largely through gear at the higher end of the level range.<br>
<br>
B) Progression in gear is accomplished in medium to large groups.<br>
<br>
C) People like to feel like they have some value.<br>
<br>
D) There are basicly a handful of specialized roles, damage and healing in a raid.<br>
<br>
E) Skills that don't require skill, or at least give immediate feeback to the user making them feel like they've done something important don't make people feel useful (think summoning mod rods)<br>
<br>
So here we sit while they prepare to rebalance pure melee to keep up with the current bean counting going on and despite the fact that I'd love some more damage I wonder if something more creative than incrementing our damage could be done.<br>
<br>
As far as the rogue class I think there is a lot of room for improvement without touching overall damage at all.  Some ideas...<br>
<br>
1) Group Stealth.  This would enable rogues to extend the same protection they enjoy to nearby groupmates, leading them quietly through dangerous zones.  This could be added via AA and require shroud of stealth as a prerequisite.<br>
<br>
2) Spell interuption. 61+ backstabs would gain the ability to interupt in a manner similar to a bash.  Gained with chaotic stab.<br>
<br>
3) Burst Damage.  The rogue would be able to do one minute of backstab damage in one stab at the cost of greying out backstab for 2 minutes sacrificing overall damage for immediate damage.  Not usable on certain mobs like kunark dragons. Passive gain at 65.<br>
<br>
4) 2h 1 handed weapons.  Specificly 1h pierces with a neg 100% duel wield mod.  Allowing the rogue to give up all offhand damage for increased backstab damage.   Swapping weapons should start bs recycle time over though to prevent exploitive use of this.<br>
<br>
5) Implimentation of locked doors as previously described (fat chance I know)  Specificly apropriately named apropriately placed invisible npcs representing doors( like a stout wooden door).  Killing or despawning them with the pick locks skill unlocks the door until respawn.  However while picking can be done in a stealthy manner blowing or knocking it in can bring down agro from nearby social mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aerimusshadowborn>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 304<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 1:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wizards</span><hr size=1> Also in what manner do you think wizards could be improved without simply incrimenting damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xoshia>Xoshia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 1:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards</span><hr size=1> 60+ Pillars would be a start imo.<br>

<br>
Raids: <br>
Rogues SoS and drag bodies - wizards do damage. Wizards are easily the kings of raid damage these days. Rogues are severeky hampered by short range ae and ae rampage. <br>
<br>
Solo:<br>
Rogues cannot solo whatsoever - wizards are one of the better solo classes.<br>
<br>
Groups:<br>
I would call it even. Both deal good damage - neither has much utility.<br>

<br>
Winds of Gellid + Iceflame of E'Ci<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think you are at least partially right.  More abilities need to be added that don't unbalance the game, but make it more fun to play those classes.  I think Charms had the possibility to add that, but fell far short by being worthless for anyone capable of farming them.<br>
<br>
I would like to see some no drop, non level restricted items attainable with cool uses.<br>
<br>
Like a Warrior usable item that procs a Mez (extremely short duration, and easy to resist).  My ideal vidion of a warrior is someone who runs into a fight scrutinizes the enemy, and then digs through his bags looking for the weapon specifically suited for that creature/encounter.<br>
<br>
However, one of the basic problems is there are just too many classes.  They are running out of places to expand to unless they do something drastic.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 2:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards</span><hr size=1>  Lower the agro attached on some of our spells, would help more than adding anything new, in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bayler>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 2:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Diversity VS Beancounting , thoughts on class balance</span><hr size=1> Has anyone else noticed that Graffe's and the Safehouse seem to be merging?

Group Shroud of Stealth would be way too powerful - it would bypass huge amounts of content.  Surgical strikes anywhere in Norrath.  Imagine racing through the BoT towers without fighting a single mob, the instant a named pops up on track?  The group with the bard and rogue always wins.  The same can be said of any kind of &quot;crawl&quot; race mob.  It's only because rogues are nearly useless combatants when alone that Verant felt it was safe to give us the ability in the first place.  A rogue alone is just a scout; a rogue + mage is a beachhead. <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

The designers of this game have fallen into a never ending flawed loop.  &quot;Power begets Power&quot;.   <br>
<br>
What does that mean?  It means that as far as progression of NPC upgrades and PC upgrades has been basically more HPs and or more damage.  Very few mobs have truly unique sets of abilities that force you to adjust and think on your feet.  <br>
<br>
The poster made some rough suggestions.  Although group SoS would be VERY powerful and most likely overpowering, he starts the thinking toward creativity.  I'm afraid though that creative suggestions do little if the main way to kill mobs is the tried and true MT--CH chain--with damage dealers laying the rubber heavy to road.<br>
<br>
I've said it before long ago and I'll say it again, the game has evolved into a poorly DM'ed D&amp;D game.  Where the DM just kept upping the &quot;power&quot; of the players and thus had to keep ramping of the power of the creatures until...................you guessed it he's killing the gods themselves (no choice in that because he overpowers everything else).  <br>
<br>
That's poor design IMO.  There are so many things that designers could do to keep the game fun, the players progressing (and therefore excited about going forward), the encounters challenging, and past loot valuable.<br>
<br>
Carrot and stick approach is proven to work, but the implementation of such is where my frustration lies.  SOE's solution to everything is the just give better Ratio weapons, more hp's on items....  How about being more creative like giving items that have things like immunity to fire, Brilliance (actually raises your effective level by 10 thereby decreasing your resist rates and fizzle rates--and doesn't cap out like it does now), AA skill Wall of Force (creates a magical barrier in a 20 ft raidius around the caster that makes the people within the barrier completely immune to all effects for 2 rounds--stuns the caster for 10 sec and drains 1000 mana)...<br>
<br>
Give me anything that doesn't require the designers to to give melee 20 damage 15 delay weapons and casters 4k nukes.  Alas the game is too far gone IMO.  It's only about power and no subtlety. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fqubedf3povar>FqubedF3povar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 10:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: abilities</span><hr size=1> Heh just take D&amp;D rules book and look at the spells, or go play D&amp;D with someone who has some DMing experiance and you will get plenty of options. <br>
<br>
An option i thought for rogues was an AA that would be usable once per 134 mins (mb timer) and alow them to scor a BS with their next atack whatever the weapon being used, but thats dmg hehe, it would have the drawback of taking the rogues hp ac and to half their max (potentially killing the rogue) and reducing the atk by 90%. giving it a regen of those things so in 5 mins they are back to std lvls.<br>
<br>
But yes there needs to be more innovative spells to help out ie what Gflux and Invert Grav were but for all classes and all ppl. <br>
<br>
Bane weapons have a grate potential but they are mostly wasted already as they are. its jsut a special trick you now get.<br>

Blasts, DOTs and such are very similar between classes.

The classic wizard example being manaburn. In a roleplaying sense, I do not see a problem with 13 high level wizards being able to kill sona, let alone a blue mob like gore. It seems obvious to me that this should be possible in a roleplaying sense. But the reality is that if 13 wizards can kill sona, they will do it over and over and over again and farm the mob for loot. This is the same problem with any ability that SoE might give any class that can be considered &quot;overpowered&quot; in a situation. It will be used to farm loot, experience, or bypass content. The design of EQ is flawed in this way. So much so that I suspect it is unfixable.<br>
<br>
I was actually shocked that SoE was willing to bring charms up to the level of power that they have, because it seems to me the trend has been to disable and reduce the usefullness of special abilities to force every encounter to be the standard healer/tank/dps setup.<br>
<br>
The benefit of SOE's slowness and reluctance to rapidly change things in this game has preserved the value of character advancement to a certain degree. That is one area where I think SOE has been reasonably successful. Sure, people have found exploits and gained massive advantage from them, but the game is not dominated with people using exploits to level. Most level fairly.<br>
<br>
Lastly, there is a considerable popluation of very active players with good relationships with the SOE community who are, due to their efforts, ahead of the curve. Large changes in abilities and encounters would threaten that lead, they are naturally inclined to protect the status quo.<br>
<br>
I'd like to roleplay a wizard that was more &quot;wizardly&quot;, but I have begrudgingly come to the opinion that I am going to have to wait for another game EQ2, WOW, [insert hyped game here] to get my wish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maevenniia>Maevenniia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/03 11:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: abilities</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Familiar’s Eye</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>

When cast on the familiar, the wizard;s sight is bound to the familiar and he can control the familiar’s movement for a duration of 3? minutes. The Familiar cannot swim at all, but *can* fly.<br>
When cast, this uses a buff slot in addition to the familiar buff slot, but just like the Eye spells it will fade when the 3 mins expire.<br>
<br>
(essentially your familiar acts like an Eye spell, you can use him for scouting, and he can *fly* ie:  move up and down the z axis, without having to climb a high structure first)<br>

Wizard01 says: “Flappy, time to get lost”<br>

AA Ability – Familiar’s Aura<br>
<br>
Imparts Flappy’s Mana regen, resists, etc to your group members when the Ability is used WHILE grouped with them (ie:  you have to toggle this one &amp; THEN cast the familiar spell/AA while in group to extend the benefits to that group.  All group members get a flappy buff icon in their buff slot.)<br>

AA Ability – Second Sight<br>

When cast, the map for that zone will be completely revealed.<br>

<br>
IMO, pre-SOL, AE groups were quite balanced, it was hard to get a pull of 20 mobs, and it was hard to kill it safeuly. Then PoP came out, pulling mass mobs got easy, and easier to kill, and I can see why they axed it like they did.<br>
<br>
What would I suggest? Find a number, lets say 20 for now. Make it so no single player can aggro more then 20 mobs at once, and limit all lvl 60+ AE spells/abilities to 20 targets, then add a line of PBAE stuns to encs so they can roll stunns at 60+ on targets for AE grouping.<br>
<br>
Tweak the number 20 to something that would allow a solid AE group get EXP at a rate (reasonablly faster) then your 'normal' groups but still within the reason of risk. <br>
<br>
tweak a few uber-encounters in the game to make use of this change, make AEing a part of more raids.<br>
<br>
I was happy as a pig in shit on TT when the way we dealt with all the adds was to bust out the AE spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26733.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26733.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26733.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26733.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26733.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26733.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26733.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
