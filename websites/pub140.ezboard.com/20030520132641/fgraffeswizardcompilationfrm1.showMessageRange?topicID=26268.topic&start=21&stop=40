I'm killing Terris Thule.  If you try to zerg Terris Thule, you are dead. And she's easy as shit.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about Grummus, Agnar, Saryrn, Bertoxxulous. <br>
<br>
I think before you say that there are no tactics involved in killing anything, you should actually attempt to kill something difficult.<br>
<br>
Specifically on to your point about killing without wizards. How about Agnar? Best of luck killing him without a wizard.  I bet you could do it without a single enchanter, but good luck if you don't have wizards.<br>
<br>
Wizards own, and one of the reasons I read the Arcanist board over this one was very simple. I come here and I see people going &quot;omg, we suck, we're not balanced&quot;  I went there and I saw the one thing that has always been obvious to me.  Wizards own.  <br>
<br>
I have never felt useless.  Why should I? I'm playing the best damn class in the game.  If you feel useless, maybe you should find another class to play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tarlor>tarlor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/26/03 11:32:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26268.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>DD Proc buff?

<br>
If this line of spells were only from levels 1 through 55 or so, though, (and their efficiency scaled appropriately) I think they would be great.  (stopping at ~55, because AA crits could make this sort of thing a tad over-powering)  Really, this is just expanding the &quot;spear&quot; spell concept to lower levels, much like Frozen Harpoon began to do with LoY.  It might not help high end wizards at all, but I think it would be healthy for the class as a whole.<br>
<br>
One of the themes that gets posted here a LOT is that most wizards don't get groups because they're anti-social and don't work at it hard enough.  This is certainly true for some people, but isn't the only reason.  The standard counter-argument is that we've <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>had</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to solo our way to the upper levels because we just can't do enough sustained damage to be attractive to groups pre-60ish.  <br>
<br>
True or not, that is a common perception both within and outside the wizard class.  We more than come into our own at high levels with our high level spells and AA skills, but by that time, impressions can be hard to change.  Besides, it's a long, hard road to 60 (if you play it untwinked, un-PLed, and with only level-appropriate buffs (no KEI)).  <br>
<br>
A line of spells like this in the 1-55 range would accomplish a couple of positive things:<br>
<br>
1)  it would give wizards the dps <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dph to be attractive to groups at the earlier levels, where impressions about the different classes are initially formed<br>
2)  it would make wizards appreciate the importance of aggro control at an early age - nothing worse than a pure soloing wizard that has no idea what aggro control is when he finally starts grouping<br>
3)  it would make lower wizards play in a style that reduces ping-ponging, and hopefully establish early on that ping-ponging is a bad thing (which is something that I still have to keep drilling into people's heads) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind seeing a spell of this sort every 8 or 12 levels - to keep the standard nukes useful, while giving wizards a power boost periodically.  If one of them could &quot;happen&quot; to be at level 34, I would be rather happy too - it still chafes a bit that I was out-nuked by mages at that point (and no, bolts aren't hard to land in level 34ish groups)<br>

Rogues and other melee don't.  There is no limit on the damage a melee can do, meaning it isn't tied to a mana bar or stamina bar, as long as they are alive and all the top melee classes rogue, monk, ranger all have aggro reduction abilities or spells.  Aggro is the only limitation on melee aggro and they have ways of mitigating it.<br>
<br>
A caster is limited by both mana and aggro.  We could do damage quicker but then we would end up dead from aggro and even if we didn't die we would be OOM.  There doesn't seem to be a practical application of the quick damage principle that allows casters to outdamage rogues without dying.  Poor mages don't even have any aggro reducing spells!  The only real limitation you have on rogues is how many you can reasonably get behind a mob for backstabbing.  That certainly isn't going to be a problem in an exp group. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101939"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Atri Drumrunner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqdiva.com/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkblue;">Virtuoso</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkblue;">Erollisi Marr</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=191240"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Cameiel Stormgate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkred;">Sorcerer</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.pendragons.org/everquest/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkred;">Pendragon Society</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yaldin111>Yaldin111</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 596<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/27/03 12:42:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26268.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Problem</span><hr size=1> I really don't think we need &quot;this&quot; particular upgrade, what we need is better planned encounters where the holy trinity isn't the focus of it - interesting idea on the PoA fights for example, mobs that mem blur all the time, they need to come up with some original ways to use their limited programmability with a game engine that's about 3 years old (remember they revamped it once for higher DX and such).<br>

Sure, I really like the idea of wizards being able to add temporary proc damage to weapons.<br>
<br>
Is it necessary and essential to the wizard class to achieve balance or group utility?  No.<br>
<br>
The real problem here is that there is a perception that the trinity classes are absolutely required to gain exp in EQ.  There is real basis for this argument though as SoE makes it harder and harder for casters to do anything without a PC tank (aggro changes etc.), but another aspect of this problem is the originality and creativity of the players.  <br>
<br>
There is a definite perception among most players, casters included, that you must have tanks and healers to do anything that you cannot do solo.  This simply is not the case.  There are lots of options.  Aggro kiting, tandum quadding, and all caster groups are all possibilities.  Are they as efficient as trinity groups?  probably not, but I guarentee you that they are more efficient than whining on EQ boards, waiting for SoE to change its mind, or spending hours LFG.  <br>
<br>
The only real problem is that as SoE makes more and more mobs summon they make tanks, healers, and slowers a de facto requirement and that is a true problem.  I think the solution to this problem is obvious.  SOE, STOP MAKING ALL MOBS SUMMON.  There are other way for them to fix this problem and achieve the same end.  Make exploited or unbalanced mobs more resistant (requiring more assistance from mages for malo, or enchanters for tash), add to their HPs putting them out of solo quad range, or make them unsnareable/unrootable.<br>
<br>
Next time you are LFG and sitting on your ass at the PoV zone in, look at the list of other &quot;undesireables&quot; and try to think of a strat that you can use in conjunction with them and help each other out.  This is a hell of a lot more fun than sitting on your ass and it is a great way to learn alternative ways to use your class.<br>
<br>
Some tandums/groups that work great from my experience (non summoning mobs) are: <br>
Wizard/necro<br>
wizard/rogue<br>
wizard/mage<br>
Wizard/Wizard<br>
Wizard/Druid<br>
Wizard/Ranger<br>
<br>
There are always other wizards, necros, and mages waiting around for a group.<br>
<br>
The possibilities are only limited by your imagination and your tactics.  Next time you are getting ready to complain about not getting groups try to link up with these other classes and see if you come up with a strat to accomodate your new partner/partners.  Who knows, your strat may end up being more efficient or fun than a trinity group.<br>

People seem to forget that the mana bar limits our DPH, but if it didn't, we would be doing 300-400dps where melee does way below that. With manaregen as limiting factor, the dps goes down to 200sh, which is on par with similar geared melee.<br>

You would have to have the 'cast within melee range' requirement because otherwise SOE would never go for it. If you could cast it outside of melee range it would enable us to solo to well (and we know how SOE hates that) - we could just root and nuke with it. <br>
I think maybe adding some aggro reduction to it might be better.<br>
<br>
Other ideas for spells: <br>
- fire and magic based version of the Iceflame of Eci spell.<br>
- something like the rangers 'call of x' line of spells, that adds a fire/cold/magic dd proc to a weapon, only this one would be other targetable. You would have to be very careful with this spell, i.e. make it only work on people fairly close to your level, or scale the damage based on the recipients level.

<br>
I think wizards need a self-only mana regen buff which is weaker than like-level-clarity and takes its spot.  This is not unbalancing because there is already the entire KEI buffers&amp;bots market in the nexus.  It just evens the field a bit for those who don't run to the nearest enchanter when KEI fades.  We certainly do not need help when we have KEI up, but without KEI, flowing thought and AA, wizards can really struggle.  This addresses that.  At the same time, it does not boost wizards because VOQ on raids overwrites it.<br>
<br>
I think the game and the classes are pretty reasonably balanced, personally.  I enjoy playing and playing with every class.  The only caveat is that some of the classes are pretty dependent on the right support, which leads to frustration when it is not there, but that's the social game.<br>
<br>
Since, as I say, the classes, especially wizards, are fun and balanced now, then why would I propose new spell lines?  Not because we &quot;need help&quot; or anything silly like that, but because they are cool ideas that would increase playability for wizards and for everyone in a fair and creative manner.  They need some new spell ideas for the next expansion, surely.<br>

<br>
AA flappy gives more mana regen than Clarity and even stacks with it. So adding another buff that wouldn't stack with clarity would be waste. Sure it would remove some class interdependancy from wizards and we wouldn't need to make enchanter friends, but it would do nothing for groupability, only for solo downtime.<br>

<br>
From the perspective of a low 50's wiz, mana regen does not limit my dps nearly as much as aggro.  Without all those AA you probably have (and yes, I still desperately need concussion), I cannot do significantly more dps than the melee without getting aggro and causing more trouble than its worth for the group.  <br>
<br>
Mana regen (thanks KEI!) only allows me to almost &quot;pull my fair share&quot; while in a fast pulling xp group since all I currently bring is damage and maybe evac to a group.  I'm sure things change when you get to 60+.<br>

The concept certainly has some merit.  <br>
Your damage numbers are far too high though.  A 4,000 point nuke would be insanely unbalancing, particularly if Crits are factored in.  <br>
<br>
You say that these spells are Group friendly, but I would argue that an average 65 Wizard, with SCM3, SCF3, Improved/Allegiant Familiar, Focus Effects, and KEI, already is balanced in a grouping situation.  By Balanced, I mean able to sustain a relatively high DPS over time.  If Wizards already are objectively group friendly, then any failure to find groups is a matter of perception.<br>
<br>
Any Wizards, like myself, who began playing before the Kunark era can tell you about Group friendliness  perception and reality. In the Velious era, the average Wizard had a real objective problem sustaining DPS significant over time.  This was due to the large infusion of melee weapons, into the game, with high damage and low delays, without a similar infusion of comparable caster items across all level ranges.     <br>
<br>
Thus was born the Wizard LFG problem.  The idea for the group friendly spell that you suggest was born in this era.  Some asked  why not make a high damage, efficient, slow casting group friendly spell?  A good question, but something changed.  That something was Luclin.<br>
<br>
It is probably hard for Wizards who began after Luclin to understand just how different Wizards were as a class prior to Luclin.  Luclin helped to balance Wizards by introducing focus effects, AAs, Flappy, and FT items.  PoP introduced some easily obtainable, superior DDs, in the form of new Draughts and Aganrrs Thunder.<br>
<br>
I guess my question to you is:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do Wizards really need these Uber Nukes given that AAs, Focus Items, the Familiar, FT items, AT and SoS already provide huge DDs and Draughts provide relaibele and efficient DPS over time?<br>
<br>
In the post Luclin/PoP era, I think your large DD are not as relevant as they once were, and perhaps a bit superfluous.<br>
<br>
I do think we need a 2,000+DD base nuke to round out AT and SoS though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yes, you may not be able to turn PoP level mobs, but it's rediculously easy to turn a fire or ice giant if your spells do that much of his hp in one blast.  Some of the post 50/60 crowd is still in family type guilds, while I'm not, I still remember what it's like.  If you draw the duty of helping with the clear for your lower members' Vox/Naggy raid, it can be really annoying to get handed a beatdown by a blue or green mob.  <br>
<br>
Melee range is a liability in these situations, since your tanks aren't all that concerned with why the mob isn't hitting them anymore, just that it doesn't seem to be moving out of the horde of swinging tanks.  If the mob had to at least take 3 steps in your direction to connect, that would let the slower tanks out there know that they needed to punch the taunt key or have the enchanter mez it a second so they weren't going to carry a freshly rezzed wizard the next few battles.  Also, if all battles occur in melee range, how am I going to be able to med?  Sit aggro is a bitch that close in.<br>
<br>
That said, yes these do suffer quite a bit from balance issues.  I'm not entirely sure how to save the idea beyond tweaking the mana vs. dmg aspect some more and possibly adding a lower aggro component to it.  If it cost more, but didn't annoy the mob quite as much as it should, that would still make it viable.  <br>
<br>
Some of the others on this thread have brought up some good ideas though.  I like the idea of group harvest/group flappy-effects.  Part of the benefit of that is it really breaks up the holy trinity aspect of the game.  With everyone getting mana, you move away from the adding another support tank to the mix mentality and actually create demand for casters in groups, so you don't waste any of that mana.  It's always bugged me that there are so few pure caster groups.  <br>
<br>
One possible problem with the idea of a sub-par clarity spell for us is that we end up leaving out mages from the mana regen club. Yes, mod rods are mana regen, and yes they are easily utilized when paired with Phantom armor regens and AA skills.  Problem is that this is essentially banked mana, it's not being created from somewhere like harvest, lich, or clarity lines.  With the time limits imposed on rods and all, it's about the same as our harvest line in terms of utility.  Without coming up with a similar skill for mages, we end up creating a new bottom rung of the mana ladder, and just swap one imbalance for another.  <br>
<br>
I won't argue that we don't need a little extra oomph, especially at the pre-60 stage, though.  Yes, you can get a non-AE group in Seb, Velks, or HS before this stage, but how useful do you feel, and how wanted do you think you are?<br>

A group requires DPS, and a wizard is a great choice for that function.  A rogue is a great choice for DPS.  So is a mage.  There are a ton of classes which can be used for DPS.  It's great having two wizards in a group for your DPS.  But who wants two clerics, or two warriors, or two enchanters?  Wizards are great for groups.  We also provide evac and some crowd control which is something other DPS classes do not provide.  What we need, and what a lot of other classes need, is something that makes us unique outside of our DPS, something that is noticeable, something that makes groups want us.  But I think the problem still remains that every group needs a healer, slower, tank, and the rest of the classes are ffa.  The problem is more that there are not enough people playing the trinity classes and too many people playing the DPS classes, so you end up with a lot of the DPS classes LFG, or a bunch of the DPS classes making a group and looking for a slower, or healer, or tank for a long long time.  I'm not sure how to fix that...  <br>
<br>
But I'd start by making all classes more well rounded.  That's right, I'd give every class more abilities so that it wouldn't be the end of the world when you couldn't find a tank, a slower, or a healer.  Give wizards the ability to cast a weaker form of clarity, have a weaker slow/speed ability.  Give the necro the same type of abilities. That way if you couldn't find a slower you could substitute a necro or wizard.  They already improved the healer situation by giving shamans and druids complete heal type lines, but shamans were already one of the slower classes.  But hey, make Necro heals better maybe or SK heals, definitely Ranger and Pally heals.  A Pally could never act as a main tank and main healer, but if you had two Pally's the second one could fulfill the role of the primary healer, or a Ranger could.  Mages already have mod rods for mana regen, but that's no substitute for an enchanter.  So give mages the ability to summon something that would slow the mob.  I mean, come on, a mage could summon strands of webs or something that would wrap around a mob and slow their movements, but maybe don't give them any speed ability.<br>
<br>
Wo, am I rambling or what.  I just think that the real problem lies in that a group HAS to have a Healer, Slower, and Main Tank.  It's a necessity to have all 3.  Five people can be sitting there and need a slower.  Five people can be sitting there and need a healer, or a tank...  It's ridiculous.  Make Rangers better able to tank.  I don't know...  but just do something to make it not so hard to form groups unless you just know a ton of people.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26268.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26268.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26268.topic&start=61&stop=67>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26268.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26268.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26268.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26268.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26268.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26268.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26268.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
