<br>
Do you honestly believe that for 60+ Wizards that getting GSS is not a goal?  The choice is not theirs, it is their guild's as a whole.  What Magician would chose not to get Firebolt of Talon?  What are the consequences of his decision?  The only decision that is likely to affect acquisition of GSS, is which guild they can reasonably become a member of.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And saying that family type guilds can't go to VT is so false. It's like saying family type guilds don't kill Nagafen.

The guilds doing VT at the moment aren't what you (or anyone) would classify as uber guilds. - Mystic<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It really depends on what your definition of a family guild is.  I think many believe this to be a guild which allow choices among its members, as apposed to a full time raiding guild with mandatory objectives and play/level requirements.   Sure a high end guild can have a family atmosphere but this is not the same as a casual raiding guild with few requirements other than mutual respect of its members.<br>
<br>
Comparing the trivialization of Nagafen to the Emperor Ssra is beyond preposterous.  No single group is going to take down the Emperor anywhere in the near future, unless the next couple of expansions expand levels again, and the game totally deteriorates.  In any case the event is not in the foreseeable future.  I doubt that anyone will ever solo the Emperor Ssra.  The two jumps in power are not even close to comparable.  <br>

<br>
I have never read a post where a wizard claimed to have a 22% crit rate over a sustained period of time.  The posts I have read indicated that the crit rate was around 19% with maxed AA crits plus innate crits.  On the Magician board they are saying that with PoP crits they are getting around 12% crit rate.  AA crits give roughly 2% per level the wizard gets 3 levels + innate and the Magician 2 levels.  Even when you use your numbers, how do you get 3x when you calculate 22/10, like I said your statement was blatantly false.  PoP AA reduced the margin between our crit percentages bringing the magician abilities closer to ours in this area.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But to say my guild carried me through these encounters is a bit harsh.

<br>
I don't think it is harsh compared to your 'choice' theory.  If we were to switch guilds, I would have GSS and you would not.  I met a 62 wizard that had GSS from a high end guild who did not even know what SCS was.  She chose to use it in PoV over DoR in the desert, but then she had the option of being in a full time raiding guild where I could not play at their raid start time, nor as often as they required.  Of course she didn't know where the HoH camp in PoV was either.  The only 'choice' she could make that would affect her acquisition of the spell was which guild she should join.<br>

No it is not about individual goals but it is about guild capabilities and goals, or incredible sums of plat if these start showing up in the bazaar.  I finally found Sunstrike for sale in the bazaar for the measly sum of 70k, SoS was 190K.  Both were gone by the time I checked later (not that I would pay 70k for SS, nor could I afford SoS).  I have never seen GSS or EER for sale in the bazaar, but your mileage my vary.<br>

Since anyone can see spell damage now, crits are not necessary to show the gap between our spells.  And a mage only has to be 61 to purchase FoT for pocket change.

<br>
And that pretty much sums up what my definition of a family guild is. No steady raid times in a sense of 4+ times/week, no requirements for playtime, etc. Level requirements come by nature, as it is often so that guilds filled with 55th level people will not recruit 10th level character even though they say they don't have level requirements.<br>
<br>
Yet there are people in such guilds who have SS, GSS, EER, SoS, etc. Although people in this board make it sound impossible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Comparing the trivialization of Nagafen to the Emperor Ssra is beyond preposterous.

<br>
I remember when people said no one will take down Nagafen with single group in any foreseeable future, yet it would be way easy to do nowadays. Unless you're privy to some secret dev information, the foreseeable future can hold anything for us. I also remember when people posted that only ubers will ever get to VP, ST... yet, those are playgrounds of family guilds nowadays. Same will happen to ssra/vt, whether you want to believe it or not.<br>
<br>
So where's the preposterous comparison? EQ has changed, most of Luclin was first done by ubers with 60+ people... yet in the end it dropped down to 20sh people. First Ghould Lords in LGuk were done with 2 groups, and it soon dropped down to soloing. First Nagafens took 40+ people and deaths and bind rushing, but in the end they were done with lot less. EVERYTHING in EQ is getting killed with less and less people and less and less timesinks as time goes by. If you don't want to believe that, it is your choice.<br>

<br>
3x came from thin air, like I said, I don't know mage crit rates. And can you even max the PoP crits at level 62? Or is the magician at 62 level with maxed crits a blatantly false too?<br>

If we were to switch guilds, I probably wouldn't stay at the guild you're in but change to one that suits my goals in game and reflects my playstyle. And on the other hand, you'd be kicked out because of attendance and wouldn't have GSS. The game gives what you put in. And... I don't know where HoH camp in PoV is, yet I know tons where what is in PoTime... then again I also know where matriarch and patriarch camps are in Kedge. What does knowing PoV has to do with anything?<br>
<br>
The choice she made was to set goals to get the spells and join a team that can take her there. There are other routes too, making friends and raiding with people who keel what you want while being in a family guild is always an option... most people just choose not to utilize it. OR they aren't nice, friendly, whatnot and can't make friends... I don't know the drivers different people have, but I do know that people who put in the time/effort, get what they want from the game, unless they're total jerks.<br>
<br>

<br>
Individual goals and drivers get people to join guilds and make friends... they also get people to raid with friends and guilds and keel targets. Guild doesn't have a mind, it is a team made of individuals. Some individuals have goals that make them change guilds every couple of months... some individuals have goals to be master in all tradeskills, some couldn't care less about tradeskills. Some individuals have goals to see PoTime, while others couldn't care less about that. The biggest problem is the old phrase &quot;I pay same amount, I am entitled to get everything too&quot;. People just don't realize that everyone has the same chance in game, but it is up to the individuals if they can/will take up on it. Some people can play 60 hours a week, some can play 2 hours a week. And the rewards will be different, but maybe it should be printed on the box so people would know it before buying.<br>
<br>
Sunstrike was sub-30k on BB while PoP was still unannounced. EER and GSS have both been seen in bazaar quite few times. So yes, my mileage varies from yours quite a bit. And making plat is the easiest thing to do in EQ, at one point I had a bit over 500k without any uberloots or phatgear to sell / auction. Saving up and just fooling around stacked up eventually.<br>

<br>
Like I said, they should first correct the problem at level 34 spells before concentrating on 60+, because majority of wizards will hit lvl 34 compared to hitting lvls 60+. And as they haven't 'corrected' the problem with dd vs bolt that has been damagewise there for 4+ years... why do you see the need for them to fix similar situation at level 60+?<br>

So if our definitions are similar, you are saying that there are guilds successfully taking down the Emperor that have no level requirement to be 60+, who have an optional raiding schedule, and requires no minimum play time or raid attendance to join?  I am truly impressed that they can pull that off.  Which guilds are these?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet there are people in such guilds who have SS, GSS, EER, SoS, etc. Although people in this board make it sound impossible.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not impossible, but not equitable either.  When FoT is on a vendor for pocket change, GSS should not be that rare or hard to obtain.  <br>

SoE has stated they are not planning on increasing level ranges in the next expansion.  With the Emperor being a longer encounter and the side rooms likely to repop during the fight, I think it is fairly safe to say that a single group will not take down the Emperor even with the next expansion.  Nagafen was taken down by a single group before Velious was released, and by some family guilds with around 10 members shortly after Velious release.  Nagafen and Vox were trivialized so much, they felt it necessary to put a level restriction on the encounter.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So where's the preposterous comparison?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I guess SoE better get to work putting a max level requirement on Ssra mobs, because the encounter was trivialized by PoP.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Maybe, just maybe.. you might want to read the sticky in General board titled &quot;Wizard Mini-FAQ&quot; where it states that with maxed AA crits you'll get 20% (+2% from innate) crit rate.

Zarbonius probably did not take into account that the original thread in the library was parsing all critical spells (including innate).  I don’t think there is a parser available to most that differentiate an innate crit versus an AA crit.  A 22% total crit rate over any extended period of time has not to my knowledge ever been confirmed, although crit rates in general have been questioned multiple times.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3x came from thin air, like I said, I don't know mage crit rates. And can you even max the PoP crits at level 62?

No you cannot max AA crits at 62.  Magicians should crit between 8 – 9% with FoM (since they were reporting 6-7% with SCF3), the wizard would be at about a 16-17% crit rate, still not close to 3x.<br>

There is a valid basis for the suggestion; we have provided a multitude of reasons with supporting arguments that the current situation is unbalanced.  Asking to have the situation looked at is not unreasonable.  SoE made a major fo’paw when the put FoT on a vendor.  It shows you they had no idea how uncommon even Sunstrike was, much less how rare GSS was and continues to be.  Before you say that Sunstrike is not uncommon recognize that the spell would not be 30k even on your server if it was common.  Kunark dragons are taken down regularly on spawn, so those spells have to go somewhere.  Availability will determine price.<br>

Because an imbalance exists at a lower level is no reason to create a new one.  They should correct both.  While you say that more wizards will see 34, I submit that more primary wizards (mains) will spend considerably more time at 60+.  I think 50+ is a bigger issue to the general wizard community in general.<br>

Sorry, but no you haven't. Merely your opinion why it is unbalanced. Lots of people have opinions that differ from yours. You show how things look on paper while ignoring how they actually work in the game because to do that would make your position untenable. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I am truly impressed that they can pull that off. Which guilds are these?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I wasn't saying pure family guilds are taking them down yet. I said the guilds doing emp/vt at the moment are family type guilds to some extend and far from being classified as uber guilds. But, afaik UK (United Kingdoms or United Kingdom) on BB doesn't have raid attendance requirements and they're in ele planes at the moment (after farming VT). And they take tons of people who aren't in guild to their raids, thus allowing non-guilded people to experience content people think is only attainable by ubers / those with extensive play time.<br>
<br>
EQ is a grouping game / massive multiplayer game... making friends is a key to practically everything.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> SoE has stated they are not planning on increasing level ranges in the next expansion. With the Emperor being a longer encounter and the side rooms likely to repop during the fight, I think it is fairly safe to say that a single group will not take down the Emperor even with the next expansion. Nagafen was taken down by a single group before Velious was released, and by some family guilds with around 10 members shortly after Velious release. Nagafen and Vox were trivialized so much, they felt it necessary to put a level restriction on the encounter.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But they've announced 2 expansions, right? No one knows what will happen. As it stands now, emp ssra can probably be done with 10 people, which is yes, more than a group, but not a raid force of 60+ people. If AA / gear upgrade in next expansion as they've done recently, it isn't outside the realm of possibilities for single group to keel emp ssra after next expansion (maybe even after PoP with fully geared group).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess SoE better get to work putting a max level requirement on Ssra mobs, because the encounter was trivialized by PoP.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nice try at sarcasm... but those snakes in ssra will never have the status (significance) of Nag/Vox. Never. We saw that with Gore/Tale/Sev already. They're soloed/duoed regularly and with ease, yet there aren't AA/level restrictions on those.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Zarbonius probably did not take into account that the original thread in the library was parsing all critical spells (including innate). I don’t think there is a parser available to most that differentiate an innate crit versus an AA crit. A 22% total crit rate over any extended period of time has not to my knowledge ever been confirmed, although crit rates in general have been questioned multiple times.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But maybe you've now seen a post which says 22% rate?<br>
<br>
With resists it will always be impossible to differentiate the innates and aa crits from our logs. And for the record, I've questioned the whole numbers too, as it seems like I can't break 16% with total crit rate on DD. If innates are 2%, the rest 14% come from scf3, scfm3, fomm3... and it ain't looking good.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> No you cannot max AA crits at 62. Magicians should crit between 8 – 9% with FoM (since they were reporting 6-7% with SCF3), the wizard would be at about a 16-17% crit rate, still not close to 3x.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, wizards at 62nd level are critting as much as wizards at 65th level. Because after 20,000 nukes the 16-17% rate is what I'm getting with full AA crits. SCF3 with 12 aa points and 6-7%... then SCFM3 and FoMM3 for additional 30 aa points and only another 10% gain felt like ripoff.<br>
<br>
I'm inclined to believe that the AA crit rates on mage boards and wiz boards are exaggerated. But lucky us, it is summer and more people are going to be putting more hours in game again. Maybe this summer will produce nice logs that could pin down the real crit rates we get with the AA points we spend.<br>
<br>
But based just on logs from fights on raids (and yes, they're greatly inaccurate)... the mages in our guild are critting somewhere 20-33% of the amount I am. Then again, they're spending time on other funky spells like mod rods and stuff and wasting mana that way too. And on the other hand, I'm probably missing some of their hits even when I'm on data collecting trip. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So at least you seem to acknowledge that guild membership plays a significant role in the ability to acquire this spell.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It can help. But if your guild is filled with 10th level people and you're 65th... I'd say the guild membership isn't helping. And on the other hand, there are people who aren't in guilds who have the spells and just have good friends in lots of guilds.<br>
<br>
For people who want stuff along the first wave, the high end guild membership helps of course. But if you don't want to join such, put the hours they do, etc... the 2nd and 3rd and Nth wave guilds will eventually hit the same places and kill the same mobs. This brings back the old &quot;if you want it now, there is a way, if you want it some day, there is a way&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> There is a valid basis for the suggestion; we have provided a multitude of reasons with supporting arguments that the current situation is unbalanced. Asking to have the situation looked at is not unreasonable. SoE made a major fo’paw when the put FoT on a vendor. It shows you they had no idea how uncommon even Sunstrike was, much less how rare GSS was and continues to be. Before you say that Sunstrike is not uncommon recognize that the spell would not be 30k even on your server if it was common. Kunark dragons are taken down regularly on spawn, so those spells have to go somewhere. Availability will determine price.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What reasons? I've seen opinions so far. We wizards don't even know how good it is not to have bolt spells. Some mages exaggerate their unusefulness, but there is distinct downside to bolts compared to dd spells. If you'd stop to try and look for the imbalance so hard, you'd probably realize that the FoT isn't that great compared to DoR / AT.<br>
<br>
And, what makes you think Sony doesn't know how rare SS or GSS or EER are? Because they put a mage bolt spell with decent damage to vendors, but gave wizards much more usefull spell one level before?<br>
<br>
And availability alone doesn't determine the price. You need to find someone willing to pay the price to make the deal too.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Because an imbalance exists at a lower level is no reason to create a new one. They should correct both. While you say that more wizards will see 34, I submit that more primary wizards (mains) will spend considerably more time at 60+. I think 50+ is a bigger issue to the general wizard community in general.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, the imbalance is your opinion. In my opinion there isn't imbalance at 34th or 62nd. And since more primary wizards will spend more time 60+ they will have AT and SoS too most of the time then, right? AT isn't exactly rare or expensive anymore, SoS is coming down fast too. 60+ levels are easy to do in a week or month for most primary 60+ people, and especially easy for wizards.<br>
<br>
What it all boils down to is that some vocal people in this board think there is imbalance and some vocal people don't think so. The game is filled with such &quot;imbalances&quot;. Clerics nuke harder than us at levels 5-7 I think, yet even Grimstaff has stopped to crusade about it. I might be wrong, but I sure remember tons of posts about them having bigger nuke than wizards at levels 5-7. Funny thing is that no one seems to care about that cle/wiz issue, just like people don't seem to care that enchanters get pet at level 1, where mages get pet at level 4.<br>
<br>
Gwideon, there are tons of imbalances that majority will see. Yet the opinion that FoT is the root of all evil seems to be the most recent one. I guess with Lost Dungeons of Norrath and new stuff you and few other people will find new imbalance and FoT issue will fade slowly to background and few years down the lane it will be a memory here, refered to by people who were in game when it happened. Just like AE mez having unlimited targets, mez having random timer, wizards having no snare, etc. are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A> at: 6/19/03 10:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fenwig>Fenwig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 10:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: back yet?</span><hr size=1> yikes.

Of course I was being sarcastic, because the encounter was not gimped to the level of the original dragons as you implied.  It was not status that lead to the restriction but monopolization of the spawns by small groups.  A similar reason was given as part of why Manaburn was nerfed.  It is true that no-one knows what future expansions may hold, but I can safely say that the Emperor Ssra is nowhere near a trivial encounter currently for the vast majority of players.  <br>

Wizards were getting close to a 14% total crit rate at the end of Luclin which is where the original numbers for the library came from.

A wizard should not have to be a higher level to be equitable in his own area of expertise, nor should another class be that close especially when they other means to reliably deliver damage.

If you do not believe that availability is the primary driving force in this situation, you are delusional.

<br>
Please, provide the mathematical formula you use to compare bolt spell to dd spell in EQ. I'm very interested in seeing it. Since the game isn't complex, showing the formula should be a mundane task for you.<br>
<br>
Your opinion that &quot;bolt doesn't have that bad downsides&quot; isn't hard numbers, it isn't math... it is just an opinion among tons of others. And that opinion part is the one we're arguing. You think that the hard numbers are only ones that count... if that was so, we get Jyll's line that does WAY more damage than FoT will ever do, just based on hard numbers and math.<br>

Information is power, but obsolete information is just obsolete information. You can probably go to Safehouse and read a thorough walk-through for emp fight and thus the information is out there already. And the way the guilds on your server or mine act with outsiders, is going to vary always. Different people, different policies, different ideologies. Some guilds let stuff rot before giving it to recruits, some guilds get random people on raids, so stuff won't rot. Some people will give droppable stuff away to make others happy, some people hold on to it and sell it for profit.<br>

<br>
10 might be optimistic... can't say. Haven't been to there in 6+ months. But on the other hand, did tank Sontalak for 1.5 minutes today on my wiz. I think 18 or so is current 'low' number with which people have done emp ssra (I could be wrong) and we're still just starting to tap into high-end PoP-gear. Items with 200+ hp/mana will mean additional 75+ of both per slot compared to Luclin.<br>
<br>
Kunark gave us 10 levels, which took us 5 levels over Nag/Vox. In order to as strong level wise difference to happen, they need to up the levels to around 75 or 80 I guess. But they learned from Kunark and the rise in power has been more moderate since. I still don't understand what the 3 expansions are, because surely you're not calculating LoY as an expansion that affects it, when all it gave was pink trolls and bank slots. And was aimed to 35-60 crowd. In that sense, PoFear, PoHate, PoAir were 3 expansions before Kunark came out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And next expansion won't give us any rise in power, no levels, no aa, no nothing. Just few more zones to explore. So... emp ssra will probably stay as hard encounter for some people even after that. Looks like SOE is learning that rise in power isn't good for the game they created. They did it with Velious, but went South again with Luclin/PoP.<br>

Matter of opinion... way I read it back then, the restriction came because Nag/Vox are 'first uber encounters for people to train on' and they wanted to keep it so. Sure they didn't like people duoing them, but the reason they posted back then (if I recall correctly) was the 'raid encounter experience'.<br>
<br>
Currently emp ssra isn't nowhere trivial to vast majority, but Nag/Vox wasn't either nowhere trivial for the vast majority when the restriction came about. For example content that I consider trivial, probably isn't so for vast majority of players.<br>

12148 casts of SoS/SoM/AT/ADoI/ISoS/DoR/DoE and 16.26% crit rate. SoS has lowest at 15.32 (3023) and ISoS has highest at 17.39 (2779).<br>
<br>
So, if magicians are getting 14% and wizards are getting 16%... the extra AA seem to be useless OR the magicians are exaggerating.<br>

<br>
Let me ask you this, since you're nearing 65th. Are you looking forward to SoS (reliable) or SoM (big damage)? Which means more to you?<br>

<br>
My mistake, I thought mixed levels of FoT and DoR in my head.<br>
<br>
Anyway, they get a decent nuke at 61 and some wizards have similar at 60th, but newer / lazy wizards don't. You have to remember that some wizards got SS about 3 years ago. Anyway, even if wizard00 is so incapable of getting plat / friends that he/she doesn't have any of the 60th level nukes, he will still have the draughts. I don't know your server, but if killing emp in sebilis is considered a considerable effort, then I assume it is Stromm. But even for wizards who can't get any of the 60th spells, it is only one fast level to go for DoR.<br>
<br>
Also, people who rush through levels and don't gear up are going to be lacking in gear and people who farm gear may level slower but will get the gear. Getting SS at meaningful level is so easy even today, as you don't even need to be 60th to farm it.<br>
<br>
Let me spell it out, sounds like mountain out of molehill with FoT again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> If you do not believe that availability is the primary driving force in this situation, you are delusional. If there is one person selling a useful item they can name their highest reasonable price, if there are 100 people offering the item the price would be driven down to what a merchant would pay. Diamonds are a good example of what availability can do to price. This is economics 101.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Highest reasonable price... which in BB can mean 400kpp, but on some newer server can mean 10kpp. Availability of merchandise isn't the only one determining the price, like I said. Please, take a moment to read, that is Written Comprehension 101 - Step 1. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Looks like this long thread can be summarized easily:<br>
Wizards-without-big-60th-nuke:&quot;FoT is unbalanced.&quot;<br>
Wizards-with-big-60th-nuke:&quot;FoT is just fine, we have better spells.&quot;<br>
