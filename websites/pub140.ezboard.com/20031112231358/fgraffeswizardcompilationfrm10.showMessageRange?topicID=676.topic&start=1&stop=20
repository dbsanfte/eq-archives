Even though I am high levle and skilled, there are many places I cannot use pets, from my first planar raids I've had that problem, as have all mages. You know how FRUSTRATING it is casting 600hp nukes, that do around 150hp actual damage *consistantly* is ?<br>
Even at 60, Plane of Hate2..GAAAAAH! Can't use pets in most of it, and resist rates make me just wanna sit down play gems, it's truly horrible. Much of Plane of Air, Fear, epic mobs, a lot of dragons, TOV, the Hole we have problems in.<br>
<br>
But, we shouldn't get lures, that's wiz territory, rightfully. Wizards should always get low resist/unresistable/mob specific nukes.<br>
<br>
So the most &quot;in class&quot;, and fairest idea I can think of is this:<br>
<br>
Spell summons a solid projectile, that smashes into its target. Damage is  melee type, NOT spell resist, AC/dodge affect the damage. The projectile does 1/2 damage if an attack roll using 1hb skill fails, this should be easy to code, and prevents over power (caster has to &quot;guide projectile&quot; as it were, also atk buffs, rear positioning would help,  making it more fun and RP). Spell is conjuration, so is in character and mana efficient.<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
lvl 45 Stone Smash, a boulder literally drops onto the target's head. Damage is 400 hp.<br>
<br>
lvl 50 Blade Bolt, a bolt-type spell hurls a ballista bolt at the target, damage is 600 hp<br>
<br>
lvl 55 Blade Bolt 2, as Blade Bolt 1 but does 800hp<br>
<br>
Lvl 60 Meteor Blast, a meteor falls from the heavens on the target, damage is 1,000hp.<br>
<br>
 In your opinion as wizards. would these spells be in class for magicians, not step on wizard &quot;toes&quot; as it were, or be too powerful? I'm asking you guys because you are *the* nukers, and therefore I think need to be considered in such things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Less lure type spells is better. More means they use them to balance encounters more, and that just ends up sucking for everyone. Besides, you already get a low resist spell. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
<br>
The problem is we OFTEN CANNOT USE PETS!!<br>
Where do we meet high resist mobs usually? On Raids, yes?<br>
<br>
Where can mages generally NOT use pets? RAIDS. Please do not tell me we can, because generally we CAN'T (I have used pets everywhere bar TOV and ST,  I know what I'm doing and I STILL can't or won't use pets in many raids).<br>
<br>
So imagine you are a mage doing a raid on hate or fear, your about level 50, going for planar armour maybe chance at epic drops. What does the mage do? Tries to nuke, notice, TRIES to. Until you hit 55 resists SUCK big time. You CANNOT use a pet, so that leaves you...hm maybe DS a tank, make some rods....<br>
<br>
How would YOU like it, as a wizard, if on a raid you are told &quot;Oh no nukes, O'Kiels the tanks, TL and port folk in and out.&quot; Would YOU be happy? That's the situation mages face, and I for one am rather *** about it.<br>
<br>
Oh and I am not getting at wizzies or trying to cut in on your action, which is why I am ASKING you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've said for ages wizzies need about a 40% increase in power, whether that's by mana regen, mana ratios etc is for you really to decide.<br>
<br>
mages, wizards and necros are the damage dealing Int casters, we've been screwed over for ages, I am merely proposing one way to help my class that's within reason. I don't mind the idea of mobs with high resists, I do object when we aren't given the means to affect them by using a different set of tools.<br>
<br>
I hear wizzies saying lures aren't good, well the mana ratios could sure be improved (why not a longer cast time but more normal mana/damage ratios?), but if you are having high resists would you STILL say they are crap?<br>
What I would like to point out is why is it wizards don't have MORE lures/banes from LOWER levels? As said up to lvl 55+ resists are a MAJOR pain in the butt, from 45+ when mages go on raids and can't use pets we are REALLY shafted.<br>
But also wizards frequently face  high level mobs from their LOWER levels whom they have trouble with resists on...<br>
So why isn't their gnoll bane spells around lvl 25? Low level lures from lvl20? I'm not talking uber nukes at those levels <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  At those kind of levels, mages/necros have pets, DS and life taps. Wizzies have..O'Kiels...to deal with high con high resist mobs. So why dont' you get banes/lures EARLIER ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I think one of the big failings of EQ in regards to casters, is not so much equipment, but lack of variety and thought of spells. There should be far more mob dropped/quested spells at low level to give interest. For example you camp the magi in Guk for a SMR, but why doesn't he drop Froglocks Bane, lvl 40 spell, only affects froglocks, does say 600 hp, 6 sec cast, practically unresistable and low aggro. The spell is powerful, but only on *specific* mobs.<br>
<br>
I dont' know exactly what wizards need in terms of balancing, but isn't that, logical, useful and in character ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am trying to suggest a logical, useful and in character solution in regards to mage probelms, not trying to upset wizzies.<br>

<br>
You realize the 1000 pt nuke you just outlined is bigger than our biggest lure? In fact your entire line of stone spells demonstrates (imo) a huge overestimation of lures.<br>
<br>
at 44 we can lure for 360ish<br>
at 51 our lure is in the 640 range<br>
by 60 it's 825<br>
<br>
If you wanted 'stone' to fall in line (~70% of wizard nuke) you would have to cut all of your numbers flat in half.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, maybe you are already factoring that in thru armor class... but the numbers you put up, if you actually got those numbers they'd be stomping our toes clean off =)<br>
<br>
As an aside, your stone series would amount to &gt;&gt; lure in pvp, particularly against casters since you'd have a good chance to land a full hit (1hb) and, by the mechanics of it, probably no 60% nerf. From what I've heard, mage versus wiz pvp is one of the few encounters in the game that approaches balance. This would **** it up right squarely =)<br>
<br>
And as Grim said, you already get pets. The only reason we get lures is because we have no pets. I really appreciate your respectful attitude, and I hate to dissagree with ya, but I don't think mages should be any more damaging than they already are. Look, there's already hideous class competition in the damage department. Mages are one of the FEW classes that can potentially get away from that, because you have a monopoly on a utility function (summoning). If verant would make more summoned items that were worth a darn, then mages would fall into favor without stepping on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> toes. Mages are the only class I can think of with that type of potential; every other class shares key functions with somebody else, and can't be tweaked without multiple levels of balance issues.<br>
<br>
What I would love -so- much more is if verant fixed pets and made more useful mage-summoned items available. Regarding pets, fixing the pathing would be nice, but even a quick hack to make the indiff to all would help a ton, right? It could be implimented as an alt skill or an enchanter buff if Verant wants to be particularly mean about it =/<br>
<br>
Regarding summoned items: You know what I want to see? Bet you can guess =)  --Summoned items with hideous big +mana!<br>
Maybe a summoned halo with like 400 +mana; rings, earrings, etc...<br>
Speaking of which, I'm still waiting for them to design a Tinkered: mana capacitor (back slot, backpack graphic) with like 500 mana, 15 weight and no other stats.<br>
<br>
And there is supposedly a &quot;summon peridots&quot; spell in the spdat now. If it isn't a mage spell, it damn well should be! Sure, it would require a few lines of hard-code, to make the summoned pdots no-rent (unsellable) but still work as reagents... but it would be so awesome! I suspect this spell would put the epic pet to shame, in terms of influencing group/raid desirability. And again, without stepping on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> toes. Indeed without really changing the balance of the game at all!<br>
<br>
How about a mage-summoned sword that procs a HUGE debuff to charisma? ie, the ultimate taunt sword?<br>
<br>
Now it's time for me to completely depart from the realm of the reasonable and dream a bit =)  no need for flames from anyone; I realize the following examples are probably bad ideas, but the mechanics of them might be used for something cool.<br>
...<br>
How about this for a mana-booster item/spell:<br>
mage spell (1.5k mana) summons a no rent item.<br>
<br>
the item is given to others on his raid; it has one charge with a 2 minute cast time to summon a second item, which is the actual mana booster. The mana booster is no drop, and has an instant 1k mana charge on it.<br>
<br>
The point of going thru 2 steps, is that it gives you a huge mana boost item which is tradeable but cannot be stockpiled. (the person recieving the item is forced to stop and cast for 2 minutes before the effect becomes available; after which the effect is instantly available at any time, but no longer tradeable) It would essentially allow the mage to give each person in his group/raid a 1k mana emergency pack.<br>
<br>
You could also design a similar non-stockpilable summons spell to summon a strong arrow (max arrow damage stat x1.5 or something). It would essentially allow a mage to give a single powerful nuke to each of his archers on a raid.<br>
<br>
It would be an awesome item to have, but it would probably unbalance high level encounters, and be no fun for the mage anyway... Summoning a bunch of mana expensive items at the beginning of a raid... yay. bet you gotta hate that... but... You are a summoning class. I have a gut feeling that the majority of your work will always need to come be before the fight starts. There may simply be no way around it.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I know that was a bunch of rambling on my part...<br>
But in short, please don't compete for damage. You're already pretty good at it; the best in some situations; and seeing as damage is a widely-competed racket, you are bound to get people riled up if you push for more. Mages have the potential to be a utility class which is valuable in its own right, without competing with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. That is a rare option, and I wish for your sake and for mine that verant lets you expand in that direction rather than choking the damage field any further. With the utility potential mages have, imo it would be a crying shame and a horrible waste if you were balanced by DD capacity instead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>(Title left blank)</span><br>  Posts: 4708<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/10/02 8:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> still no lures</span><hr size=1> The answer is to make your pets more useful in areas where people don't want them now, NOT to give you Lures.

<br>
As for mana, well we currently DO have a mana boost item..mod rod Mk2. I always hand one out to everyone BEFORE a big fight takes place. Epic wizzies love 'em hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Even on no-epic wizzies, if they watch agro carefully, clicking a rod -300hp +220 mana can be a very useful trade. And in XP groups I've churned 'em out for wizards as well (use boots for nukes).<br>
<br>
Well unless pet aggro/pathing/ability to give NO ATTACK command are seriously addressed mages are really SHAFTED, and I'm sick to death of it. Sheesh, I LIKE playing my mage, but with this garbage about pets taking xp, and when you're lower level on raids doing diddly damage on mobs (even when higher when you can't use pet and on certain mobs) it gets really frustrating :/<br>
<br>
To give an example, Veeshan's Peak, no way in HELL would I dare use a pet in there *shudders at the thought*.<br>
Or when I was lower level in Hate, nukes would generally do about 200 hp thanks to resists, and I COULDN'T land a damn thing on clerics of Innoruuk for a long time.<br>
<br>
Casters have poor attack skills hence I thought that would be a good and sensible limit on the proposed *projectile* spells, I dont mind if damage is lowered, but we sure as heck NEED them. At the same time wizards need more banes/better lures.<br>
To point something out: wizards = masters of DD, right? So they would have developed far more nukes to deal with *specific* targets, wouldn't they? And from this...why dont' wizards get crit nuke skills from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> low level?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It's NUTS wizards have to pay xp to buy what should be an ability you earn. Mages/necros should earn it later on with AA because we are not masters of nukes.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I debuff on some raids, was kind of nice when my wiz pal who was about lvl 51-52, said he loved having me around cause his resist rate was drastically reduced, so he could light up, hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Frankly I have little hope of VI fixing our pets, the latest *face screws up like Kermit* stuff from Absor has made things worse *sigh*<br>

I would much rather pets got fixed somehow, so that we can use them on ANY raid, but VI's atttitude lately...*grimaces*<br>
We've already pointed out making pets neutral would mean no AFk XPing is possible which should please VI, as well as help us.<br>
<br>
Don't know if you've been to TOV or upper islands of Sky, but they are prime examples of where pets are totally FUBARed. isle 7 has pathing that's just totally &amp;$^$£%!<br>
<br>
Want mana galore? get a 56+ mage, slap a hit point buff (aegolism etc) and regen on him, assign a healer to look after  said mage, he casts Rod of Mystic Transvergance, uses 1 charge, drop rod now with 2 charges..he gets healed as needed. This system=mana GALORE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Wizzie with epic hsould have rod hot keyed, runs low..click, loses no hit points thanks to epic rune (wonder if Spell shield works in conjunction with this, hm??), and gains 220 mana per click.<br>
<br>
you are correct, mages shouldn't get much increase in our DDs damage, unless ALL casters got an across the board % increase, not really sure thats needed though, more FT items from non-uber mobs seems better in regards to all Int caster balance problems? Would like to point out that our nukes and pets dont' scale after 50, which is one of the big bones of contention. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>

That doesn't scale well does it? I dont know if wizards have a similar problem in regards of scaling up 40 to post 50.<br>
And I know some wizzies will point out lvl 34 nukes here, ahem ours is a bolt and I personally have no objection to wizzies getting upgrades, I'm all for it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
On a point I made: Do you think wizards should get more lures/banes at various levels? To me it would seem an excellent way to address some wiz problems, and make the game more fun (rather than camp the FBSS for a melee, camp the archmage for a Froglock Bane, hehe)<br>
<br>
Your idea of summoned arows is good, would like to see that myself, say it procs a lvl 8 nuke or some such, hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have a gut feeling that increasing your nuking power is never going to properly compensate for broken pets and a spotty summons list. You already know what the problems are, and how they need to be fixed.

Other than that, I haven't cast them once.  I suspect that if you are getting nasty resist rates, you probably just need to level.<br>

I don't want mages to have lures because I don't want anyone to have lures.  They are a stupid hack.  Int casters should do more damage than over armored tanks, and lures are not the answer to that.<br>

<br>
And yes I know what it feels like to be highly resisted.  Lures do help, but they are not the cure.  I also disagree with the Mages getting the stone spell your talking about.  But not because it would unbalance Mages.  But because once mages got the spell Mobs would also.  And most likely the mobs would get an AE version of the spell.  <br>
<br>
On Raids If I could find a mage that would cast their Malo line of spells I would have a new best friend.  Problem is all the mages/necros/shaman that I have been raiding with have all forgotten about their debuffs.  Therefore reducing my damage ablility as well.  From what I have noticed while fighting without debuffs I average about 60-75% of my max fighting power.  With debuffs I am alot closer to 90%.<br>
<br>
You know as well as I do what VI will say.  &quot;Since Mages can't use their pets on raids, they still have debuffs, DSs and nukes.  Therefore they are still balanced.  We like the idea that mages have to change their style of play during raids.&quot;  Now if in game the balance is true does not seem to matter to them.  I think they only look at such things on paper.  Oh how I hope caster balance brings some changes, big changes.  I really hope Mages and Wizards benifit from these changes not just the triad.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 3602<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/02 7:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mage Lures</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The problem is we OFTEN CANNOT USE PETS!!<br>

Where can mages generally NOT use pets? RAIDS. Please do not tell me we can, because generally we CAN'T (I have used pets everywhere bar TOV and ST, I know what I'm doing and I STILL can't or won't use pets in many raids).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There's almost no situation where you can't use a pet, if you know how to control it.  Brodie, Fuedar, and Maltily (Mages in my guild obviously!) always have a pet up on every raid with the exception of Ssra when we're moving.  When we get to the boss we're there for they get them up.  We have never had a pet train us anywhere.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Where do we meet high resist mobs usually? On Raids, yes?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nope, not anymore.  At least on a majority of the mobs.  Obviously before the resist change patch went in there were problems, but since then it's virtually non-exhistant.  I know because I always try my trusty rend robe (mr based nuke) on every mob we fight.  Rend lands almost every single time.  Besides boss mobs fire and magic nukes will land on almost every standard mob found in dungeons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How would YOU like it, as a wizard, if on a raid you are told &quot;Oh no nukes, O'Kiels the tanks, TL and port folk in and out.&quot; Would YOU be happy?

Well, our job is nuking and dealing fast efficient damage.  Your job as a Mage is to provide damage and raid utility.  You can't have the best of both worlds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> mages, wizards and necros are the damage dealing Int casters, we've been screwed over for ages, I am merely proposing one way to help my class that's within reason.

Check out the &quot;damage&quot; a Necromancer deals on raids, then come back here and see if that statement holds true.  Necros can only do extreme damage to mobs on long, drawn out fights... and at that they can only do it if there are 1-2 at the most there since their dots don't stack.<br>
<br>
Mages combat high resists with their pets which will hit anything.  See your pet as a lure-based DoT. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In any case one of the class defining skills of a Wizard next to quick hard damage was reliable damage (lures).  Personally I don't think anyone should have lures except Wizards and Abashi said awhile back that no one else would get lures but Wizards.  I wouldn't be totally against a level 60 Mage spell that did say.. 500 lure dmg for 350 mana or something.  <br>
<br>
Lastly you came here asking our opinion on what we thought about Mages getting lures and you got it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Don't get so upset when we say we don't like the idea.  I feel for you guys and I know you're not perfect but there are many other solutions than just giving Mages lure-based spells. <p><br>

Should they get a spell at 60 that is lure based? I'd think a 1:1 ratio might be ok, but nothing along the lines of the wishful thinking that started this thread.

When rogues were broken, well over half of their skills had no use or were broken, they couldn't tank, couldn't deal damage, had no purpose beside sucking up healing mana... They wanted to get fixed.<br>
<br>
They didn't get mend, or feign death, or able to wear plate armor (other class' perks). They got their broke-ass tools repaired. And in some cases, over repaired (and some things, like non stacking poisons and poison related issues, are still arguably broke).<br>
<br>
If VI addresses your summonables (making them useful instead of cute or 'naked-fear-break-only' items), and your pet drawbacks (not scaling past 49 terribly well, pathing AI, absolute non-desirability by MANY (but not all) others in many grouping situations, etc), you'll be better mages, and have less need/desire for lures (inefficient spells with lower resist chances).<br>
<br>
BTW: Your initial concept, I don't think works even in concept. EVERYTHING that isn't totally melee, melee ranged weapon based damage (weapon including things like feet, shields, or such), is non-melee damage. Falls are non-melee. Arrows are non-melee. nukes are non-melee, so are dots. Everything.<br>
I've always been pretty sure that's because Melee damage compares against armor mitigation, and nothing else does (or it'd be double jeapardy. Beat the resistance... then penetrate the armor. Yeah right). Your 'lure' idea of making it melee damage, but at range, breaks a lot of things. It makes it better than arrows, thrown weapons, and spells. All the advantages of not being in melee, with none of the downsides other than line of sight. Being 'melee' type damage, I bet it would even avoid the only-cast-in-melee range mobs, like fire giants. It's just not a good idea.<br>
All IMO, of course.<br>
<br>
By the way, Lures can and do get resisted. My first black reaver raid in City of Mist as a wizard, I was L51. So I was using Enticement of Flame. Inefficient, and slow. It stuck, roughly, 50% of the time. Sure, it beats bouncing totally 100% of the time, but it's not even all or nothing. It gets resisted, and you can still get partials. Lures, frankly, bite. But when the ONLY thing you can EVER do in combat is mana/magical based DD in one form or another, having even a lousy weapon beats having nothing at all that can touch an effectively magic (or fire/cold) immune critter.<br>
Take away a wizard's mana (or more accurately, their attack spells of DD/AoE/Rain) and they're reduced to a vastly inefficient melee with no special abilities, lousy weapons, and lousy skills.<br>
Take away a mage's equivalent spells, and they still have their utility function (granted, we can still evac/port, but that takes you OUT of the fight and does nothing to enhance staying IN the fight), the summoned items themselves if they apply, and two constant potential damage sources. Damage shields (utterly unresistable, damn them when they're on the mob), and pets. And even in bad pathing places, you could make of pets the same as lures, by casting them at the beginning of a fight, having them engage, and then reclaiming them at the end (or having them get lost). By summoning them next to the monster, few pathing issues. By banishing them after the fight, vastly less random risk of pathing trains. Yes, it IS incredibly mana inefficient compared to other methods... but so are lures. This kind of situational mana usage would be for when you don't think you have any other productive way to add to the fight (which is exactly when I use my lures. When there's nothing else I can usefully contribute to the group/raid by being there).<br>
<br>

As it stands currently mages are seriously handicapped in any environment where they cannot use pets and there are a very significant number of places where this is the case post 45.<br>
But how does one fix this without breaking them everywhere else. Granting mages lure type spells would make them much more viable in most raid encounters but it would totally unbalance them in many other situations. there needs to be some kind of fix but I am not sure that adding lures is the way to do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>(Title left blank)</span><br>  Posts: 4842<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/17/02 10:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> No lures for you!</span><hr size=1> &quot;As it stands currently mages are seriously handicapped in any environment where they cannot use pets...&quot;<br>

That's all you really had to say.  What's the problem now?  Can't use pets too many places.  How do you fix the situation?  Kinda stands out when you think about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1405<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/18/02 2:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards, your opinion on a mage low resist spell please?</span><hr size=1> Personally I don't think giving mages lures would change all that much.<br>
