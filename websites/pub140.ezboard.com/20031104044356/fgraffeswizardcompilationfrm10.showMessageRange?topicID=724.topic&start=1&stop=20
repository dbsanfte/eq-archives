But through the design of the system, these classes are fun and useful in different situations.  <br>
<br>
* Enchanters<br>
Fun in grind groups, they are the crowd control and the folks that level them know this and enjoy this aspect.  They are part of the holy trinity and have a great usefulness in such groups.  And in low numbers, are useful as buffers and crowd control on alot of raids.  But as the number of enchanters increase, their fun level and such exponentially decrease in a high end guild situation.  Their nuke power is horribly below all under casters, so the extra's can't feel anymore useful.<br>
<br>
* Necromancers<br>
Origianlly the ultimate caster.  Everyone and their dog had a necromancer twink.  Good in everything, master in none.  Sort of the bard of casters.  While they have continued to grow in this area, it has only been a PvP wise advancement.  While their PvE has greatly decreased compared to other casters.  In grind groups they are valuable and have lots of abilities if the groups take advantage of them.  In a raid situation they become a mana battery and not much beyond this due to their lack of arsenal.  Plus with lousy pathing and limitations, pets are generally considered unuseful on raids.  <br>
<br>
* Magicians<br>
A Great class in all respect.  They are very useful in a grind group when a group knows their potential.  A good mage is a huge asset to a group while a idiot is a huge liability.  With damage shields, mod rods, pet, and good nukes; they have the capability of adding value to any group.  But many people don't realize their true potential and as such would take a druid or a wizard over a magician in alot of situations.  On raids, mages are the most boring of a class.  They become rod whores.  Everyone wants their rods.  They lose alot of desirability to play due to not really doing anything different but dropping rods in the high end game.  <br>
<br>
* Wizards<br>
The constant talkers, they don't shut up.  Wanting ultimate power, but always getting moldy cookies.  Their solo ability is probably the best of all pure casters in the high end game.  Their AE group ability has great potential beyond the VI nerfs.  In a normal group they are rather a boring class.  With the holy trinity they are stuck to sitting on their arses and doing far less damage then they thought they should be capable of.  In a raid situation, wizards are the highlight of the casters.  Magicians, Enchanters, and Necromancers envy their power to do damage and only have wet dreams of matching them.  Other caster jobs are to support the wizard along with the raid. <br>
<br>
That is my basic summary of the pure casters.  Now what can be done to help balance these classes, both playwise and funwise.<br>
<br>
All Casters:<br>
* Allow DD's and DoT's that can't be stacked with the same spell from another caster the ability to stack.<br>
* Allow Caster shield buff line the ability to Stack with Shaman Focus line<br>
<br>
Enchanters:<br>
* Give them nukes that rival that of Magicians in their current state.  While in grind groups they are crowd control, on raids they could do more damage.<br>
<br>
Necromancers:<br>
* Give them the ability to take control of their pet as a first person.  With the variety of pets, they would add a whole new level of strategy to the necromancer.  Plus with several classes to play, it would rarely get boring.  Also this would make pets more useful in raid situations.<br>
* Give them a better ability to Resurrect Players<br>
* Give them a upgraded Mez ability, so that they could be considered a better crowd control member in a grind group.  <br>
<br>
Magicians:<br>
* Give them the innate spell debuff that wizards have.  So they could hit mobs as effectively.  With their less efficient spells, this really wouldn't infringe on wizard territory.<br>
* Give them a lure line of spells.  Or a Lure spell.  In the current state of the game and resist rates on mobs.  This would not be an unbalancing or bad approach on wizard territory again.  This would only increase their usefulness and fun factor on raids by allow them to do more then drop rods. <br>
* Give them some ability to Evac the group to the safe spot, high level.  Or atleast a means to *TL* members to the safe spot. <br>
<br>
Wizards:<br>
* God only knows...We are fuggered<br>
* Read Graffe's! Plenty of Ideas.<br>
* And Yes I am a wizard<br>

<br>
Hm for a raid ability, or an AA skill, ability to manaburn power that makes a lvl 60 pet that hits for 150_, now THAT would be fun!<br>
<br>
Lures: I proposed a spell that summoned a bolt or meteor, hits vs Armour rather than resists, sick to death of resistant mobs I cant do crap on :/ AND DONT TELL ME I CAN USE PETS ON THEM! *cough* :&gt; most of the time you meet resistant mobs you cant use pets or the risk is too high, hate, ToV, VP, PoA etc.<br>
Reavers and lords / Lhranc in CoM you can use pets, thats ok there that they are lure only since pets are ok *still need skill though COM is screwy*.<br>

The only real solution to Magician balance would be the re-work of pet abilities in a raid condition. There have been many ideas mentioned by the mage community. The problem is weeding through these, preferably a nice list given to VI that we could go through and work with based upon pet reasonable pet improvements.<br>

<br>
Feh.  Enchanters don't envy wizards damage.<br>
<br>
The enchanter's view is that damage is done by the peons.  =)<br>
<br>

<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Enchanters don't want to do damage.  That is like balancing wizards by giving them healing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Necromancers<br>

<br>
I agree.<br>
<br>
Keep the mezzes short &amp; expensive.  Toss in interesting side effects, like a mez that costs the necro HP, or lifetaps HPs from the mob and gives it to the necro.  Give them all long recast times, and keep the duration short -- force a necro to give up some spell slots to do mezzing effectively.  Allow any mez to overwrite a necro mez. . .<br>
<br>
For example, give a necro a 1.0 CT 12.0 RCT mez, 5 mana, does 200 damage to the necro and mezes for 24 seconds (damage only done if mez lands).  Or, a 3.0 CT 8.0 RCT 150 mana mez, drains 100 HP &amp; gives it to the necro, mezzes for 24 seconds.<br>
<br>
Mages:<br>
Targettable summon spells.<br>
<br>
Target a player, have the summoned item appear in the target's inventory.<br>
<br>
Add charged LORE NO DROP right-click summoned items.  Wizard only evak or nuke or deaggro items.  Enchanter only PBAE mez or stun or self-rune clickies.  And the like.<br>
<br>
It is an entire world of effects you could add that wouldn't infringe on anything.  Being targetted &amp; NO DROP/LORE, it is alot more dynamic than stacking mod rods on the ground.<br>

Seems to me someone who plays an enchanter and doesn't like doing that stuff is pretty silly.  That's like saying &quot;who'd want to play a Warrior if all they do is hit stuff and taunt!?!?&quot;  That's THE CLASS, there wasn't any secret about it.  Enchanters nuke too much already in my book, like Clerics. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/02 2:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: =)</span><hr size=1> Excluding Kunark and old world zones, one possible solution would be to have manaburn have ZERO delay between recasts.  Being fully OOM after using it once gives us the need to sit down and med up again anyway.  The only problem with this is the pathetic 32k HP mobs from Kunark(including Venril Sathir in this).  So, get rid of the delay between manaburns, and we would probably be well balanced.<br>
<br>
Putting damage bonuses to our spells based on our intelligence, or having the mana cost be lower based on intelligence, and total mana pool might also help.<br>
<br>
Really, we suffer the most because stats don't affect individual spell damage output.  A level 60 wizard with sunstrike does IDENTICAL damage per cast to any other wizard with sunstrike(since summoned focus items are pretty much identical to the effect on items).<br>

The first enchanter gets tash, the shammys are already fighting over slow and cripple, and the rest of the enchanters spend thier time twiddling their thumbs and snarling at verant.  <br>
<br>
In a single exp group or on a fast moving crowd control raid I have neither space nor mana nor inclination to mem any booms and only the speicifically needed debuffing dots.  But when dealing with non mezzable zones (Kael etc) or the &quot;what crowds?&quot; boss mob, it woudl be nice to be more than wasted space.  After an enchanter for KEI/shiss and a second as backup we could be better replaced by any other class at that level.  Its at that point that enchanters start cussing out verant for leaving them nothing to do with their mana.<br>
<br>
So sure, I want a better boom.  Something that has better mana efficiency than 250 mana for 650 damage landing one in 5 casts and not landing at all since by cast attempt 4 the super high taunt has me aggroed and dead.   I dont need a scad of lines of booms, I *don't* want to be a better boomer than mages druids or wizzies, I just want some way to spend my mana on offense not defense.   My greatest fear is that Verant in caster balancing will look at the enchanters and say &quot;Balanced, no probs&quot; or worse yet &quot;not balanced, lets give the whores more buffs to make all the *other* players happy with&quot;..<br>

Pet &quot;problems&quot; are about 85-90% reduced with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet hold</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and new pet coding measures, and the other 10-15% can usually be avoided by careful paying of attention. So basically, even on nasty multi-mob raids, I can send in a pet to attack and watch it out of the corner of my eye while I drop a few mod rods for the healers. And if I can't devote enough time to watching the pet, I can tell it to hold and have 100% guarantee that it will sit there until I tell it to do something else or it dies.<br>
<br>
Still, I suggest the following be taken into consideration:<br>
<br>
*) In Jewish mythology, a golem was an animated being constructed from the powers of earth, wind, fire, and water. Given that magicians are nominally masters of those four elements, it would seem appropriate that magicians could also have some line of spells for controlling these beings. If magicians deserve some kind of bane spell, and if the devs don't want it to be too horribly unbalanced, then some form of golem-bane would be appropriate. It would give magicians a new little niche to play with, and it would add some roleplay value (yeah, not a big issue I realize, but still).<br>
<br>
*) Barring that, stretch the definition a bit and consider various golems and constructs as summoned beings and give the versus-summon spells a lower resist rate, including golems currently immune or nearly so to magic attacks (spite golems, black reavers, etc.)<br>
<br>
*) Consider some form of pet-only weapon with a low-resist proc or high ATK and combat stats specifically for designated uber encounters. Make the summoned items zonebound (similar to PoA keys...rentable but not zoneable) and make the spells castable only in certain designated zones such as Kael or Skyshrine. The weapons could also be tagged only for a specific mob model (such as Giant) so as not to give magicians in, say, Velketors Labyrinth any advantage with the spiders and gargoyles when the weapon was only intended to contribute to the Velketor battle itself. This would help magicians better utilize pets on large raids without throwing typical game balance askew. The spells don't have to be common, they can be quested similar to wizard bane spells. Heck, they can even use a fairly costly reagent. The goal is just to give pets (all pets) an edge where they need it most: making physical contact with level 61+ mobs.<br>

If you did some homework you'd find that in longer (5+ minutes) fights, necromancers are often the highest damage dealing casters. My pet now gets the same resists I do, and he now survives most AE encounters with little help from me. As far as pathing, well pets are neutral to mobs now, so that's not a problem any longer. Now while it is true for the time being if there are more necros on a raid that we encounter stacking problems with DOTs, but often you may be the only necro there, so stacking 100 DPS worth of DOTs is not a problem.Let's not forget we get 350 mana per minute - STANDING with arch lich. Our mana regen is pretty fast compared to other classes. And my lifetaps crit just like DD spells as well with Fury aa skill. Mana battery? heh that is so last year. With our new group taps, upgraded pets, new DOTs, we are a formidible damage class. Let's not forget Lifeburn, our aa skill similar to Manaburn. The difference is that although it does less damage,Lifeburn uses NO MANA. Instead of medding to full, we are doing damage that entire time, giving us even higher DPS.The fact is, even with crits, our DOTs are more mana efficient than DDs are. Necromancers= masters of damage in long fights, wizards= masters of damage in shorter fights. Hmm, sounds like they might work well together huh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A Nuke that didnt have a stun component and had a chance in hell of landing would be nice, but I'd rather they redesigned raid zones. Luclin and Velious had 0 raid quality zones that needed a chanter beyond buffing and tashing.  Raids are an exercise in boredom for us.  In ToV, you do single big fights, or multiple fights on unmezzable mobs.  I would prefer more zones like the Kunark Planes, where to get to the boss mobs you have to clear a lot of trash, that can be CC'd.<br>

I almost felt good about being a necro on raids again after reading your post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Everything you said is true for the most part, as long as you are the ONLY necro on the raid casting dots.<br>
<br>
So ONE necro can have good DPS during along fight. (like last night on RoS fight in CT I easily did 70k on Acidic mass, as well as tapping mezzed mobs near by for group buffs, and healing group after vexing mass), However, the other necros will have to cast less efficient dots because they wont stack with yours. Where all other DD classes just continue to hammer away.<br>
<br>
Pets are nice on some raids but they don't last at all on the raids where mobs have unresistable AE's. Pet still just don't have anywhere near the hps to be useful on many raids.<br>
<br>
And the Lifeburn is good if you want to try for the kill shot, but I for sure won't be casting mine until after mob is at 5%. Nothing quite like being at 1hp or say 500 if u have manaskin up and then drawing low hp aggro from mob, or get hit with a AE and get wipedout <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Having all our mana left wont help much if we draw aggro from low hps. Not many of the high end battles allow ToN or Zumul's to land so you stuck with vexing to heal on top of lifeburn heal dot or hoping like hell your healer watching you (and we know as necros, no one ever really watching us cause they so used to us taking care of ourselves). And just pray like hell mob doesn't have to many spells on it and resist your lifeburn and still have you loose all ur hps but do zero damage to mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's true we can do some decent damage in long fights, I just wish other necros could also do same damage. I can't tell you the number of lvl 60 necros I see leaving class because they just aren't needed in numbers on raids.<br>
<br>
And wizards are masters of damage in long and short fights. Any wizard worth thier salt, can easily outdamage me on long fights, even if it isnt a Giant/Dragon type.<br>
<br>
And like you said mana battery is so old news it's not even funny. Lots of times raids needed us for the mana pumping, but now with new magi rods, even on raids of 35 - 40 ppl in long fights - where I'm only necro on raid - I don't even get asked for mana. Much quicker (and much more effecient) to hit rod x3, and get a heal than for them to get mana from me.<br>
So we not even looked at as mana batteries for raids anymore either.<br>
<br>
Not trying to make us sound like wimps at all, just saying we really aren't as good as you making us sound if there is more than one on a raid.<br>
