This paladin knew not where he was going, or what he would encounter. Ready with his brand new leg chopper, which was given to him by a friendly ogre, he boarded the boat in the town of Freeport. He had an uneasy feeling, that something bad would happen, but he sat back, and enjoyed the long boat ride. All of a sudden, he heard a voice, &quot;wake up, wake up&quot; it said. The young paladin opened his eyes, only to see a beautiful elf. The paladin wondered where he had traveled to; he shortly realized he had reached the twin islands. He thanked the elf for waking him, and grabbed his weapon and started looking for someone to show him the way out. Before the paladin knew it, it was night, and he was lost. He decided to set camp, and travel in the mourning. The paladin looked for a good tree to set up camp, when he tripped over something; he turned around only to see a poor half ling’s corpse. Hoping the same would not happen to him, he checked the corpse for any life signs, he suddenly felt a sharp pain on his back, and fell to the ground, still conscious he heard “did we get him?” and realized he had just been mugged by a band of thieves. When his soul reappeared back in Freeport, he swore he would get vengeance. The young paladin boarded the boat again, and set sail for the islands. The second ride to the island drove him to near insanity, and he jumped off the boat when he was nearing the Twin Islands. He swam for miles and miles, searching for land, when he finally saw a big hill. Upon reaching that hill, he saw what looked like a grim reaper running at him, he put up his fists, and got ready for a fight, the Grim reaper looked much stronger and faster than him, so felt scared. The grim reaper pulled his sickle back, and swung, the young paladin knew this was the end of the road for him, so he made no efforts to dodge the incoming attack. The paladin closed his eyes, but he felt nothing, instead he heard a loud scream, he opened his eyes, and noticed that there was an experienced shadow knight fighting the gruesome monster. The paladin aided the shadow knight, and the monster was defeated. The paladin asked the shadow knight, where he could reach the boat from, the shadow knight pointed him in the right direction, and told him to swim. The paladin was very thankful towards the shadow knight. As he waved goodbye, he got in the water and started swimming. The paladin swam for miles and miles, when he finally saw land. The paladin swam ashore, and dried himself off. The young half elf quickly noticed that he was at the same island he was mugged on, he quickly started searching for his corpse. He saw a shadowy figure, from farm away, he had been taught that this race was known as the Drows, or dark elves, for their evil ways of being, and purple skin. He hoped this was a friendly one, and approached her. The paladin spoke very little of the dark language, but luckily she spoke elfish. The paladin asked the Drow if she had the skill to locate corpses. The Drow looked surprised, but agreed to do this little task for him; the Drow located the paladin’s corpse, and lead him to it. The paladin looked around, and walked up to his corpse. He looked for his blade, and was about to pick it up, when the band of thieves came back, they killed him, and hid his corpse. The paladin came back many times, in search of his corpse. But each time he was unsuccessful in retrieving it. The paladin, after many attempts, finally gave up. The paladin decided to become a wise druid. The now called druid, decided to name himself, Windwolf. Windwolf swore he would get revenge. After Windwolf’s 36th birthday, he returned to the retched islands, and slew each and every one of the thieves. <br>

THE END<br>
<br>
This story is based on a true EQ story. The story of my first character in the Morel Thule server, and how his life ended so quickly. I guess that proves that the old saying “Curiosity killed the paladin” is true. So please, if you are wandering a unknown land, be sure you have a way of retrieving your corpse, just in case something unexpected happens…. Luckily my paladin was only level 3, so not too much loss.<br>
