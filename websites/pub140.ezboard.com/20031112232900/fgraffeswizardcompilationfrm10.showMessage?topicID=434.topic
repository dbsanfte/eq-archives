I know its a little late to suggest but I think that what wizards need to make themselves useful in a group isn't a damage upgrade or an &quot;anchor&quot; spell.<br>
<br>
I know that you may scoff at me for this, but recent events have lead me to conclude that what would really help Wizards to be useful in groups would be an O'Keils group enchantment. Hear me out before you push that back button or start writing your flames with one hand at 60 miles per hour.<br>
<br>
We are wizards. Architects of ruin and masters of damage. It only makes sense that our enchantment be something that adheres to this standard. Damage shields should be as much a part of our class as direct damage spells are. I have taken the liberty of planning the progression of these spells with wizard class balance and group usefullness in mind. I believe that if this is brought about wizards will once again be useful in groups, not only at high lvls, but at lower lvls as well. They will become a desireable addition to groups even against the epic mobs in Velious and other places where wizards were nothing but dead weight before.<br>
<br>
The O'keils line could start as it does, the 2 ds at 4th lvl. Move the flickering flame upgrade down to lvl 12 or so. Upgrade the damage to around 12-20 at lvl 20. Give wizards a group version of this spell at lvl 29. At lvl 34 you can give a single version of this spell with about the same damage (maybe a little more) with additional resist bonuses. At lvl 44 give wizards a group version of the previous spell (with the bonuses) and slightly upgraded damage (around 30-40). At lvl 49 give wizards a single version of this spell with a damage upgrade (about 50) and improved resists. At lvl 52 give wizards a group version of this spell. At lvl 54 Wizards get a single version with a strength bonus for tanks in addition to the previous bonuses with a damage upgrade to around 70-80. At lvl 56 wizards get the final and ultimate upgrade to this spell. A group version with improved resist and strength bonuses, damage of around 90-115, and maybe even a slight regen effect. Verant could make the damage output of these spells increase as you gain levels, like with our direct damage spells.<br>
<br>
If you have read this and still don't understand what perfect sense this make then let me put it into these terms. Magicians are useful in groups because of what they do best: summon. Clerics are useful for what they do best: heal, Enchanters are useful for what they do best: enchant, Tanks are useful for what they do best: tank, ect. What wizards do best is deal damage but we are not useful for that reason. Instead Verant seeks to redifine the wizard to a taxi service and make that his priority. I think that this series of enchantments hold true to the core wizard function and will make us again useful for doing what we do best. Deal damage. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umalidorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malidorn</A> at: 6/16/01 1:52:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uennyaorcsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennya Orcsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/01 11:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A possible Wizard balance solution.</span><hr size=1> I agree but have an interesting idea...<br>
<br>
A twist to the idea would be to lower the damage a bit, and make the DS something that also covers the weapon. That way the extra damage is delt when anyone hits the mob. Make it unresistable, and make that damage add to the wizards agro (well, gotta give something back =) That way we are differenciated from Mages and others with good DSs. We are the masters of Offensive spells, and that change would reflect it.<br>
<br>
Wow, I really like that idea! Then we wait till that last 20% is left and start making the clerics job easier buy smashing the crap out of the MOB with the bigger DD spells. Hmmm...<br>

Such a spell would indeed be a good group addition: it would make us more group friendly.  However, it's simply not the cruise I signed up for.  I started a wizard to be able to do my own damage, plain and simple.  To blow things up; to freeze them; to send them to Hell.   I cannot do that on a sustainable basis except with pipsqueak things that should never attack a 57 wizard anyway (I don't care about soloing, I can do that of course to the extent Kunark allows it).<br>
<br>
Verant's perception is utterly flawed:  They think we do enough damage (Poe said it again).  We do not.  It is simple: mana, mana, mana.  It's the only fix, by whichever of the myriad of ways that have been suggested, that is consistent with what OUR VISION is.  Screw their redefined &quot;Vision&quot;; if I ever play again, it will be a cold day in whatever Hell Norrath has before I give ANYONE but a groupmate, close friend, or guildmate that has a strong need for it, a taxi ride anywhere.  I do NOT want to be redefined.  That is a dishonest and abusive technique of non-customer service.  It fits perfectly with their normal corporate culture and actions.<br>

This is what I signed up for, and this is what is supposed to be special. The math proves that Verant has failed to provide this. Everyone keeps talking about levels 50+ but the fact is that the distinction should begin at level 1, not 50. Giving us MORE DD spells is not the same. So if Verant refuses to provide a meaningful solution in DD, find it someplace else. If the aggrogate damage a 20th level wizard provides their group is 18.2%, be it by DD or anything else, then they are a good contributer. Forget how it is done. So, remove the DSs, add Direct Damage Buffs, and the balance starts.<br>
<br>
This would be a good spell progression:<br>
at  1st: DD, Caster cenered AoE, shield, and Bolt.<br>
at  4th: DD, Mob centered AoE, Direct Damage Buff<br>
at  8th: DD, Rain AoE, Bolt, skin, 0-stun<br>
at 12th: DD, Caster cenered AoE, shield, bolt<br>
at 16th: DD, Mob centered AoE, Direct Damage Buff<br>
at 20th: DD, Rain AoE, DDB, Bolt, skin, 6-stun<br>
<br>
Progress like that. the DDBs should be targetable, and the damage unresistable. They turn into group spells around 24th and 29th they turn into group buffs, and the stun line turns into AoEs. <p>Ennya Orcsbane<BR>

<br>
The wizard class pre-expansion was a well balanced class and the original design was balanced. (post beta) <br>
<br>
The overriding problem with the wizard class is that post expansion our class doesn't scale well. Mele has gained increased efficiency and higher damage ratios.<br>
<br>
The original concept of the wizard class was to be the Damage dealers of the game this concept worked well pre expansions. With mob hit points increasing in the new continents a problem was created that VI either overlooked or Ignored the fact that wizards were not given spells with enough mana efficiency/damage ratio to effectively play in the new Lands.<br>
<br>
The following is a list of Balance suggestions for our class:<br>
<br>
1) Wizards are supposed to be masters of Channeling create for us a group buff called &quot;Magic Reflection&quot; the idea is that this spell creates a temporary magic shield where magic attacks are reflected back against there caster at one half value.<br>
<br>
2) Create a temporal spell line Wizards should be masters of Time and Space. We should get a spell that's group related it can be a level 34 spell and what it does is reduce spell cast and recovery time it could start at 5% reduce for Cast and 10% reduction for recast. This could be a temporal Flux Spell line or a single Quest spell (This should be difficult like our brain bite quest) that scales up as we level.<br>
<br>
3) If a temporal Line is considered then how about a Wizard dot/Buff spell. Now I know what your thinking wizards shouldn't dot or buff.. and I agree but this spell doesn't work like a traditional dot or buff how it works is it is designed to stack with the highest dot or buff on a PC or NPC and will extend the length/duration of that spell by 1/3 or 1/3 the idea is that the wizard is able to manipulate the time on the target to extend the spell. A spell of this design will increase a wizards groupability without changing the classes ability to solo.<br>
<br>
4) WIzards need a increased damage mana ratio ..... verdant doesn't want to give it to us for one huge reason the damage efficient needed would unbalance us in the original game zones by a huge margin. What I suggest is either a continent based spell line. We channel the mystical/magical/elemental forces from that continent. Or they make items available for each continent Channeling Crystals that give percentage increases to Spell Damage and percentage increases to Mana efficiency for those zones that we are inefficient for only.<br>
<br>
5) A alternate Idea would be to create a Imbue spell line for the Wizard class. This spell line would allow wizards to Charge up spell effects into either a quest item ( 10 charges max) or channeling crystals one charge each stackable and expendable on cast. This would enable a wizard to pay the mana cost for some spells in advance. Make the items charged in this manner have a greatly reduced cast time. Quest Items that can be charges have the option by the wizard to &quot;Mana Dump&quot; select a number of spell charges to fire in one shot. High Aggro yes will it look kool when the mobs HP go to 0 real fast Hell yes<br>
 <br>
These are just suggestions that I see for making the wizard fall in line to what the original concept was. The Idea of altering the Character concept to fit the game dynamics is poor customer service shows a lack of concern for continuity in game design.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to comment or expand on my suggestions <br>

This spell could have a further effect of making that person say only &quot;ribet...ribet&quot; for an hour after the cast no matter what they typed. I would gladly lose half my mana for that hour for the joy of turning pesky beggers or obnoxious players into a frog. This spell isn't unprecidented in folklore and would give a bit of enjoyment back to the game while waiting in a newbie area for melee's that keep you waiting to TP them. Just one of many ideas on my Wizard wish list. Buffing others isn't on my list at all.<br>

<br>
I have a high level shaman, so being a wizard is, among many things, a badly needed retreat from buffing.  To me, lower mana costs and lower resists from mobs are key.  Verant believes we can dish out a balanced level of damage, but if our spells are repeatedly resisted our damage reality falls short of the damage *potential*, which is how balance is determined.  <br>
<br>
Few things anger me more than when Frost Giants in GD resist my Conflagrations and Inferno Shocks.  I dinged 46 the other night and had two straight full resists from a frost giant.  On average about 1 cast in 12 is fully resisted in this way.  This is utterly absurd.  On average about 1 cast in 12 is fully resisted in this way.<br>
<br>
IMO, Lures were a big mistake.  All wizard spells should have lure type resists.  Failing a serious revision of our spell lines, a general lowering of resists seems reasonable.<br>
