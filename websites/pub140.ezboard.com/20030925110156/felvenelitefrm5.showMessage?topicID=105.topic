Twilight's essence slipping in through the window, dancing on the floor. A frosted crest on everything in the city glistens in a fading sunlight. Yet, in this winter's wake, a warmth radiates through our all-too familiar halls. Faces coming in and out throughout the day, with stories behind them streaking endlessly into memory. One could easily get lost in history here, for we make so much of it together. A small brown finch sits idely outside a closed window, peering in intently at all the bustling warmth. He watches us bring nourishment to each other, in glasses of lightly transparent wine and in the embraces shared between most. The bird silently sighs, in the way that birds do, and drops from the window being swept into a cool current. This small creature has been stopping by our halls for many weeks, and he still comes back almost every day, but few see him. During morning's rise, he sings with such delicate, intricate beauty it seems to slow time and current and brighten the sunlight. Most still sleep through it, though they claim to love it. He comes to us and watches, the friendships entwined about each other like ancient vines. He watches us as we quarrel over various things, all seemingly unimportant to him. Despite how hard he tries, rarely can the small finch concieve why we argue over such trivialties, yet rarely embrace the beauty and personality in our worlds. He rises each morning to sing into the spirialing winds of beauty, yet recently there has been a growing resiliance within his small bird heart. The everlasting debate of the merciless trivialties wears at him like a frozen winter's roar at an old tree in the forest. Yet, in the small grasses springing through the hall's oaken floors, there is a slight renewal of spirit. No matter how many times they are stepped on and crushed into a smelly green paste, there is life in them, and the small bird find's strength in another, different trivialty. It's just grass.<br>

The narrow ledge has become routine in its daily rounds through the Faydark as it hunts for tiny seeds and insects. This day is like most others as it takes a moment to rest and survey its surroundings.<br>
<br>
The afternoon sun peeks from behind a soft, cotton candy clouds high overhead. As the sun shares its warming, golden rays with the forest inhabitants far below, the finch finds itself suddenly facing its own distorted reflection trapped in the glass. The finch raps at the window with its diminutive beak in an effort to drive away the illusionary intruder. It ruffles its feathers and prepares to strike again, but the sun once more greedily cloaks its warmth behind the clouds; the glare and the illusion both fade, leaving the tiny bird happily alone.<br>
<br>
The finch looks through the window now that the transparency has returned to the glass. The brown bird finds the usual circle of Elite wandering the halls. Some of this Elite troop laugh, while others argue but all seem to have found some niche within these halls to call home.<br>
<br>
A slight movement beyond the window causes the finch to defensively flutter-jump backwards. The bird turns its attentions curiously to a young, honey-skinned elven maiden that kneels near a small patch of trampled grass. The grass has pushed its way through a crack in the aged marbled floor and has found itself an unlikely home. The finch hops a few inches closer, back to the window, and observes the woodland elf lovingly nourish the broken blades with her tender prayers and magic. The finch watches as the blades of grass straighten and are whole once more.<br>
<br>
The elven maiden pushes a golden strand of hair behind a pointed ear and smiles at her work, before turning and joining a seductive, buxom, raven haired beauty in conversation. The two wander back into the din of the commons, leaving the finch alone on the windowsill, staring at the grass. Perhaps it’s more than just grass?<br>
<br>
The finch, having had enough of the windowsill for one day’s adventure chirrups and takes flight, continuing the hunt for small seeds and insects. Hopefully this afternoon will prove as bountiful as the last. The finch quickly fades into the Faydark mists, leaving the grass and the windowsill in each others company.<br>
<br>
A few moments pass. The clamor of the hall has somewhat quieted. The windowsill is the only remaining witnesses to observe the small patch of grass begin to blacken and wither. The blades painfully curl in on themselves as they seek preservation towards the ground, but there is no escape or reprieve. As the last remaining drops of moisture flee the once slender, delicate blades, they crumble into a barely noticeable pile of fine black ash.<br>
<br>
The windowsill continues its silent vigil alone, and it shares no secrets.<br>

This grass grew towards the warm Fay sunlight, not realizing until much later that it would be alone and at the bare mercy of all those above it. A feeling of utter vulnerability it seems, to be trapped in a spot without the ability to flee. I have felt like that before, but I was not sprouting through a floor.'' He trails out of the front door to wander aimlessly beneath the trees just before the grass turns to ash. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=105.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=105.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
