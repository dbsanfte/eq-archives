It's well known by now that rare spells maintain their value over time because once they are scribed, they leave the economy forever.<br>
<br>
Why not do something similar with gear/weapons?  Like if you went to the bazaar and bought Centi Shortsword #5,973,256 for 50pp for your twink.  Then your twink goes up to an NPC and performs a quick &quot;Hail&quot; quest that turns the CSS into a NO DROP item.  In return for permanently removing said item from the economy you would get a slight improvement over  it's original stats or a bonus to the dmg/dly ratio.<br>
<br>
They did something similar, if much more convoluted, with the SMR for the enchanter epic and it's worked pretty well.  It's one of the few old world items from a relatively low level dungeon that still nets around 4kpp(or more). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seaotter42>SeaOtter42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 12:41 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> mudflation isnt even a real problem. As more and more items become available in the game, old items face more competition for characters money. additionally, these older items become easier and easier to obtain, thus increasing supply of the particular item. Not every item will be useful forever. This actually helps new players a lot, as obtaining entry level gear becomes easier, and it doesn't hurt experienced players, as how many level 60-65s still spend their time hunting in lower guk? I would even contend that mudflation helps lower levels, who otherwise would be faced with large numbers of higher level players farming items in areas intended to be hunted by mid-low level characters. <br>

The problem is, something like this could promote bottomfeeding merely for the easy XP available from items. It is something that could work on FV pretty well, but I wouldn't really see it working too well on most servers unless the XP gain was really minimal. But then if the reward was that low, it might not solve the problem at all. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

First of all Comparing Level 60 Spells to Weapons.<br>
<br>
By saying this Weapon that you can buy off twink so and so goes for 50 plat why does Sunstrike (For example) go for 20k+?<br>
<br>
Reason : The level 60 spells drop off Kunark Dragons Generally or something equally difficult to get. These mobs also have a spawn rate of 5+ days!<br>
<br>
When a Centi Longsword drops off a mob like gore, then I could expect to see the prices stay high. Look at the Windblades in HOH. They go for a randsom now!! WHY? Because they are a ultra rare drop!<br>
<br>
Look at Sceptres of Destruction .. Same thing, they go for a lot! Why? Rarity and on most servers, they dont drop anymore.<br>
<br>
Look at the Blade of Carnage. They go for a randsom also! Why? Because it drops off a Difficult mob.<br>

<br>
Low level items becoming more frequent and cheaper is a byproduct of mudflation. While from an economic standpoint it looks like deflation, it is a direct result of over-all mudflation. Those low level items are more available because the relative power required to obtain them is lower. It was a lot harder to get, say, the haste sash from lguk when the max level was 50 than it is now when you can be lvl 65 with 300 AA.<br>
<br>
Then, the relative power to obtain that sash may have been max power or close to it. Now that same lvl 50 is no where close to max power, hence mudflation causes the sash to deflate in price.<br>
<br>
Is it good or bad though? Mudflation being bad is a really subjective thing, I think. So newbs have it easier now because they can pick up very nice gear in the bazaar for pretty cheap, that certainly doesn't hurt the newbs but some old school peeps may not like the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the game. Is this a real game issue, or just a subjective view of the older players? There's a lot of other scenarios like this too.... all seems subjective. Mudflation is a problem only when it becomes a problem for the players.... otherwise mudflation can seriously just go on for as long as the designers are willing to keep making bigger and better content and the players are happy to keep eating it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=596996" target="top">Infirno</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Especially since the game keeps getting 'longer'<br>
<br>
You don't want a new player to take substantially longer to get to the 'end-game' level than it did for the current players or people begin thinking &quot;Why should I play this game? It would take too long to catch up with everyone&quot; <br>
<br>
You also end up with people growing bored of their main and wishing to play a new class. Powerleveling, twinking, this is all a means of replayability.  When people say &quot;replayability&quot; they don't mean &quot;playing the game again just like the first time&quot;  In a game where most of your ability is based on your equipment and time devoted vs. player skill, the only way to 'speed it up' is to provide better gear.<br>
<br>
Sony seems incapable of choosing a middle-ground. The twink gear available pre-luclin is disgusting for melee, and the lack of gear afterwards is equally unbalanced (it creates a gaping hole where for 20 levels you are unable to buy upgrades).<br>
<br>
IMO much of the level restricted gear (the required stuff, not so much the recommended stuff) should be more lax, and No Drop items should rarely have a level restriction.<br>
<br>
It's my opinion that level restrictions are ADDING to mudflation rather than help it.  How?  Because now as soon as people hit the level where they can equip the restricted items, they throw the other stuff away, not really caring what they sell it for--this is in contrast to previously, when they would just buy them/quest them/farm them the best available gear, and then never sell it.<br>
<br>
Take my bard alt: She is currently wearing a set of Engraved Royal Veliuim, which I will soon replace with some cultural.  If I could go straight to Cultural, I would never have had my friend craft the ERV in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 632<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 2:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The problem is, something like this could promote bottomfeeding merely for the easy XP available from items.

Let's say you're filthy rich but can't find a group...or a high level melee who can't solo in PoP.  I suppose if I were in that position I might feel a bit insulted by farming but at least it would give me something to do that would net some exp.  <br>
<br>
If enough people did it the value on items across the board would go up as their rarity increased.  Just making an item rare drop isn't enough anymore as long it can keep circulating in the economy.  Right now you have items that were farmed for years in wide circulation sitting right beside newer, harder to get items and devaluing them.  The quality of the reward vs. the item destroyed would have to be carefully considered by SOE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 863<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 2:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> Some people hate the lower level game.

However, others don't share that opinion.  I for one love the lower levels.  There were much more grouping opportunities (since the zones were populated by newbs).<br>
<br>
I don't agree, though, that people should be rushed through content, by design, to get to the end game.  It should be a choice of play style.  Maybe they should lift level restrictions on toons from the same account, so that you could twink your own alt if you wanted to zoom through lower end content.<br>
<br>
However, whenever you can get far superior gear for the price of a stack of silks, or for that matter, as stack of batwings, something is just wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laeyakk>Laeyakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 2:21 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> Is mudflation a problem?<br>
<br>
it is somewhat of a design problem.  See, gear impacts melee characters more than it does casters.  As such, mudflation puts a shear on the relative power of melee and casters, requiring more balancing and design work.<br>
<br>
Second, mudflation reduces the value of drops in low end areas.  Right now, there is no point in hunting for items at lower levels, because you can get better items easily from higher level characters.  This removes the &quot;cool&quot; effect of getting a neat item, which is a good thing.<br>
<br>
Third, Verant in order to combat mudflation makes items, especially DROPable items, rarer.  This sucks, because people like getting items and improving their character.<br>
<br>
In order to make mudflation less of a problem, you'd have to constantly revamp old zones, reitemize them and change their difficulty level, rescale the relative power of casters and melee regularly, and generally expend a whole lot of effort.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that the mudflation can't be solved, I'm just saying it is a hard problem.<br>
<br>
There are other solutions:<br>
Item decay.  I hate this, having to replace my equipment regularly, or replace the really cool set of boots I got, sucks.<br>
<br>
Making more items NO DROP.  This removes a rich part of the game (trading), which sucks.<br>
<br>
I like the customization suggestion above.  As an alternative, have the NPC return an item with a &quot;charge count&quot; on it.  You can return it to the NPC to de-customize it, but this reduces the charge count by 1.<br>
<br>
After a certain number of customizations, the NPC becomes unable to de-customize the armor.<br>

This makes customization more tempting (you can still sell it later), but the item decreases in value as more people choose to use it.<br>

Well if my evil plan were actually hatched you wouldn't have non-level restricted items impacting the lower level game anymore...because there wouldn't be any.  Yes, that would require a reitemization of all low to mid level loot.  But this time you could make sure loot only got into the hands of the right players of the right level and not cause massive balance problems.  <br>
<br>
If EQ's not on the &quot;back burner&quot;, why let old problems remain?  The lack of rewarding gameplay outside of the endgame has been a big issue for a long time.  You've got half a million subscribers here.  There's no garauntee any of the upcoming MMO's will be able to reach or retain that level of subscribership.  Why wait to fix EQ's problems in a sequel?  They need to do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>something</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to make things interesting again.<br>

Wouldn't that still be mudflation? In fact, that would probably be the worse kind of mudflation: instead of just having more powerful areas that trump the newbie areas, you completely remove the newb areas. The powerful keep getting more powerful, and new players are left completely screwed.<br>

In EQ many items just haphazardly flood the economy without regards to prices(drop is pure profit- no PP costs associated with it usually), which causes them to sink. Naturally they need to be demanded. now quadding akheva once I got 3 items in 1 quad when i wanted to try the place. now, thats 3 centi weapons into the economy in some 10 minutes. Obviously I would need to find 3 slots for people to put them into. Those are very easy items to acquire, then.<br>
<br>
In a mmgorpg, the prices of items are based largely upon overcrowding, difficulty, and downright rarity of an item compared against the money supply and free slots. For instance, in the pre kunark time youd spend a HUGE amount of time in line for an SMR(crowding/rarity). Same thing with Yak, I sold 3 of them for 8-11k. They took forever. Shooting over to the velious era people could get icetooth claws set up for their whole group in a night, which were far more common than yaks dropping both of their prices to 500. Rare vs common simply did this and I don't think decay systems will help much if theyre a dime a dozen anyway. All that decay does is increase the rarity of items on the market and thus the price some. Rarity can be achieved anyway, the lack thereof is due to the game systems. If a decay cycle just means perpetual cast farm fest, then I think it's failed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1822<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 3:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> The problem with it is that casters cant skip spells.

As you can see, melees dont have to go to older world dungeons as the loot has become outdated by better items that are as easy to obtain or MUCH better items they can get a bit later. While casters have to get these spells from Sebilis etc.  <p>Sage Quineloe<br>

Why?  Well, there wouldn't be a lowbie market for mid-level gear.  So, you could raise prices to sell to the &quot;lazy&quot; or unlucky mid-level players who only have their lowby stuff.  Or, you could just sell to the vendors, and totally remove the item.<br>
<br>
NO DROP does this to an extent, except you get no value from selling to a vendor.  <br>
<br>
Mudflation is probably the singe reason why people don't do dungeons (especially mid-level).  I mean, why take the risk of doing a dungeon, when you can cheaply by the same gear in the bazaar, and can instead, go quad for exp? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hibashira>Hibashira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 466<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/03 4:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> I think Dark hit on something here.<br>
<br>
Item decay (in some game) is a mean to take items out of the economy, thus, shoring up the value of new drops of the same item.<br>
<br>
Problem is everyone hates item decay, realistic or not is one thing, having a piece of gear rot away does not contribute to the &quot;fun&quot; factor.  So a turn in quest to 1) make an item No Drop and 2) remove item decay will kill two birds with one stone.<br>
<br>
As for old item pricing falls due to newer better ones dropping, I really have no issue with that.  Besides, if the above can be implemented, even a lot of the better items will be quested and removed from the economy, keeping its value, and slowing the demise of the older items.<br>
<br>
I like that idea.  Good one Dark. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
