<br>
1) Soloing : Normal melees have trouble, casters are better<br>
<br>
2) Grouping : Melee own, caster suxx badly<br>
<br>
3) Raid : Its depends on the mob, overall casters own.<br>
<br>
Get a reality check ......<br>
<br>
Wiz are awesome against some mobs, and good against some<br>
others. The same goes out for melees. <br>
<br>
Velious = Melee Friendly mobs<br>
Luclin = Caster Friendly mobs<br>
<br>
Many casters are limited in their DPS by the inability of melees<br>
to compete with them on agro (raid mobs)<br>
<br>
When i do 20k with primal on I.V and a wiz 59k i doubt he<br>
needs more tuning... <br>
That wiz didnt even have FTs or Rend robe.<br>
<br>
Casters are better for -10min fights.<br>
Melees for +10mins.<br>
<br>
Casters need a big revamp on xp group situation, and maybe a<br>
small push in raid situation. But they are not as desperate as<br>
most of you pretend.<br>

The main reason people want melees over casters is posts like this one that just say &quot;Melee own, caster suxx badly&quot; without providing much support for the declaration.  Wizards have some specific issues, but there are a lot of situations I haven't seen wizard damage logged yet.. for instance a group with an epic wiz and a magician where the magician spends a large amount of extra mana T rodding the epic wiz.  Magician damage output will slow down a bit but will be more than made up for in wizard output.<br>

Now, out of that list of 11,628 grouping possibilities, which doesn't include level, equipment, zone, zone population, mob difficulty, or mob resistance or AC level, nor does it include possibilities for groups smaller than 6 characters, you expect me to be able to comprehend what a &quot;normal&quot; grouping situation is? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 4/17/02 1:11:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mudsquirt>Mudsquirt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/12/02 1:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> My view on class balance: Make every magic(lore)  item, armor, weapon in the game no-drop except to sell to npc merchants when players have upgraded from actually earning or questing for the equipment. This rule should not apply to the basics such as spells, plain armor, and weapons and of course other fundamentals such as food, drink, basic utilities. Give casters an equal oppurtunity to earn good equipment as melees.  This would be a good step in the direction of balancing. Of course it would eliminate twinking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 5198<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/20/02 5:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> &quot;When i do 20k with primal on I.V and a wiz 59k i doubt he<br>

<br>
You're right, level 60 Wizards don't need any work.  Now, about those previous 59 levels....<br>
<br>
Incidentally, Goladus, 'normal' grouping is when you aren't on raids and aren't soloing.  You know, 99% of the game, all semantics aside.  This isn't especially a challenging concept. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/20/02 3:43:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1852<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/20/02 11:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> Recent groups I have been in:<br>
<br>
Mage + warrior + cleric + paladin + bard + rogue in sirens.  High uptime, medium length kills, occaisional nasty effects including one overpull+charm wipeout.  Used right click nuke significantly.. averaged probably 1 click per fight.<br>
<br>
Wiz + Wiz + Enc + Mag + Cler + Bard chardok AE group.  <br>
<br>
Wiz + Mag chilling out killing mobs in the upper chardok tunnel. (Wiz did most of the nuking and pulling.  I made rods and nuked a bit.. pet was also the tank)<br>
<br>
Warrior + Cleric + Druid + Enchanter + Magician + Shadowknight in the hole = Solid crawling group, enchanter didn't really like mezzing and played with charm instead.  I had enough mana to nuke freely.  I wasn't able to make full use of my right click nuke but felt that I was pulling my weight quite well anyway with nukes.<br>
<br>
Magician + Druid vs. Efreeti Lord Djarn = fun, didn't even notice that I got a nice chunk of xp.  Wizard would have been a great 3rd member.. though it probably would have made the crawl trivially easy.<br>
<br>
Bard(53 dinged 54) + Druid(60) + Magician( + c3 in the grey = over 100 kills per hour and average mob lifespan was approx 15 seconds.  great xp, ding 59 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Wizard here would have done nothing but increased kill rate.  In fact, a wizard would probably be the absolute best choice of a fourth class in this situation.<br>
<br>
Exact same grey group plus a Shaman in kael, we crawled from bank to arena and managed to take out some of the outer arena mobs such as Trooper coldstone.  Mobs took minutes to kill, xp was slow and we didn't get lucky with loot, but the fights were really fun and xp was noticeable.  Downtime was fairly large but unavoidable for the group we had, a wizard would have fit in very well and would have had plenty of mana to make our battles much easier.<br>
<br>
Mage + warrior + cleric + monk + shaman + druid in Cazic Thule.  Long fights, no clarity = not very nuker friendly.  Not pet friendly either, and if I hadn't had a right click nuke I would have felt very weak.<br>
<br>
Mage + Cleric + Warrior + Druid in Umbral plains.  Long, long fights, no clarity... low downtime  /hug pet, DS, right click nukes.  Not very nuker friendly situation, though resists were not a big problem at all.  Added another cleric later on(played the role of extra nuker... wizard would have been superior).  Finally added a rogue who made a pretty noticeable difference.<br>
<br>
And that's pretty much it.  Nope, didn't waste any of my time getting killed by random pickup groups in seb or getting into silly fights about spawns at the frenzy in Velketors.  The kind of groups that think there is a &quot;normal&quot; way to do things and that 99% of the game is the same.<br>
<br>
Casters need tuning in some areas.  But lets not overstate the case by trying to oversimplify what it means to be a normal group.  Maybe I'm reading you wrong, but it seems to me that you guys would take that list I just gave and pick out all the most nuker unfriendly scenarios to call 'normal.'...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 4:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> Goladus, it is not that hard to define a normal group.

All but one, the AE group, of the groups you was in fall inside that deffinition. <br>
<br>
The groups with pet as tank fall outside because melees cant join as damagedealers without getting to be tanks. But as you are a magician its not strange that you see more of those then wizards do. In any of those you might as well have been a 'normal' tank instead, except the one with just a wizard. Wizards work well together with magicians, but not all groups a wizard come across comes with a magician included. All groups you are in does obviously.<br>
<br>
Something else to think about is that in none of the groups so would a wizard have done better then you as a magician. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A> at: 5/21/02 8:04:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 5202<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 9:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> &quot;The kind of groups that think there is a &quot;normal&quot; way to do things and that 99% of the game is the same.&quot;<br>

OK aside from a clear attempt at setting yourself up as superior to the plebes who play the game other than you, you're missing the point totally.  A normal group is one that isn't on raids and isn't using AE.  It really is that simple, a group that goes somewhere, kills things one at a time, and gets experience (and perhaps some items).  The composition has nothing to do with this, its a NORMAL Everquest group.  You really are trying to complicate something I'm pretty sure you already understand clearly and simply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1853<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 10:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Goladus, it is not that hard to define a normal group.

And again...  killing one mob at a time with someone tanking is only one part of the strategy..  In some cases, a nuker fits in fine, in others they struggle.  Another point, is that crowd control was not always available..  we had two pulls a couple of times in the umbral group, and a careful wizard would have been able to make great use of Pillar spells, as in order to prevent the healer from getting aggro the warrior had to continually taunt both mobs.  Additionally, hard nuking on one target will serve as rudimentary crowd control and save healer mana.<br>
<br>
Choosing between small pulls and trains is only one strategic decision.  When determining the usefulness of a wizard, the fact that you will be getting single pulls is not the only important thing.<br>
<br>
Other important things:<br>
<br>
Mob hitpoints  (CT vs Grey)<br>
<br>
Mob resistances or immunities  (Dark assassins in umbral have snare immunity, Giants in Kael untunnable.. hole mobs have fairly high nuke resists, Grey mobs resist like.. never)<br>
<br>
Mob damage output  (Grey.. high  Chardok .. average)<br>
<br>
Mob special abilities (Like charm/gfux in sirens,  lifetaps, AE slow, rains, and so on in CT, enragers in Umbral..)<br>
<br>
Mob aggro tendancies (Grey mobs dumb as bricks.. Kael giants a bit more clever)<br>
<br>
Mob AC  (Umbral vs. Kael)<br>
<br>
Crowd control available  (Umbral vs. Grey)<br>
<br>
How much mana regen available?  (Note the grey group had bard song and c3 and potg, while the umbral group had no song and no clarity.. just potg)<br>
<br>
Snare available? (Yes in most cases..)<br>
<br>
Fear kite viable? (Not used)<br>
<br>
Safe camp available?  .. or is a crawl necessary?  (Umbral group had to move several times..  Grey group found an empty spot and pulled continuously)<br>
<br>
Evac available/needed?  Exodus saved CT group's asses.  Needed to get out of the hole..<br>
<br>
Coth available/needed?  Used in CT to get group past some mobs that we didn't want to fight.<br>
<br>
Slow available?  (CT yes, Umbral no)<br>
<br>
Haste available?  (Hole yes, Umbral no)<br>
<br>
Focus items?  (Um yes in all cases hehe... but for a wizard this would be a factor)<br>
<br>
AC of main tank?  (Umbral = awesome, Grey = medium(53 bard tank), Efreeti = ass(pet))<br>
<br>
levels of all members (Don't remember really.. lots of 60s, but of course there are 59 levels before 60 right grim?  Until recently most of my groups have been made up of various levelled people)<br>
<br>
Intensity of group...  (Some groups are just out to have some fun, and aren't going to be chain-pulling endlessly..  Grey vs. Efreeti..  In my experience, the most intense &quot;trinity&quot; groups are no more common than intense AE groups)<br>
<br>
ability to communicate<br>
Someone capable of single pulls?<br>
Chance of mid fight adds?<br>
Mobs undead?<br>
Summoned?<br>
Mobs never run away?<br>
Mobs damage shielded?<br>
<br>
.. you get the picture I hope..  there are just too many factors important to a damage caster to use only the term 'normal' groups to describe your balancing target.<br>
<br>
Differences in strategy do not have to be as drastic as AE group vs. Single pull group.  As was commonly argued, AE groups should not be the basis for wizard balancing, despite their increasing popularity and viability.  Besides...  I only listed one AE group, and there are many different ways to get an AE group to work.. depite the talk of wizards here that ONLY want to be in the most optimal, exploit level AE groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1854<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 10:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> ok...<br>

I can understand your definition of a normal group.  Any group that is not raiding and not counting soloers...<br>
<br>
Fine, but unfortunately, due varying factors such as the ones I listed, we can't just say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) Grouping : Melee own, caster suxx badly<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->or<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Something else to think about is that in none of the groups so would a wizard have done better then you as a magician. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Good point..<br>
<br>
However, in the grey group the pet was not the tank, the bard was.  Even a bard has much better AC than a mage pet, and it saved us a noticeable amount of mana.  I think that a wizard in my situation would have easily been as powerful as myself.  I forget the numbers but this was a session I did log, and I nuked for easily 2x the damage of the epic pet, probably more.  There were a couple of times that my pet did tank while the bard used charm, but I can't really speculate about what a wizard might have done in my place.<br>
<br>
The other groups with a pet tank was the Efreeti and the chardok tunnel.  /shrug I'm told that a level 60 epic wizard with decent equiment can solo Efreeti.  A magician cannot.. runners would kill me.<br>
<br>
In those situations where we had extreme amounts of uptime with low mana regen then yes, I was probably more valuable than a wizard.  Umbral comes to mind..  However, add in a conflag or rend robe and the wizards contribution will be much more respectable.<br>
<br>
The sirens group?  It's hard to say..  The Hole Group?  Also tough to say, probably the epic pet in both cases would set me apart from a wizard...  But to be honest I'm not an exactly fair comparison.  I know far more non-epic mages than epic mages.<br>
<br>
Also... who is to say that I should be the one replaced by a wizard?  In many cases the wizard could substitute for someone else.  For example, the second cleric in our umbral group would have been better off as a wizard, though an enchanter or shaman probably would have been more valuable.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly certian that a wizard would have outdone me in the Cazic Thule group.  My pet damage was absolutely pathetic.  The only things that was really keeping me going was damage shields(and the mobs spent most of the time slowed by a 60 shaman.. so DS damage wasn't even all <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> great) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br>  Posts: 855<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 12:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> I define a conventional group to be any group not focused on AE tactics. I define AE tactics to include PBAoE groups and any quadding (including team quadding). Basically, it's any group that focuses on single target tactics, including single kiting, fear kiting, and the more common pull singles/mez adds approach. Excluding raids is also reasonable, as the goals, tactics, and modes are different enough to warrant a separate analysis. In addition, most raids are multi-group endeavors, and thus falls out of the usual definition of &quot;group.&quot;<br>
<br>
For wizards, the formula is fairly simple: when mana expenditure exceeds mana regeneration, wizard performance starts to lag. Mana expenditure is a function of mana efficiency (dmg/mana) and uptime. Right click nukes also help with damage output, but the value of this is a function of average combat length, click activation time, and damage from the item. My charts show the relationships between these pretty well.<br>
<br>
But the bottom line is pretty much what you would expect: wizards in high uptime conventional groups (which comprise the vast majority of the game as experienced by the vast majority of player) lag and are in need of some balancing. <p>"Evacuate?

<br>
First I would increase casters hps slightly.  Its ridiculously low compared to melees (I know that casters should have the lowest hps of all classes and I don't want them to be tanks, but I still think it's way too low).<br>
<br>
Another problem is spell resistance.  Melees can have equal or greater spell resists with their gear (read: PERMANENT, not buffed) and have awesome AC.  Casters will never even come close to the AC a tank has.  I'm not saying that they should, just trying to show the unbalance here.  Melees can have awesome resists in both areas (spell and melee damage), whereas casters will only be awesome in one.  Not sure what a solution here would be, short of nerfing melee resists (which would probably make them mad).<br>
<br>
Some will argue that we have skin spells.  Sure it provides TEMPORARY defense, but doesn't increase our AC (which reduces the total damage you take) and sucks in a bit of damage.  This is only temporary however, unlike a melees gear which stays with him all the time (unless he dies).<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is removing the 66% damage cap for spell damage and adding a 66% cap to melee's resists for dueling only (so if they had 100FR it would be 66 in a duel situtation).  This way they won't get shafted for end-game encounters with AE, but will balance PvP somewhat I believe. Thoughts? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aniar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1007<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/28/02 1:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> Caster balancing as doaal suggested would do absolutely nothing for PvE caster balance, which is what the first goal of the &quot;caster balance&quot; effort should be.
