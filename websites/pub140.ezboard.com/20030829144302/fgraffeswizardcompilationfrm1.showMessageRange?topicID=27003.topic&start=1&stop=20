<br>
Claud was talking about a separate issue here (this is taken out of context, I'm not picking on you Claud) but it reminded me of a few comments that made me shake my head lately about groups.  Most camps are divided into &quot;Waaah Wizard's SUCK!!!/No YOU suck!&quot;  Lets drop the whines, and the flames and the whole casual vs. Ubah blah blah &lt;insert favorite argument here&gt;.  Instead, lets lay it out -- POLITELY -- in light of the recent EXP and pathing changes.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I have excellent social skills, I DO get groups, I am in a fairly high level guild and am very well equipped.<br>
<br>
Grouping is a problem for one reason and one reason only (and no its not because we can't keep up&quot;, we can).  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Post POP</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, other classes can bring similar DPS in a group situation (non raid) PLUS bring group-friendly extras. Mage's summon items and bring pets for an extra melee, Druids heal and buff, etc... etc...<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is that Wizards have to be on top of their game and go out of their way to try to get groups when a group knows that a Mage can do an equivalent DPS plus this plus that... etc...From a groups perspective it makes sense to look to other classes first.  Human nature. I can't blame them.  A really good wizard, with time and effort will get groups.  Its not that a wizard can't they are just at a slight disadvantage comparatively.<br>
<br>
Does that mean wizards suck?  Nope. We kick ass in certain situations and are generally good in most others.  Its just that SoE has made it so other chasses are more &quot;group friendly&quot;, and thats a fact that -- in some well meaning folks constant attacks against whiners -- often gets ignored.<br>
<br>
So getting a group as a wizzy is not impossible, but it is more difficult now than once before, and it is inherently more difficult than some other classes, specifically post-pop.  150 AA's and solid gear later a wizzy is desirable again at the upper end, but by then grouping isn't such a concern anyway.<br>
<br>
Whats the solution?  Damned if I know.  As long as there were solo opportunities for a wizzy to take advantage of, and he/she could get enough AA's and such that they reached that upper end and became &quot;OMG we HAVE to get soandso&quot;, I never worried too much.  Now that soloing has essentially been struck down again and more emphasis on groups?  Well grouping is better, but we are no more group friendly now than we were then.<br>
<br>
Its primarily only a problem for the 55-61 with little to no AA crowd, but its a real issue. Ubers (sadly that seems to be me as well according to newbies) may not notice frankly, but the lil to mid-size wizzys definitely do.  And for you &quot;I haven't played since POP but still like to give my opinion crowd&quot;... trust me, its changed.  Not too much, but yes some, and not for the better.<br>
<br>
If they reset the pathing in some of the old solo areas to what it was just before the last patch I wouldn't mind.  Id just say, &quot;Suck it up and quad some more young'un&quot;.  But as that and the grouping exp changes have come to be?  Sony does need to address the issue, for the general CLASS if not you and me specifically.  <br>
<br>
How?  /shrug  ...maybe increased crits/increased procs/increased ATK to a group when a wizzy is in it and has his familiar up.  I've always liked that idea.  Hell make it so it affects everyone BUT the wizard, I don't care -- its not about US its about us in a GROUP.  Or just share some of the familiar benefits we get to the group we join.  Something simple yet creative as opposed to becoming a buff casting class would be preffered. A little, but visible thing like that would be all thats needed.<br>

hehe my favorite line<br>
<br>
well honestly i think social skills and a little bit of not so common sense can get you a group faster than aa and gear .the only problem is that a lot of the people that had social skills have left the game and more and more DOODS are playing .<br>
<br>
granted i have lots of aa on all my characters and know the game very well and am a funny guy but if i didnt have the aa and the game knowledge i could still get groups just by being patient and polite . its amazing how many people whine but have never actualy tried being polite OR patient and think the world should be handed to them on a platter just cause ...<br>

<br>
Draughts have boosted wizard damage output decently.<br>
<br>
Agnarr's Thunder isn't too difficult to get for anyone that can get groups in a tier 3 zone such as BoT.  Even for those that can't, 6k plat isn't a lot to pay in Bazaar for a 2305 damage spell.<br>
<br>
I havn't really focused on the low to mid level game, or even the 51 to 59 game where there are still a number of issues that could be addressed, but look at what's happened in the game....<br>
<br>
Focus 3 items are NOT hard to get for anyone in a guild.  As a result, even without the PoP spells, wizards can do more damage than we could before.  The AA abilities are available and boost both short term and long term damage output.  Flowing thoughts items are also more available than they used to be.  Horses are available which allow for  mana regen, even while casting a spell and avoid the sit agro we used to deal with.<br>
<br>
Again, the 51 to 59 range will be the most difficult, but it's less of a problem than it was.  Twinking of melees still provides a lot more power for melees, so this is an area that needs to be improved.<br>
<br>
*shrug* People will always complain, there are many things about the game that need work(like to reitemize Kunark and Velious to drop items fairly for all classes for example), but aside from that, wizards at 63+ with AA points are probably where we should be.  We can drop those big blasts(breaking 4k crits with Agnarr's for example), spell casting mastery to extend our mana pool, draughts increase our regular damage output for fast-kill groups, etc.   <br>
<br>
Most players have started to assume that wizards have a good level of damage output, even those that don't.  As a result, groups have become easier to get from my own observations.<br>

Heh, if only that was true. One thing that is overlooked though is that many classes barring Tanks, Clerics, Chanters, and shamans have a hard time finding groups. It's not just wizards. <p>Sorceress of the Rathe<br>

I did get several unsolicted tells to help with trials on wizard actually more than cleric. People lilke wizards for raids or trials or epic fights (which is really a raid. )In groups we bring nothing cept damage and you can get other classes for damage. Guilds, freinds are the exception<br>
<br>
I was in a 5 person group on my cleric that did not want to add a wizard because it would take away xp. In those instances i think a wizard would be welcome now that XP is not changed when  you add a 6th. <br>
<br>
I think that most people do not realize how much faster mobs can be killed with a wizard. To this day when i get a large crit  people go whoah and sometimes it not much more than the base damage of the spell. They really dont know how much DPS we are doing. Otherwise if they want a caster Wiz falls after enchanter, mage and necro in that order. Melee usually even prefer shaman as the slower over enchanter since shamans makes the melee stats better <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sardonus>Sardonus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 10:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Agnarr's Thunder isn't too difficult to get for anyone that can get groups in a tier 3 zone such as BoT.

<br>
Heh must be nice to be on that server. AT is still pushing the 15k range still on my server. Additionally, most people that are in BoT hoard spec drops so they can do turn-ins for the high ticket spells to resell. AT isn't nearly common or easy to get for the average person on my server imo. Only way I have it is I was willing to bite the bullet and pay a buttload of cash to get it. Alot of wizards can't/won't do that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Focus 3 items are NOT hard to get for anyone in a guild. As a result, even without the PoP spells, wizards can do more damage than we could before. The AA abilities are available and boost both short term and long term damage output. Flowing thoughts items are also more available than they used to be. Horses are available which allow for mana regen, even while casting a spell and avoid the sit agro we used to deal with.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess your definition of &quot;not hard&quot; and &quot;more available&quot; are different than mine. Then again, perhaps this is true on your server. Focus 3 items are still tough to get as most guilds aren't going to want to spend the time farming a zone for one drop that is going to be out-dated by 61 anyways. From what I can see, most people that are going to get focus3 items anymore are either going to buy it themselves for alot of cash or have some really really good friends that don't mind wasting many nights farming for a drop. Me personally, I wouldn't even bother asking my friends to do that for me.<br>
<br>
I consider one ft1 item to be commonly available. Anything other than that I don't consider &quot;more available&quot; at all. Aside from the solstice earring, bout every other ft item that is droppable sells for at minimum 50k on my server. Sure money is easier to come by now than it ever used to be but still....most people dont' have that kind of cash and don't have guilds capable/willing to do those encounters.<br>
<br>
Having said all that, I agree whole-heartedly with the following quote: <br>
<br>
&quot;wizards at 63+ with AA points are probably where we should be.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's just a shame to me that due to melee twinking we are largely sub-par before 51 and really only average in dps up to about the point quoted. I remember pre-PoP, alot of wizards said level 60 was when wizards really came into their own and the game got fun again. By the time I hit 60, PoP was out and I got to miss all the &quot;fun&quot; part of it. Once I got AT, though, things really started to look up. At 65 with SoS and about 30 AA and I really feel I'm finally at a point where I can contribute to a group consistently without causing down time. To me, we should be able to do this from the beginning, just as all the other classes should/can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andraelarcaneumrunner>Andrael Arcaneumrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Hand Of<BR>The Cabal (tm)!!!</span><br>  Posts: 1915<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 11:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have NO idea what game you've been playing, but wizards in the 61+ range with a decent number of AA points do NOT have a problem getting groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have no idea what post you read.  It wasn't mine.  Did I say 61+ wizzys with AA's have problems?  Nope.  try reading it again without assuming its yet another rehash of the old arguement.  In other words, how about we try very hard NOT to turn this into the &quot;Waaaah!!! vs &quot;you guys just su&gt;&lt;0rs if U cant get a group&quot;, cause that is NOT what this is.<br>
<br>
Also, its NOT about the DPS possible, or the mana regen, or the awesome &quot;burst&quot; dps we are capable of (that makes us hell on wheels for POP boss mobs)... its about sustained grouping and what benefits different characters bring to a group.  With the damage mudflation, other classes can equal an average/non uber wizards sustained group DPS and theres nothing much wrong with that...BUT they also bring other &quot;group-friendly&quot; things to the table.  I dont think we need some awesome overbalancing power shift so much as a creative group friendly aspect for an offset to the fact that lots of folks can bring close DPS now, but I cant give a mod rod, focus 4 items, send in my pet, charm a frog to tank for the group or Cheal or buff the group etc... Not that Id want to do those things, but they do have value in grouping.<br>
<br>
Our stuff? Evac? Bah GY's remove the timekill of the old dreaded CR.  all the rest of our spells others classes have plus other group friendly ones... OK we have ports. So does everyone else with POK.  /shrug the game changes, and characters have changed with it.<br>
<br>
Wizards though still primarily just bring damage and we are very good at it.  Others are too now however, and though some are not quiiiiiiite to our level. they are close enough for a groups need -- PLUS &quot;group-friendly&quot; as a class.  Its the &quot;group friendly&quot; aspect that could use some tinkering.  Thats the point and that is what I'ld like to see addressed now that Group EXP&gt;all and soloing != the solid alternative it once did.<br>
<br>
Please note the complete lack of a whine, any whine you see is in your own mind and Id suggest therapy.<br>

The problem is more<br>
1) Can you get the same xp rate as a tank,healer,slower combo. The tank and heal method is very effiecent with mana.<br>
ie assisting melee and pets don't require any mana to do their damage and CH is very effective.<br>
Perhaps if the yellow bar had more of an effect on damage output and decrease faster things might be similar.<br>

Only reason wizards don't get groups is because we are usually in the 5th-6th slot.<br>
<br>
I can only get groups in Plane of Earth these days. If I go to any other zone I'm likely to fall asleep before I get a group.<br>
<br>
In most places a group needs :<br>
<br>
A tank - WAR PAL SHD<br>
A cleric.<br>
A slower - SHM ENC BRD<br>
A puller - MNK, SHD, NEC, RNG, BARD<br>
<br>
these first 4 slots usually need to be taken up before a group can start making safe XP and that doesn't leave much room for everyone else.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a group will need an evacer and I believe this gives us a slight advantage over other classes.<br>
<br>
Truth of the matter I believe is that if there were more clerics and slowers around there would be more groups being made and more chances for wizards to get a group. Most of the times I fail to put a group together it is usually because of a lack of clerics/slowers.<br>

The other day I was looking for a group with my wizard and sitting in PoT with LFG on but then I wasn't the only one a number of people were.  And you know what I used the LFG tool to see if any groups were looking for people and every group listed that was looking for a 6th person already had a wizard and there were I think 3 or 4 listed.  I eventualy got a group after a bit of sitting.<br>
<br>
Most groups I see have a wizard in them, I'm thinking ECI is just wizard heavy.<br>
<br>
But like has been mentioned were not the only ones that have a hard time looking for groups.  I've noticed rogues on my server tend to and also druids necros even mages are in a similar boat.<br>
<br>
Though making our familiars affect the entire group as long as we are in the group would add a &quot;Group Desirability&quot; affect to wizards that would make them more desirable on average.  Yeah we rock in groups right now and can do a great job at most levels with the changes SoE has made but the &quot;Noticable and Visable&quot; desirability factor isn't there.  Most people see wizards and think.....damage, they don't care what or how much or how fast, its just added damage to them when exp is concerned.  The stuff we do dosn't get that noticed accept ocasionaly or by those watching for it and know were good at what we do.  Most desired classes have something that gets noticed because its a needed essential.  Like meat sheild so im not taking damage, or healer so that funny red bar goes in a positive direction. <br>
<br>
So making familiar affect all in group would help cause people to think differently when deciding to get that LFG wizard or not.  They would think more, humm regen resists mana and stuff for everyone.  Instead of just that guy does damage but so does this class 01 over here LFG.  Heck what group wouldn't want a free extra +4 mana regen to everyone that stacked with everything without casting spells with an increased casting skill on all casters in group decreased fizzle rate increased resists on everyone in group that can't be dispelled and stacks with everything and extra mana.  And thats just with Greater familiar.<br>
<br>
Though if we did get any sort of change like this that made us slightly more group friendy then all the other classes out there that also have a hard time getting pick up groups you know those classes will cry bloody murder and beg for something and then we'll be right back were we are fighting for that 6th spot with the rest of them.<br>
<br>
The problem isn't so much less group desirability as is game geared for 6 man groups a cetain group style being the most affective and 12 classes to fill those 6 slots.  Since a certain group style is most affective wich almost always includes 3-4 of the same certain classes the other 8-9 classes are left to fight for the last 2-3 slots in every group.  And of course everyone wants the most affective group so there going to take the perceived best classes to fit those slots for the perceived best exp grind group.<br>
<br>
Untail the perception on what the ideal esp group is changes, group desirability for the 6th slot filler classes wont change without making one of them more desirable then the other thus unfairly hurting the others as well.<br>
<br>
How much would we hate it if some other class that we compete with for that 6th slot got a big group bonus to make them more desirable then us???<br>
<br>
All in all I think we have to learn to live with our lot in life of being highly desired in raids and good at soloing and slightly desired in groups depending on server perception. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=athousandyoung>AThousandYoung</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 1:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> An anti Gate spell...&quot;Elnerick's Dimensional Barrier&quot; would be nice.<br>
<br>
FAST DPS is our thing...maybe allow us to maintain a consistent DPS maybe a little less than a Mage or better but then give us mana hog spells in addition that do damage FAST but with little efficiency.  For example...level 51 spell that does Draught of Fire damage 1.5x-2x in the same casting time (3 seconds) but costs 2-4x the mana.  This way we are a sort of crowd control that KILLS stuff FAST when needed.  That's always been my biggest strength as a nuker, whether Mage or Wiz.<br>
<br>
More interesting nukes would be good too...maybe crappy AEs that don't break mez but are still better than a nuke if you hit enough targets, or a spell that puts a one shot nuke proc on the MT's weapon kinda like Rogue poison or in some other way adds aggro to the MT by coming out of him instead of the Wiz...maybe a nuke or AE that goes off when he's hit, kinda like a one shot damage shield.<br>
<br>
We are supposed to be masters of perception.  Maybe a spell that lets us see auras, allowing us to tell what dots and buffs are on a mob, and how much mana it has left, what level it is exactly etc.<br>
<br>
Mystical translocation is also in our sphere of influence supposedly.  Spells that give Ranger arrows greater range by porting them to the target, or spells that &quot;summon&quot; a mob back to the tank and roots it there (Rooting is also supposedly a Wiz thing) or spells that banish a mob away from the party (crowd control).<br>
<br>
I think I like the high damage mana hog spells the best.  Those would be brutal on PvP servers though! <p>Caffron, Wizard of &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/bsanctuslumen" target="top">Sanctus Lumen</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt;, the Good team PK guild.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etelka>Etelka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 597<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 1:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> I agree with the original poster.<br>
As for a possible solution.... right now we're fighting with a few other classes for a piece of the same pie (the 5th and 6th group slot). <br>
Increasing our chances for getting a piece of that pie doesn't really sound fair to me, because we already have an advantage over the competition when it comes to raiding and soloing. As has been said: we already ARE a pretty powerful class, just a bit less powerful in groups.<br>
<br>
Also, that people perceive rogues as &quot;somewhat better for groups&quot; doesn't bother me all that much. Most sane people, when forming a group, are simply going to fill the needed slots first: tank, healer, slower, and after that they'll just look for &quot;DPS&quot;, and whatever DPS-class is LFG at that moment will get a place. Of course, one wizard being LFG at exactly the same moment as 2 rogues, when all 3 of them are also of the same level and reputation, *might* have to wait a bit longer, but I've never been in a group that needed one more DPS-er, and turned down a DPS-class just to wait a few hours until the &quot;ideal&quot; group-DPS-class shows up. It doesn't work that way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what I'm much more interested in, is increasing the group size from 6 to 7 people. That way, the pie that us pure DPS-ers are competing for is suddenly 50 percent larger. That should take a lot of pressure away for all parties involved. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~tom.van.der.veen/Sig-custom.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yeldareyugami>Yeldare Yugami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 1:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> Was gonna make a new thread but i thought this would be an appropriate place for what i wanna say...<br>

My friend was in an inner group and they had an open spot, and my friend asked if I (65 wizzy) could join. This dude (who was the lowest level in the group, they even had another monk in the group who was lvl 65) would not let me join. Instead they got a 63 rogue. My friend (the cleric) was pissed at this...and because of his anger he somehow slipped up and caused a wipeage. Anyway, Im on the Luclin server so feel free to log on anytime and tell this guy he needs to die.<br>
<br>
In these tells that i sent him we went on to talk about how monks are better because they are constant damage and have other uses. He also said that wizard damage sucks unless they have crack. All he kept saying were wizzys suck for xp grind. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I still get groups, Im in a great guild that likes to help eachother out with that kind of thing, so i get the hookups. But still, this guy is a dumbass and i have to admit, their are probably a lot more people like him. I just feel that wizards need something to show these people that they are utterly wrong...I dont know what...but we need to be proven in the eyes of idiots like this that we are great in some way.<br>

<br>
3 classes can tank. You have to have a war/pal/shk a traditional group.<br>
1 class can heal buff and ress. Clerics are needed.<br>
3 classes can effectivly slow. you need a sha/cha/bst in PoP.<br>
<br>
Every other class (wiz,rog,mnk,dru,mag,nec,brd,rng) is left in the DPS role. And you dont actually NEED any of them if you have the first 3 you are sorted.<br>
<br>
Ok, of thouse eight classes theres some variety in ability, the exact amount of DPS you gain for each one can be argued to be better worse. But lets face it, any one who gives a shit is a cretin, you just want some extra DPS now.<br>
<br>
Situationally sometimes you end up needing one of thouse eight classes to do something. (Evac, harmony, lockpick, CoH, track, ect, ect.) but again its rare, most of PoP can be safely pulled by a warrior from what i have seen. most of what can't a pally or Shk can easily do.<br>
<br>
Now that means there are three tiers of Group friendyness.<br>
Clerics, Teir 1, required with no competition.<br>
Other Holy trinity classes, teir 2, needed with two other classes in competition.<br>
The rest. not needed, seven other classes in competition.<br>
<br>
Were in the bottem band, which sucks. But so are the majority of other classes, and i really do not think we are lagging in that pack of eight. If anything we arer doing rather well. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95533"><b>Jadrax Darkfire</b></a><br>

An example: it's true that a shadowknight only has competition from 2 other classes for that tank slot, but what is not true, is that he isn't competing for the remaining slots. After all, have you never been in a group with a pally and an SK, or a chanter and a shaman? <br>
Happens to me quite often. <br>

This is highly situational.  For the record, I'd kill to have more wizards in my groups and raids.  Their variety of nukes is simply superior, hands down.<br>

Back to your point, I agree.  To an xp group I am just dps, and intechangeable with many other classes.<br>

<br>
Just a quick thought off the top of my head, maybe lower mobs chances to resist stuns from our spells or slightly reduce the recast time. Maybe a stun spell with minimal DD but better stun (harder to resist or longer lasting etc)<br>
<br>
The groups I am in are often surprised when one of the first spells i drop is some small nuke which has a stun component. And it is group friendly, stops the tanks getting hit for a while so they are happier and as a result requires slightly less work from the healers so they are happier.<br>
<br>
Also handy in those panic situations when a healer/enchanter pulls agro on one of several mobs if I can stun it for a few seconds giving the healer/enchanter enough time to move and the tanks enough time to regain agro.<br>
<br>
Dont know how commonly stuns are used in the higher end game but up til now for myself (level 39) theyve always been pretty handy. With Tishans clash and Thunderstrike I can keep a mob stunned for about 1/3 to 1/2 of a fight and if the tank is doing a good job I can still drop my bigger nukes without worrying too much about pulling agro. (Also Tishans clash is so small I can drop it almost at the start of the fight without any worry for agro but the fight effectively starts with everyone getting a few free shots in whilst the mob just stands there) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A
