Well, one idea that will meet with a mixed response is as follows:<br>
<br>
The idea is that right now, every protection spell in the game is cast, either increases our hit points by XX amount for YY mana, lasts a duration, then is gone.  The problem with this is that in a battle, that really doesn't help THAT much, especially if we die without spending all our mana.  So, a new type of shielding that would be caster only is one thing that would be nice.<br>
<br>
Spell name: Magic shield of protection<br>
Classes: Wizard Magician Necro<br>
Mana cost to cast: 1<br>
Duration: 60 minutes or until dispelled<br>
Description: <br>
Through the use of the caster's power, an invisible wall of force that is powered by the caster's mana is created around the caster.  The wall will absorb all types of damage, but in so doing, will drain the caster's mana at a rate of 1 point of mana for each 10 points of damage the caster would have taken, until the caster is out of mana, at which time the effect will end.<br>
<br>
<br>
This spell would aid the casters where if we do agro a mob, we won't go down.  Even in the event of a train, this would allow the caster to run and escape since the effect would stop stuns as well.  It has the disadvantage that the caster WILL go out of mana quickly if he/she does not work to avoid damage.  It has enough of a negative impact in combat where it can't be used to make the casters TOO powerful(you can't just stay in the middle of 5 mobs attacking without going out of mana quickly), but it would also allow the caster to evac a group.  The other aspect is that this spell WOULD allow the evac, but by the time the evac is finished casting, if you have gone too low in mana, you may not be able to cast it anymore.  I feel this would be a very valid compromise.  Now, Necromancers would use their power over life energy to cast this spell, magicians would use elemental energy(non-damage shield) to power theirs, and wizards would use pure energy.  Enchanters already have AoE mezz and stun, so they need this type of spell less than the other pure casters.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's one spell idea and it will get it's share of people who don't like it, but others will probably love the idea.  My next idea may meet with less resistance.<br>
<br>
Skill name: capture energy<br>
Classes: Wizard<br>
Level first available: 34<br>
Description: <br>
The wizard is a master of magical energies, and this allows them to harvest the magical energy around them.  Over time, this ability will capture some of the magical energy of others as it is spent, without being able to drain it directly from other spellcasters.  The ratio of magical energy spent by others to magic gained will increase as the wizard gains more of an understanding of magic.  Since this skill is useless without other spellcasters being near, it will not be very useful in a solo situation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, both of these would improve the wizard class.  The skill I have in mind isn't mana regeneration in the normal sense, and neither of these ideas would increase damage output directly.  If other classes have the ability to regain mana through various means(Shaman, Necro, enchanter), and we DO have the ability though harvest to capture passive magical energy with the harvest spell, then it makes sense that we could absorb active magical energy as well.<br>

<br>
First spell:<br>
Nice idea, would help is be wanted in groups, but we would then do that and ONLY that in a group or raid, because we would either go oom real fast or the group would want us to save mana. So it aint gonna work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Second spell:<br>
Didnt really understand what you meant by this, but i think its somehting like, if we are grouped with a pure caster we get +1mana per tick, and if 2 pure casters +2mana per tick or something i donno. This too is also a good idea, but if i understood it right, it wouldnt work very well either simply because at most groups only have 1 pure caster, its very rare to find 2 of them, and groups wont take 2 pure casters simply to help the wizzie get more mana. Level 34 wouldnt work since we get Harvest at that lvl <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  mabye 39 or 44?<br>

Perhaps instead of the second one there could be more of a Mana Tap type of a spell where you actually drain your target of mana and add it to yourself?  I mean, it wouldn't be an earth-shattering effect, it would cost little and you wouldn't get a whole lot back, and then it wouldn't be necessary to have that stun from Harvest.<br>
<br>
Just a though. <p><br>

<br>
The second idea sounds really good.  A self-shield that gives us a mana burst every time someone in our group casts a spell at lower levels and for every time a nasty (nasty sounds better than mob) at higher levels.  It's not overpowering if soloing since we'd have nobody casting in our group and most people don't quad kite casters.  Of course, I'm all up for stealing the manatap enchanters have at L51. Theft of Thought, for ourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=artillis>Artillis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/14/01 5:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Two more ideas for how to improve wizards</span><hr size=1> I like an Idea thats on the Class balancing page of this site.

It lets us protect ourselves from ALL attacks through the use of our mana, this would include stuns.  In a raid situation, this would only drain us if we over-agro the mob, if we hold back on nukes, and avoid agro, we don't have our mana drained out(since we arn't being hit).  If we are fighting Velketor, and are toe to toe with him, well, we nuke once, and we may get hit, if we get hit three times for 700 damage each, that's 3 times 70 damage, or 210 mana would go poof QUICK, which would lower our mana, and stop us from nukeing fully.  But, we wouldn't die, so that's the trade-off.<br>
<br>
Now, the second idea, it takes some of the mana expended by all casters in a set radius(or perhaps a radius based on the wizard's level), and gives it freely to the wizard.  Consider it like harvest, but grabbing the mana as it's being expended by others and claiming it as your own.  It doesn't DRAIN mana, but if a spell takes 400 mana, and is cast by the mob, or another player, we may get anywhere from four to fourty mana suddenly ending up in our mana bar as a freebie.  It's not stealing it, it's just takeing some of the free energy out there.  <br>
<br>
Mana drain, which hurts the target, is not the sort of thing the wizard class should be doing, but if an enchanter casts a spell, there's always going to be some magical energy released into the world that doesn't go into the spell.  It's that energy that the wizards could be tapping in a radius around him/her.  It just seems that unless you fight a spellcasting mob when solo, that you get no benefit from this SKILL(not spell) when isolated away from others, but in a multi-player environment(raid or group), the wizard benefits, which would translate into more nukes that helps the group.<br>
<br>
If I'm still not clear, I'll try it again, but both of these were put together with balance in mind.  Not super-strong, but they touch on what wizards do, and expand on it.<br>

<br>
I envision the mighty wizard in the face of a terrible onslaught, the breath of a dragon blasting down apon him...death seems certain. The blast erupts from the open maw of the great lizard attempting to roast him. The flames shoot downward and divide, parting around the Wizard. The Wizard's face taunt with concentration, a bubble of calm surrounds him in the middle of the maelstrom. The Dragon's feirce punishment is not felt, but our mighty Wizard is nearly drained of his magical energy. Smoking slightly around the egdes, the wizard emerges unscathed, but a tad charred...<br>

There is a line of wizards, each with an agro stick. (SoTF at lower levels, dunno what at higher levels)  first one steps up, get's the agro via manaless agrostick, Epic shield, whatever. Hit with one really big blast, then begins a gate spell, GFay prolly. Gate out while taking the damage, sits to regen mana.<br>
Next, Agro stick, cast a really big nuke, etc... takes the agro, starts casting Fay gate...<br>
repeat previous process. At some point the last wizzy will just be chain casting like mad to try to get the agro, but it seems that this could be exploided pretty well...<br>
<br>
Second idea:<br>
How about a special shield that sucks the energy via partial/total resists of a particular type. (you have to cast the appropriate element, etc..) If you are ever pushed over 100m you take feedback damage.<br>

If you cast out with 8 draughts, that's 1720 mana, half your amount, and we are looking at quad 250 damage and up mobs in Velious for the big encounters.  True, perhaps the 10 damage to 1 mana is a bit too much, perhaps cut that in half, but it's the idea that I'm looking at, which is using mana to avoid all damage and to be able to always cast through ANYTHING if you have the mana for it.  It's really an issue to balance the first idea.  That idea about using agro, then people gateing out, that doesn't make sense based on how you explained it.<br>
<br>
Now, the second idea, to be able to scoop up mana from other spellcasters, the amount of mana you absorb would need to be balanced out as well, perhaps with a cap on how fast we could get mana back with the skill, but it's also something that could easily be tuned, and would add to the class.<br>

I think that's the aspect you missed here Fusion, if you choose to use this, you give yourself protection, but at the expense of being able to cast other spells.  If you DO cast other spells, you lower your ability to avoid that damage through your magical protection.  <br>
<br>
This idea is completely different from any spell currently in the game since it is similar to a normal skin spell, but has the cap based on your CURRENT mana, not based on your mana at the time of the casting.  If you have this up, then start chain nukeing down to 20 percent mana(perhaps 600 mana tops), that means you only have 600 mana worth of protection left.  Now, IF you do this, normally you might be able to evac, but if the mob is beating on you, you won't have the 600 mana available, and by the time your evac spell goes off, you won't have the mana left to cast the evac, and you just got your party killed since you can't evac anymore.<br>
<br>
Now, 600 mana at 5 to 1, that's your 3000 damage protection.  Being able to take this additional 3000 damage MIGHT be enough to survive the rest of a nasty encounter, even if the mobs are agroed to you and the rest of your group is alive, but it won't GIVE you a lot since again, casting spells will take away from your ability to stay alive.  Mobs at the higher levels ALL hit for a minimum of 85 damage per hit except for some mobs in Plane of Mischief.  Too powerful?  I really don't think so, it's all a matter of ballance.  If every spell you cast removes some of your ability to defend yourself, then all the better, it's balanced.  It might not be a GOOD idea in places where the mobs AoE, and the mana drain would remove our effectiveness, but for group hunting, this would make us more desired.<br>
