However there is one area where I believe I have been mislead.  <br>
<br>
I have been playing a warrior now for 12 levels, and I've got to say that it's a lot harder than I thought it would be!  So I started looking into the issue a little deeper.  Now I haven't climbed high enough in levels to really have a strong opinion on the matter, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I gotta say that I'm not so offended by the melee upgrades any more.  I think the complaints of warrior just might have some merit.  I think the real issue is item inbalance and not class inbalance.  Sure my wizard felt useless next to a warrior hitting for big damage, and barely being scratched by the mobs we were fighting, while I spent all my time medding just trying to keep up.  However now that I've played a warrior I realize that the only reason this was the case was due to twinking.  As an un twinked warrior I get my butt handed to me on a regular basis.  <br>
<br>
I have no means of escape whatsoever, and it only gets worse at higher levels, when greens can give you a beat down too.  A green might be able to beat down a wizard too, but only if he's oom!  Otherwise root, and run, or gate, etc.  If you're a warrior, you either have a sow potion or you are SOL!  You can't run fast, you can't root, you can't gate, you can't do anything, but fight and hope you win, or run for zone, and hope you make it.  God forbid you die and have to cross a hostile zone.  You have no invis to hide, can't defend yourself, and you can't outrun anybody.  I'd rather be a dead wizard on a CR, than a warrior any day of the week!  In fact I'd rather be ANY other class on a CR than a warrior!  This goes for the whining hybrids as well!  I'm told they have only a few hundred less hp at high levels, and access to gear that is nearly equivalent in AC!  What's the point of giving up all those spells to be a warrior anyway?  Just so you can take one or two more hits before you die?  <br>
<br>
I've got quite a few levels to go, before I can pass judgement, but I have to say that I'm viewing the world of Norrath from a completely new perspective.  Anyone here complaining that wizards are underpowered compared to melee should walk in their shoes before they open their mouth.  Not saying you haven't, and you're certainly entitled to your opinion if you have, and still feel that way, but I'd be willing to bet that a good number of you haven't played a warrior, while denouncing them as over powered.  A warrior is his gear, and as we all know the best gear in this game isn't all that easy to get.  Wizards certainly have issues, and could use all the enhancements that I hope SOL will bring, but you won't catch me chiming in on the warriors should be nerfed crud any more!<br>
<br>
Please don't flame me for this, as I stated I haven't played either class to high levels, and claim to be anything but an authority on the matter.  However, I just wanted to point out that things aren't always what they seem, and we should all try to keep an open mind when it comes to addressing the complaints of each class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 2425<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> Tanks definitely need magic items.

That doesn't really negate what's been said though, they have been enormously upgraded and Wizards have had no change over the same level range with each expansion.  Thus, there's a problem here, since most people (everyone who was there at the time at least) agree that Wizards and melee were pretty well balanced BEFORE the expansions.<br>
<br>
I play a Rogue, Warrior, and Paladin in addition to my Wizard (plus a bard), and believe me I know what they can do and can't do.

<br>
Well, TWINK your warrior nicely.<br>
<br>
Fungi tunic, multiquest some Velious armor with him (ever saw a level 8 Warrior running around in full Kael armor? Aye, yes, yes, yes that ix possible, hehehe)<br>
<br>
Get him some better weapons.<br>
<br>
Now he will trash stuff at your level in tears. He will do this untill level 40ish. Downtime is not that bad with the correct equip.<br>
<br>
Ohh and btw those 'melee upgrades' only affect level 51 plus Meleers and not your level 12 warrior (if you are reffering to the latest melee upgrade).<br>
A lot changes at level 51 plus.<br>
<br>
All those nice Kunark and Velious weapons were meant to be on high level tanks, but they go of course as well to low level twinks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulinxs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Linxs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> this is not a flame or anything.....<br>

If you're going to twink your warrior with kael armor quests then I'm going to twink my wizard with a tola robe for haste, and all the HP/AC I can get.<br>
<br>
This guy is talking about 1-27.<br>
<br>
Between 1-20 my wiztank: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14604">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=14604</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
will be as good or better at taking damage than similarly levelled melees.  He'll be able to deal damage via melee with his smoldering brand and haste.<br>
<br>
So.. I can basically be as good of a tank as the game originally intended, except that I can root at will and cast powerful damage spells.<br>
<br>
Yet you'll complain that this isn't enough, that wizards <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> also</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, because some warrior somehow managed to get to ally faction with kael before level 20, and has insanely high AC, wizards <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> also</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need to do 10% more damage with their spells.  This is against mobs that are already too weak to kill him, because of all the hp and ac gear he is wearing and because of the spells he can cast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukazzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kazzap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> heheh<br>

The majority of the eq population doesn't have a lvl 60 caster that can farm twink equipment or plats to buy all the killer equipment.<br>

I would totally agree with Padimar on this - pre50 the problems with balance are not with class abilities but with equipment. Melee classes are impacted FAR more than caster classes by their equipment. Although I would bet a baby wizard with 200 INT and 200+ mana would tear it up pretty well too. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor Kilbringer</b></a><br>Evoker of the 58th Conclave<br><span style="font-size: 10px">Vini, Vidi, Nuki</b><br>

Warriors are really a group class, if you play one, you need a group to do just about anything...unless your supper twinked out...<br>
<br>
On the flip side, take a lvl 50 warrior and a lvl 50 wizard into Sollusek A, I think you will find the wizard having lots of problems from greens, but not the warrior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unatanmagus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 618<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> It really depends on the server.<br>

On Mith Marr (one of the older servers) you really don't meet an untwinked low level Meleer.<br>
Most Meleers are heavily twinked. And heavily twinked does not mean Ykeshas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 3558<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> So would you say that a tank that twinks with gear that your level 27 Wizard can get in those places would be no more effective than the Wizard?  That the effect of this gear on the tank would be not more than the Wizard?  You and I both know that is absurd.  The effect of equivalent level items on a Wizard as on a melee class is tremendously different.  Slapping a high damage low delay weapon in a level 1 Warrior's hand will make him instantly rip things up horribly, a Wizard cannot use these weapons (anything that might be like that for a caster is no drop), and their spells will never, ever, EVER do more than their set formula under any circumstances, no matter what gear you put on them.<br>
<br>
Further, you can try to equal a melee class' AC and even hit points, and you STILL won't be as safe as they are because of several factors.  <br>
1) Wizards don't even HAVE dodge until level 22, melee get it in the first 10 levels.<br>
2) Wizards get 3 points of defense per level, melee get 5, with warriors an additional 5 points.<br>
3) Warriors get Parry at level 10 and Riposte at level 25, neither of which a Wizard has.<br>
4) Try to put a flowing thought item on a level 27 Wizard.  Now choose any one of the many hp regen items out there for the Warrior types, few of which a Wizard can even wear.<br>
<br>
I understand what you are trying to say, but I see you again and again trying to downplay the effect of twinking in the game, as if you can twink a caster as effectively, easily, and cheaply as you can a melee class.  And that's patently false. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 12:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> At the low levels, warriors are nicely balanced against casters given level appropriate gear.  Up to level 10, a warrior with rusty weapons and leather armor is going to have a rough go of it, and will still suffer wipeouts when grouped from time to time.<br>
<br>
However, on older servers, any player that has a clue can self twink from scratch with little trouble. Higher level players, flush with cash, pay a premium for items lower level characters naturally harvest (bat wings, bone chips, and spider silks). On new servers, players just don't have a chance to acquire cash like they do on older servers.  The second part of the equation is the falling prices of highly available weapons in the level 40 range.  You can easily find a Frozen Longsword (7/26, magic 1hs) or it's equivalent for sale in the 20-50p range from other players.  Compare this to a rusty longsword at 5/35.  That's roughly double the damage output.<br>
<br>
There is simply no equivalent for a caster.  Yes, you can twink out a caster heavily to make him a decent tank at the early levels, but you can always twink out a tank better with equivalent funds.<br>

Any haste items are still out of range for any pre-40 player unless they are a die-hard trader or ebay-twink themselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  However, the main point I am trying, unsuccessfully, to make, is that due to the number and diversity of players at the lower levels, and the relative strength of mobs versus the players, that the comparison of the strength of one particular twink to another does not matter as much as the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  direct</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> comparison between that character and the mobs he is facing.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If there is a player-competitive argument to be made, you must set up fair conditions under which to compare.  This poster is talking about up to level 27, and is observing the travel related hardships that most warriors this level face.  You can't arbitrarily give a warrior tboots and kael armor and compare him to a wizard a fishbone necklace and a rusty dagger.  <br>
<br>
Yes, melee twinking is more effective than wizard twinking, but that doesn't matter, because either way both classes become overpowered against the mobs they are intended to fight.  Encounters are trivialized no matter what way you look at it, and the game turns into a race to 50.  When that happens, you've turned the game into something it was not meant to be.<br>
<br>
Personally, I view the caster/melee competition for groups basically meaningless for the first 20 levels.  All classes can solo to some extent.  Some better than others, but it is possible for everyone.  Groups happen most often as a random meetings, or players go to oasis and LFG.  If you can't get a group in oasis, there are lots of other places you can adventure and earn xp.  There are lots of other players on norrath at that level that aren't wearing Cloaks of Flame and wielding Frostbringers.  So long as you can defeat mobs solo and with any group makeup, you're good to go.<br>
<br>
Slowly, it begins to matter more and more, as full pickup groups become more common, as mobs become more difficult, and as the penalties for failure become more severe.  If you're a level 40 caster and really cannot get into a standard level 40 group because it is full of twinks, and because any other class would be better than yours, then ya there is probably a problem somewhere.<br>
<br>
However, at this point you must examine whether or not it is truely a deffeciency of the class or if it is simply a misconception on the part of the players.  That is beyond the scope of this thread, really. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 10/30/01 10:59:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unatanmagus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 623<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 1:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> I am sorry, GOladus... i am NOT using extreme examples.<br>

Thurgadim Quest armor is relly NO biggie to get, even for mid level guilds.<br>

I don't give you a break, Goladus, on this things. They are gaming reality.<br>

and a bunch of mana items......got a 30 sk took 3 days play time to get him there. (love that wurm slayer) <br>
 No it a lot easyer to twink a meleer. When my twink sk started in the newbie zone stuff died in 1 blow. Not so for the wiz more mana but still capped on damage output.<br>
 So yes i got to agree it an equipment issue for the classes 1 to 50<br>

In fact, when I'm forming my lowbie groups, I love to have groupmates twinked (provided they have a clue and don't overpull, etc).  They will be able to contribute more, and the entire group will benefit.<br>
<br>
However, there is a social effect.  Since melees are so easy to twink, and even new players can find equipment that increases their effectiveness far beyond the balance imposed by the game design, low level wizards at their best can't keep up with the average tank.  This creates a common perception that wizards cannot carry their weight that players carry with them as they level up in the game.<br>
<br>
How many posts have we seen on these boards where a wizard asks to join a group, only to be told &quot;no, we don't want a wizard, thanks&quot;, whereon the wizard proceeds to demonstrate that he can kill mobs alone almost as fast as the group.<br>
<br>
We have a PR problem folks.  Part of it is our own fault, part of it is truth, but the rest is a result of twinking.<br>

Proposed Idea:<br>
<br>
[Intelligence+1 - base intelligence] / [Level] x 100% = Percentage of normal spell damage your spells do. =)  <br>

Guild trained skill: Arcane Profficiency  Level 8 Skill goes to 200 where: Skill / 2 = % chance the above equation comes into play.<br>
