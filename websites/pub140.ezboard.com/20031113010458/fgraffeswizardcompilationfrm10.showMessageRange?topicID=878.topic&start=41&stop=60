My discomfort is that all too often the edge that Wizards have on direct damage is very slight compared to Mages.  In a very, very short time, for most levels, a Mage will equal or exceed comfortably the Wizard's damage output (a single fight is enough many levels), and use less mana, with less threat of aggro.<br>
<br>
There's a huge difference between &quot;I hate Wizards&quot; and &quot;I've never thought Wizards were built properly and can recognize problems&quot; Myztic.

Last 4sh years we've been posting here, I see tons of negative posts from you, even on positive threads. So, I asked a direct question. Because it really baffles me that someone who has nothing but negative, still has the energy to play the class... where most people would pick up some other class like bard (or that mage who does so much better) and play them. <br>
<br>
And for most levels, mages can't exceed wizards' direct damage output. Unless they've made sweeping changes to our direct damage spells in last few patches. Total damage output maybe, if circumstances are suitable, but not direct damage. Then again, with suitable circumstances, wizards can do nice damage output too, which I think I proved to you some 3.5 years ago. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And most intelligent wizards would train SCM3 first before any AA. <br>
***<br>
<br>
<br>
and most wizards know the difference between the timesink of SCM3 and a vendor bought spell<br>
<br>
here's a simple way of looking at it for the simple people who still say we just want big booms<br>
<br>
ent of seb and places where you have only so much space<br>
<br>
we'll just call it 100 feet<br>
<br>
now you need to snare.. then root.. we'll just say each time you cast costs you 20 feet with recovery of nook.. the 2 sec minimum that's still there on refresh times and longer refreshes for what big spells most wizards have<br>
<br>
so.. you got 5 casts before you are in a melee situation with no resists<br>
<br>
regardless of mana cost, regardless of how fast you can chain nook it, regardless of ratio over an hour of play time<br>
<br>
you have 5 casts<br>
<br>
do you want to hit for 1200 a cast ? <br>
or 2000 a cast<br>
<br>
i'm sure the big brains here can think up better than that however if you want a basic logical reason why this argument won't go away there you go.. has nothing to do with masters of damage or we want biggest nooks<br>
<br>
it's nook vs difficulty to get because of usage ingame at hte heart of it<br>
<br>
also consider in any of these comparisons that repeating root on mobs and snare costs are never considered in calculating mana use.. wich.. with mage pet isn't used (even if they had) on mage side<br>

<br>
There is always those in EVERY class that say this. It's just the simple fact of life. If that is how you feel Grimstaff, then there is nothing really to argue about. It's your personal opinion, and I can respect that.<br>
<br>
I have stated they could make changes to wizards. It always bugs me to hear of changes for the better for many other classes but hardly any for wizards. The last spell change we got was to Okiels levity (a spell which made several other spells usless, give with one hand, take with another) to make it stackable.<br>
<br>
Necros and mages just got AA planar pet made better. Many classes got spell graphic changes, and our ice rain spells still look like fire. <br>
<br>
But I don't think wizards were built wrong, they just get ignored these days. Everyone always says that for the longest time, wizards were the top, but with all the changes in the last year, and expansions, things have changed. Possibly that is because not enough wizard players are giving feedback? I know I do. Many many mage players kept complaining till they finally did something. I suggest that every wizard player start sending in feedback to Sony.<br>
<br>
If you've been having these feelings for 4 years, Grimstaff, um this isn't some slam or put down, but ask yourself why you've stuck to playing a class that you've thought was never made right for 4 years? I mean, there has to be something about being a wizard you like? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 7910<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 11:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There is always one...</span><hr size=1> Never said I didn't LIKE the class.  Never said nor implied I hate it.  That's your addition to my statements, without basis or logic.  I mean seriously guys, if I point out problems with a car I like does that mean I despise the car?  Or that I'm frustrated and voice my frustration when it comes up?  Myztic either has an astonishingly selective memory or is deliberately ignoring the many things I've said about Wizards that are positive and constructive, but that's his perogative I guess.<br>
<br>
Here's what I mean about improperly designed class from the beginning: This game is built around the idea of opponents significantly tougher than the PCs, and the concept of experience gained only through very difficult encounters.  Further, the combat engine does not reflect fighting poorly when you are injured (for most monsters, its rather the opposite).  Thus, a class built around AE attacks and blasts without much defense and very low hit points and AC is going to have problems by design.  The game doesn't really support a high offense/low defense character very well, and that's a basic flaw with Mage and Wizard design.<br>
<br>
Further, the class was originally built around being the biggest boomer, and then was heavily cut back from their first design.  Two problems resulted from this: <br>
<br>
First, they put Direct Damage on too many other classes, which watered down the Wizard's design specialty significantly.<br>
<br>
Second, these cutbacks were not done with proper context of other classes.  Clerics, Druids, and Magicians all get more damaging blasts at odd points through the levels, pointing to an inconsistent and improperly examined design for Wizards and other classes.  These things were never addressed, and every attempt to get them addressed has been ignored or contemptuously dismissed (well, Absor pretty much did everything contemptuously).<br>
<br>
Further, as time went on, new spells added were FURTHER not done in proper context of all the classes.  Rangers, Druids, Shadow Knights and other classes all have gotten tremendously fast, good blasts that are far faster for the damage than anything Wizards have at that level.  Proper context would ensure Wizards would have at least something similar or perhaps just not giving these spells to the classes that they were granted to.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that the class works, more or less, and you can enjoy yourself in any class in the game.  Its more about your friends and what you do than the class you play, EQ is like 90% socialization and 10% game.  Wizards are, as I stated earlier for those unable to read positive things I say, the most powerful DD class in the game almost every level.  By the end game, the edge has gotten very significant.  It's just too bad that edge is so blurred or ill-defined for so many other levels, and if it were me in charge of design, my pride at the job would prevent me from letting that happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverbladetheenchanter>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1016<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 12:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is wizard the master of direct damage now?</span><hr size=1> As a mage, in a group I use my mana to:<br>

Mala/malosini mobs so me and WIZARDS can land spells on them. Wizards dotn spend 200+ mana per mob debuffing them, wizards love the effect of the debuff as thier spelsl land better.<br>

Damage Shield, depending on party make-up/time per kill/kills per minute. I Use the group DS cause timing the single is a PIA. Do wizards casxt O'Kiels much? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Does it cost 200+ mana every 10 minutes?<br>
<br>
Do wizards get bugged for rods/focus items/pet toys/arrows/coldstones?<br>
<br>
Do wizards take 5 minutes to start up from start? I usually summon: bag of focus items, cold stone, fill the now empty bag with pet toys so I cn hand them to Jibober as soon as a I get to spot, rather than waste time there.<br>
When I enter a zone to fight I must: make pet, bufff pet, arm pet with pet toys, I usally suspend that oen an dmake another because PoP mobs eat pets and being abl to pop out a spare pet has saved the group a few times...but thats more time.<br>
What does a wizard do when joing a group? How much deown time/buffing etc?<br>
<br>
Wizards get TL crap at raids, sure, AoE TL owns though! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You try CoHing folk all night.. blerg (ask the wizzy who is often on CoH invite duty).<br>

Harvest, I dunno what your talking about but a single snare and you can kite any mob in OS w/o root if you know what your doing. For the entrance all you do is snare, run towards the zone in. Jump up onto the ledge and to the very back then nuke. Run back down the ramp and nuke when you can see the target. Repeat. I lived in OS 58-60 and 20ish AA and I would solo when waiting for AE groups. I had run3 though when I did it so not sure if the timing would work if ya don't have it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=finsmacgalis>Fins Macgalis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 2:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is wizard the master of direct damage now?</span><hr size=1> Wizards don't have anything to worry about.<br>
<br>
A mage will rival, if not surpass, the average wizard in an exp group, but in raids that wizards have the greater edge.  If I go full burst on a raid mob using Firebolt of Tallon, I'm going to be VERY high on the agro list.  Case in point, my guild was clearing PoS minis for medallions and each time the MT died, I was usually one of the first to get summoned and obliterated.  Without concussion, I run a very large risk in chaining Firebolt of Tallon, no matter how much agro the MT has.    <br>
<br>
Silverblade also has a great point.  Each time someone asks for a modrod, a beastlord asks for pet gear, or a druid asks for a damage bracer, that's mana I could have been using to do more personal damage.  Do I complain when they ask me these things?  No, but that's still mana I could have, umm, been using for the personal glorification [and shlong enlargement] of myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(Why the hell do shamans ask for modrods?  Wtf!!!11)<br>
<br>
Also, if you wizzies complain you don't have focus gear like mages do, just ask!  Most mages will not charge their wizard brethren for nuking toys.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 7941<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 9:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is wizard the master of direct damage now?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I personally would like to see wiz nukes improved: either by damage or mana ratios.

<br>
Yes, at some levels mages have better vendor DD spells than wizards do.  I had the same problem when I was fighting seafuries at level 44 and my mage friend was outdamaging me.  But you grow out of it.  Personally, I'd much rather peak at the high end than at a mid-level where no one stays for long.<br>
<br>
A level 60 wizard easily outnukes a level 60 mage.  And a level 65 wizard easily outnukes a level 65 mage.  It's not even close.  Add in pet damage and yes, a mage can contribute more overall damage in a lot of xp groups, but that's fine with me.  There's not a mage in my guild who can come close to my damage output on big raid mobs.  And with the absurdly hard hitting PoP mobs, I can outsolo mages now too (which used to be their strength).<br>
<br>
Wizards got relatively weaker in Luclin, but anyone who thinks wizards didn't get a big boost in PoP is playing a different game than I am.   <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61177">Gherad</a>            <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72580">Peleg</a>

I wouldn't say stupid, I'd say random and streaky.  When we first started getting runes (and they were rare for us at the time) it took around 15 or so to get a copy of Strike of Solusek.  Just about every spell was Greater Decession or Shock of Ma*ss*gic.  The other day I had around 14 or so runes on me, turned 6 in for Wizards and got SoS, SoS, SoS, Tears, Tears, and SoM. &gt;&lt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harvestofsouls>Harvest of Souls</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/03 9:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is wizard the master of direct damage now?</span><hr size=1> ***<br>
Wizards got relatively weaker in Luclin, but anyone who thinks wizards didn't get a big boost in PoP is playing a different game than I am. <br>

<br>

<br>
every zone i can hunt in is trivial and for nifty 61 spells i'm supposed to step up my game play with i've gotten an upgrade for shield of magi and lvl 12 elemental armor ! wooooooooooot<br>

Just because you haven't gotten any of the wizard upgrades in PoP doesn't mean they aren't great.  If you're still level 61 and don't have the new spells, then obviously the expansion does nothing for you.  But for those who get to level 65 and get their spells (or even level 63), PoP is an enormous upgrade over Luclin.<br>
<br>
Like I said, if you don't see the improvements, you're playing a different game than I am (which you are). <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61177">Gherad</a>            <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72580">Peleg</a>

<br>
sry<br>
<br>

<br>

the fact that it is now easy as sin to level and there is no reason to not have hod and level 65 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

theres a difference between playing a nerfed class and not leveling.  One is Sony, one is you.  Wizards were not nerfed, so figure out what the problem is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysthawk>Mysthawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/03 9:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is wizard the master of direct damage now?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>so what again is it that helps me everyday from pop when i log in ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You do realize the world doesn't revolve around you... right?<br>
