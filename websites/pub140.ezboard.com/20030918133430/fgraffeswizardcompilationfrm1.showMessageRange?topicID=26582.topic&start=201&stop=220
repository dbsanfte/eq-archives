<br>
The mages on magecompendium are math-freaks (myself included). We love to calculate dps, efficiency, etc etc. We don't care how big a gun is, we want it to be efficient over time. <br>
<br>
Wizards in this thread (and in my guild) are BUM!-freaks(tm). They love to see the BIG numbers hit, and they love to know that no one can outdammage them in the short run.<br>
<br>
So while mages are blind to the sensitivity-issues of BUM!-deprovation(tm), wizards are blind to BUM!-blindness.<br>
<br>
Mages coulnd't care less if the largest nuke of the pet was 600 instead of 1200, specially if wizards feel bad about this. As long as the dps is good.<br>
<br>
Wizards are our friends, and we don't want them to feel bad. If you guys feel bad about us getting your big gun from when you where level 50, I sincerely belive that we should not get that one. <br>
<br>
Shame to that mage who came to our cousins board and used bad langauage. And shame to those wizards who bashed mages for something Sony put on test. If you want to bash someone, bash Sony. Perhaps you should wait to a given effect goes live, though.<br>
<br>
What some mages liked was that it could be a burst dps-pet, so that it could sustain higher dps on a boss mob, for example, but would then have to rest for 5 minutes before being used again. If for example it could sustain 130 dps for 2 minutes, but would have to rest for 5, it would be a great situational pet. This would not thread the BUM!-ness of wizards, you would still be far superior in that time frame.<br>
<br>
But this is most likely not to happen. Most likely, it was just an experiment, like they have made many before with mage pets. Or if something happens, it will be a pet that is comparable with the others in average damage over time. Which is then a non-issue, because people will not bother.<br>
<br>
Whenever there has been a pet with to high a dps, it has been nerfed. Remember necro-pets with daggers?<br>
<br>
Upgrades to neighbouring classes means that one owns class will also be upgraded one day. It just takes a different timeframe than the short one. <p>Iblis<br>

<br>
Some more comments.<br>
<br>
I do realize that other classes have useless spells, and mages certainly have at least their share of them.  However, having one of our four main spell lines be useless since <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kunark</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is much more of a class concern than some obscure spell at the back of the spell book.  Magicians are supposed to be masters of the elementals, and ever since <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kunark</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the post-50 fire elementals have been just about useless.  Prior to 50, mages have had all four elements to choose from.  After 50, we have three: we lose one of our elementals.<br>
<br>
The near uselessness of post-50 fire elementals has long been a concern of mages.  To make a better analogy, it would be as if all post-50 wizard fire-based direct damage spells were so useless, that in any situation that called for fire DD, you would have to resort to your pre-50 fire DD spells.<br>
<br>
As regards snare, all I can say for certain is that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">if</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> mages should have snare, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">then</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> it should only be cast via a pet, as is the case with stun, cold DDs, root, etc.  I for one have no desire to be a kiter, as some other mages have suggested.  I would be against mages having snare if it turned them into kiters, unless that were the best of a lot of bad alternatives.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Karana</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> granted me <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gobaner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so he could stand toe-to-toe with the enemy, not to run around while my enemies chase me.  If I wanted to kite, I would have played a wizard or a druid.<br>
<br>
In order to add an opportunity cost to reclaiming and recasting a new-style fire pet, it might be a good idea to have them use and take advantage of focus items.  Thus a fully equipped fire elemental would have more damage output than a newly summoned one.<br>
<br>
Masters definitely do <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> inherit all the hate of their pet when it disappears, as any pet chainer can tell you.  Instead, all the hate disappears along with the pet.  The newly cast pet starts with zero hate, while the mage still has all the hate they have accumulated so far.  Thus pet-chainers must manage aggro carefully if they want the new pet to gain aggro quickly.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rombus:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  the pets need to have a balanced mana pool as well. Unlimited is not a balanced option.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not necessarily, if the spells themselves are limited.  There is not that much difference between a meleeing pet that procks 150 DD without using mana and a casting pet that tosses 150 DD with regularity if the net result is roughly the same sustained DPS.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natan:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Seriously, i wonder why the Devs have to go from one extreme to the other so often recently.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Beware <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Monkey's Paw!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I know I do.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wandor:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This is not going to affect low 50s wizards becuase THEY DON'T GROUP WITH 63+ MAGES to begin with.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Actually, I often partner with junior casters.  Just having snare and root at my side makes my camps <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">so</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> much safer, it is not funny.  By my lonesome, I cannot split most spawns, nor can I deal with adds, and if <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gobaner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dies at the wrong moment, I am toast.  Duoing with a junior caster in one of my solo spots works well for both of us.  Being higher level, I get the lion's share of experience, while the junior still gets very good experience because of the level of the mobs.  The enemies die faster, and with much less risk.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sintaril:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  mages dont get snare, nor should they get snare (the class is balanced around not having it, so this can and will screw stuff up<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I agree.  I do not want snare, I did not propose snare, I do not want to be a kiter.  However, if the new fire pet casts snare it will not break my heart, unless it turns mages into kiters.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sintaril:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  if you reclaim/recast it to avoid that, youre going to have a pet that is sustained burst dps, and that is not balanced.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I look to a caster pet for <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">sustained</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> damage, not burst damage, which I can provide myself.  What I would prefer is essentially a pet that deals damage by casting, not melee.  Something like lots of nukes in the 100-300 point range, that amounted to roughly the same damage as a meleeing pet.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sintaril:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  or you can do as several people suggested, mages included, and add in a recast buffer<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am not sure it is worth the effort to get big nukes out of a caster pet.  Might be pretty, but I would prefer slow but steady damage, like my other pets.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jaytee:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Summoning an OOM pet is not an option in my opinion as the pet will still be worthless. The pet needs to be ready to go as soon as it is summoned just like every pet from level 4 on. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Exactly.<br>
<br>
Pets have always had many advantages over rangers, for example.  They do not whine about rezzes, or demand a healer or slower.  They do not roll on parchments, or ask to have their girlfriend invited to the group.  Elementals are instantly ready to fight, and do not spin around in circles looking for the enemy when they move.  They get lost much less often than rangers.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sintaril:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  ok, so place a recast limit on it so that the pet cannot be chained.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No.  All our normal four elementals have always had reasonable recast timers, and mages rely on their ability to quickly summon and resummon pets.  I myself have devoted 18 AA to summoning pets quickly.  There are some specialty pets, such as the epick, decoy and rage pets that have long recast timers, but not the basic four.<br>
<br>
Instead, a caster pet should be limited by its spell list.<br>
<br>
And yes, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Iblis</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is right.  I would much rather have sustained DPS from a caster pet than burst.<br>

It has is a significant attribute of elementals that they are summoned ready-to-fight. There is no reason to alter this for wizard pets.<br>
<br>
Raz, I have a fair amount of respect for you, but you are clearly wrong here. Pets are not summoned prehasted, prebuffed.  They have not been summon ready to fight since you turned level 8 and got your first pet buff.<br>
<br>
Pets have always needed some set up time.  This process was made even more pronouced with pop now in order to have a ~90 dps pet I have to summon the pet, summon it two swords, a haste mask, and a girdle.<br>
<br>
A wizard pet would be/should be used in situations where the need for burst dps outweighs the need for having the sustained damage of the rogue because it sustained vs burst dps is what defines the difference between rogues and wizards.  To that end, it is reasonable to expect that when the pet is &quot;spent&quot; that its damage would go down. <br>
<br>
However, due to the tools  a mage has at his disposal that situation won't ever occur if all it takes is casting a new pet.  Even a recast timer does not get around this problem because I could simply suspend/unsuspend a rogue pet while I am waiting for the fire pet to &quot;recycle&quot;.  The only solution I can see where this pet can provide &quot;burst&quot; dps is if it summoned oom.  <br>
<br>
Maybe it shouldn't be &quot;burst&quot; dps.  Maybe its speciality should be range damage or a pet that is immune to aoes.  However, I don't see any real to add another pet for sustained damage, the water pet fills that role nicely.<br>

<br>
Would be if I got to get the damage for free...like I bring out Jabober, it casts the damage, I reclaim Jabober for mana and recast to get Kabarer who does the same thing.  <br>
<br>
I just do not understand why they just dont cast mage spells?  No one has a problem with them upgrading the fire pet to usefulness.  Just give em MAGE level 44-52 nukes.  Or give them a 1120 damage, 10 sec casting time ice nuke without the IC graphic.<br>
<br>
I think thats what most wizards (me included) are pissed about.  I dont want some group seeing an Ice Comet and not seeing a wizard casting it...because the next time that person sees a wiz and mage lfg...they will think &quot;why choose the wizard, since the mage can do all the same damage plus the melee of the pet and the casting of hte pet&quot;<br>
<br>
Regarding FoT on vendor:<br>
<br>
The difference in power between FoT and GSS compared to the difficulty of getting each is inarguable.  Give each a numerical value from 1 - 100 where 100 is the HARDEST thing in the world.  The give 1-100 for power where 100 is SoS.<br>
<br>
Buying FoT: 1 (vendor)<br>
Obtaining GSS: 100 (Luclin uber mob)<br>
Power of FoT: 70 (good damage, well known drawbacks)<br>
Power of GSS: 95 (Third best nuke in the game, maybe 2nd)<br>
<br>
Subtract the difference of each to get their relative Risk V Reward:<br>
<br>
95 - 100 = -5<br>
70 - 1 = +69<br>
<br>
Thats how I am looking at it...the RVR for FoT compared to its drawbacks, in my warped head, far outweigh a comparable level / damage spell...but hey, this dead horse is well...dead.<br>

Im partial to the suggestion Rombus made back 10 pages or so ago. I've made similar suggestions on the mage board, they seemingly fell on deaf ears there.<br>
<br>
I do feel that since the pet is being based off the wizard class, a cold based nuke is somewhat appropriate. Wether that is to be IC? Well thats a different story.<br>

fire's hp is so low that it will probably die faster than i can get 1 nuke out (so its not 3900hp as some of u think it is). <br>
the fire's dps still wont be as good as our water pet. so fire's dps wont make our overall dps better. this pet will just become more useful than its predessessor and will also be a &quot;fun&quot; pet (&quot;hey guys, look at my pocket wiz&quot;) . its snare ability means squat to us since we've been doing fine without one. the reason why itk casts wizard spells like ice comet is because it ----IS---- a wizard. the reason why i think sony gave the fire pet ice comet is because it IS a defining wiz spell. most (if not everyone) knows that fire pet models after wiz so sony probably thought it fitting to give our most powerful wiz pet a wiz defining spell. only thing i think suck is that its a quest spell so its unfair to alot of wizs who quested for it. but to say that its a defnining spell and that it doesnt belong to our fire pet is wrong. cause our fire pet is a wizard (ya i said that before) so i dont understand whats the problem of a wizard (fire pet) casting a wizard spell whose dps isnt as good as our water's. and yes many mages are gonna summon these pets but if they intend to do pure dmg they'll go for water. like what i said before, this pet is just a fun pet. oh ya would like to also say this: water pet has been parsed for 120 dps with some pc buffs muhahahhahaha <br>
-------------<br>
this should end discussions about &quot;dps&quot; since our rogue pet (water pet) has more dps than this pet will ever have even with ice comet.  only way fire pet would surpass rogue pet is to chain cast ice comet and thats not possible.  as for those who are saying about how a fire pet casting a ice spell ...well because its a WIZARD.  u gotta first look at the fire pet as a WIZARD class not a fire pet.  .....damn people, look at what i posted before and see what soe was thinking when they gave ur &quot;defining&quot; spell to our fire pet (WIZARD class)  and btw this pet ISNT a lvl 52 wizard, its a lvl 60 wizard so in reality it should even cast lvl 60 wiz spelld <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
again stop talking about the dps of this pet cause its not exceeding our best dps pet...so dps discussion should stop.<br>
<br>
as for ur defining spell going to a pet, that discussion should also stop since its not going to a pet, its going to a wizard.<br>
<br>
so what else is there left to talk about? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ikeya>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Stamping Out Stupidity</span><br>  Posts: 3452<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 4:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: thought you should hear it from a mage first</span><hr size=1> My cat's name is Mittens.<br>

As much as I respect Rombus's opinion, I think concussion should be left to the Wizard.  If Mages received concussion, even as a pet ability, I would vehemently appose it.  Magicians already have enough agro-less damage in their pets and damage shields.  I would hope that the class as a whole would see how that would directly infringe on our burst dps abilities.  I would rather Mages have Ice comet as a regular spell at 62+ than see that.<br>
<br>
Besides, I am sure Magicians do not want to be the druids of the Int casting class.<br>

this is jolcen (yes i still dont know how to use those nifty quotes thingy) and wanna respond to this.  reason why i said that is because many of u are ignoring the fact our pets are in fact wizards.  and i think that is the reason why sony wanted to give our wizard pets wizard spells and not mage spells as some of u suggested.  if ure compalining about that, then ure a few expansion too late.  funny that no one complained when our wizard pets was casting crappy wiz spells but now that it can actually cast something useful (not overpowering since overall dps wont surpasss our rogue pets), theres all this discussion about balance and such.  u gotta look at the bigger picture not just &quot;oh damn look at that.  they gave those freaking pets our ice comet&quot;.  i wonder if rogues went nuts when our water pet (rogue class) started to backstab/assassinate...hehe most likely  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 932<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 4:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> There is a big difference between rogue pets BSing and Wizard pets casting Ice Comet and Lures.<br>

Increase mana pool +4000(works on npc?)<br>
Increase mana rate to 50/tick<br>
Lots of mana preservation<br>
Slow spell casting speed to so and so percent(balance)<br>
<br>
his nukes should be on par with that of his melee dps. his AI shouldn't try to fight, just chain nuke with his nukes that are slowed to be on par dps with other pets, or better than them but at least reasonable. what's the point of that? they don't make melee push, don't make a pocket wizard for mages(which is not acceptable- i dont have pocket voq sd potn soe etc), and will be a real nuker pet. it shouldn't be some stupid melee/wizard hybrid. caster pet casts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ikeya>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Stamping Out Stupidity</span><br>  Posts: 3453<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 4:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: once...</span><hr size=1> My cat just coughed up a hairball.<br>

<br>
Natan, I hate to burst your bubble, but the level 62 pet spell summons a level 60 pet that when buffed up with burnout V, mage summoned weapons, and mage summoned equipment does comparable damage to a level 60 rogue with epic.<br>
<br>
It can't do all the things a rogue does, but it does have many of the attributes of a level 60 rogue, i.e. it backstabs, has a chance to assasinate mobs level 46 or below, and does approximately 85 to 90 dps when properly positioned and equipped.<br>
<br>
Our level 61 air pet has many of the characteristics of a level 60 warrior.  It can taunt.  It can bash and it can kick.  It can  duel wield.  Under the proper circumstances it will even /shield its owner.  Properly buffed it can substitute for a tank.<br>
<br>
The fire pet is a wizard.  The fire pets have been wizards since Kunark.  <br>
<br>
In the majority of cases our pets have been similiar to the class they were modeled on in many respects except being overall weaker and lower in level.  Why should the wizard pet be any different?<br>

<br>
YAY Balanz for saving me from Carpal Tunnels!<br>
<br>
I would like to adress a couple comments that were brought into the discussion at one point or another:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Every other caster class gets a type of skin spell and an agro reducer of some sort, they don't have to be as good as the wizard ones, but at least give them something. Ditch the fire pet totally, it's a broken idea already. That right there would make playing a mage 100x more fun.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As far as the idea that mages should get a Skin Spell, before Kunark came out our self-buff &quot;Phantom Armor&quot; line of spells (not to be confused with the Summoned: Phantom Armor line) was meant as a quasi replacement.  Instead of spending several pp a cast to absorb so many rounds of melee, the Phantom Armor line gave us added AC and HP regen for the cost of Cats Eye Agates, which was a pretty good deal back when the high level exp group mobs didn't kill us in two or three hits (we had time to run around in a circle and scream like girls).  A couple expansions later, and the ability has been approved upon quite nicely.  The addition of mana regen to the higher end of the line, along with the change to the use of Pearls instead of Cats Eye Agates (one pearl to cast the spell is MUCH better than 4 Cats Eyes, due to the backpack space needed fer all them Agates), to the removal of the need for a component at the very tippy-top of the line (Xegony's Phantasmal Guard) makes it a very welcome self buff.  Add the fact that XPG stacks with just about EVERYTHING (the only thing it DOESN'T stack with is Protection of the Cabbage/Glades/Nine) makes it a VERY nice buff to have (especially when there's no druid around).  In a typical exp group, if I take 600 or so damage and are not in danger of taking more damage soon, I usually tell healers not to heal me, since the regen of XPG usually gets me back to full decently quickly.<br>
<br>
I don't believe mages need any aggro reducing spells.  I for one can handle my aggro quite well, and the times that I DO take the 600 or so damage mentioned above is quite rare.  The only times I do have to worry about getting aggro when simply doing my job are: a) when I'm soloing. b) if I'm grouped with people who don't know what they're doing. or c) Some bit of lag or something causes a bad pull and we have to deal with multiple unmezzed mobs for a while.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>can I have elemental charm? how about malosinia or winds of tishan or malos- some other class defining ability and their BEST spell for it. I thought not, and I think also that mages shouldnt have a wizard's class defining spells, either.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think Malosinia counts as a class defining spell, since both mages and shamans have access to the majority of the &quot;Mal&quot; line.<br>
<br>
I also don't think of Elemental Charm as class defining, since mages get it only once, and many other classes can charm (variations of charm don't strike me as class defining for anyone other than Enchanters, since they get a whole lot of them).  Granted, it's a very powerful ability if used in the couple zones it's useful in *cough* BoT *coughcough* that has already been nerfed once since it was too powerful...   But not what I would refer to as &quot;Class Defining&quot;.  Personally I've never fealt like playing a Ghetto Enchanter, I'm a mage dammit.<br>
