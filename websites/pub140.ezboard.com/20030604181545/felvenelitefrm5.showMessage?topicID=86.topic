Was this really necessary?  She stepped back to stay better hidden behind the large rock, and looked at her two companions.  Both were intent upon the drake, studying where it flew.  Maybe it was necessary.  They had had a very frustrating day, trying and failing to gather enough companions for a proper hunt.  Now the day was at a close, and Krushh was gnashing his teeth with irritation.  He scratched, clonking Seyah with his spear.  She backed up further.<br>
        “I’ll get his attention with a spell, and run past you.   You should be able to hit him as he flies by, “ said Laenyel, stepping back and speaking to the ogre.<br>
        “Where shall we fight him?” asked Krushh.   Laenyel had hunted the area alone before, and knew the terrain.<br>
        “Down on the beach, so we avoid the other one.  Also, that will keep us out of the way of any druids.”<br>
        “Ok.  Come on, Seyah, let’s run down.”<br>
        Seyah ran down the sloping cliff beside Krushh, smiling a little as she began to cross the dunes and heard the othmir’s happy calypso music.  Krushh chose a prominent dune and stationed himself on top of it.  He signaled to Laenyel that they were ready.  Seyah scanned the cliff, and a moment later saw the wizard gliding swiftly down, levitated, with the blue drake screaming in fury behind him.  Laenyel always looked so calm and unhurried, Seyah thought to herself, even with an angry monster in hot pursuit.  <br>
        Beside her Krushh shifted his weapons, bracing to swing as Laenyel went past.  He connected, and the drake abandoned his pursuit of the fragile high elf, turning his fury to the armor-clad warrior.  He screamed a spell and a fog of poison enveloped Seyah and Krushh.<br>
        “Move away Seyah!” yelled Krushh, still swinging both weapons.  “Get out of range of his spells!”<br>
        “Over here!” called Laenyel, and obediently Seyah turned and ran down, just as another cloud of noxious gas materialized.<br>
        “Heal yourself,” the wizard urged as she drew near.  He was casting his own spells, strands of fire arcing from his hands.<br>
        Seyah complied, then looked up the dune.  She could still see traces of the fog, but the combatants were out of view.  She began to run back up the hill.   <br>
        “Stay back,” cautioned Laenyel, but Seyah replied over her shoulder, “He’ll need a heal.”  His health was dropping, she could see, so she stopped to cast, tossing the blue strands of Tunare’s blessing toward where she could hear the fight.  It didn’t hit.  <br>
        “He’s out of range!” she yelled anxiously at Laenyel, who was running up behind her.  Obviously his spell weren’t landing either.  She topped the hill, and had Krushh in view at last.  He was struggling, badly wounded, and desperately Seyah tried another spell.  Still too far.   Again she ran, afraid that she wouldn’t reach him in time.  To her horror, she saw him lose his grip on his spear, which dropped soundlessly to the sand.  “Noooooooo!”  she screamed, trying to run faster over the too-yielding sand.   In slow motion she saw him stagger and begin to topple, then he fell backward into the sand. <br>
        Seyah, finally reaching him, threw herself onto his inert form.  Never has they failed to die together, and here she was full of mana, barely scratched.  She sobbed with frustration and shame, hearing only dimly the screams of the wounded drake, now attacking her.<br>
        “Evac,” Laenyel stated calmly, and the thunder of the spell drowned out the drake, and the faint strands of calypso music.<br>
        Hands still grasping his treeweave, Seyah raised her wet face and gazed uncomprehending at her change of scene.  She looked a moment at the ogre’s still form, then jumping to her feet cast a heal spell.   If he came with them on the evac, then he had to be alive.  The heal landed, but the ogre did not stir.    She examined him, and told Laenyel,  “It must be the poison.   He lives, but he’s beyond my heals.”  She tried a spell for the curing of poison, but it had no effect.<br>
        She looked around at her surroundings.  “Faydwer?”  she looked inquiringly at the wizard.<br>
        “It seemed as good a destination as any, at the moment.”<br>
        “Why not something closer to the guildhall?” she asked, starting to think of what needed to be done.<br>
        “Seyah, the guildhall is deserted.  There is no one there to help.“<br>
        She nodded acknowledgement.  “Well, since we are here, let’s get one of the priestesses to come and tend to Krushh.”<br>
        The priestess had come, but said she could not completely cure him.  “This seems like two poisons, working together,” she said.  “He must have had an old one in his system, before you encountered the drake.   He should recover, with time &amp; rest, but I’d suggest you bring him to Felwithe, where we can watch over him.”  In town they had hired bearers to come get the unconscious ogre, but at the gates they had to pause.<br>
        “Why MY rooms?!” Laenyel asked, his calm perturbed for once.  <br>
        “Where else?  Did you think I could put him in my cell at the cleric guild? Seyah asked.<br>
        “Well, why not your family’s house?  It’s big enough - he’d fit in the stables at least, or maybe somewhere in the servants’ quarters.”<br>
        “Right.  You can see my mother housing an ogre?”  Seyah looked at Laenyel, and his expression changed from outrage to resignation as he realized the unlikelihood of the Lady Althia harboring a non-elf.  Maybe a diplomatic or intellectual emissary of some human-based race, but no, he couldn’t see an ogre.  Before he could voice the acquiescence she already saw dawning on his face, they were interrupted.<br>
        “I’m not an ogre, I’m an elf.”<br>
        The turned together to look down at the litter.  The bearers were chatting with the guards, and it certainly *sounded* like Krushh speaking.  His eyes were open, staring at the ivory and gold towers of the Felwithe gates.  Seyah frowned, and exchanged a worried look with Laenyel. <br>
        “Krushh?” she said, moving to stand in his line of vision, but he stared through her, and a moment later his eyes closed.  Seyah waved to the bearers, and they came to carry the heavy ogre into town.  Laenyel’s brows twitched slightly as Seyah instructed them where to go, but glided ahead of them to throw open the double doors to his entryway.  <br>
        “Where exactly do you propose I put him?” he asked, unable to keep a small trace of sarcasm from his voice.  <br>
        “In here,” she declared, throwing open a second set of double doors.<br>
        “My library!”  Laenyel was once again betrayed into agitation.  Seyah was rapidly clearing a space in the middle of the room, closing books and stacking up bit of parchment in a businesslike manner.  “My quest research!”  He snatched a stack of parchment from her hand and put it on a desk in a corner.  Looking annoyed, he began stacking a set of odd-colored rocks back into the case they had obviously been sent in.  He closed the lid and added it to the rising pile on his desk, as Seyah began to shove books back in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.  He began to assist her, glaring at her resentfully as he pulled a book out from her hand and flipped it right side up before shelving it.  She handed him the last pile and turned again to the center of the room.<br>
        “Here,” she declared, and the bearers carried the comatose warrior in and set the litter gently onto the floor.  “Thank you all,” Seyah smiled, pressing coins into their hands.  “Thank you for your help.”  They left cheerfully, each eager to tell of the strange visitor in the wizard Laenyel’s quarters.  By morning all of Felwithe would know of his houseguest.<br>
        Seyah turned to Laenyel.  “Cup of tea?” she inquired.<br>
        “Yes, thank you,” Laenyel replied, preoccupied, sorting through the pile on the desk.<br>
        Returning to the library with two steaming mugs a short time later, Seyah passed one to the wizard and sat herself wearily into a deep chair.  “Laen, we need to think about finding a new guild.”<br>
        “What’s the matter with the old one?”<br>
        Seyah pressed her lips together.  Laenyel resisted change.   But he himself had said the guildhall was empty.  The need seemed plain to her.  She wondered how to convince him.  <br>
        “I am lonely, Laen,” she said after a pause.  “We three are barely functional, alone.  It would be good to have steady group mates, who we could trust. “<br>
        His pale blue eyes met her deep blue across the pile of books and parchment.   They reached a mute understanding, and amusement crinkled Laen’s eyes.  “Let me know when you’ve found one,” he said, and returned to his papers.<br>
        Seyah’s mouth turned down at the corners and she stared into her tea.  The prospect of finding a new guild made her innards twist.  Her glance fell to Krushh and her thoughts turned to him.   He was more experienced than the two of them.  She wondered if they did not hold him back.  Doubtless he could apply and gain admittance to a great house.  She didn’t think she could stand the cacophony of a large guild, her taste and she knew Laenyel’s ran more to refinement rather than opulence, quality over quantity.<br>
        She rose, and bidding Laenyel goodnight, let herself out into the soft night air of Felwithe.   In the morning, she resolved, she would begin her search. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seyahmt>SeyahMT</A> at: 12/6/02 7:05:53 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=86.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=86.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
