Let's take a group of lvl 51 wizards.  Most dk blue mobs at that level have no more than 10khp.  6 wizards opening with Ice Comet = 6720 right away.  If pulled with snare, then wizard with aggro could kite, while the other 5 launch another round of IC = Dead Mob.<br>
<br>
I think sometimes we underestimate ourselves when it comes to grouping.  Now this couldn't work in places like PoP, when the mobs have much higher hp's, and hit harder.  Situational, maybe.  Fun, you betcha.<br>
<br>
We were in PoN last night, and the difference in my group when the Mage left, and was replaced by a druid was dramatic.  The fights lasted much longer, the cleric used much more mana....  <br>
<br>
It continues to amaze me how so few groups DON'T load up on wizards/mages for DPS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garchoo>Garchoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/03 9:41:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25537.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I agree!</span><hr size=1> Mages = great for kiting partners; a backstabbing air elemental following an a mob being aggro-kited is insane.

You don't get much more unobtrusive than a bard tank/mezzing a single mob, and it's slow, so those who solo that way are rarely a problem.  That's probably why you don't see much of them; you probalby think they're warriors.<br>
<br>
Those that fear kite walk around slowly hacking the backs of mobs up, but are pretty harmless and unobtrusive.<br>
<br>
Those that chant kite cover a good bit of ground, but as long as they're careful, there's no reason for anyone to get hurt.  The kill rate is fair for this type of soloing, but it's rarely a problem to have a chant kiter hogging too many spawns.<br>
<br>
Charm kiting, and especially swarm kiting is more risky, and harder to do right.  If done right, however, it's great experience (until you hit a lag spike, or charm the wrong mob, in which case you're toast).  This kind of kiting should be done away from others, and other people should be very careful about stepping in on a swarm kiting bard;  It's very low-aggro kiting, so you could easily get the whole swarm on you if you're not careful.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: There are bards who hog spawns, much like druids, and, dare I say it, wizards, who quad kite constantly with KEI.  It's not the class, it's the individuals that are jerks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battleaxe0>BattleAxe0</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.terrabase.com/images/ma1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 1:55:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25537.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bard question</span><hr size=1> You talked about bards group charming.

With the changes - how does this effect exp?  If you charm a mob, charm wears off and you charm again - does this count for 2 charmed mobs or 1 (i.e. do you lose 30% or 60% exp)?<br>

As for charming in groups, the exp deduction is only for the person who charmed (everyone else gets normal exp - note dire charm is different) and a mob charmed twice only counts as one charmed mob.

My annoyance really comes from several months where it seemed there was a too-low-level-for-the-zone invasion of ME on the prexus server by Bards.<br>
<br>
A group of 52 to 55 level bards trying to pull half of an entire zone (that 3 wizzies and a couple of druids can share peacefully all at the same time) over and over... losing control over and over.... running away at bard speed and scrapping mobs on everyone... over and over.<br>
<br>
I started wondering if someone had made a post on swarm kiting in ME at lower levels on some bard board as it seemed to go on, always with new bards, for a couple of months.  They would try it for 3 or 4 days and give up.. then a new one would appear and do the same thing.  Lots of dead bards... lots of dead bystanders.  Lots of angry folks.  ME wasn't a lot of fun for a while there.<br>
<br>
I personally dont quad there anymore but Ive hung out with folks doing shards and have noticed that it finally stopped.  I have no idea what started it all but Im glad its gone.<br>
<br>
We have some great Bards in my guild.  I love grouping with em.  The thing is, swarm kiting takes a lot of skill to do right and just like there are better and worse wizzies, there are better and worse Bards.  If you are an awesome Bard (like those in my guild) I'm sure you can do it well without killing everyone around you through incompetence -- and more power to you.<br>
<br>
Generally (please note the word &quot;generally&quot;) a less than skilled wizard who can't quad dies.... and dies alone.  If the quad goes wrong they rarely have a chance to run away (dead too fast, we are wusses with a big gun) or they run 100 yards and abscond.<br>
<br>
A less than skilled Bard often takes folks out with them when they die or kills others while living by running away at Bard speed with an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>amazingly massive group</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of ticked off mobs in their wake.  Its a shame that those dorks give all Bards an UNDESERVED bad rep, but they do.  In a way its the double edged sword of how awesome a truly good Bard can be, but how difficult it is to be a truly good Bard.<br>
<br>
So, lets review.  I dig bards, bards are cool.  Its tough to be a REALLY good bard.  Those that are, rock, those that dont, suck.  Not a lot of middle ground there.  If you are one of the rockers, then dont be offended by those who point out that some in fact do suck.<br>
<br>
It certainly doesnt offend me that some wizards suck.  Heck I can always tell someone who is used to Suck-wizards.  In groups they keep saying &quot;Dont nuke too hard!  Dont get agro!!!&quot;  and seem panicy.  I generally just say something like &quot;Been with lousy wizards have we?  Chill, sit back and watch what a good one can do&quot;<br>
<br>
At which point the mobs fall down in a hurry and the exp rolls in.<br>
<br>
/peace<br>

<br>
This is a significant problem for bards who do normal charm kites (which are a lot easier and less dangerous than swarm kites).  Does breaking charm break the xp loss?  We just don't know.  It's hard to test that kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
If it does, there is a way around this.  You just have to charm the less-powerful mob and sick it on the stronger one.  Then you kill your pet first.<br>
<br>
In regards to swarm control, I agree that bards in ME should be more careful about their swarms.  ME is a hard zone to swarm in; huge aggro radii, nonsocial mobs, and pop-up mobs make it very difficult to swarm effectively.  It can be done, though.  Gorongas and toilers are good victims for a swarmer.  It's the adds that are the problem.  <br>
<br>
Frankly, it's not hard to leave a huge swarm in the middle of the zone.  If you lose control, you as a bard have enough speed that if you're at all careful, you can zone with the mobs too far back to train onto anyone.<br>
<br>
There are specific requirements for doing a good swarm kite:<br>
1.  It must be done in an open area, where the bard has a significant speed advantage over the mobs.<br>
2.  The mobs must be social mobs.  Otherwise, it's better to two-mob kite.<br>
3.  Casters should be avoided if at all possible.  One root, snare, or stun, and you're a crispy critter.<br>
4.  Swarms should be done away from other people.  Few people have seen a good swarm kiter in action, and fewer still understand how it works.  I've had many a good swarm ruined by a passing druid that tries to take a few off my swarm for himself.  Such druids invariably get pummelled, and then proceed to blame me for &quot;training&quot; them.  <br>
<br>
You'll rarely see a good swarm kiter, because the good ones tend to avoid other people while swarming.  I get the occasional gawker, but usually, swarm kiting is something other people only see when I'm grouped with them and there's a bad overpull.<br>
