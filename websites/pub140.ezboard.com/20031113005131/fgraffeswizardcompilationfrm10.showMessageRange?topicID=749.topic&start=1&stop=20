<br>
In effect, your rate of XP in this game is how much DPH you can cause, divided by the number of players required to maintain this DPH.<br>
<br>
Keeping a heavy damage dealing class like a wizard balanced is hard.<br>
<br>
If they do significantly above average damage, why would they group?(1)  Every individual added who does less damage per hour than the wizard lowers the groups average DPH, plus adds coordination friction.(2)<br>
<br>
Verant solved the problem for Rogues by requiring the Rogue to be behind the target -- requiring a support infrastructure of some kind for the Rogue to keep up her DPH.  Either fear/hate kiting of some kind, or a tank+healer combo in order to soak up the damage.<br>
<br>
However, Wizards do not have the Rogue problem, at least on non-summoning creatures.  They can snare, root and jboot kite them -- even indoors some places.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the Monk is often seen soloing (traditionally) -- able to keep up their HPs using mend and bind wounds, their above average DPS translates into very good DPH.(3)<br>
<br>
Then, there are the column spells -- these spells are NOT easy to use in a group at all -- producing the inducement to quad kite rather than group.<br>
<br>
Wizards are hurt by this, because it means Verant has, at least in the past, kept their DPH down BELOW the average DPH in a group.  As their DD DPH passes the average, it becomes more and more tempting to use DDs to kill the creatures, solo, rather than bothering with the group baggage.(4)<br>
<br>
And if a damage dealing class, in a group, has a lower DPH than average -- well, their choice as a group member is not exactly optimal.  This sucks.<br>
<br>
There are other reasons to group other than DPH -- if tougher camps give more XP, with creatures/multiples that are harder than 1 person can deal with, grouping becomes useful.(5)<br>
<br>
Another reason to group is synergy -- haste, clarity, and other abilities your group members bring that make the group more powerful than the sum of its parts.  2.5+ hour buffs have reduced this synergy -- how many Wizards buy a KEI every 2.5 hours, or get one off a guildie?  How many melees bug friendly enchanters for a haste from their clicksticks while soloing?(6)<br>
<br>
I think this is a tricky problem.  And I don't know how to solve it.<br>
<br>
Maybe Verant's plan to make tougher creatures worth killing will help.  Or larger XP bonus' in new, tougher zones.<br>
<br>
Remember, wizards are not just being balanced against other damage dealers.  Tanks and Support must be factored in as well.<br>
<br>
Footnotes:<br>
(1) Other than socialization.  =)<br>
<br>
(2) coordination friction, or time lost.  People going AFK.  Gathering.  Random LD.  You know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
(3) Their ability to spell haste 40%, and FD in overpulls, also helps.<br>
<br>
(4) MB =)<br>
<br>
(5) Most dungeons used to be like this, and CT is mostly like this.  Now, Velks and Upper Seb is soloable by high level melees with ease.<br>
<br>
(6) I use Enchanters as an example, because traditionally they are the best at improving DPH with buffs.  Cheap &amp; Long lasting buffs make actually GROUPing with the buffer less likely.<br>

<br>
See, when other people on other message boards talk about Wizards they say &quot;Wizards suck in xp groups, great on raids, they have manaburn and can quad kite, so I guess it all evens out.&quot;  What's the problem with this equasion?  Kiting, and snare.  I'm more than willing to give it (and invisible vs undead, where the hell did that come from anyway?) up and get better grouping and damage.  We aren't druids, we aren't generalists, we are specialists at DAMAGE. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 8/22/02 1:15:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubranamanstarbinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Branaman Starbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1195<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/23/02 6:02 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Damage Dealer Balance Problem</span><hr size=1> The only reason I got groups in Sebilis was because I could snare, evac, and there were no Druids left.

<br>
What if you could do more damage, over time, than any class there?  What if you did more damage than a rogue?(1)<br>
<br>
Would you still have gotten a group?<br>
<br>
My point is, so long as you can deal your damage WITHOUT a group backing you up (say, snare the target, then nuke them), that means of dealing damage +cannot+ be above average.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, you would be dumb to group.(2)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That was of course Until I started grouping with a cleric, 3 enchanters and another wizard.

<br>
Exactly.<br>
<br>
You can't deal that level of damage without the backup.  Thus, dispite the fact that the 4! support classes in the group do FAR less damage than the wizards, it makes sense to group with them.<br>
<br>
The PBAOE group's problem is that not enough classes are useful in them, and the group size of 6 is just barely enough for them to start scaling.  Add useful PBAOE spells/abilities to all the classes(3), and up XP group sizes to 12 (XP-join 2 groups), and actually DESIGN some zones around this interesting tactic.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, this is getting too specific.<br>
<br>
Losing snare probably isn't going to happen -- the cries of nerf would echo thru the lands.  Thus, wizard DD beating rogue DPH won't happen.  Other spells have to be used to make wizard attractive to grouping.<br>
<br>
Al'kabors looks like the most tempting victem to modify for a wizard's groupage.  Either that, or rain spells.(4)<br>
<br>
What if rain spells hit:<br>
1 target first wave<br>
2 targets 2nd wave<br>
3 targets 3rd wave<br>
<br>
It would up their efficiency 50% on 3 targets, and 25% on 2.<br>
<br>
&quot;Focus Items&quot; for particular rains spells could be added, giving an extra wave for that spell (with a number of target determined by the item).<br>
<br>
Or, like I've said before, double Al'kabor damage to stationary targets, and make it bounce off mezzed mobs.<br>
<br>
Or, add in near-melee-range DDs for wizards.<br>
<br>
Footnotes:<br>
(1) Per hour, counting mana regen downtime, in a good group.  This can happen post-60.<br>
<br>
(2) Or, generous/social.  But, if you gain xp faster outside of a group, few people who go through all the effort to get a group together, just for less xp.<br>
<br>
(3) Some random PBAOE ides:<br>
Give Necros PBAOE DoTs<br>
<br>
Shamans PBAOE Malo, and a miss-curse.  Possibly even group topor.<br>
<br>
Give druids a group rune-shield.<br>
<br>
Bards a long-recast AoE stun and Aggro.<br>
<br>
Warriors a way to concentrate damage on themselves (an ability that makes 40% of all attacks in melee range hit the warror, for 30 seconds, for example)<br>
<br>
Monks some AoE kicks and attacks.<br>
<br>
SKs AoE group lifetap procs<br>
<br>
I can't think of something for Rangers and Rogues, admittedly.<br>
<br>

There are 6 other classes with Snare in the game, it is hardly a challenge to find someone who can fill this role.  We get groups to BLOW THINGS UP (if you try hard enough you can work out how to use AE spells in groups, if you want more info ask away).<br>
<br>
It's clear that a lot of people think we are ok because we can solo, despite our troubles in xp groups.  The answer is to lower our soloing ability (Verant apparently figured that was the way to go - we didn't used to have snare at all, it was added later when we pointed out we don't group very well and we don't solo well).<br>
<br>
If solo ability is what is holding Verant back from fixing us as grouping characters, then I say the hell with solo ability.  Its not that taking snare away wouuld be a huge help, its that I'll trade it for grouping any day of the week.  If I want to play something solo, I'll play a more entertaining solo game.<br>
<br>
However, be of good cheer, they apparently want all classes to be equally wanted in every aspect of the game (or, at least a few select ones) so the whole discussion might be academic.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't really consider me influential in any remotest sense though, don't kid yourself.  If Verant listens to anything I say its only by accident. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 8/24/02 12:51:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 2404<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/26/02 1:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Damage Dealer Balance Problem</span><hr size=1> Yakk, very good post.  Here is my main concern with it:<br>
<br>
You have reduced entire game balancing down to damage in an xp situation.  Whether it is grouping, soloing, or raiding, xp is not the only goal, niether is damage per hour.  If your goal is killing Master Yael in the Hole, you need damage per hour until you reach the master, then you need damage per second as you kill him.<br>
<br>
Your goal need not be considered a &quot;raid.&quot;  For example, I spent several hours tonight alone in Kedge Keep soloing.  I was soloing, yes, but not for xp and not for loot.  I was trying to kill several mobs that were there just for the fun of figuring it out.  I got about 5% alt xp for my efforts, and ended up taking a 75% rez after a death.  Overall though,  it was one of the more fun nights I have had in EQ.  (I've never been big on high risk soloing before)<br>
<br>
My goal was not damage per hour.  My goal was exploration and the assassination of a couple mobs (Undertow,  Swirlspine Searhorse, to be precise).  Tools of varying importance to me during this time:<br>
<br>
Improved Invis<br>
EB item<br>
Annul Magic for thorn shields<br>
Pet dps<br>
Fast Nuke dps.<br>
Pet Heal per second<br>
Pet heal per mana<br>
<br>
I would be hard pressed to say which was most important, but since I was so relaxed and cautious spent much more time meditating than I needed.<br>
<br>
This was a solo situation, but it need not have been.<br>
<br>
I have hunted many places with friends, for reasons other than socialization.  We usually group to play the game, not grind max xp per hour.  I do not believe this is mere socialization.<br>
<br>
Why is this important?<br>
<br>
Because the value of a wizard increases in these situations.<br>
<br>
These are the two situations that must be balanced with each other.  In the XP grind situation, mana is a big limitation.  In the raid/mini-raid/adventure setting, mana/DPH is sometimes a limitation, sometimes only a minor limitation, and sometimes not a limitation at all.  In adventure settings, wizards already have great potential.  In many situations their dps is practically limited only by aggro and their ability to cast spells.<br>
<br>
While not everyone is content to have fun and explore, not everyone wants to be tuned only for max xp gain, especially if tuning them for balanced max group xp gain makes them overly powerful outside of that one environment.<br>

The only reason rogues were percieved as the best damage dealers for so long was cause their backstabs were visable for ALL to see. If groups could see the damage we crank out they would toss rogues to the dogs and want 3 wizards, 1 tank, 1 cleric, 1 chanter groups.<br>
<br>
With AA crits the &quot;perception&quot; of Wizards sucking for damage is being erased slowly. More and more melee are making Wizard Alts and telling me &quot;OMG Wizards are so fun!!&quot;. Getting a group is no longer a problem any more, and will only get better for us.<br>
<br>
After spending some time in a group I told them I needed to go soon. They started to discuss who to invite when they decided they wanted another Wizard cause of all the damage I was doing. They didn't even have a chanter, but they knew Wizard = Dead mobs fast enough to not need a chanter. To me, at that moment I knew my class was doing ok.<br>

You're trying to hijack the thread by bringing up this topic.  It's about damage dealing in xp groups only.<br>
<br>
If the changes on test go live and are as significant as they seem, then this thread will be rather obselete anyway.<br>
<br>
It fixes the dichotomy of wizards in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> raids</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> versus xp groups by making <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> raids</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> reward appropriate xp.  And when I say raid I mean raids 1-60, ranging from a Pixie Trickster to An Ancient Guardian Wurm... Where <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> raid</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> means a single combat objective.<br>
<br>
Ideally, it will mean that a group that kills a mob 5 levels higher than them and rests after every pull will get the same xp as the group that kills 10 mobs 5 levels below with no downtime.  Furthermore, the group grinding the 10 mobs with no downtime should take longer to kill the stronger mob and still possibly suffer downtime, and might possible not be capable of killing it at all.  However,  the group that killed the red mob may not be capable of grinding low blues as quickly as the other group.<br>
<br>
When I was arguing against the pet xp penalty, I showed how a dichotomy formed between what the goal of the game <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be and what the goal of a magician actually was.<br>
<br>
A magician suffering from the 50% pet penalty was faced with a choice.  He could play his class to try to realize his full potential in killing mobs as quickly as possible, -OR- he could try to realize maximum xp gain by using strategies that didn't really make sense (overnuke the pet, reclaim at the end, memory blur.. etc).  For every non-pet class the goal of gaining xp and the goal of killing mobs quickly were one and the same.  A non-pet class doesn't change its strategy to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> less</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> effective versus mobs in order to gain <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> greater</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> xp.  This was my problem with the pet xp penalty and why I argued so vehemently for it to be removed.  You were playing the game to get xp, not playing the game and being rewarded with xp.  And yes.. I admitted that one possible solution was to impose a constant penalty, which VI chose not to do.<br>
<br>
This situation is very similar.  Experience should be the reward for playing the game and accomplishing things.  It should reward better play.  The division of goals is not so clear cut here, but nonetheless the division is still there.  Groups choose to &quot;play&quot; the game in a boring fashion because it gains more xp.  In many cases, significantly more xp.  But that's not really playing, that's working.  The whole concept of &quot;grinding&quot; is a rather bad one.  <br>
<br>
Actually, the fact that the game is reduced to &quot;grinding xp&quot; actually lends a lot of weight to the &quot;We're fine at 60 argument.&quot;  Since, for so many, the game has been reduced to gaining pp and xp for 59 levels before starting to have fun, true game balance during that time doesn't matter.  It also lends weight to the soloing argument and the AE group argument.<br>
<br>
The problem is not the classes.  The problem is how those classes fit into the game as it is played, and, more specifically, the problem is the way people play the game.<br>
<br>
While making the pet argument I used two analogies to help illustrate the point, and both apply here.<br>
<br>
When a student takes a test, normally his goal is to demonstrate knowledge and ability by answering questions.  The student should be scored based on how well he performs.  For a multiple choice test, however, something changes.  If a student does not know the answer to a question, he can randomly guess the correct answer.  If an incorrect answer is scored the same as no answer, then certian scores may be inflated.  A student in this environment thus has an illogical (what I called &quot;external&quot;) goal-- that of getting a good grade on the test.  The goal of getting a good grade is separated from the goal of demonstrating knowledge because, through random guessing, a student can get a score that is not really a reflection on his knowledge, rather his ability to fill in bubbles on an answer sheet.<br>
<br>
This is why on tests like the Advanced Placement exams, tests are scored by giving points for a correct answer, zero points for no answer, and negative points for incorrect answers.  A student in this environment is encouraged to answer every question he can without resorting to random guessing.  Normally, a test is balanced such that educated guessing (when you can narrow it down to a small number of choices) will result in a better score.<br>
<br>
Another point:  If you were to totally remove the scoring system i.e. if you were taking the test for yourself alone, you would not guess.  You would probably take the test identically to the way you would take it if it was scored using the AP method.    <br>
<br>
I liken the ability to guess and earn points on a multiple choice test to flattening low blue mobs under the grind-machine of a sustained-dps oriented group.  If you were to totally remove the xp/loot system from everquest, no one would ever &quot;grind xp.&quot;  People would kill things for the challenge of it and to say they'd done it.  Of course not too many people would play eq if you took out character advancement..  But the point is that if you consider that orange bar to be a scoring system as I do, you'll find that you'll play the game differently if it's not there.  <br>
<br>
I think that is something that could/should be improved.  Getting xp should not require such a departure from the way you might ordinarily play the game.<br>
<br>
The second example I used was an america football game.  Football is a game that is played in backyards as well as professionally.  Often, when pickup games are played, score is not even kept... yet the game remains basically the same.  Your goal is to get the football to the other team's end zone, and you have 4 chances to do so, and a chance to earn 4 more chances(first down).<br>
<br>
Suppose they were to add a rule that doubled the amount of points given on 3rd down.  This would totally change Football as we know it.  This would change the basic goal from &quot;get the ball into the other team's end zone&quot; to &quot;get the ball into the other team's end zone on 3rd down.&quot;  The game would probably still be fun and interesting, but now we would have a rather illogical goal.  Furthermore, the game would be played much differently in the absence of these rule.<br>
<br>
If these new xp changes work like they are supposed to, players should be rewarded appropriately with xp for playing the game as it was meant to be.  I'm sure it will not be perfect, but it will be a step in the right direction.  That is, making the goals of having fun and earning xp be one and the same.<br>
<br>
That is my interest in this thread.  At this point I am not overly concerned with how any one class fits in to this.  I'm thinking about the health of the game as a whole.   <p><center>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Condensed version:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Experience should be the rewarded for playing the game and accomplishing things. It should reward better play.  The problem is that groups choose to &quot;play&quot; the game in a boring fashion because it gains more xp. In many cases, significantly more xp. But that's not really playing, that's working. The whole concept of &quot;grinding&quot; is a rather bad one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Ideally</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, Everquest would be played the same way by any given character whether experience existed or not.  I do not believe this goal is actually attainable, rather it is approachable.  I believe that right now, EQ is a long way from this goal.  (You can tell how the original EQ game designers tried for this.. albiet not necessarily very well, in that they hid xp gained from the player and used the vague and slow-moving orange bar)<br>
<br>
It's like the difference between taking a test that penalizes for guessing and one that doesn't.  The test that penalizes you is much more natural..  you take the test to demonstrate knowledge, not fill in bubbles on an answer sheet.  Grinding xp as opposed to being rewarded xp as you play for fun is like filling in bubbles on the test to get a better chance at a high score as opposed to answering the questions as best you can.<br>
<br>
I believe the proposed changes on test are a step in the right direction as far as solving this problem.<br>

&quot;That's why I have been suggesting removing snare from Wizard arsenals. You can still solo without snare, its just a lot harder.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would be totally opposed to this idea. I'm not willing to give up one of the few group oriented (admittedly, it has huge benefits while soloing) utility spells that I possess. I use snare to help split mobs while pulling, reduce damage while doing ghetto crowd control, and many other uses. Taking away from my utility will not help me group better.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;Yes, I want to remove it and make Wizards so that they are a class that gets groups because they DO DAMAGE.&quot;<br>
<br>
I already get groups for this reason. Further, the chanters about feint when they see me rooting/snaring mobs to HELP THEM do CC without getting totally crushed. A well timed root, snare, or stun can do wonders to help a chanter mez something.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;Everybody wins except the virulently antisocial soloing types.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would strongly disagree with this statement. What about the mid-level wizards competing with twinked melee? Honestly, utility is one of the things that WILL get them the group. I'm not suggesting snare is the only utility we offer, but it is definitely one of the big ones.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;See, when other people on other message boards talk about Wizards they say &quot;Wizards suck in xp groups, great on raids, they have manaburn and can quad kite, so I guess it all evens out.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I would never claim this all evens out. However, I will say that it was quadding that really pulled me through. I love quadding and I would be very sad to see the ability go away. Simply put, it's fun to do and it's challenging to do it in places traditionally unfriendly to the notion (i.e. seb).<br>
<br>
Branaman Wrote:<br>
&quot;The only reason I got groups in Sebilis was because I could snare, evac, and there were no Druids left.&quot;<br>

I always get groups before a druid. People are aware of the damage we do and most of the time, in my experience, will select a wizard over the druid because they get it all that way.<br>
<br>
Sir Yakk Wrote:<br>
&quot;What if you could do more damage, over time, than any class there? What if you did more damage than a rogue?(1)&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I'd go find a druid or other snarer to duo my way to massive xp as I abuse the hell out of whatever fat nukes they are going to give me in exchange for taking away snare. While I may have been balanced to &quot;group&quot; I, like many other wizards, are going to use these skills in ways unintended in the balancing vision.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;There are 6 other classes with Snare in the game, it is hardly a challenge to find someone who can fill this role.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, but what do each of the 6 different classes that can snare bring to the table? They all bring different skills and abilities the sum total of which make them attractive group mates. I fail to see how removing a key component of grouping desirability is going to make us MORE attractive to group. <br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;It's clear that a lot of people think we are ok because we can solo, despite our troubles in xp groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally, I group for fun and solo for xp. I don't think this makes it ok for all wizards. Personally, I find this suits me quite well. I agree this does NOT suit all wizards. Hopefully, a balance can be achieved that will allow wizards the freedom to freely choose between solo and group.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff Wrote:<br>
&quot;If I want to play something solo, I'll play a more entertaining solo game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your desire to play other games you deem more entertaining has nothing to do with balancing wizards in Everquest. Even offhandedly suggesting another &quot;solo&quot; game as a counterpoint to the removal of soloing for wizards is plain silly. While you may not enjoy soloing in Everquest, there are a lot of us that do. I find and tackle a great number of challenges which has been a vast source of entertainment and fun for me.<br>

I think you should also give yourself some credit. You've been an active contributing member of this community. I think many wizards respect your opinion. I've always respected your willingness to debate and discuss issues of importance to the wizards. You're no Whizbang tho (Gandalf shouts, &quot;Nerf Whizbang!&quot;)!<br>

I couldn't agree more! There is a lot of ways to enjoy this game and min/maxing is just one of many if that's your bag.<br>
<br>
I think everyone will agree that wizards currently don't enjoy the same number of options as many other classes. I'm all in favor of giving wizards, and other classes for that matter, a broader variety of ways to enjoy the game. Breaking the populace at large out of the whole &quot;min/max&quot; mentality would do a hell of a lot more to &quot;fix&quot; this then any skill you can add/remove.<br>

Part of your problem with this is that you are making the mistake of thinking I think snare could be removed and NOTHING else done.  Were that true, you'd have a point, but what I'd like to see is for Wizards to be so capable and excellent at being Wizards and doing damage that snare wouldn't be missed... except by soloers.  It's possible Verant will take their priest policy of &quot;everyone is great at everything&quot; to INT Casters, in which case they would be horrible to remove Snare from Wizards as a price to being great at grouping.<br>
<br>
You personally like to solo, that's fine, I find it tedious in this game, but I've done it to get to a goal before.  You like snare, so do I.

Personally, I like not being dependent on grouping.  I mean, I'll go group to help out a friend, or for a change, but I personally enjoy the freedom that quadding gives me.  <br>

Snare makes sense for a wizard to have, because it's one of our few defensive skills.  The purpose of root is to keep mobs from beating on us.  The purpose of gate is to get away from mobs beating on us.  The purpose of snare is to let us outrun mobs who want to beat on us.  It's our compensation for being the only int-caster class without a pet.  I think it's a good design. <p>-- <a href="mailto:tremas@optonline.net">Tremas Trueheart</a><BR>

Ok, I'll bite. What exactly would you propose in terms of changes that we could be so excellent as to not even miss a critical utility skill?<br>
<br>
Imho, it really needs to be something more than damage because turning a class into a one-trick pony isn't going to help. Ok, a two-trick pony since we'd still be able to port. Currently, groups have a wide and varied selection of damage dealers all of which provide some type of additional utility or benefit to the group.<br>
