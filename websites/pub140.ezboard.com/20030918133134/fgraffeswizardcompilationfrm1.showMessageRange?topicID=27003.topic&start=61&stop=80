<br>
Nearly everyone who says wizards are fine in groups is of the 63+ w/aa crowd.  The original post stated that at that point wizards are fairly balanced.<br>
<br>
A <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>few</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> others think we are OK in the 50's...  But the reality is that while we may scrape by, nearly everyone else contributes more to a group than we do.<br>
<br>
No one cares how efficient we are.  No one cares about cast/recast times--except us.  I have to laugh now that damage is visual, and I actually get asked to burn with Ice Comet...  I use rains for normal group damage, and get lots of Ooooh from the 600, 600, 600...<br>
<br>
I can get groups, it's not terrificaly difficult when it's even possible, but some days it's just not possible.  I've been turned down in a group for a 47 rogue in PoJ, and I'm 53.3 /boggle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wizards may end up Ok, but the 50-59 game just outright sucks.  Big improvement that would help with perception would be to move some excess spells from 60 a bit lower.  Put a big nuke at 53, another at 57 (perhaps sunstrike and Elnerniks, or slightly smaller new ones) and we will get noticed when we start using them.  <br>
<br>
And I still want an &quot;Ice Bolt of Eci&quot; spell on a pop vendor that is identical except resist to Firebolt of Tallon.  We got a ice bolt at level 1, and 61 is the brave new world. <p><br>

<br>
The actual reality is, you actually can do a lot of damage in a group in the 50s. Wizards are not hurting for damage at those levels, you just want more. This, however, is not the same thing as needing more. Wizards may or may not need a bit more group utility, but damage is not the answer. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
It is sad that there is so much momentum for the holy rule that an efficient group must contain one or more tanks, a cleric, and some form of slower. Part of the fault is that the designers have made content suited toward the traditional tank/healer/slower group; while most of the fault is because people are often too lazy to try something different (even if it means a little risk).<br>
<br>
PoP mobs hit insanely hard and fast and have considerable amount of HPs. The obvious way to address this content is the holy trio (tank, healer, slower). Sure it is possible to use multiple pets, kite, ping-pong, chain stun, and a variety of other techniques instead of the holy trio... these &quot;non-traditional&quot; group formations/tactics are not widely practiced, offer some risk, and/or require that your group mates have a little bit of grey matter and patience.<br>
<br>
Most of the time you can indeed take the initiative and form a group yourself. As group leader you have the choice to invite the holy trio, or you can break the mold and improvise with a non-traditional group. I generally warn people when I invite them however that the group may be non-traditional and may incur some stress, but it can be a lot more fun than a typical grind group. If I go for a traditional group, I change my warning -- that they may have to wait a bit until we find the tank/cleric/slower.<br>
<br>
While it is nice to have a cleric in the group... you can live without them. Slow the mob, snare it, send in the pets/tanks, have everyone stun, everyone root when necessary, and blast it hard. If you have a Cleric, tell them to load their stuns and nukes as well... You'll be surprised at how little mana will be needed for healing. If you have some room to spread the nukers out, a little communication will enable you to get the mob to ping pong like a game of frisbee.<br>
<br>
If you have the room, a safer approach may be to do some kiting. I can't solo kite many PoP mobs because their HPs surpass the amount of damage I can unload with a full bar of mana. But what if I had a partner to finish them off when I ran out, or to help when I got into trouble. Now how about 5 buddies to help pick up the slack. Imagine a group running around in a triangle, stopping at each point ahead of their snared mob to simultaneously cast 6 nukes. Booyah. Or take turns, have only 1 or 2 kiting while the other group members sit on the bench. As each kiter runs out of mana, they tag a bench warmer who finishes them off. Rotate through the group allowing the oom to med and those with mana to kite.<br>
<br>
These caster-heavy groups do not require any sort of tank (in fact sometimes tanks complicate these tactics). So you don't wait all day for a tank. If you don't need a tank, you may no longer feel pressured to find a cleric and slower. Sure it is safer to have a healer and slower, but if you're group is good, the mob will never touch anyone.<br>
<br>
What about pulling? Ocassionally the FD puller is needed. You might be surprised though how a little bit of harmony or a long-range, low-agro (cancel magic) spell will work. Root, atone, mez, charm, etc are all fine ways to deal with multi pulls (let us not forget the beauty of AEs as well).<br>
<br>
Do you not agree that all these group tactics are as valid as the &quot;traditional&quot; group? Yes? Then we need to market these types of groups. It would be great if SOE helped us market these groups though!<br>
<br>
If Clerics are so crucial to a group and imbalance class selection for groups... why not have groups take a small experience penalty for having a cleric in the group? That might make people think twice about forming a traditional group. Maybe a bit too harsh? Then how about penalties for large heals (e.g. raise the non-raid-mob agro for CH, increase the mana cost, etc)? Having several hybrid healer classes spreading out agro with small heals would increase their grouping karma -- and Clerics would finally be able to do more than just heal. With healing penalties kicked up people might respect the old saying, &quot;The faster you burn em down, the less you have to heal.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;not-so-group-attractive classes&quot; have a commonality in DPS... How about designing more content for the DPS caster group? Make the creatures hit slower, softer, but counter that with something bad happening if you don't kill them within a certain amount of time: e.g. they spawn another mob (annoying green mob), they heal themselves, they become increasingly higher in AC and/or resistance (only while under attack), etc.<br>
<br>
If the non-traditional groups are not popular because of the risk, efficiency (pull rate), or most likely because of the amount of non-laziness it takes to find a good non-traditional group, then SOE should award these non-tradtional groups with an experience bonus.<br>
<br>
Why fix one of the broken group classes when you can fix a dozen of them?<br>
<br>
I fear if non-traditional groups took off, the Warriors would really suffer... They are already struggling in the traditional groups due to their difficulties with holding agro.<br>
<br>
Personally though, I'll take the fun of a non-traditional group any day to the boring grind of watching a tank go toe to toe with each mob. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

I've duoed with Paladins, warriors, and shadowknights. I've also regularly started groups without tanks at all. Any class that logged on, i would group. I don't have a problem with grouping myself, and I've said this before many times. I have only about 290 AA's, but I stopped getting AA's because i'm not attracted to any of the options i see left. <br>
<br>
What i'm trying to say is the average wizard is not going to get grouped more often with just about any group friendly spell, unless it allows us to break into the holy trinity.  <br>

Yes, this is very well possible and very nice exp. Tanks would not fit in that groupsetup. I do those groups regularily.<br>
<br>
But keep in mind, this is ONLY possible for ele flagged wizards, and as far as i know, PoFire is the only place worth doing a groupsetup like that.<br>
This excludes the 'standard' Wizard who has not acces to PoFire.<br>

Ya, i agree here, too, but that does not mean that we shouldn't try for even more damage capabilities or at the very least - we should be able to keep our standing ammoung the other damage dealing classes. (Keep this in mind when they look into the other damage dealing melee classes. 1200 Backstabs with the fennin dagger are not exceptions, it is norm.)<br>

I agree and I disagree... that &quot;fringe&quot; is where a lot of the action happens, that's true. On the other hand, that mold that you are trying to fit in, is a mold that fits me nicely, so I don't see a whole lot of reason to try and break out of it. What's more: I don't want to be locked out of the mold, or, for that matter, locked into it, like warriors and clerics often are.<br>

<br>
I think every class compares themselves to the strengths of other classes and says - we dont match up and we should, waa. Wizards rarely compare our grouping capabilities to warriors or our solo capabilities to rogues. Druids are envious that clerics get invited to groups quicker and clerics are envious that druids get xp quicker. It's really tedious at times.<br>
<br>
Saying rogues can BS for 1200 is like when melee get annoyed when I back to back crit for 6k. All classes have advantages and disadvantages and acting like rogues dont have their fair share of downsides isnt reasonable.<br>
<br>
That we have had so many boosts over the last 18 months is thanks to the constructive whiners tis true. So thanks &gt;_&lt;. <br>
<br>
But I dont think we need any boosts at 65 atm. It's hard to be objective when you love a class I know, but understand that others love their class too and they need some help atm.<br>
<br>
Maybe at 51-59 we need a little help, I dunno; but I know wiz are a lot better off than when I did it and I did ok. Maybe at 1-50 we need a boost now we've lost kei but that goes by soo fast now anyway; ditto for 61-64.<br>

Totally agree here, one thing that will make us more attractive to groups is if we outdamage any other class out there. Every intelligent group is going to want the best dps possible.  <p>Sage Flintnilf Ironori<br>

Bring on Flappy sharing the buffs he gives us, (at least as a % if not full, thats a speperate arguement) with the group we are grouped with.  Ta Da!!! Group bonus, without become a &quot;buffing&quot; class.  No ...&quot;Dude could you cast Flappy on me?&quot;  Just ,&quot;Hey man, wanna group?&quot;<br>

The best part about this is as there are different flavor flappies. It already scales in power.<br>

Would that make us as wanted as the holy Trinity?  Nope, not at all and so what?  Im not wanting to break into the holy 3, Im wanting a simple improvement, rather than being a one trick DPS pony.  And please, let the arrogent among us chill out with the &quot;We bring more than... blah blah blah&quot;, I know how to play my class... you know what I mean for heavens sake, chill.<br>
<br>
Its not much, its small, but it could affect that &quot;perception&quot; everyone speaks of so fondly.  You know the perception that we really only bring DPS to a group, and since others bring enough to do the job in a a group AND they heal/summon/buff etc etc...  Yup, its a perception all right.. unfortunately for the sub uber among us more battle tested wizards, its a perception thats accurate.

It was truly a joke.  It took less than a minute to burn each mob.  We cleared the boat so fast, we had to sit and wait for repop.  TWICE!  Before that group got together, it was me, the bard, and a 51 Cleric, and we still controlled the boat.<br>
<br>
It isn't that situational to have non-traditional groups.  Most everything outside of PoP (at least in the 51 &amp; under levels) doesn't hit near as hard, or as fast, as PoP mobs.  However, in both groups last night, I had a hard time convincing the bard, then the ranger, that we didn't need a tank or a healer.  Maybe it's because some people don't solo much, so they're not comfortable being able to handle things themselves.  Wizards are.  If it's dk blue, we know we can solo it (unless it summons or something like that).  So, we are less concerned about taking a non-traditional group, and doing something.<br>
<br>
Under 50, however, probably needs addressed, now with the nerf to KEI.  The total amount of melee loot that is being dropped, and the relatively low prices of these items, couple with the high prices of lower level tradeskill items, makes even noob melee able to twink themselves  (go to bazaar with 100pp, and see what kind of melee gear a level 5 tank can buy).  Either level restrict a lot of that stuff, or increase prices for vendors so it gets sold to vendors, not lower levels, who then use it to overpower the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=claudshadowflare>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Has Eddie Murphy's<BR>taste in women</span><br>  Posts: 3763<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/03 9:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> Bah, wish I had gotten to this thread earlier, but if you're trying to say we have no purpose other than nuking in groups, you've only an extremely precursory knowledge of your root, snare, and stun spells.

Root = Useless in a lot of PoP exp encounters...<br>
Snare = Same... (does not stick very well, IF the mob is not immune, lalalala.)<br>
Stun= no comment in the higher planes.<br>
Telekin = useless in the higher planes, but a nice aggro hooker.<br>
<br>
Oh ya, you can land the DD component of Telekin on a mob after a chanter tashed it for you... But you get only the DD component, not the stun on it (on most ele planes mobs) and... you get nice aggro, too. (Aside the fact, if you have a chanter in the group you don't need to root and stun...)<br>

Nope, all that matters in PoP is our damage abbility. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rainblowb>RainblowB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/03 10:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Root = not usless in the majority of the pop encounters that i have been in (all the way up to BoT...  above that i have no idea).  sometimes it might not last very long, but you have time to recast it if snared.<br>
<br>
Snare = not usless either..  i have found that my snare will stick 95% on the first cast.  i have used it to prevent mobs from running away in CoD, to save my life and my groups in HoH, and as the only snarer in PoV.  only problems i have with snare is that every once in awhile there is either an immune one, or a higher-than-normal magic resist mob.<br>
<br>
Stun = Tlekin is a god send!!  all the lower lvl stunns dont stun for crap in PoV/PoS and up....  but tlekin..  OMG OMG!!  the only time i see aggro from the stun part of the spell is if we have a War for a MT in my groups.  i have saved chanters, druids, MT's, me, and clerics with this spell..  stops a mob long enuff to cast 2 roots or 2 snares, or root and snare.  only problems i have with it are the occasonial resists, and the named's that are usually immune to snare and stun.<br>
<br>
so for me all your points make no sense.  in pop i only rarely do i have a problem with snare, root, stun.  and while tash does help stun and magic alot in landing, it isnt everything, i have been resisted on AT, EER and tele both with and without tash..  but then i play with a chanter in most of my groups anyways..  =P<br>

&quot;correct. necros are great in groups, and did you know that beastlords can give mana and hps at the same time? How long will it take for &quot;perceptions&quot; to change? Takes much longer than a couple of months. Mind wrack has been with necros for at least 2 expansions, nobody cares. &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes I did, I was using the bst crack as an example. How long does it take for 'perceptions' to change? Lifetimes, look at human history for many examples of that. Nobody cares? One reason is that people dont know of these spells, I think that players dont know of this spell b/c of the limited use of it (mob must have mana) and people don't want to group with a necro to find out.<br>
<br>
Are we going to get something that is going to break the holy trinity? I believe never. <br>
<br>
So that leads us to either some way to have more benefits for non-traditional groups and/or some group buff to help. I don't trust sony to do the former without really messing it up. So that leads to the latter, but to start the ONLY thing we can offer for the whole group is evac, nothing else. We are the only class that is that way, every other class can do something for the other members of the group (via buff or summon items). Which is one reason we are at a disadvantage for getting a group. No one can say right now 'Oh get the wizard they can do blank for the group'. All other classes can fill in that blank with at least SOMETHING, it might not be huge (ie sow, summon arrows, etc) but its SOMETHING.<br>
<br>
Yes we can burn things and burn them good. We can also bring the dps to a group, what we don't bring is some sort of buff or effect to a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mukaka>Mukaka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/03 11:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> You certainly can root and snare in PoP.

<br>
I personally would rather not have the flappy effect turn into some cheap group buff. Bards have all sorts of that type of group buff; I don't see them in high group demand. If I wanted to be a bard, I'd play a bard.<br>
<br>
The only real change that is needed is to fix the amount of agro generated from healing. Some time ago someone took pity on the clerics and enchanters for getting so much agro - so they adjusted the agro down. If they left the agro alone, then we'd see more creative group hunting and there would be many more classes that would be attractive to groups. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

In that very thread they mention how druid / wizzy CC is even replacing their mez with Snare / Greater Fetter.  Yet on our boards we see Root = useless.<br>

All that adding more agro to heals is going to do is screw warriors over, most of them have a hard time to control agro as it is let alone add something that is going to add to their problems. Also the uproar from the shaman, druid, cleric communities will not go over well. In order to make one group set more desired, changing aspects of other classes (ie nerfing) is not the way to do it.<br>

<br>
It's perception, but it's also what a LOT of players got used to from 51-56 in the Kunark days, to the 1-60 days of Velious where wizards were GROSSLY underpowered compared to the melee classes.<br>
<br>
Think about it, we went for a LONG LONG LONG time where wizard damage was considered sub-par.  AA points in Luclin went a long way to helping, but it took until PoP AA abilities for wizards to really get back to being considered a &quot;primary damage dealing class&quot;.  <br>
<br>
In the pre-60 game, I agree, wizards need work, but being able to get to level 65 has done something a lot of people have overlooked.  A lot of the OLD uber encounters are now able to get taken down by the average high level guild.  The perception that wizards as a class don't have the damage output needed to compete in the 60+ range is somewhat flawed.  Focus items, flowing thoughts, horses(ok, only in outdoor zones, but still deserves to be mentioned), these things have all boosted wizard power levels.  Now that all characters can see our damage output(if they don't turn it off), the perceived impact of our spells can at least be correct.  Dropping a 604 damage Conflagration at level 44 is still a decent bit of damage/cast.<br>
  If you want an ID 3 item, it IS possible to buy a Erudite made robe now.  So it's not impossible to get the items needed to boost damage output.  <br>
