With Numbers</span><hr size=1> OK, something has struck me about the PoP expansion and Wizards are probably the most likely to suffer it.<br>
<br>
The problem stems from Focus Items, how they effect spells and the outcome of using them with the old spells versus the position of the new spells.<br>
<br>
See, Focus 3 items are relatively common *AND* they are achievable by practically all players.  For sure, while a more casual player might need to use a completely statless item, while uberguild player gets the focus effect from an item that would be nice on its own otherwise, the choice is there.<br>
<br>
So from Verants own design focus has become part of the game and available to all.<br>
<br>
Whether this is correct or wrong isn't hugely relevant.  The bottom line is that it does exist.  So changes with the post 60 spell focus effects has to reflect the existing position.<br>
<br>
Now for some classes - most notably buff classes - the raw efficiency of spells isn't as important as other aspects.  That extra 350hp Clerics can give is 350hp and worth spending mana just to get it.  But Wizards most fundamental measure is their sustained DPS (or DPH, whatever your measure).  And this is directly related to the efficiency of the spells.<br>
<br>
So I have looked at all the spells to which we get upgrades in PoP.  I've not bothered with &quot;Incremental&quot; Cold as we don't get one.  The term incremental I use for the spells which increase in the damage position with levels (the big bangs).  So I've looked at &quot;Incremental&quot; Magic and Fire and Draughts to all three resists.<br>
<br>
This is a ROUGH analysis to give an indicative result only.  If someone wants to run some parsing and make adjustments for the small resist adjustment on post 60 spells, feel free.<br>
<br>
For Focus 3 efficiency, I've used a 10% mana saving (MP3) and averaged the gain from Improved Damage 3 at an average of 10%.<br>
<br>
Spell--------------Level    Damage    Mana  Efficiency    Focus 3 Eff<br>
Sunstrike-----------60        1615        450        3.59        4.39<br>
Garrison's-----------60        2100        540        3.89        4.75<br>

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
Rend 2--------------60        1890        525        3.60        4.40<br>
Agnar's Thunder-----63        2305        580        3.97        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
Draught of Jiva-------56        688        215        3.20        3.91<br>
Draught of Thunder---63        950        255        3.73        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
Draught of Fire-------51        688        215        3.20        3.91<br>
Draught of Ro--------62        950        255        3.73<br>
<br>
<br>
So what do we see here.<br>
<br>
Well in EVERY SINGLE CASE, using post 60 spells is a significantly inferior.  Any Wizard who does not have access to Focus 4 level items is doing less DPS than they can manage with the existing spell lines.  There is no reason to be post 60 unless you have access to them.<br>
<br>
Therefore we can draw a conclusion.  Wizards to be effective - to even bother levelling post 60 - need the Focus 4 level effects to match what is already available to them.<br>
<br>
And there's the rub.<br>
<br>
Verant have CHANGED the design.<br>
<br>
The Focus 4 level mana conserve is split, with most EXLUDING damage spells.  Not only that.  Improved Damage is split itself.  Instead of an inclusive Focus to cover your damage, you need one for Magic, one for Fire, one for Cold.  And it doesnt stop there.  The Focus 4 level effects do NOT have the statless alternative which were the mainstream of the vast majority of players who are not part of the uberguild scene.<br>
<br>
Oh I'm sure there will be those in the uberguild scene who will love this.  The differential gets exponentially larger (as if it isn't already large enough!) and they get more attention as the regular players fight over the tradeable scraps from their table - go farm some light blues for 10 hours because there is nothing you can get in a group.<br>
<br>
As things stand, Wizards outside the uberguild scene face the stark choice that levelling is not important to them.  With the new resist model, levels are much less important then they once were, which means that the gains in efficiency from just doing AA and forgetting about levels is far better for the vast bulk of the player base.  Almonst uniquely amongst classes!<br>
<br>
The stark reality is that without changes and Verant reverting the design, reitemising their Focus Item dropping to make the old style statless Focus available in the Focus 4 range, Wizards will be left behind other classes.  Sure for the uberwizards there isn't much problem but this tiny minority aren't really the proper focus for a mainstream gaming product.<br>
<br>
PoP has been out for over 4 weeks now.  It is possible to make quite accurate assumptions about the itemisation (hi monks and your lack of any items whatsoever).  It doesnt take a brain surgeon to see the changes of Focus itemisation, the lack of opportunity outside the narrow elite in hte ubergame.  If Focus had originally worked like this there wouldn't be a problem.  But it didn't work like this.  Mainstream players got their Focus 3, even if the items were statistically inferio, and that has to be the baseline for the expansion.<br>
<br>
To change the whole system and basically negating the entire point of levelling for Wizards is just the height of Verant's stupidity. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theunmistakablevoiceofreason>The Unmistakable Voice of Reason</A> at: 11/17/02 7:52:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baronwhizbang>Baron Whizbang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/17/02 7:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Post 60 Spells Worthless.

A flawed methodology, and something of a whiny bitch conclusion at that.<br>
<br>
Especially considering that the post-61 fire focus has twice the effect that an Improved Damage IV item would have and comes from a zone you can get to without flags at level 46. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=49189" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz_toon.gif" height="104" width="390" alt="stats" border=0></a>

There are lots of resist specific focus effects floating around PoP, even in the tier 1/2 zones.  Learn to take advantage of those.<br>
<br>
Also when you say you're using a MP item, are you assuming that it's always saving you 10% mana?  I see you mentioned you averaged the ID but not the MP.  If so, your calculations are off.  It's 1-10% random savings.  I also wouldn't call the 61-65 spells &quot;signifigantly inferior&quot; either.  You're only looking at base damage values on Draughts for example but you don't take into account the -50 resist check on the new ones.<br>
<br>
Oh and as Whiz has already pointed out... Mages get focus items that affect spells up to level 60. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:xx-small;">Officer of Triton, Member of Team Ice, Povar<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458434">Rombus, Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5702">Rommy, 61 High Priest</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jahvethesorcerer>Jahve the Sorcerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/17/02 9:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Post 60 Spells Worthless.

Really.<br>
<br>
Well, for Improved Damage 3, I spent 80 minutes in CT2, for Improved Range 3, I spent 45 minutes in Karnors and for MP3, i bought an item for 12k.<br>
<br>
Now they aren't *good* items.  But they are there and in game, which is the point.  The development of Focus 3 level items has allowed them to basically become part of class balance.  Focus 4 ISNT, it is apparently a strict reward.  This WOULD have been fine if it had applied to Focus 3 as well.  With it not applying to Focus 3, it devalues all the 60+ spells because you can no longer assume Focus enhancements.<br>

Sorry, I didn't get the chance to respond to everything yesterday.<br>
<br>
You raise two points - that Focus 4 is available and available in tier 1 and 2 zones.  Also that mage summons have Focus 4 level abilities.<br>
<br>
Second point first - mages hardly need the ability to be more desirable given that they are currently the most over-powered class in the game behind Bards.  The new melee-beating pets and the resist changes (which basically devalued lures) have made mages beyond comparison with most classes.  The requirement to group with a single class or (worse) to have to waste time every play session finding one and buying/begging for focus isn't particularly useful.  Again perhaps it is different for people who play 5 or more hours a day.  But that is very few people.<br>

For the availabilty of Focus 4, I don't think you are right.  I recognised in my first post that they are now split (that's PART of the problem - you need more for the same effect and where the MP4 equivalent that works on DD is, I do not know).  This means more slots and more items.  But they DO NOT exist.  The only generally available Focus 4 items that we can see are almost all restricted to Hybrids.  The expansion is out for over 4 weeks, we can draw ACCURATE conclusions about how it is playing out.<br>
<br>
Verant have changed the way focus works.  Instead of being able to get poor quality (as an item) pieces for non uberguild members and good statted items for ubers, you now have a strict pecking order.  Only the uber attainable items exist.  <br>

It is!  It will remain beyond a number of players permenantly (you know, it would not surprise me at all if MORE players had never killed Vindicator than had - and that's a mob that was trivial when Velious launched for anyone with 5 Clerics at hand). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theunmistakablevoiceofreason>The Unmistakable Voice of Reason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/18/02 4:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Post 60 Spells Worthless.

Yes, I didn't dispute that.

The fact is that the top level pre-PoP nuke that non-ubers can get is fire. The first non-lure upgrades wizards get are fire and fire (tears and draught). The +20 percent (not +10 percent, as with ID items) fire item is available off a not-hard miniboss in PoI -- which you can get to without a flag, and with a pick-up grade. The item is also droppable and is starting to show up in the Bazaar on many servers.<br>
<br>
Combine that with a marginal amount of work to get focii (and just kill yourself in a duel and leave your body with your focii somewhere convenient) and you're in as good a shape as ever.<br>
<br>
None of that is at all uber, far from it.<br>

While I do think that VI could of done a better job at populating the PoP world with items (does seem to be a general lacking of all around loot). Its not nearly as bad as you make it out to be .. but on the same note, it would be nice if VI bumped our spells up a notch or two so w/o focus effects they are better then 60 with focus effects. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theunmistakablevoiceofreason>The Unmistakable Voice of Reason</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/18/02 7:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

That's wonderful.  I can possibly get lucky in a raid or save up for three to six months and get a focus item for spells that do not exist in my game.<br>
<br>
Well that's useful.<br>
<br>
Then I have to buy an item from a zone that for some reason is DENIED to the majority of the people actually paying for the zone.  Course I'll still not have cold focus.  Or range focus.  Or Mana reduction.<br>
<br>
Again, i feel you have completely missed the point.<br>
<br>
Splitting Focus into individual resists, removing mana saving from available focus for DD, turning all the focus into much more &quot;reward&quot; and less available items, these are things I personally would not have a problem with.<br>
<br>
EXCEPT, that Verant already introduced Focus and had a much different design philosophy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milaru00>Milaru 00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 931<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/18/02 9:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> do you even play a wizard?  and if you do, do you have a better idea of the wizard class than you showed of the monk class with its 950 ac prekunark?<br>

I did notice, however, that at least the ID4 for fire (the first one you need for lure/draught of ro is easy (mostly) to get.  I will say though, if you aren't in a decent guild you are probably screwed for a long time.  But the way the game works you basically have to be screwed.<br>

If they made things easy for non ubers (or people in decent guilds) they would be trivial for people in the ubers.<br>
<br>
If I didn't have goals in a game, I wouldn't play though.  Being level 65 will open up the resists, I don't care how much they changed resist code.  I was 61 in PoV getting resisted reasonably often (going against white cons) ding 62 and resists went down drastically.<br>

I just want to chip in here that its been mentioned that the mini-boss dragon in PoI is 'trivial' to kill if you raid at all. <br>
<br>
I'm in what feels like a strong guild, we kill HoT, we kill Vindi, we kill Woushi, but we dont have 40 people so theres limits in what we can do, I know people in other guilds a lil better than mine. KIlling that PoI dragon is a pipe dream to us, we aspire to it. its not &quot;easy&quot; its not &quot;trivial&quot;. As i read you guys say its trivial, I remembered a conversation with some friends about it it where espoused rumors of &quot;It quads for 700!, Its got this AoE! blah blah blah&quot;. <br>
<br>
The fact that 2 of you think its a trivial battle partially illustrates that guys view that there is a atmosphere of uberness on this board. <br>
<br>
It may be trivial to you, and yours, but I doubt it is to the majority of wizards out there would agree that its 'trivial'.<br>

<br>
Mage foci are reasonably availiable.  They last until you log off, and can be left on a corpse if you have lots of short playing sessions and little access to a mage.<br>
<br>
Tradeskill items with focus effects exist, however due to the imbue parchement shortage aren't that much in game yet.  There is a change to how imbue spells are going to come into the game coming next patch, so I expect focus based jewelry and potted items to become more common.<br>

Aphasia, that dragon isn't that easy, but should be doable.  Team up with another guild or two and zerg the dragon if you have to.  You get key access to the factory in innovation, that is worth the effort -- the key lets you bring friends with you to a sub zone rougly equivilent to PoV/PoS.<br>

If your point is that change is bad, I have to disagree. I found focus items to be dull and wizards had an unfair advantage with them pre-PoP, as we only had one that we really needed to concentrate on, and that one was droppable and easily obtainable for at least half of the appropriate level range.

*nod*, junk beast is a bit of a surprise.<br>
<br>
Did him with 2 rag tag groups.<br>
<br>
The really annoying part of him is getting unmezzable adds, and the aoe blind he gives off.  Cleric had to cheal blindly for a bit.<br>
<br>
We wiped the first time we tried him with 9 people because of the blind &amp; 4 adds.  Second time was a clean pull, and we where ready for the blind.<br>
<br>
Drops a few good items, but nothing that an uber guild would want -- at the same time, stuff your guildies would drool over, heh.<br>
<br>
To find his spawn point, zone in, turn left, go down the valley to the first junktion.  He spawns in the room to the right, behind the door, IIRC.  The mobs in there are hard, but good xp in the 60s.  Expect to die if he spawns, and then call in reinforcements.<br>
<br>
No, he isn't a common spawn, but the area is good xp anyhow.  =)<br>
