This is because, time and time again, the rest of the group says &quot;we don't need 2 wizards.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other night, looking for people, we pulled in a second wizard.<br>
<br>
Myself<br>
Second wizard<br>
SK<br>
Enchanter<br>
<br>
Odd xp group, yes, but it worked (mostly running fears.)<br>
The thing that struck me the most was this...<br>
<br>
What's the other wizard doing?  I got the impression that he wasn't doing ANYTHING.  I started to get pissed off...there's a lot of xp-leeches around, and I figured we just got another one.<br>
<br>
Before I say anything, I start watching him.  Very very carefully.  Turned all outputs on so I could watch the battle.  I watched, very carefully, for his spells.<br>
<br>
Ya'know what?  He was doing fine. <br>
<br>
Unless you're grandstanding and burning something down, people just don't see you.   You're invisible.<br>
They don't see you stand up...their back is to you.<br>
If they have spelleffects off, they don't even see the<br>
spells land.  Invisible damage.<br>
<br>
As a wizard, knowing exactly WHAT to look for, I could see the contribution of the other wizard.  When I was not explicitly looking for it...he was invisible.<br>
<br>
Ipso facto (and I really just wanted to say that), we're all invisible.<br>
<br>
Probably get a lot of flak from the guilded people, and the higher levels who know on a subconcious level that the wizard IS actually contributing.   However, as the current popular saying goes, there IS life pre-60.<br>
<br>
Fact?  Fiction?  It's all about perception.<br>

<br>
Many times in a group, especially pre50, you will hear snide remarks about sitting on your ass leeching exp. Any time I hear this, I make it a point to educate the ignorant melee.<br>
<br>
Next time some melee is doubting your contibution, tell them that you will not nuke for the next 5 mobs. When the cleric gets LOM - make them sweat a little, then stup up and nuke when they get in trouble.<br>
<br>
Most melee don't realize how much shorter a fight will be when a wizzy is doing his job. Wizzies make fast pull groups possible in many cases. If you get really luscky you will be fighting mobs that run - see how many mobs it takes them to figure out how important it is to snare every mob.<br>

My main is a 51 ShadowKnight, and I never really noticed a wizard. I always knew that they did lots of damage, only never noticed it unless I was on a multi-group raid. Now that I play one (only level 16, havent even gotten my 16 spells yet) I notice how much damage we do. I cant wait till I get an aoe group going on (I play a gnome wizzie, and my roommate plays a gnome chanter, both leveling together). <br>

Not if you're watching the mob's hp bar lol.<br>

And not taking another wizard because you have one already is pure idiocy.  Two wizards is twice the power of one wizard, there aren't really a whole lot of classes you can say that about in EQ.<br>

<br>
Most people are on slow links, or are out of mob-refresh range.  Any updates seen on the bar are possibily lag-related, and so any &quot;chunk&quot; is attributed to lag.  Remember, they're melees and USED to it.  They won't think twice about a chunk going away in a normal non-burn situation.<br>

<br>
Part of this probably will never change, they can't see our damage, and the blast we do doesn't make as much of an impression as watching your hp bar go the other way from dying.  But at least part of it would be helped by Wizards being given visible boosts in patches and comments by Verant. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uchifiir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chifiir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/2/01 7:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Inivisible damage</span><hr size=1> I was more thinking along these lines...<br>
<br>
Mob's HP bar is red.  As melee's attack it, and through normal updates, it is red and diminishes (as it does now.)<br>
<br>
When a damage nuke lands, the bar turns yellow and a refresh is pushed to the clients so that the damage update in instantanious.  Not &quot;slides down&quot; but drops in a single, discrete chunk.<br>
<br>
It's not more battle spam that people turn off.<br>
It won't show exact damages.<br>
They're nukes, and shouldn't KEEP the bar yellow except in raid situations.  <br>
Overhead should be minimal, except on large raid situations.<br>
<br>
That way non-melee damage is visible, but doesn't add battle spam and doesn't show exact damages.<br>
<br>
I don't know how well it would work without a test run in a raid situation.  People may then complain about DoTs not showing up.<br>
<br>
At least when that bar goes yellow and starts dropping then melees won't contribute it to lag/slow refresh times.<br>

I have had the same problem, with my grp were they ask if im nuking the mob at all, and offen they are quit surpice when I tell how must dmg im doing to the mop. <br>
I was considering at one point to make a hoykey sayin somthing like a %t has been nuked, and say that in /gsay but that will only add to the spawn, any idea,<br>
or shoud we wizards just hope that other ppl know enouf about our class and what power we bring to a grp?<br>

It started out as me and a rogue, and then the 2nd wizzy joined.  I'm 31, the other wizzy and rogue were both 35, so a good Paw XP group.<br>
<br>
We stayed in the bedroom for a while, and the 2 wizards would sit on opposite sides and ping-pong gnolls as the rogue brought them in, and he'd backstab them as they ran between myself and Vincit, the other wizard.  Gnolls died FAST.  The rogue loved it, cause all the downtime was our mana regen, mostly while he pulled.<br>
<br>
Then a chanter joined us, and we started pulling 2s and 3s, using Cast Force while the chanter stunned.  Skins are VERY nice to have in this case, but again, it worked REALLY well, cause the rogue could backstab the stunned mobs (and our AoEs WAY out-aggroed him).<br>
<br>
When other classes (pally, druids) joined us, they were all REALLY surprised at how quick stuff was dying.  Now, this IS Paw, where a 35 wizzy and 31 wizzy only have to cast 2 times each to kill anything (1200 HPs, I'm doing 250 dmg / cast, he's at 300, i think), so both wizards nuking 1x / mob is almost half of it's life.  With chanter tash and my fluxxes, resists were non-existant.<br>
<br>
The whole point here, is that I think I figured out where we have to work on educating other classes: 29 - 35 (maybe down to 20 now, with Garrison's mana shock).  This is where 1 or 2 wizards have enough firepower to REALLY hurt mobs that they're hunting.  OT has been the same thing for me: groups REALLY notice me, even if I only cast 1x / mob, unless I'm the lowest level in the group (still hit that level limit if I've got a 36 warrior pulling).<br>
<br>
Any other lvl 29-34 wizards noticing anything like this, or did I just have a REALLY good day today and Tuesday? <p><br>Aniar Orrenson

I made a series of hotkeys, like clerics use.  I did one for each of my three stuns, and one for my nukes.  And, I used them.<br>
<br>
The group would see me keep the mob stunlocked, and know it was me.  Used to be, they'd know it's stunlocked, but not really say anything.<br>
<br>
Anyway...I'm now a very, very popular wizard for normal exp grind groups.  Almost every group I'm in, with people I've never grouped with end up at the end of the night with comments like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn, you're a *great* wizard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Shiz, going to put you on my friends list, okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jeez Shiz, you're really effective&quot;<br>
<br>
etc...<br>
<br>
So, I'd suggest trying it.  Make the hotkeys and use them.  Only once have I had someone complain about the spam, and he was an idiot anyway.<br>

I turn off everything I don't need.  I don't have other melee damage on the text box, mainly because in raids I could never see a command given because of all the spam.  I also turned off bard songs and spells to group only.  If tanks did the same thing they won't know when we are casting.<br>
   But I'm also hoping the tanks are giving me a little respect to know I'm doing damage.  I usually also have some a couple stuns up if I'm not the one snaring.  This is to stun right at the beginning of the fight just in case the aggro isn't on the tank he can have time to taunt.  Also if the tank is getting low on health and a CH is coming in I chain stun to keep the mob from doing damage until the CH comes in.  And last but not least to keep the mob from CHing or Gating.  This is probably when the tanks see that i'm doing some work cause the see the mob is stunned. <p><img src="http://mechops.homestead.com/files/sigtrial.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uthediscoinferno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The DiscoInferno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/11/01 11:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perception from melees...</span><hr size=1> Turn on your other hits filter and watch the melee's damage fly, it's disgusting <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aniar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 381<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/12/01 10:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perception from melees...</span><hr size=1> I heard from my assistant GL about a lvl 47 pally who got a new axe from Maiden's... getting 200+dmg / swing w/ a 50 delay.<br>

It's just general perception.  Within a period of a month or two and with no real changes, rogues went from being a &quot;well, there's nobody else LFG&quot; class to a &quot;wow, rogues rock!&quot; class.  It's not because people started adding &quot;Backstabbing %T for XXX&quot; emotes to their hotkeys.  People just slowly realized that when there was a rogue in the group, mobs died faster.<br>
<br>
Melees have the hardest time paying attention to what's going on.  They have to be up close to the mob, blocking their sight and turning their back on either adds or the party.  They can't turn Own Hits off (and believe me, sometimes I really wish I could).  End result - bad field of vision and tons of spam on top of it.  Yet, somehow, melees seem to be far more likely to notice &quot;A_mob looks uncomfortable&quot; or &quot;A_mob is shackled to the ground&quot;.<br>
<br>
So don't just blame melees.  Blame people who are unwilling to take chances.  Blame people who don't pay attention during a fight.  Blame people who just don't care.  <p><center> <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="background-color: black;"> <tr><td colspan="3"><img src="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/Shariin.gif" alt="Shariin"></td></tr> <tr style="color: white; background: rgb(40,35,40); text-align: left; font: italic bold 10pt sans-serif;"> <td>Shariin Shadowblade</td> <td style="text-align: center; color: rgb(128,128,128);">House of Kindred</td> <td style="text-align: right;">Assassin</td> </tr> </table> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukitsinu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kitsinu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/20/01 3:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not always...</span><hr size=1> I had the dubious pleasure of being on a Venril Sathir's Remains raid on Sunday.  There were several Wizards waiting on the Venril Sathir spawn that helped out on this, among them, the board's own Graffe.  As the only Cleric for the actual fight, I wasn't happy at all.  No hastes, no clarity, no possibility of slowing the mob.  We were simply too weak to take the mob down with what we had.  I expected up to take it down to 80% before we all died.  I hadn't fought that particular mob, but it was a rare spawn epic mob, so I had a good idea what to expect.  The Main Assist started the fight and I started my complete heal.  He died before it ever landed.  If he couldn't tank the mob, no one else could either, so things looked even worse from the start.  A good tanking Monk got agro and I went to immediate CH and the Monk feigned before he was killed.  Heal lands and he is up and taking the damage again.  Spell recycles and I am hitting the heal again.  We have some deaths by now, and I am at about 40% mana, so I sneak a peek at the mob's health (using a cheesy cleric trick called assist healing) and see it is at 70%.  Not as bad a loss as I expected, but not a chance in hell of winning.  I announced during the 10 second long complete healing cast time &quot;We lose badly.&quot;  The heal lands and I take another look at the mobs health between heals.  It is down to a sliver!  I had to check the name again to make sure it wasn't one the people on the raid, but sure enough, it was the mob.  As I was looking on incredulously, it even started running.  Not for long though as Ralanorn beat everyone else to the killing shot.<br>
<br>
This was probably the ugliest, worst, successful raid to take down Venril Sathir's Remains.  There is no way any other three or four people could have made the difference that the Wizards made on that raid when they unloaded.  Kudos.  Perhaps I am too ignorant of Wizards, but it does seem to me that the familiars are a great addition to the class.  Downtime means far less wasting of the Wizards damager per hour, so they are that much more welcome.  Whether that is true or not, I will certainly keep a better eye on &quot;Invisible Wizards&quot;.  Just keep your mana high for those emergencies, too many try to stay low on mana so they can regen during downtime.  I hope the familiars help reduce the need by Wizards to stay low mana so their ability can shine through when the oportunity arises. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=616.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=616.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=616.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=616.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
