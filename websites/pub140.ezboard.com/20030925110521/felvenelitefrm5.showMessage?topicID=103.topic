<br>
Vladimirski raised his hand and cut Ary's rant short &quot;Time will tell Master Aryllyian.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot see....&quot; Ary said while shaking his head in bewilderment. &quot;I cannot see how any good can come of this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vladimirski smiled and crossed his hands behind his back, and turned toward the door.  &quot;I will take my leave now, Master Aryllyian, and...&quot; he paused and took a moment to consider his words, &quot;Do try to make Lord Kenelan feel welcome.&quot;<br>
<br>
The final words stung Ary like the lash from a whip. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=irislilly>Irislilly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><big><table width=150><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#FFCCCCstrength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Erudite Hippy Chick</font></td></tr></table></big></span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(6/11/03 8:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In reply to Kenelan</span><hr size=1> Irislilly trudged up the final hill toward the guild hall.  It had been a long day.  <br>
<br>
&quot; Goddess, sometimes I wonder why I am here,&quot; she thought.<br>
<br>
Iris knew that Quellious had sent her to these elves for a purpose, but that purpose was not yet clear.  The sound of the slamming door brought her head up and she saw Aryllyian storming out of the Hall.<br>
&quot; I wonder what that is all about?&quot; she sighed and walked into the hall.<br>
<br>
Instantly she knew something was going on, all the elves were buzzing. She heard fragments &quot;dark elf&quot; &quot;Vladimirski has gone crazy&quot; &quot;Rallos Zek&quot;...<br>
Quickly she searched out her friends Drayal and Malluil. When they told her about the dark elf Kenelan she smiled....<br>
Saying a prayer of thanks Iris began to see what her mission for the goddess was to be.<br>

<br>
Vlad thought to himself, &quot;If they only knew the sides I have seen of Kenelan.&quot;  Long ago, in a different time, when Vlad drifted about Norrath, he had met this Dark Elf Warrior, and knew even then, something was a bit different about him.  He got to know him, and on occasion fight in some of the same battles.<br>
<br>
He then heard a rumor that Kenelan was to marry Entice...  ENTICE, the evil Shadow Knight female.  Vlad thought this would be a terrible blow to Kenelan's good-sided nature, and decided to head to Nektolus to see for himself if this was true.  And there in Neriak he found all the rumors to be true, he watched from a hiding spot as Entice and Kenelan became married, wondering to himself what Kenelan was thinking.<br>
<br>
Soon after this, Reapers of Sorrow, and Vlad's guild at the time became arch enemies.  Entice had rubbed our guild wrong too many times, hence a Guildwar started.  This war was very bloody, the lines between Nektolus and East Commons had many battles fought on them, but it was during this war, that Vlad realized Entice hadn't changed Kenelan.<br>
<br>
After the great wars, things between the guilds calmed, and Vlad's current guild began to falter.  He decided to seek out a guild where his ideals would be welcome, and where he could use his leadership skills to help fight the good fight, his true calling had arrived.<br>
<br>
Vladimirski had found a home in the Elven Elite, he worked hard under the guidance of the best Paladins in Norrath, and he rose in rank quickly, and then the day came, he was given the highest rank of the Elven Elite...  Guild Leader.<br>
<br>
Several seasons had passed after this, and he had heard of a DE Warrior wondering in GFay, killing Orcs no less...  He had to find out information and soon.  He sent riders out all over the land, gathering information, and then it came back to him, Kenelan was afoot...  Very interesting.<br>
<br>
Vlad summoned watchers and trackers to see what Kenelan was up to, he also send Rogues to Neriak to find out any information to be had.  As reports came back in, he began to realize Kenelan was trying to gain the trust of Felwithe and Kelethin, the good side of him was winning at last it seemed.<br>
<br>
NOW, now was the time to bring him, to look in his eyes, and see if all the hatred had departed, now was the time!  Vlad summoned Nalilya and asked her to seek him out, and bring him to me, but bring him alive...<br>

Aryllyian raised the Banner of the Elven Elite and cried aloud, &quot;The Pride of Faydwer awaits! Bring her to us Rokken!&quot;<br>
<br>
All around him the Elves hastened thier preparations for battle, that is when he saw it;  a large White Wurm came into view, lumbering down the long hallway toward the Elven Host.  Vladimirski raised his shield and met the charge head long.  A huge clash of metal upon metal rose up and echoed throught this lair near the great wurm named Dozekar.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the name of Tunare, let us slay this minion of Veeshan!&quot; in unison, the full weight of the Elite came crashing down upon the wicked wurm. Spells exploded overhead and arrows split the air, as Tinv and Wilwen appeared and unleashed thier special talents.   Aryllyian smiled, the Elves have come a long way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Wyvern in the back!&quot; came a scream of panic, as the casters scattered in the wake of the frenzied beast.  As if in slow motion, Kenelan slammed his visor shut and took a breath.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You shall not tread upon the weak, by Zekk, I demand battle!&quot; With that, Kenelan launched into a series of wicked attacks designed to attract the attention of the snorting foe.  The ancient Wyvern spun and redirected his attacks toward the frail looking dark elf.  Aryllyian turned his attention back to the task at hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Steady!&quot; warned Aryllyian.  &quot;Remain on the wurm!&quot; Aryllyian fully understood that in moments of sheer panic mistakes are often made that can be disastrous to any mission. Tonight, however, his Elves are destined to greatness.  <br>
<br>
After several long moments, with both foes vanquished, Ary paused for a moment to consider Kenelan. He saw Vlad and Kenelan kneeling and chatting like old friends......in that instant, Aryllyian realised that Vladimirksi had been right about Kenelan.  But Lord Aryllyian was not often long on sentiment when Elves were in danger.  &quot;Now, where are you Dozekar?,&quot; Ary mumbled under his breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scouts and trackers to me!&quot; Ary raised the green and gold standard of the Elite aloft and smiled. &quot;Tonight we come of age&quot;<br>
<br>
