----------------------------<br>
<br>
When he was clean, he hardly smelled at all. Maybe she was just getting a numb nose. It could be the change in his diet. When Laenyel traveled with them, he supplied them with delicacies, some hearty enough even for an ogre. Seyah knew Krushh tried hard not to disgust her, she’d seen him studying the way she and Laenyel handled food. It was sweet, really, if “sweet” was an adjective you could apply to a 10-foot meatshield with yellow eyes and sharpened teeth.<br>
<br>
Seyah tucked her feet beneath her, sitting at Krushh's feet, and paged through her spellbook. Good, a hunt today! Laenyel was already waving his hands around. Another wizard, Beylan, arrived, and a wood elf druid, Wooddy. <br>
<br>
&quot;The enchanter is coming,&quot; Krushh said, &quot;He's been delayed&quot;<br>
<br>
They all sat at the spires, waiting for the enchanter, each making their own preparations. A small scowling gnome ran up, panting. &quot;Sorry I'm late,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm so angry!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Porting&quot;, said Laenyel, clearly impatient to get moving.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold,&quot; Krushh said. &quot;Why are you angry, Lorkathor?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I just lost two diamond rings, ruined in the making!&quot;, exclaimed the gnome. Everyone sighed in sympathy, and said soothing things. Enough to make anyone irritable, to lose such valuable components. <br>
<br>
The gnome looked around at the group. His scowling gaze fell upon Seyah, still seated. &quot;Is THAT our cleric?!! The Hole will own a cleric so unseasoned!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seyah's back stiffened, and her eyes widened at the insult. She and Krushh and Laenyel had hunted the Hole many times, and though not always an unqualified success, she certainly had never felt &quot;owned&quot;. Now the other two strangers were gazing at her dubiously as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;I take this cleric everywhere with me.&quot; Krushh's voice was completely flat.<br>
<br>
The gnome humphed. &quot;Well, no offense, but I'm not taking her rez&quot;, he said, and climbed up to the top of the platform. &quot;Let's go, or we'll never get there&quot;.<br>
<br>
Who offered him a stinking rez?, Seyah wondered, flushing angrily. Does this mean the little squirt is planning to die? She chewed on her thoughts. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, I'm offended.&quot; she told Krushh privately.<br>
<br>
He chuckled. &quot;Why, because he said you'd be owned by the Hole?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That remains to be seen. But he didn't have to speak of me in the 3rd person.&quot;<br>
<br>
Krushh patted her with his huge hand. &quot;It will be fine&quot;. <br>
<br>
Seyah knew how eager he was to hunt worthy prey. &quot;I'll shake it off&quot;, she promised.<br>
<br>
They ran through the fields and tunnels leading to the Hole. &quot;I will need to be a wolf to get through the cracks at the entrance&quot;, said Krushh to the group.<br>
<br>
The group ran down the stairs to the pool outside the underwater door to the Hole. &quot;I need Boon of the Garou, or a wolf spell, before I will fit through the door,&quot; Krushh reiterated.<br>
Odd, thought Seyah, as the group plunged into the water and began squeezing through the cracks around the large stone door. Why doesn't the druid turn him into a wolf?<br>
<br>
&quot;Wooddy, I need a wolf spell, please, before you go in!&quot; Krushh exclaimed in desperation, just as the druid's feet disappeared through the door. <br>
<br>
Well, I'm not going in there without my tank, thought Seyah, and she swam back up to the shore to sit beside the irritated ogre. The ripples in the pond flattened, and the water stilled. They sat there, beside the quiet pool. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wonder how long it will take them before they notice they have no tank and no healer?&quot; Seyah remarked. Krushh just grunted.<br>
<br>
&quot;ACK!!&quot;, Laenyel's voice came clearly into her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Seyah jumped to her feet, though she knew Laenyel was out of reach of her spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone pulled a bunch of elementals into the water!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Swim back out!&quot; Seyah told him, anxiously watching the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't, I'm gonna die!&quot; Laenyel sounded faint now.<br>
<br>
Searching for Laenyel's familiar pattern, Seyah found it, with sinking heart, back in West Commons where they had left such a short time ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;They killed Laenyel,&quot; she informed Krushh.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Great. This is gonna take all night.&quot; Krushh scratched himself dejectedly. &quot;I haven't killed anything in HOURS.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seyah threw pebbles into the pond, while they waited for the others.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I was an elf, I'd fit through the cracks.&quot; said Krushh.<br>
Startled, Seyah looked at Krushh. What an odd thing to say, she thought.<br>
<br>
A sheepish Wooddy arrived and turned Krushh into a wolf, and the five of them swam in. Seyah found Laenyel's corpse behind a rock in the water, and dragged it out to the dry ledge to ressurect him. &quot;It was that fool of a gnome,&quot; Laenyel told her. &quot;He was wandering around. When he agro'd the creatures, he swam back into the tunnel with them.&quot; Finally, they were ready to begin. <br>
<br>
Seyah concentrated very hard on not being &quot;owned&quot;. It really was like every other time she had been to the Hole. Stand, heal, sit. Buff. Move when Krushh said move. Don't fall in. Laenyel, as usual, never needed healing, and Seyah was pleased to note that the other wizard was just as careful to avoid the monsters' attention. Lorkathor seemed to be perpetually out of mana, and every now and then Wooddy would fail to snare an elemental, which would go running down the hall. So far the two wizards had been able to reduce them to cinders before they got far. Seyah could hear Krushh grinding his teeth in irritation. He hated unsnared monsters. Still they reached the ledge where they normally fought, and Krushh began pulling the huge rock golems which took forever to beat down, but sometimes had nice treasure on them. After a few of those, Lorkathor said he need a break to regenerate mana, and while they waited, he would be in a deep trance. The group sat huddled on the ledge, making jokes and chatting. One after another, they reached full mana, and still no word from Lorkathor. Krushh began scratching with both weapons. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not on this narrow ledge, Krushh, please, you'll knock us off or decapitate one of us,&quot; Seyah pleaded.<br>
 <br>
Glaring balefully at the still comatose gnome, Krushh said &quot;I'm gonna try to pull one.&quot;<br>
<br>
He returned with a flying creature, which they warily dispatched, looking around for its friends. They sat and rested for a minute after it was dead. &quot;He still gone?&quot;, Krushh asked, poking at Lorkathor's tiny figure. The gnome tipped over. Seyah propped him back up. &quot;Guess so.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmph. Gonna try another then. If we get adds, evac us out of here, Laen.&quot; Another creature was brought back and summarily slaughtered. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is getting ridiculous&quot;, Krushh exclaimed, and grabbing the gnome by a foot, he shook Lorkathor vigorously. The whole group roared with laughter, but made haste to extract the tiny man from the ogre's ungentle grasp. Crude speculation began as to what could be keeping Lorkathor away from his body so long. &quot;Bah, I came here to kill things,&quot; Krushh said, and lumbered off again. Almost immediately he came back with a golem and began pounding on it. Seyah glanced at the gnome, still slack-jawed, and up again just in time to see the sprite arrive to help the golem.<br>
<br>
&quot;Evac,&quot; Krushh tossed the word over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Evac&quot; Laenyel echoed, jumping to his feet, and weaving the complex spell that would take them to safety. Seyah counted the seconds down.<br>
<br>
She opened her eyes. Ahh. South Ro. Something heavy was on her foot. Bah! That annoying absentee enchanter! The rest of the group looked around at each other, and then at the recumbant gnome. Suddenly Beylan grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Disband everyone! I think I'll take him to Skyfire&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=85.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=85.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
