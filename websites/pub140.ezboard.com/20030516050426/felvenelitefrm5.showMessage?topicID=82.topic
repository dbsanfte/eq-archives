The elves had grown quite alot in a year, both in levels and skills and in numbers. They had moved the camp from the Northern Desert of Ro to a much better place for all of them now. <br>
<br>
Eliani loved the Twilight Sea. She loved having all those elementals around. Slaini swore that the earh elementals smelled but Eliani had never smelled such a thing as a bad smell from them. The Twilight Sea was far from home. Up on the moon actually. But it made for a good camp. They had access to portals everywhere and yet could do some decent hunting at very close range. Or had been able to... Lately they were having to travel farther and farther to hunt anything that gave them experience. Eliani was so glad they had abandoned the idea of making camp in the Western Wastes. Cold was not her thing. Right now most of the Elite were home. The guild hall was more full than it had ever been before. <br>
<br>
She wondered where they could go. The Plane of Knowledge was too civilized for a camp such as this. And as for civilization, the guild hall in Kelethin was plenty civilized enough for the Elite. Tunare would provide. <br>
<br>
Just then Ariaa ran in. &quot;I just ported Aryllyian back here. Yep he's had too much to drink again.&quot; Eliani laughed at Ariaa and went to help her. <br>
<br>
&quot;What say we take off his armor and leave him tied up somewhere&quot; Ariaa asked mischeviously. Eliani readily agreed to help. <br>
<br>
They got him undressed enough that he could sleep comfortably and waited for him to begin to snore again. Eillail walked in to check on him just as they finished. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you two evildoers up to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We are just helping Ary, E. He'll be fine. Ariaa ported him home drunk. He's tired and disheartened and we are just taking care of him.&quot; They looked at him innocently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, I have been worried, too&quot; Eillail said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well life here isn't easy. It gets you down&quot; Ariaa agreed. <br>
<br>
Eliani said, &quot;We are looking after him, you can go read.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was just on my way to do that, how did you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Eliani laughed and pointed to the book in Eillail's hands. He looked down and laughed with her. &quot;Oh...&quot; he said, and wandered off. <br>
<br>
Aryllyian continued to snore soundly. When Eillail left, Ariaa and Eliani tied his left arm to the low table beside his bed and left him. <br>
<br>
The laughed and went into the kitchen. Eliani had several things baking. &quot;He'll wonder how he got in that position and be too polite to ask, just like always.&quot; They had a good laugh.<br>
<br>
Eliani felt a bit of remorse. What they had done wasn't nice. She waited till Ariaa left and thought about undoing him. She'd tell Irislilly what happened and that would ease her mind. She hunted down Iris and hugged her, pulling her from the armor repair she was doing. &quot;Come with me, I need to speak to you quietly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Iris followed Eliani to the kitchen. She was curious. <br>
&quot;What did you do, my elvish friend.?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It wasn't just me, it was mainly Ariaa's idea.&quot; Eliani told her the details. Iris laughed and laughed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh I can help with this one. I'll be right back.&quot; <br>
<br>
Iris reappeared several minutes later. <br>
Eliani looked up, &quot;What did you do, Iris the Evil?&quot;<br>
<br>
Iris just shook her head. &quot;Wait and see....&quot;<br>
<br>
/ooc Sorry Ary. The other one started this way too.... I had to keep the original idea. HUGS I figure you can handle this one...<br>

Ary is so much better at this stuff she thought.  He has been in a mood  lately though better to just struggle with it herself than to bother him with such a minor repair.<br>
She tried not to think of it but it did bother her that he went so often to Seyah for comfort when he was troubled.  <br>
&quot;Well,&quot; she sighed &quot;they both share such a deep love for their Mother Tunare, it is only natural.&quot;  <br>
Just then she smacked her thumb with the smithy hammer and cursed softly under her breath. <br>
She heard the rustle of silk and turn to see Eliani standing there head down. Irislilly called upon Quellious to grant Eliani some peace, and went to her.<br>
&quot;Come with me, sister&quot; Eliani said.  &quot;I have been up to mischief.&quot; <br>
Upon hearing her tale Irislilly threw back her head and laughed.  This would be a great opportunity to lighten things up around here. Elves were supposed to be lighthearted maybe a good practical joke would help them all to remember that.  <br>
&quot;Wait here.  I will take care of this,&quot; she said.<br>
Quietly she crept into the main hall seeing noone about she snatched up a quill and a parchment from the writing table.  As she turned to leave something caught her eye...that will be perfect she thought and picked up Seyahs comfy blanket from her chair by the fire.<br>
A few minutes later Iris appeared again in the kitchen.  &quot;Come here Elfy and see what I have done,&quot; she grinned.<br>
She led Eliani back to Arys room where he remained snoring and tied to the bedside table. She had removed his pants and he slept there in nothing but his shirt and *braise.  Clutched tightly in his other hand he held Seyahs afghan.  Pinned to which was a note which read: &quot; Ary, Lets keep this our secret.  I have a reputation to uphold, I am a nun after all.  Seyah&quot;<br>
Eliani gasped in surprise and then began to chuckle,&quot;that should cause some interesting fallout.  Let's go eat some cookies&quot;<br>
<br>

This time with a sleeping Slaini. She dropped Slaini on the floor, all that armor was heavy. Iris and Eliani ran in at the clunking sound. They broke into peals of laughter and Eliani blushed a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay ladies, what's up?&quot; Ariaa said, pouring wine. She was still panting from carrying the snoring Slaini home. <br>
<br>
&quot;You look tired, Ariaa&quot; Eliani noticed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am beat. I found her in Freeport at the Green Jade Inn. They sent a bard with a note to me in the commons. I was getting batwings. So I went to the inn, picked her up and ported here.&quot; She looked around, &quot;Can you help me with Slaini, please? I don't think I can get her to her room.&quot;<br>
<br>
Irislilly and Eliani burst into laughter again and wandered off. Ariaa wondered what they had done. She wondered if Aryllyian had woken up. Maybe she'd peek in on him. She dragged Slaini to just outside his doorway and had to stop for breath. Slaini had to stop drinking or get herself home, that was all there was to it. She looked down. &quot;Slaini, you have to stop this, Hon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slaini only gurgled some unintelligable response. Ariaa had to pick up everyone from a raid in less than half an hour. No one would be here but Iris and Eliani. She'd tell them to move Slaini the rest of the way if they had time. She dragged Slaini into Ary's room and took off the heavy armor. Slaini groaned at her and curled up into a ball. She didn't want poor Slaini to be cold and was out of time. So she scooted Slaini next to Aryllyian and covered her with Seyah's afghan. <br>
<br>
&quot;I hope Seyah doesn't come home and want to get comfy&quot; she thought. Either way, she didn't have time to do anything else. She took Slaini's armor and pack and dropped them into her room. Slaini would wonder too, now. <br>
<br>
Ariaa ran to the kitchen and told Iris and Eliani where she was headed. She didn't remember to explain that Slaini was in Ary's room until she was teleporting and gone. They'd figure it out...<br>
<br>

Clumping wearily through the main room, she made her way to her room where she dumped her packs.  A bath first, she thought, after such a long raid.  She headed back up the passageway, then paused as she glimpsed a recumbant form through a door ajar.   Slaini again.  <br>
<br>
Poor Slaini, Seyah thought, being guildleader really had unhinged her, and that was months ago.  She pushed the door open, intending to move Slaini to the bed.   But the bed was occupied.  Seyah stopped, trying to comprehend what she saw.  <br>
<br>
Ary had one arm tied to the table.  &quot;What is that supposed to accomplish?&quot; Seyah wondered, totally mystified.  &quot;Either tie both arms or none, but why *one*??&quot; She looked again at Slaini, and noticing her own afghan, she made a face and reached down to collect it.  The crackle of parchment attracted her attention and she unpinned the note.   Her eyebrows shot up and she looked sternly again at Slaini, still snoring.   It didn't look like Slaini's handwriting.  She tucked the note into her bracer, to save for the fire.<br>
<br>
Again she looked at Aryllyian, and froze.  His eyes were open, and he was looking at his arm tied to the table, and then at her in question.   She felt a flush start at her collar bone and rise through her neck to the roots of her hair, leaving her cheeks flaming with heat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your pardon, Aryllyian, I didn't mean to intrude,&quot; she stammered, glancing at the inert form at her feet. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seyahmt>SeyahMT</A> at: 11/1/02 8:24:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=firinn>Firinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Leader / BFB</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(11/2/02 1:11:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The never ending story</span><hr size=1> Firinn, still a little bleary, emerges from his room with scraps of the note he had written to Ivri in his hand, wondering how he had missed them the night before.  Walking down the hallway, he notices Aryllyian's door is open and Seyah standing inside the doorway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, anyone got anything to eat?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seyah turns to look at him, and he notices her face is flush with a deep red, and a look of surprise on her face.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You seem to have something clinging to your armor Seyah&quot;, he says, reaching for what is no doubt a scrap of something from her latest outing.  &quot;I'll get it, its right there...&quot; he murmurs, reaching for her wrist.  <br>
<br>
Firinn frees a parchment from Seyah's bracer, and then sees over her shoulder Slaini passed out on the floor, and Aryllyian undressed, and tied to a table!<br>
<br>
&quot;What in the world?!&quot; bellows the barbarian, forgetting the parchment in his hand.  He looks at the paladin, at the elf on the floor, and then back at Seyah quizzically, who turns a darker shade of red if its at all possible.  <br>
Firinn blinks his eyes, shakes his head and says &quot;Who can figure Elves?&quot; and starts making his way to the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Seyah calls after him to stop, and remembering the parchment in his hand, turns to give it back.  He glances down and sees...<br>
&quot;Ary, Lets keep this our secret. I have a reputation to uphold, I am a nun after all. Seyah&quot;<br>
<br>
Firinn quickly looks up at Seyah, as she snatches the note from his hand, and he says flatly, &quot;I think I shoulda just stayed in bed.&quot;<br>

Looking up into Firinn's confused face, his hair still rumpled with sleep, Seyah felt a chord of sympathy.  That was exactly how she felt.  Terribly, terribly confused.  And tired.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't write this,&quot; she said, and seeing that Firinn was not really absorbing what she had said, she added, &quot;Go, have some breakfast, Sweetbear.&quot;  Seeing him turn and head toward the kitchen, she sighed and looked at the paper in her hand.  But now it was torn?  No, she had more than one paper, the note she didn't write, and some pieces. &quot;I apologize...&quot;  &quot;Paladin of tarnished armor&quot;  &quot;unseemly behavior on your part&quot;.  She opened her mouth to call the northman back for his own notes, but but shut it again since he had already stumbled out of sight.   She stood a moment, gathering her thoughts, then turned with decision back to Aryllyian and Slaini.   Ary was working at the knot that held him to the bed.   Sweeping a glance at the still unconscious Slaini, she grabbed the door handle and backed up into the hall, closing the door firmly behind her.

She sighed at the simple pleasure of a fire, feeling tranquility begin to creep back to her troubled thoughts.  Now for that bath.  She took her towel from the shelf and a clean shift, and padded barefoot back into the passage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=82.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
