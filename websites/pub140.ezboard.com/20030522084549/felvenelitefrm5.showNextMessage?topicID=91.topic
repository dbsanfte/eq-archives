His head hurt from too much drink and the sun was very bright.  He crawled from under the blanket and found his pack and swords.  His entire body ached. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why do I even try to sleep in this armor?&quot; he mumbled aloud, not expecting a response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because we have been through this too many times for me to undress you Aryllyian Wyndreaver.....&quot; it was a feminine voice that trailed off as she ran away.  <br>
<br>
Aryllyian spun around to see Ariaa speeding off toward the rising sun.  Quickly Ary decided he was in one of the deserts of Ro...but he hadnt decided which one yet.<br>
<br>
The makeshift camp was home to many Elite.  He noticed many of Lenian's things but didnt see the ranger anywhere.<br>
<br>
Ary quickly determined that it was his job to guard the camp and since that was all he could manage anyways...thats what he did.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aryllyian>Aryllyian</A> at: 11/3/01 8:36:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ubwikus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bwikus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(11/3/01 4:59:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An ever continuing thread...PLEASE POST!!</span><hr size=1> Pretending to be asleep, I listened with interest to Ary's gutteral mutterings (I had once heard Lenian refer to them as such, and was inclined to agree with him). On occasion I had to falsify a yawn and cover my grin, the words that were coming out of Ary's mouth had me in stitches inside.<br>
<br>
However, the thought of Ary even trying to defend the camp worried me. A band of orc raiders could at any time jump us and, while Ary was the only one keeping watch, I feared for his safety. Of course he could shout to me and our comrades for assistance, but would it be too late by then? Who knows.<br>
<br>
As I lay I thought I would assist him, after all, we could both use the company. Not until I got him back for the armour trick on a previous occasion though. I sat up as quietly as possible, foraging for small stones in the earth. When I had gathered four or five and lay back down again, I threw one stone to the right of the place Ary was guarding. As he turned toward the sound and drew his sword, I threw the next stone to his left. He turned quickly but again did not see a reason for the disturbance.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes he let his guard down and I threw two more stones directly over his head while he was looking down. Once more he drew his sword and, by now, was agitated and let out a cry. &quot;Do not mess with me! I am Aryllyian, the great Paladin who shall defend himself and his kind from any evil, and fears nothing!&quot; I slowly got up and walked toward Ary, seeing his head about to explode with frustration, and tapped him on the shoulder. &quot;What's up Ary?&quot; I said, in a calm voice. &quot;There is a disturbance Bwah, to all our sides, do not disturb me while I am working&quot;. I threw the last stone on the ground next to Ary, and laughed out loud as his face turned into a look of humility. <p><HTML>

Grumbling she opened her eyes and looked around, trying to locate the source of the voices. When she found them, she smiled a little, Bwah was tormenting  Ary again. After trying to sit up once she had to suppress a groan, Bwah had been teaching her the fine art of drinking and she was paying for it now. All she remembered of the night before was Bwah's smile and Taurin trying to tell her some thing she could not seem to recall what it was. When they had finally decided to sleep, she had been in the middle between Taurin and Bwah, which was a very warm place to sleep. When she finally managed to get up she pulled a cloak around her and walked up behind them both.<br>
<br>
&quot; Morning&quot; she said cheerfully, and instantly put her hand to her head. She did not notice both men jumping at the sound of her voice. Both smiled at her as they turned around to face her, she looked from one to the other and could not understand why both of them were blushing. <br>
<br>
&quot; What's wrong with you too?&quot;  her voice a little quieter this time. Ary pointed at her and covered his eyes, Bwah was just standing there with his mouth open. Syrren tilted her head at them then looked down at herself. Her eyes widened for a second then she grabbed the ends of the cloak more tightly.<br>
<br>
&quot; How? Um&quot; she bite her lip and looked at them with a fine blush on her own half elven face. &quot; I don't remember taking off my armor&quot;  was all she could get out. She looked at Bwah, trying to get him to explain. <br>

Within moments the transoformation was complete and he was quickly racing to catch Ariaa, and maybe a rabbit or two for breakfast.

Ariaa heard the earth shake as loud footsteps bounded down the hill. Apparently Tarbul hadn't forgotten their last visit either. When he saw them he managed a great roar and lunged. They quickly ran out of his reach and began to cast. <br>

After many healings of the other, roots and snares of Tarbul (most of which he shook right off), hundreds of swarms and several serious ice attacks, Gildorn and Ariaa ran for the bridge. Once safely across they heard him yellilng for them to return, calling them cowards. <br>

The question I wanted to ask myself, though, was who had got hold of Lucman's quill and written the words &quot;I fancy Wood-Elves&quot; across Syrren's chest. Of course she was very drunk the night before, so she wouldn't be able to remember a thing. I'd had a few too many as well, and even cajoled Taurin into downing a few of my favourite tipples. I remember telling Taurin something about how Syrren was quite an attractive Elf, but exactly what I told him ... well, I hope he can remember. <p><HTML>

<br>
They seemed to sit closer, touch more often and actually LOOK at each other more while they spoke.<br>
<br>
All this made Ary very suspicious of the previous nights activities.   But he didnt say a word.  He ate his chow,m and gathered his things.  It was time for another day of high adventure.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are those Wayward Druids?&quot; he asked aloud, with no   response.  Ary did not like the Idea of walking all over Norrath today..not with such a hangover.<br>
<br>
He walked over and kicked Orin who was sleeping in the classic spread eagle Ogre fashion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to Kill something Orin..and ahem..Breakfast is ready.&quot; said Aryllyian matter of factly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Awwww Ary..dat mush too early..&quot; Orin whined rolling over and showing his butt crack to the whole camp.  Orin knew that they never woke him until after everyone else had eaten.  And that served all very well.  Most folks got to eat before the Ogre's moved in. And Orin got to sleep longer.  <br>

When she was dressed again and ready to face the world, she walked out to where the others were eating and talking. Looking around she saw that the only place to sit was next to the handsome bard, she gave him a small smile as she sat down next to him. She had a plate in her hand but needed her glass, and that was on the other side of Bwah. She bite her lip and leaned over him to get it, whispering sorry as she moved back. <br>
<br>
Ary she noticed was watching them and trying to wake Orin, at the same time. She wondered what he was thinking every time he looked at them. She turned to ask Bwah a question and lost what she was going to say when his lips touched hers. It was such a sweet kiss that it left here totally confused, when he move away she reached up and touched his cheek. All she could do was smile at him and try not to blush any redder than she was. He had  stunned her, she could not begin to wonder how that happened. <br>
<br>
When she could actually think again she smiled at him before asking her question.<br>
<br>
&quot; What are you going to do this day?&quot;<br>

Yes, I wanted to kiss Syrren, but never would I have dreamed of doing it in front of other people, I would have been too scared. But wow, it was so soft, a great kiss.<br>
<br>
After I gave Syrren a quick wink and mouthed Good Bye, I ran from the camp at full speed, occasionally drumming my drums and casting a levitation spell so I could get high in the fresh air. Through deserts and forests I ran, admiring the lucious greens and listening to the calls of the wildlife.<br>
<br>
Arriving in Highkeep some hours later, I was exhausted. I had no stamina and my armour was dirty. The Merchant I found sold me food and drink which I consumed hungrily, and even after I had had my fill bought some more, I would eat it later.<br>
<br>
The chairs in the Inn were comfortable, but not enough so that I fell asleep. I read through the latest edition of Highkeep Weekly and saw an advert which got my attention. I immediately dispatched a mesenger with a note to give word that I would purchase the items being sold, and that he should meet me in the Oasis of Marr as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Then, I found a bed, removed my armor, and fell asleep contentedly. The day tomorrow would be long and I needed, as always, my beauty sleep.<br>

She looked around the camp to see most every one taking off in thier own directions. Following thier lead she waved at Ary as she tapped her own drum and let the song take her. Quickly she ran through the desert and over in to Oasis Marr where she had been hunting the last few days. She  was thinking about Bwah and was not paying any attention to where she was running, then she felt the ground shake and look up to see a Sand Giant coming at her. She was to close to get away from his grasp and soon was standing in total confusion at the Freeport Gates.  The Gods decided that she needed more time to learn and placed her in a safe place. <br>
<br>
Naked except for her songs she started to run back to oasis, to get her things befor some one stole them. Thanking the Gods as she ran and telling herself to keep her mind on what she was doing and not on Bwah. No matter what she told herself it did not work for later that day she was thinking about him again and ran in to tree. Standing back up, she was able to start thinking abit better and started fighting like she knew she could. <br>
<br>
After fighing all day, she was in need of bath yet again, quietly she went to the place she knew would not be occupied. She took a quick bath and cleaned her armor of the remains of her kills, then headed over to the gypsies to get some food, since she was going to be spending the night in thier camp. Smiling she wondered where Bwah was and fell asleep inder the stars. <br>

A few close scrapes with giants of the sand variety had left Naminu filthy and tired. She breathed an almost silent sigh of relief when the Elven Elite camp came into sight. Hitching the worn pack up on her shoulders she picked up her pace to a trot and crossed the final distance with renewed strength.<br>
    Shouting a quick &quot;Hail&quot;, she walked among the mostly empty tents, slipping into one that seemed not to have been used for a while. Taking an appreciative breath of the dry, still cool air of the tent she dropped the pack to the ground and unhooked her sword from her hip. Leaning the etched blade against the solid center post of the tent she contemplated how long it had been since going unarmed had been a comfortable option. Too long, she concluded as she stepped back out of the tent in search of some warm water and maybe a fresh breakfast.<br>
    Walking to the center of the camp she saw Orin eating heartily at the table. Stepping past him she quickly grabbed a muffin off the edge of the table and beamed a smile at the ogre. Turning as she took her first bite of muffin she noticed a large kettle of water boiling over the fire. Squealing with delight she tossed the muffin back onto the table and thanked Tunare for her thick leather gloves.She poured off a considerable portion of the water into a large copper bowl nearby.<br>
    &quot;Where are you going with my dish water?&quot; an incredulous voice asked from behind her.<br>
    &quot;To my tent,&quot; Naminu answered pertly as she carefully and purposefully walked away from a puzzled Aryllian. Orin just chuckled as he shoved the last of the food into his mouth with one hand and happily patted his belly with the other.<br>
    Back in her chosen tent Naminu stripped off her grimy armor noticing the worn leather padding would soon need to be replaced. When she was finally free of the restrictive metal she set to enjoying the first warm bath she had had in weeks. By the time the bath water had cooled Naminu's ivory skin had taken on a pink tint from vigorous scrubbing and her wet hair hung straight and clean down her back. With a contented sigh she walked over to her pack and dug into it. After a short search she pulled out a tissue wrapped package. Pushing the pack away from her with a bare foot she tore the package open removing a light green silk shift she had acquired on her last trip to Felwithe along with a darker green robe to go over it. After slipping into the fine cool fabric she picked up the bowl she had appropriated for her bath water and exited the tent to dump it.<br>
    After successfully completing the task of returning the rinsed out bowl Naminu walked to the edge of the camp. Lifting her voice, more used to battle cries than singing, she praised Tunare with a hymn learned years ago and oceans away. A hymn of the joyous pleasure of friends and simple pleasure of merely living.<br>

He remembered fondly the days when he used to sing alot.  It recalled his favorite Elven Elite song, after a short while, and when Naminu was finished;  He turned to the dishes and belted out The Ballad of Somma:<br>
<br>
The fairest flower of chivalry to bloom in all the glen.<br>
And the Noblest of all the Knights of Colwyn, <br>
was <br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! Jyleel's sister's son<br>
Known through all the Elven Lands for battles he had won.<br>
A Heretic from Ak'Anon made pleas to go to war<br>
To aid our allies to our north and put goblins to the sword<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! you called the plan ill made<br>
But Nonetheless did Colwyn agree to send them aid<br>
When the heretic requests you for the post most perilous<br>
Willingly do you accept as honor deems ye must<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! the rearguard you command<br>
With Clarion your loyal friend to ride at your right hand.<br>
At a vale near Kaladim, your doom is now anigh<br>
The goblins they hold the pass and will not let ye bye.<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! Sound yer mighty horn!<br>
to try to call back all the elves that just rode out that morn.<br>
Colwyn has heard your call but the Heretic says &quot;Nay!!,&quot;<br>
&quot;Tis only your young Aeadien out hunting on this day&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! wont be goblin prey.<br>
Cause in his heart his courage and in his voice is not dismay:<br>
&quot;Faced with goblin arrows, take yer shields and hold em high!&quot;<br>
&quot;With honor we have lived our lives, with honor we shall die&quot;<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! sound your final blast<br>
As one by one the Elven Elite dies fighten at the pass.<br>
At the last is Clarion, by Greenskins overthrown!<br>
Now, ye of all the Elven Host now stands alone.<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! T'was dark the day you died<br>
Widows cursed the day in Felwithe and lay'd round and cried<br>
They found you on the hilltop, ring round with slain foes.<br>
Never has there been a day of such great woe.<br>
<br>
Somma! Somma! your name will live in song.<br>
as long as great Elves take up arms to right a mighty wrong<br>
The Fairest flower of chivalry to bloom in all the glenn.<br>
And the Noblest of all the Knights of Colwyn!!!<br>

As I peered over the top of the sandy dune, I couldn't help but feel relieved at the sight of Aryllyian singing. Was he now pretending to be a Bard? Or was there a hidden talent tucked up his sleeve that no one knew about?<br>
<br>
I allowed a small smile to creep over my lips and started running again at full pelt.<br>
<br>
Not stopping in time, however, I knocked into Ary, sending his pile of dishes all over the floor. I blamed the water on the floor, but I'm sure he'll come up with something more befitting.<br>
