Minimum Level:51<br>
Maximum Level:54 (maybe 55)<br>
Zone Name: Burning Woods<br>
Camp Area/LOC: Hornet Nest/Ruins<br>
Mob List (HP): Ash Hornet(2500), Cinder Hornet(3000), Ember Hornet(3500), Scoriae Hornet(5000)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 9 (nearly never camped)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (10pp)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 7 (takes getting used to)<br>
Faction Affected: Hotwingz decreased<br>
 <br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great quadding spot, as it is nearly never camped. It is a great alternative to the usually camped Cobalt Scar, but is slightly more challenging. The biggest warning is to try to avoid most Sarnaks, which are plentiful here. They are typically SOW-ed and can provide some difficulty there. The best area to pull and rest is the burned out area down the hill from the nest. None of the hornets see invis (skeletons and gorillas do though). It can be a challenge to get a hang of where the good mobs spawn and you might have to mix in some gorillas and skeletons. They are pretty safe to add in though some of the higher-level ones have more HP than the hornets and will require a finishing off nuke. The Scoriae hornets also have a lot of HP and will require the same. <br>

Camp Area/Loc: Spiroc Birdhouse<br>
Mob List(HP): Spiroc Litefoots(lt blue/green at 52, green at 53), Spiroc Watchers (blue/lt blue at 52) Spiroc Provens (blue till 54)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 4 (Come off peak times to have the whole place to yourself. Can be shared by several people though (lots of spawns))<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4 (some plat)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (almost never resist, very easy to round up)<br>
Faction Affected: Spiroc faction decreased <br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: One of the best camps at 51, these are quadable with a large mana pool from 46 or so if you stick to the smaller ones. By 51 ever thing is blue with a smattering of lt. blue from the lightfoots, and with KEI you can swarm kite them. They go down *fast* to Pillar of Frost. XP is amazing at 51, not bad at 52, and pretty poor at 53.<br>

Mob List(HP): Timeless Golems (perfect quad fodder), Sshissar Stalkers (faster than Golems, and more hp), Forlorn/Forgotten Slaves (undead that go down easy if you can get them in groups of 4...)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 10 (never camped. With all the nerfs to this zone, there's never more than 3-5 people here, and the zone can easily support 20)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 5 (some coin from golems, organs/scales from Snakes)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 9 (moving traps, large agro radius, viscious stone grabbers, summoning boulderlings and quick-casting worms make this zone a nightmare to quad in... but doable)<br>
Faction Affected: Sszarra Temple decreased<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This zone is a nice, quiet place to get some XP, though the XP is no where near what I would call &quot;phenomenal&quot; its not awful... if you can manage to avoid the traps and the stonegrabbers. Have abscond ready and keep SoW up at all times and you should be fine here.<br>

Mob List(HP): Raptors (blue til 57 (rare blue after that)) Vicious raptors (blue til 60), Dinus (lvl 48 I think, blue 60+)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 2 (everyone comes here. EXPect to have to get on a list.)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1 (abysmal, only research components)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (once you get it down, this place is CAKE. still, wide agro radius on the raptors means it has a learning curve.)<br>
Faction Affected: none<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Raptors are probably the best XP anywhere from 54-58. Even after 58 with KEI you can hold both islands and still make darn good XP. With a little practice you can kite right on the isles, and with KEI you'll be right back at full for the next spawn. Finding an isle open can be tough though, I would recommend binding here and checking the spawn when you log in, then asking the person to send you a tell when they leave. Seems to work pretty well.<br>

Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (just avoid the named)<br>
Faction Affected: COV on named Yvolcarm<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Often camped but very easy, Wyverns will not agro if you have a good faction with Claws of Veeshan, except for Yvolcarm and Azureake (the named Cobalt Drake). So stay away from them when they are UP, they are not snarable neither rootable and killing them will decrease your CoV faction. If you agro, just run and then gate. Need to be Dubious to CoV to travel safely here. <br>

Availability (1-&gt;10): 5 (sometimes difficult to find 4 mobs due to other quaders)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (tusks can be traded in CS for gems, occasional research drops)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 2 (great place to learn how to quad, plenty of room, easy to avoid adds)<br>
Faction Affected: Othmir increase, Uthorks/bulthars decreased<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Avoid the rhinos, they run VERY fast, and are quite resistant to spells. Begin with the walruses, and as they become light blue, move up to Uthork Hunters and then Uthork Warriors. If you can only find 2 dark blue mobs, you might as well mix in a couple light blue or greens to keep the spawns cycling and you'll be using the mana anyway, so it's extra kills for &quot;free.&quot; Have something to make you run fast, and use bonds of force (lvl 29) to snare and the researched circle of force (lvl 34) to nuke.<br>

<br>
Good place to learn to quad. The small zelniaks just north of the sseru zone line are easy and non social. You can spread out to the middle of the zone as you approach 40.<br>
<br>
The non social nature of the zelniak tends to make finishing a quad annoying.<br>

Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 7<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings:<br>
<br>
The XP is not that great because they have 8000+ HP's. It takes a ton of mana to finish them off, and that means lots of med time. But there are two nifty things about quadding here: Camp is always available, and loot is great. C3 and lots of +int/+mana gear is a must. Only Pillar of Lightning works reliably. Special care must be taken not to path them through a tree, as that will scatter the pack. The terrain has a rough learning curve. <br>

Zone Name: The Overthere<br>

Mob List (HP): Sarnaks, Succulant, Cockatrice<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 6 (depends on pull groups)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (Rhinos/Cats/SoW'd Sarnaks)<br>
Faction Affected: Sarnaks<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings<br>
<br>
This is a GREAT zone to learn to quad in. The mobs are plentiful and the spawn times high. The easiest things to quad are Sarnaks; start with berzerkers and move up to knights.<br>
<br>
Sarnaks - Social; if there's more than 1 they'll chase you forever If there's only one and it's snared it'll freeze.<br>
<br>
Succulants - Non-social; if they're close and low and snared they'll stand still. These will wander off if you leave a certain radius so keep them close when you're finishing a quad. Get them all low and the same time and they'll all freeze in a group giving you an easy finish.<br>
<br>
Cockatrice - See Succulants<br>
<br>
The main dangers here are the adds. Rhinos and cats are SoW speed. If you pick one up, dart up a hill/rock and Shadow Step then gate or root it fast and zone out. There's a ton of wandering mobs as well, so keep your eyes open. You can quad along the southern hillside with few wanderers between the FM zoneline (ledge) and the SE corner. Another great line is along the gorge running N/S since it's almost devoid of wanderers.<br>
<br>
I've found that grabbing a mob then running ahead, invising up and then looking for more worked great. It kept down the adds until I chose to break invis and the tagged mobs continued to follow. Only Sarnaks will add on their friends, so it greatly minimizes your risk while tagging mobs. <br>

Camp Area/LOC: Abandoned Outpost<br>
Mob List (HP): Skeletons<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 10 (almost always available)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 2 until level 51, then 1.<br>
Faction Affected: None<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Inside the building directly south of the Wizard spires there are 4 Plaguebone Thief skeletons. They're semi-social, so you may have to duck inside the building to get all of them. Often I'd pull a couple and run towards wiz spires, double back and duck inside to get the rest.<br>
<br>
No wanderers around the Outpost. The ONLY tricky part about this quad is that they like to wander off if they're low on hps. If you're close to them and they're snared they'll simply freeze. This is a pain due to the low-damage of Circle of Force, but it's doable. Root is your friend if the quad starts to break up. Once you get your first Pillar at 51 this quad is CAKE. Toss 2 Pillars, 1 CoF, then the final pillar.<br>
If you go straight Pillars then you end up right on their &quot;wander-at-low-hps&quot; line and you may end up with cleanup duty. Loot is pretty dull, but they're spawn times are perfect for medding up. With KEI you'd be sitting around a lot since there's only 4 of them. Not many people seem to know about this set, so it's usually available. I've seen a fifth one spawn, but no rhyme/reason and he's easily rooted. If you get too far away from them they'll meander back to their spawn points but retain the HateList entry. They start to go Lightblue around 52 or 53. <br>

Camp Area/LOC: Underwater ruins<br>
Mob List (HP): Bloodgill Goblin (1400), Bloodgill Marauder (3000)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 8 (pretty remote, not much competition)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 5 (some pp, research stuff, sometimes a Harpoon of the Depths)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 8 (the pulling requires some practice since you have to dive underwater to pull)<br>
Faction Affected: Pirates of Gunthak increased, Bloodgills decreased<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: 200 swimming and steelskin recommended to minimize damage on close pulls. EB not required but handy while scouting invis. Levitate up at all times, staff of tflux a must! There are 2 bloodgill goblins at each pillar (4 total), you can pull one pair, swim up and make some distance levitating on the water with Jboots/SoW before pulling the 2nd pair. Once complete head towards the beach for roundup, snare and AE's (if SoWed, zigzag or you may lose them). Middle underwater building can also be pulled but are down deeper - hard to make a quad of this without taking a beating though, unless Marauder is up: in the doorway and hard to spot underwater, not having the blue skin that the Bloodgill Goblins have nowadays. Social, low aggro range underwater (might force you to tflux both goblins for each pair). <br>

Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (about 4pp / doggie)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4<br>
Faction Affected: Pack of Tomar (neg)<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: You need Pillar of Frost(lvl 51) and SOW to quad the Drovlargs. Pull them from the South-east ruins area and quad them along the south side of KC. There is hardly anyone along the south side. In case of problems, such as a spider &quot;add&quot;, you can zone into KC to clear aggro. With KEI, you can get serious non-stop XP quadding the doggies, and you also impress the lower levels when you run by with four angry Drovlargs behind you. It helps to have the tflux for pulling. This is a great spot for someone to go 100% AA to pick up 3 easy points for Runspeed 3. Once you hit 51, get your spells, go 100% AA, and start quadding your first 3 AA's.<br>
<br>
Keep your wizzy familiar up and do not tuner ANON or ROLEPLAY on. I made about 600pp+ a night between loot drops and TL requests.<br>
<br>
Rager Drovlargs are light blue at about 53. At that point only the Ravishings are DB and they are few and far between.<br>

<br>
Pull with the taunt stick, get them rounded up on the clear area right between toFS, the doggy camp and the shore WATCH OUT for a named shadow, blizzard or something, the thingie DDs from afar, very annoying. Not a big DD, but since quadding takes time, you get dead fast. Never seen levels pass this fast, the XP there is insane.<br>

May I add I NEVER got any competition at this spot? Paradise it is, my fellow wizards, believe me.<br>

<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Despite the changes to the Chromadracs dispell, SF is still a spot we can quad in. It takes some time and skill but it is doable. With the Changes to Chromadracs I seriously advise getting Run3 before making SF your home for quadding. You get your SoW dispelled and you are in trouble here and will be dead pretty quick. Also try to keep a skin up at all times, mobs hit pretty hard here. <br>
<br>
The edges of the zone tend to have a few spots that are not filled with wanderers and tend to be flat without a lot of big boulders in the way. Find these spots and do your quadding runs here. I've done multiple quads with various mobs thrown together and am able to get them all snared with no problem.<br>
<br>
If you get a resist or miss a snare on a mob, simply run ahead a little, root it, and then break root by tapping mob with Shock of Ice. Proceed to round up the quad from there, you may or may not have to resnare before all of the mobs drop (I do at 50% health just to be safe)<br>
<br>
A note on Chromadracs: While Verant gave them the ability to dispell at casting range this has merely taken them out of the lineup as quadding targets. The agro on Chromas seems to be a very small area. I run over the top of a hill and stop right in front of them all of the time, just be sure to turn tail and run like the wind in the opposite direction.<br>
Make sure you put your important buffs like SoW, C3, Ageo, etc behind as many dummy buffs as possible. This reduces the chance of accidentally losing them if you aggro a Chroma. If anything, quadding in SF while teach you how to really drive a quad with finesse. What I mean by this is that I prefer to have a full quad when I am kiting so I end up running around a bit tagging mobs here and there to make a full quad. Dodging Chromas and steering my unsnared quad around Chromas has taken quadding to a whole new level for me. Quadding in CS made me complacent, quadding in SF honed my skills to a sharp edge.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, one final note... if you happen to see Talendor and are in the middle of a quad, take you quad away from him and with a quickness. His aggro range is a tad large and you can aggro him by pulling near him.<br>

<br>
There are 2 viable mob types that can easily be quadded here, Tro Jeg and Reverants. The main place is a mesa in the northern part of the zone. On top of the mesa is a decayed castle and a small temple. <br>
<br>
When kiting the Tro Jeg I pull with snare then gather them and resnare. Kite along the edge of the mesa. Warders are casters and need to be pulled as singles. <br>
<br>
Same thing when kiting the Reverants except the Reavers are casters and need to be single pulled. <br>
<br>
Camps are frequently open, kite is very very very easy. Experience is good up to level 60. At level 61 things start to go lt. blue and green.  <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;VERBALSABRE&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50506&quot;&gt;Profile&lt;br&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mistrornge>mistrornge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/13/02 5:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quad Kiting Locations Guide - Rough Draft</span><hr size=1> Just a thought but perhaps you could arrange the kite spots by level range starting with the lower level so it will be easier to read/find your level range kiting area.

<br>
Raptors in TD: I've seen the first lightblues here at 56 (perhaps even 55, not sure) already, so I'm not sure if they're still worth it at 57. Aside from figuring out how to split the island, it's quite easy. Just watch the huge aggro at first, but once you're used to it, it's in your advantage as it makes it easy to pull them.<br>
<br>
Wyverns in CS: With KEI, I already did Wyverns at lv49 using BoF and CoF. Sure it takes longer and you have to resnare once or twice, but it's very doable.<br>
<br>
Eastern Wastes: I was told by another Wizzie that the Wooly Rhino's in EW are *not* that fast and could be included in a quad. Can't confirm this, might go check this myself.<br>
<br>
Overthere: There's another danger here; sometimes the sarnaks are SoWed here. To make sure one isn't *don't* pull it while it's standing still but look at it walk.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Have levitate.  Usually get five on first pull (four outside corners, one at bottom of tower).  Immobilize one, continue as usual.  Or learn the beauty of octing.  Circle the island until you have all eight spawns, run to shore, BoF one quad, run a little more, BoF other.  Kill second set before BoF wears off the first.  Re-BoF, and quad as usual.  Port up to Nexus, do a few ports, come back and continue.<br>

Most of the mobs killed are all but the Chromo's and the respawn is sometimes Chromo's leaving the zone mostly populated by them.  After the zone is reset or server is reset it's a great place to hunt! But after a week of people killing the easy ones it gets a little harder to find any sort of mobs what you can get 4 of.  Unless of course you take on the dispelling Chromo's...I pay to much for KEI to get it nuked off by these bastages.

They don't run any faster than ulthorks so you can mix and match.  They also keep walking and stick together until they are all alone, in which case they stop dead so you can finish with a DD spell.  They also share spawns with the ulthorks so you get more ulthorks if you kill rhinos too.  The one dif is that they have more HP than warriors.  It takes about three extra casts of CoF to kill the rhinos, compared to ulthork warriors.  XP for me has become pretty crappy at 42.<br>
<br>
  On another note, with KEI and decent equipment, I'm quadding frost giants.  Takes almost all my mana but I can do it.  They hardly ever resist and the area just below the fortress is flat enough to quad without adds.<br>

You are not mistaken.  The big problem with SF however isn't so much the mobs that cast, but the chromadracs in particular.  The annoying thing is not that they cast.  The annoying thing about chromas is that they cast a dispell which will take out all of your buffs.  The recent problem is that their casting range has been increased greatly.  That is what makes it so hard to kill them.  By the time they get into casting range for you to snare or nuke them, they have already cast their dispell on you, which means bye-bye kei, bye-bye sow, and if you aren't careful, bye-bye wiz.<br>

Like the chromas in SF, spectres now have a huge range on their lifetap ability, making them pretty much impossible to quad.  After giving up specs I moved to EW at 37 and have been quadding there ever since, starting with walruses and ulthorks and moving to ulthork warriors and wooly rhinos.  Lately I've been quadding giants from the jail area, and at 46 am getting 2 blue bub of exp for a quad of 2 frost giants and 2 kromrif prison guards.  The giants have a long respawn time so I usually take a quad of giants, med to around 60 - 80 percent, go round up some ulthorks in an attempt to get tusks, med to full and then go get more giants.<br>

As a side note:  I ran from a couple chromas in SF after porting someone in, and all I have to say is thank god for jboots!  I just kept hitting my jboot hotkey over and over again.  Luckily my KEI was the bottom of the list.  I got away and ported back out, no harm, no foul.  Though I am going to start charging a premium for ports into SF. <p>-Raelar Arcanus<br>
