I do however think it is the most fresh idea i have heard on how to fix it. The thing that i could think of to maybe add to your assesment is maybe take away some mana regen to use manaburn this way. It would kind of go along with the &quot;Story&quot; of a wizard. There are many fantasy stories out there of magic users who imbue items with thier energies when they have down time. If the VI followed suit, and said that anyone who spent the AA on MB would lose enough mana over the course of an hour to fill up thier mana pool again, in order to use for manaburn. I really suck at math, so maybe someone could do the math on this, but it seems like a logical idea...<br>
It shouldn't matter what mana regen buffs you have either, because whatever mana was taken from your original mana pool, would have to be stretched out over the course of an hour. Having KEI wouldn't decrease the recast timer on MB, it would just make it so that less mana was taken each tick, to be put towards MB pool.<br>

<br>
you don't have to be a history major of prohibition to at the core of common sense realize and simply KNOW that you do not break a monopoly on something by making it less available or harder to kill<br>
<br>
if you belive that nerfing manaburn made anything in this game more available to everyone then please send me an email.. i have a bridge for sale that you'll be very interested in<br>
<br>
with manaburn gone the only fix or balance is via availability period<br>

And no, I don't even have mb nor did I even know them as friends. Manaburn was fine and dandy and I think it really helped with decreasing costs of wizard spells or atleast making them more available as well as giving wizards a small timeframe in which they could get their epics easily if they gather up a bunch of friends.<br>
<br>
But it ruined current content and limited actual difficult content in the future. You can't say wizards need something now that manaburn is gone b/c in raids with sunstrike, mage spell haste ring and cleric spell haste from the point I start nuking I'm averaging 350dps. On fire mobs combining Ice Spear and draught of ice together will come up with almost identical numbers as sunstrike.<br>

<br>
it was not as you suggest put ingame for a short time as a toy for a few wizards to play with to justify gutting it later, it's a lame excuse.. if you can flag manastones not to work somewhere you can flag MB not to work in PoP<br>
<br>
i'm not saying there were problems with it.. i'm just saying that MB was there for a reason.. and without it without adding a similar large damage something or new content or whatever the only fix then is to do something with availability i.e. wizard epic golem fix.. for the content already ingame that the introduction of MB was supposed to do for the wizard community in the first place<br>

<br>
PoN, PoD, OS.. assuming these are PoP zones that i don't have, 99.9% of anything i'm lacking is pre-PoP.. there's no reason to buy it what so ever.. i'm a wizard.. i don't need stoopid PoK books to port around.. and don't give me well that's where exp is now.. that's friggen BS and all your doing is telling sony it's ok to trash eq so your forced to buy whatever your putting out now.. that sets a horrible precident for any future product assuming they just arn't trashing eq totally piece by piece so you have to buy their newest product (eq2, starwars, star trek).. (i.e. remember what they did to meridian so you had to buy eq in the first place ???? they took the game apart piece by piece then took out most of the support till people just stopped playing.. read the post out there about the new GM/GUIDE system.. seems dam familiar.. get out of that dam frame of mind, your doing more harm than good and telling them that's an ok thing to do, and yes.. the company that did meridian online was a subdivision of sony.. ask yourself.. self ? they did 3 expansions before this and didn't trash the content that was already ingame before.. what's different now ? well.. when those were put out eq2 wasn't just around the corner)<br>

if you know a spot in ME that you can somehow get toilers without a train post it up.. however they are alot harder than goranga's and the med time vs exp just doesn't make it worth it.. KEI is few and very far between.. there's usually none online selling <br>

what raptors ? oot ? <br>

says about 2900.. so that's what i used to figure 4k ish MB figure<br>
<br>
the zones that i have to try and get equip still from are EMPTY !  there's no one there plugging away at light blues.. there is just no way as a wizard to gain these items or drops period yet my sk or my cleric have little problem.. cleric's almost 60 also now and i'm not seeing any problem with him being able to go online and get together a group to get something done.. my Sk's getting closer to 50 so i really don't have too much info for that perspective yet but getting there<br>
<br>
this forum is entitled GOOD OL MANABURN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  with MB i would of been able like other wizards i knew to log on and go hey.. this guy's up.. i can MB for about a third of it's hp's.. we just got to get some peeps together for the rest.. or if another wizard was online hey.. we just got to scrounge a group for a third and we got it<br>
<br>
that is gone.. no mo.. nothing.. as a wizard now i have to get online and find a full compliment of people TO DO FOR ME.. that's hard work ? that's self sacrafice ? that's reward for being a good player ? bullsht.. that's just begging for a drop.. as a wizard i am unable to get online and work tword even the smallest goals that are ingame for my class<br>
<br>
being a squishy elf in a bathrobe running around smacking stuff with a book isn't exactly what most people are comfortable forming a group around period<br>
<br>
as i've said before if they want to continue this gutting of manaburn then the only reasonable fix for it is to look at the availability of the content ingame as it stands now without it that MB was put in there IN THE FIRST PLACE to address<br>
<br>
look.. not trying to rant but just being seriously honest.. if you know better just post up the facts the where and the when and the how and i'm more than willing to give it a try.. i'm just posting up the reality of the game as i expierience it every day i log ingame.. it's not a rant just an honest reporting of what's up over here <br>

edit: the first paragraph seems a bit contradictory.. i was simply pointing out that the few times that i was actively trying to quad with my equip and manapool at the time (most the goodies in my magelo are from 58/59 lvls) light blues made it actually worth the risk as that if something goes wrong i.e. lag or something.. with them being light my chances of coming back ingame alive were a bit better or snapping back ingame and still being alive to finish the kite or gate were actually quite good.. i wasn't even shown how to quad untill i was 56 to begin with.. thx again Akshel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harvestofsouls>Harvest of Souls</A> at: 12/10/02 5:11:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midgetgod>Midget God</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/10/02 3:21 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: huh?</span><hr size=1> I don't think you can say that Manaburn was put in the game specifically to balance us... That statement can be only made by the actual designers of the game. Its more or less just a perk...<br>
<br>
Manaburn was taken out of the game in my opinion due to it throwing off the risk vs reward aspect of the game (back when they explained why they nerfed Manaburn they said it would ruin content by making it too easy as in make the risk of encounters too low). A good velious analogy would be manaburning Sontalak with 13 people involves no risk. Risk vs Reward is thrown off. Add the 1 minute counter and now the fight must last 13 minutes (ha!) to do it with the same number of people. That as everyone knows is impossible. So risk vs reward is back in harmony now.<br>
<br>
It took me 10 deaths to figure out how to quad in ME and prolly the same for most other people... I'll let you die the same amount to figure it out. First you gotta take risks. Then the rewards flow in. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syrne>Syrne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/10/02 10:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: huh?</span><hr size=1> Anyone who brings up roleplaying should think twice.

<br>
it's just a basic fundamental question involving manaburn..<br>
<br>
can you imagine being a wizard now who buys PoP and EQ and starts a wizard ?<br>
<br>
the wizard spires and our roles of porting might of been a pain for other's and ourselves sure.. but was great places to sit and med and talk with other wizards.. it was a valuable asset to the wizard class.. many groups i eventually experienced were from this base to begin with.. with the add of scion's and now PoK books one of the basic fundamental and support structures of the wizard class has been seriously eroded<br>
<br>
** social and structure support<br>
<br>
ok.. next topic<br>
<br>
** wizard groupability<br>
<br>
with the erosion of the above it directly affects obviously the next.. so the effect is of course more reliance on soloing for the average wizard<br>
<br>
so..<br>
<br>
** Social and Structural support eroded<br>
** wizard groupability and opportunity eroded<br>
<br>
ok next topic<br>
<br>
the need for bigger nukes.. wich of course is the result of more need for soloing.. there are lots of topics here about needed larger damage nooks.. yes they are needed.. yes in cases that might make wizards a bit too over powered but is again a result of other primary root structure issues with the wizard class<br>
<br>
** social and structural support eroded<br>
** wizard groupability and opportunity eroded<br>
** the need to be more self reliant increased<br>
<br>
ok next topic<br>
<br>
spell and item availability issues and topics posted here.. again at the time put into the game might of been correct or balanced but once again when looked at the whole is affected by other aspects of the wizard class in general.. sorta how i see why manaburn was put into game, this was the answer of a large nook that very smartly didn't improve the soloing aspect of wizards.. of course there are arguments on need and counter arguments that are correct also on how items and spells and quests should remain aloof.. (pretty sure that's a word).. and the answer without people say is to find a group<br>
<br>
** social and structural support eroded<br>
** wizard groupability and opportunity eroded<br>
** the need to be more self reliant increased<br>
** the need for larger damage for access to game content<br>
<br>
ok.. so go back to the start of this post and start over again in the cycle<br>
<br>
the last here is where i see them trying out manaburn.. if you increase any one of these aspects they of course spill into another and help the whole wich basically encompasses all balance topics together<br>
<br>
you can put what's above this paragrah paste/copy on basically any post dealing with any aspect of the wizard class in the theature of balance and it will apply to them all basically<br>
<br>
manaburn was a fix to an area.. ok.. didn't work.. but there are other things to look at.. one issue affects the other.. <br>
<br>
i'm just trying to point out that manaburn helped adress the need for making up some of the areas like availability of items and spells and some of the loss of support base for the class.. yes there are posts on how some guilds had wizards just for MB.. it's sad that people just didn't pick up on <br>
<br>
/gasp.. hey.. we might have to invite more wizards to our groups<br>
<br>
what a horrid thought eh?<br>
<br>
it's been pointed out that the MB experiment didn't pan out like expected.. fine.. there's other aspects that can be looked at also if they want to continue this nerf to manaburn.. i'm just saying that with the way things stand with the class as a whole the easiest most simpleist most far ranging across all lvls of the wizard experience is just to look at the availability of content already ingame..<br>
<br>
inc<br>
<br>

What do you mean by this? I see, I have shitty gear, a shitty guild, and b/c of this I can't see any content in game. Manaburn is so awesome it'll lemme see that content.<br>
<br>
Truth be told, this doesn't let you see content. It lets you see how well X amount of wizards can press a hotkey. These encounters aren't designed for people to waltz in and all together press 1 hotkey to do the &quot;content&quot;. They were designed with a little more strategy involved.<br>
<br>
I still don't see your point considering almost all our other AAs are absolutely amazing and more than make up for not having manaburn. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harvestofsouls>Harvest of Souls</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/11/02 11:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: huh?</span><hr size=1> so your answer to class balance is to simply get on your knees and blow a higher lvl whomever for a spot in the handout line after thursday's raid they've made trivial anyway through thier roster ?<br>
<br>
manaburn was a very usefull tool that gave the wizard a standing and realistic base to form a group around to go after what content is ingame that you need<br>
<br>
and it didn't work as that it was easily exploitable.. there have been many suggestions as to how to counter the exploit but seems to be falling on sony's deaf ears<br>
<br>
i'm just stating that the direct fix to manaburn without touching how it is now is to look at the availability of content that manaburn being put ingame allowed you as a wizard to work for<br>
<br>
not beg guild x for<br>
<br>
there is no risk vs reward in putting on a dress and dancing to whomever's loot policy that have your mob monopolized and trivialized in the first place.. that's hard work ? that's risk vs reward ? that's self sacrafice and reward for being a good player ? no.. that's begging for a drop<br>
<br>
so.. please explain how 3 mana a tic and a broken crit table and whatever else aa points that will take RL years to achieve now with no exp from light blues and no AoE groups and quading nerfed to achieve.. how with the exp nerf the zones that up and coming wizards are in no longer have the higher lvls there to group with is balanced and opens more oportunities to the lower lvl wizards<br>
<br>
seeing how your guild Sublimity is a 55+ only guild that recruits from other guild's, and once prospective members have used and stolen time and effort from enough other people to get to that point in the game they have proven themselves big enough jerks to apply .. 99.9% of people do not solo to 55.. i would assume then that begging for whatever is perfectly acceptable in your point of view as that your guild has no risk vs reward but instead just lives on the hard work of others to further your own goals.. that's far from being sociable.. it's called isolationism or imperialism.. deffinetly not honest or fair or balanced<br>
<br>
manaburn wasn't perfect.. but it was a step in the right direction for people whom work for what they have.. not beg for it<br>
