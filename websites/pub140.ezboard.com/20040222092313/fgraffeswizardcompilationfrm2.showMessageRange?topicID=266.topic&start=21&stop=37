I am a level 45 wizard on Saryrn.  <br>
<br>
One word of warning...do not use fire based spells on the AC.  I finally got him to spawn and I agoed him first.  I dropped a conflag on him and it was a full resist.  I thought this was a fluke so I dropped another on him and it was another full resist.  I sat down and memmed an ice-based dd and it hit for full damage.  By the time I had done all this, someone else had KSd it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Oh well....I will be ready for him next time......<br>
<br>
My question is:  I have heard that the AC will only spawn in the morning hours between 4 and 8 AM.  Does anyone know the validity of this?  If someone has killed him at some time other than this...please let me know.<br>
<br>
Also....I have heard that you only need to kill the undead mobs in the zone to get him to spawn.  Is there any truth to this?<br>

First time i got sooo lucky. I was done for the night in  CoM and ported my group to Sro. I sat the on the spires for quite a while talking to some friends. I got bored and wandered over to the desert. I was sitting on a hill between the derv camp and the inke camp. it was 1 am in the morning gmae time. poof right behind me was a AC and no one was around me. i cant honestly rember what spell i cast on him to drop him but i know he went down quick. I was literally shaking bc omg i have jboots now( as soon as i finish the quest) After that i became obssesed with AC so i started camping him. The four other times i got him ( all for friends btw  multi quest is a wonderful thing ) he spawned totally random ; the times i mean. once i killed the ph in the tower at 8 pm ( crypt mummy ) and at 10 pm he popped close to the zone to oasis. three times he popped at 1 am near the west derv camp. once he pooped right near the inkie camp at 2 am. and one time i was there i didnt get him but he popped over by the undead tower near the east derv camp at midnight.<br>

hope that helps a little bit <p><html>

Well jboots are not sow and any mob (Griffons, rapters, drachnids, some velious giants) that run at or close to sow will beat your ass down with jboots on!  Jboots are very nice but I always keep a 10 charge dose of sow with me for the times the extra speed is needed.  You are almost certain to die once you get jboots thinking wow I can just run away now.  Hehehe, loading please wait...<br>

<br>
Last nite my hubby (level 54 ranger) and I camped the AC in South Ro.  We followed the tips at www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/sro (someone else had posted this one earlier, sorry not to give credit where it's due, but I looked around a bit and couldn't find the original post).  We sat at the evil vendor camp and killed any of the &quot;rare mobs&quot; that came up on tracking (we also added &quot;a skeleton&quot; to the list because it seemed out of place). First hour -- a lot of rares, and we thought, wow, this really works.  Next few hours, only two or three rares spawned.  We were starting to think, okay, maybe this isn't working, and then BAM, a bunch of rares spawned again and then POP, AC right in the middle of the derv camp on the west wall.  We hauled butt over there, my hubby engaged him while I cast Lightning Shock on him like crazy (not even partially resisted) and BOOM, he went down and I got the ring.  I don't know if his spawning was coincidence or if killing the rares helped, but it's a lot easier than trying to kill everything in the zone and it's a tactic I would definitely recommend trying as it took us less than 4 hours.<br>
<br>
I didn't check what time it was when he spawned but it was during the day (game time), but the first time I camped him he spawned twice in two hours, oddly enough both times were 9 p.m. game time. Unfortunately, he didn't spawn again in the next five hours.<br>

Clear all undead from the sands. <br>
At approx 10pm, kill the undead in the tower.<br>
Keep the sands clear of all undead until the AC shows up.<br>
<br>
We killed 0 spiders, no madmen, no dervs, no SGs, nada.<br>
Just undead.<br>
<br>
Like I said, 3 for 3.  We had a 42 necro (sense undead was beautiful) and myself (39 wiz).  Necro pet kept the sands clear and our mana up for when the AC popped.<br>
<br>
Side note:  We had 1 other person in the zone all night and he wasn't killing anything..just passing through.  <br>
He did drop the AC when it popped though...hahaha.<br>
S'okay, we got the other two in two (3) Norrathian nights.  (Missed a spawn cycle right after him since a druid showed up and we had to run him off.)<br>

There are a few things ive read from various places, but i wasnt sure about any of em:<br>
1)Creature in the submerged tower has some significance, not sure what though<br>
2)one of the ways to spawn him is to work on regular yard trash or undead<br>
3)SGs and the other nameds are possible replacements<br>
<br>
I spent along time waiting till there was no one else around, i wasnt prepared to get it ksed after all my work.<br>
Also, left the yard trash alone, rounded up lots of undead, PBAoEd em, medded a little, started again. I got round the mana problem when i noticed that the DE vendors will kill SGs. So whenever i saw one i aggroed it and ran it over to them. I got really really lucky in that my AC spawned after about 30 mins, and shaking violently, kited him without a sow at level 40 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The AC is one of them and they spawn completelly randomly (or so it seems) so if you keep killing them fast you'll make the AC pop faster.<br>
<br>
Terrorantula, regular clops are part of those &quot;rares&quot;, but a lot of other mobs are too. Particularly, be careful to check if there's a &quot;a&quot; or not before the mob's name. &quot;desert tarantula&quot; and &quot;a desert tarantula&quot; are not on the same spawn list. I can't recall which one is the rare though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So basically, spend some time with a friend tracker there, and have him identify which mobs are never found more than twice concurrently in the zone. These are the mobs you want to kill to make the AC spawn.<br>
<br>
Also note that this can not be done by a solowing wiz, as it takes you way too long to kill those and you may find yourself too low on mana when the AC finally spawns. Now if you can get your guild to spend an afternoon there, chances are you'll get over one ring per hour, which is enough to make a few people happy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uobiquon1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Obiquon1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 387<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/12/02 12:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On Journeyman's Boots and the Ancient Cyclops</span><hr size=1> ok folks here it is. kill the PH in the tower by the derv camp (not far from the spires) at 6pm.

From there you can see all 7 of his spawn points. I helped a pally do this several times (sometimes it took a few game days to spawn him). His &quot;list&quot; was so long I never bothered (since I have tboots) and now have run1 in aaxp so I wont bother with the camp BUT this does work. <p><br><br>

<br>
Although here's how the morning went....<br>
<br>
I show up with 8 SOW Potions and there's about 4 other people in the zone killing everything in their path. I checked the undead tower and killed the spawn in it.<br>
<br>
I constantly looked around, and kept killing the undead spawn in the tower. It seemed to spawn from 15 to 30 minutes (I wrote down the time each time it spawned, and got that range).<br>
<br>
The morning went on and only one person left. SGs spawned in the West Region a lot, so I tended to stick in the East Region. Everyone seemed to stay in the Easy, so it gave me better odds (50% of spawning on the East Side...hopefully) and that allowed me to kill the undead tower. I mean I saw 5 people walk up to the tower right as it spawned (or a minute after), but they wouldn't kill it *Shrugs*.<br>
<br>
Anyway I was soon alone in the zone, I started scouting more. I didn't really kill anything, I admit it, I was tired from staying up all night into morning.<br>
<br>
Soon this Anon. guy comes (around 6:20). He was killing a few things in the Northwestern side. I continued to kill the undead spawn ONLY, and I was starting to think, &quot;this isn't working&quot;.<br>
<br>
Then almighty behold, an AC spawns, Northeastern side. Of course the Anon. guy was already killing the AC and I thought I was the first to spot it. Wishful thinking &lt;:).<br>
<br>
It really pissed me off, because of the fact he was there only 20 minutes and I was there all morning. I then noticed this Anon character has a bear pet. I thought for a moment...&quot;Beastlords, Druids and Shamans all have sow and he had to be one of those because of his pet&quot;. I was nearly about to kill someone. I asked him his class he said, &quot;druid&quot;. Although it makes me wonder, since there are no bears in that zone...<br>
<br>
Anyway I was just freaked out by the fact it was someone who definally had SOW. He said he was MQing with one of his wizards on his own account. I wanted to kill him...It's impossible to MQ with characters on the same account.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I guess I'll be camping it again next morning.<br>
<br>
The undead placeholder seemed to do nothing. During the time 5 people were on killing everything, it didn't seem to help spawn the AC, although from now and then, SGs spawned. No Named SGs. Of course later, when only a few things were being killed, the AC spawns.<br>
-[End of crappy story]-<br>
<br>
Anyway just wanted to note a few things. Do NOT use fire based spells, I've heard from many people they do not work on the AC. I waited until level 44 for this quest, to help avoid being KSed if I'm the first one to see the AC. If you're level 44-48, keep Force Strike(L44) and Lightning Shock(L39) memmed. Force Strike has a 12 second recast time, thus you need the next best DD, which cannot be firebased.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps some of you out. Post if you have any questions. I've spent over 15 hours trying to kill the AC, with no luck.<br>
