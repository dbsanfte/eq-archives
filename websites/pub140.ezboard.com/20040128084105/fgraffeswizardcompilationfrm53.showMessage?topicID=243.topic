My guild has just recently decided to learn these, and they're actually pretty fun.  We didn't kill any yet, but here's a summary of our progress (note, we're pretty far down the uber chain on our server at this time, and for these raids I'm talking about the average level is 61-62):<br>
<br>
Attempt 1: Forest Lord - 30 players - Got him to 29%.  Figured out that he hits for 1481, his rampage *hurts*, and he's unslowable.  Was a straight up single-mob melee fight, no special AE or adds or anything.  I believe we had 6 clerics present for this, 5 of which were in the rotation for the MA, the other was spot healing and clicking and stuff.<br>
<br>
Attempt 2: Forest Lord - 29 players (same night) - Got him to 14%.  Basically same raid minus some person who left.  Nothing new really, just executed a bit better.<br>
<br>
Attempt 3: Forest Lord - 38-ish players(?) - We figured after the previous night of attempts with a slightly larger raid force on we'd win for sure.  We got our outselves wtfpwned in very short order.  This time he summoned several (6-8?) miniature tree mobs to his side shortly after engage, which we were not expecting.  They promptly ate clerics before encs/bards could figure out what was going on.  65 bard said they are mezzable (for him anyways).  For me they were rootable and snareable, so kiting should be an option.<br>
<br>
Attempt 4: Forest Lord - 34-ish players(?) (same night) - well we tried him again after the surprise tree spawn event, planning to have bard/enc deal with the situation.  This time he didn't summon any trees, it was a straight fight like the previous two attempts.  All our previous attempts we killed him in front of fort, and we usually had 1-2 roamer frogs add on the raid.  This time we pulled him off to the side-wall where people normall do named, to avoid the frogs.  We ended up pushing him over some trees, which summoned people around, got a few killed, and it fell apart.  Note to self, dont push mob into trees (duh).<br>
<br>
Attempt 5: Ocean Lord (we went back to forest to try again but he became untargettable again and the fort hadn't repopped, so we decided to move on) - same night roughly same people.  You dont have to clear very much of Coastal to get what appears to be a lord to spawn.  Just the spawns in the obvious main building, the two buildings across the courtyard from it, and the building behind (over a bridge from) the main building.  When he becomes targettable, he repopped all the giants we had just cleared all at once.  We re-cleared them all without any aggro from him, figuring they would bumrush us on engage.<br>
<br>
Then we engaged him solo.  He was like, more gimp than vindi.  We were all happy (yay, this must be the Easy lord, this guy is so dead).  When the fight ended, there was absolutely zero loot on the corpse, not even medallions or anything.  Back at his spawn point was a lost wanderer type NPC.  Hailed him, and said &quot;We killed Jeplak&quot; (or whatever the giant's name was), and he despawned, informing us that that was a fake Jeplak, and the real one was now present in the rear building.  Sure enough there was a new untargettable Jeplak in the back, with 2-3 guards.  Killed those guards, he became targettable.   Tried to kill him, he summoned an bunch of drowned souls on us and pwned us like the forest guy did with trees.<br>
<br>
And that's as far as we got on those so far.  The most important thing we've figured out is this:  Apparently whenever a Lord pops fresh from a death or server reset, the first time they are engaged they summon helpers which make the fight signifcantly harder.  Once he's done it once however, he can't seem to do it again.  From now on if we know it's a fresh pop, we'll probably just send in a suicide team first to engage him long enough to spawn the helper mobs, res them back in, and then re-engage without the helper mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oxoxoxoxox>Oxoxo Xoxox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 969<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/11/03 3:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoS Giant Lords</span><hr size=1> Killed the Ocean lord and the Forrest lord.  We had about 60 ppl in our raid and owned them.  The above poster is totally correct, the Lords are like mini-AoWs Less HPs but not much less and they dont hit quite so hard but if your not prepaired the rampage will kill all your tanks.<br>
<br>
The Forrest Lord spawns like 4 trees to help him they are called like Enraged Ents or something and are fairly easy, just dont let them chew up your casters, have someone kite them.  Funny thing was we killed the forrest lord so fast that 2 minutes after he was dead and we were doing loot, 4 more trees spawned.  I figure they were part of his script meant to occur at the end of the fight rofl.<br>
<br>
The ocean lord has a fake and once you kill him you can get the real one.  The real one spawns like 15 zombies called Proginators or something that look like Dregs in Fungus Grove.  These caused us lots of problems because there were so many, finally we killed the lord and the zombies but lost a lot of ppl.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about killing the lords take 40-50 ppl <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68788" target="top">Oxoxo Xoxox ~ Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Ocean Lord: As Oxo said kill fake, hail the npc poped in his place and real one pops. He hits about 1400ish and procs FD (like all ocean types) if I remember correctly. And from time to time some Dreg looking mobs pops in the room.<br>
<br>
Forest Lord: Well I haven´t got much to say about this guy since I was lagging bad + LDed. Melee is 1400 ish and I bet he doesn´t proc anything. Summons some trees tho.<br>
<br>
Desert Lord: I heard this one is the toughest of all. He melee the same as the others, but he also procs 1500DD + Stun. And I think when he agros, the mobs around him which normaly does not agro will agro aswell. (I might be mistaken).<br>
<br>
I believe ( not sure about the desert one ) that all lords have the same melee, with their specific procs / summons and same amount of HP. The loot seemed to be always 3 medals and uh... dunno the rest. I heard that he dropped a ring. Sorry this was a long time ago and I don´t remember very well about the details. I do remember that all LORDS are not SLOWABLE, which on the first encounter they were.<br>

Hits 1480, unslowable, Rampages and flurries (although rarely).<br>
He seems to spawn a bunch of tree adds to assist him. This can be triggered by a monk (not quite sure how guildie did it) and it takes him alittle while to reset this ability, but tree's will depop shortly.<br>
<br>
Desert Lord<br>
Hits 1480, procs a 1500 DD on the mt, unslowable, Rampages (Have not seen flurry yet)<br>
Hes pretty straight forward. His DPS is insanely high, so make sure you have a very strong cleric rotation on him.<br>
<br>
Sea Lord<br>
Hits 1480, unslowable, Rampages (not too often) havent seen flurry yet.<br>
When all sea giants are cleared, the 'fake' version of him will become targetable and hes pretty easy. After that, the real Lord will spawn in the back castle over the bridge. When engaging Jeplak, he will spawn an insane amount of Zombie looking adds. They seem to hit for about 288 max, Slowable, mezzable with Apathy+, but not stunable with old world AE stuns. From what i could see, they spawn in clusters of 4 or 5 approximately every 20 seconds. You'll litterally end up with 25+ adds running around hitting everyone and its totally chaotic. Maintaining a Cheal rotation is nearly impossible. <br>
<br>
Took him down on 2nd try with 36, other 2 can easily be taken with less. Sea lord is by FAR the toughest.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

<br>
You don't have to kill the minis, other than they often aggro when clearing anyway.<br>
<br>
Daerius' summary is pretty dead on.  <br>
<br>
Sea lord is probably hardest only because he spawns a vast number of adds, almost to the point that it makes me wonder if he's broken.  His adds are certainly more difficult to deal with than those from the other Lords.<br>
<br>
Desert is just a vicious beast for DPS.  Treat him alot like the AoW I'd say, and make sure to manage aggro.  You really need a couple of good heal chains here, because his rampage is almost as bad as tanking him.<br>
<br>
Forest Lord is easiest.  Charm cheese aside, I wager 3 sooper dooper equipped groups could do him.  We've done him with 4 pre-ssra, ntovish/hot groups.  Again, just manage aggro and rampage.  <br>
<br>
The lords are really great NPCs for a guild to learn advanced raid mob tactics on.  CR is easy if you wipe, loot is OKish depending on your guild's level, and they hit hard enough to wake you up if you make a mistake.<br>
