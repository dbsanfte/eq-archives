<br>
1) Wizards along with many other classes are trying to compete for the last 3 spots in a group. Most groups I have been in or made, need a tank, healer (preferably a cleric), slower (shaman or enchanter). I cant count the number of times I have been on my shaman ONLY to transfer or buff a friend (I dont have lfg on) and I get a tell to join a group. That leaves 3 spots left, and depending on the place or situation it might leave us with only 2 spots (monk puller for example). Necros have the SAME EXACT complain as us, and they have group friendly spells at high end, zevefers (1000 hp over time for all group) and mind wrack (free 300 mana to all in group) and have problems getting groups, with brings me to my next point.<br>
<br>
2) PERCEPTION! This is a reason why necros (and us) have problems getting groups. MANY people think the ONLY reason for a wizard is to port or raid or quad and farm. Some of us are guilty of this against other classes. <br>
<br>
The first one can be fixed my eq by giving wizards A (not another) group friendly spell or maybe make max in a group 7 or something. <br>
The second is something that people must fix and isnt going to get fixed but thats my opinion.  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Where government is afraid of the people there is freedom.

Honestly as others mentioned I think where a wiz MAY need an upgrade is 51-59, but at that point who cares you can quad kite basically a level a day (slower later on) and be out of it in no time.<br>
<br>
Each time i leave a group they are always in Awe of wizzy nuke power 5k+ crits; or if going over time dps then with the consistant nukage with Draughts.  So we dont get a pet big deal.. however get Harvest and HoD and bring some utility to groups be it CC with Greater Fetter or Evac's when needed, or a snares (in worst case).  At 61+ the class does shine despite what others may believe especially with each passing AA <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

At the end of the grind, I've never left a group that thought &quot;damn consistant wizzy dps sucks!&quot;.

<br>
A lot of other classes have the same complaint------we need more group friendly spells. <br>
<br>
Bullshit. There are only 3 group friendly spell lines that will actually get you grouped consistantly. heal, slow, and mes.<br>
<br>
Anything other than those 3 are just window dressing. Out of those 3 lines, only the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>top</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of that line will get you grouped. I wanted to add res to that list, but with GY's, who cares? Necros and Paladins have res, and they still have problems getting groups. Necros also have fd, but how many groups will let a necro pull? I will, but i guess I'm strange. Beastlords and bards have slow, but again, who cares? it's not the best. Clerics are the best healers, and groups will only take a druid as a last resort when other clerics can't be found. <br>
<br>
The reality is this: no so called group friendly spell will ever get us grouped consistantly, unless it falls into one of those 3 spell lines, and frankly, I absolutely love my role of damage and damage only. Please don't ask me to crowd control, heal or slow, if i wanted that, i would've played another class. <p>Sage Flintnilf Ironori<br>

<br>
the perception that one particular type of group is &quot;mainstream&quot; is exactly what works against wizards (and other DPS classes) in grouping. The game dynamics aren't going to change where suddenly wizards can take the place of a tank, healer, or crowd control (though we make great backup CC in most zones). Instead of trying to fit into the mold, we should be trying to break the mold. &quot;fringe&quot; is where many classes are finding groups these days... 5 BLs and a druid... all-pet groups, group-kiting...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Still no probs here</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>pre-PoP the conventional wisdom was &quot;sub-60 wizards have it rough, but at 60 life is rosey&quot;.....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

I've heard this alot, and with it, the arguements that wizards come into thier true power later. Pre snare, it sucks being a wizard, the 50's are hard because the nukes aren't that good as when you reach level 60.<br>
<br>
Why should only the end game for a wizard be the best time? Honestly, I've had fun being a wizard all the way through. The only time that was most annoying was when I was still doing research at level 41, and managed to make all my spells. Having ice comet sit in a bank, for 8 more levels was burnging a hole in my backpack.

Since the patch for the visual damage I've really noticed this more. Just the other night I was in nadox killing luggalds to finish up my Ice Harpoon quest with some guildies. We couldn't get a tank or a cleric to come down, so it was just myself (54 wiz), a shaman, two magi (60 and 57), and an afk bard feeding us mana (she had been grouping with us before but needed to go afk/log... we convinced her to afk and feed us mana, heh). Anyway, point is even with the magis levels I still nuked almost twice as much and easily beat them in total nuke damage done. Mana effeciency + concussion = thx.<br>
<br>
Gotta say that my 60 magi friend's epic pet does beat the snot outta stuff tho, heh. Counting his pet with his nukes, he's got me thoroughly beat I'm thinking. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=596996" target="top">Infirno</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I would crit every now and then with Firebolt of Talon for a nice 3500 pts of damage which was usually overshadowed by a nice 6500 pt crit by the wizard.  The group was great and the exp was constant-- so constant in fact that there was downtime while we waited for repops.<br>

<br>
That's true.  <br>
<br>
The sticking point these days is melee soloability at high level.  Those ignorant twits whine and whine all day as if they've totally forgotten how fast they leveled up with their Ikky BP's, dirt cheap +HP gear and nice weapons.  They don't want to talk about or acknowledge how bad they dust wizards in damage for most of the game.  They only see that holy grail of the last 10 or so levels of exp/raiding and think being able to quad is a gift from the gods.<br>
<br>
The wizard class pre 60 is like a museum antiquity.  99% of the spells and gear effects are stuck in the original design balance of the game.  Most of the other classes can circumvent that by either buying better gear for themselves or by playing a support role to those who can.  <br>
<br>
Message to SOE: you can nerf KEI and let melees stomp wizards for 60 levels but no matter how much you fuck over wizards, these melees are still only going to see that wizards are able to quad and crit big at high level.  <br>
<br>
So you might as well take your foot off the brake and go ahead and finish balancing the class for either grouping or soloing pre-60.  Either give wizards the proper and COMPLETE set of tools they need to solo consistently or start working on getting their spell line updated to fit 2003 instead of 1999. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tessei>Tessei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 2:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> comments</span><hr size=1> &quot;There are only 3 group friendly spell lines that will actually get you grouped consistantly. heal, slow, and mes.&quot;<br>
<br>
People dont like haste? People dont like buffs? People dont like mana regen? Yes most of the time they DO come with the mentioned above but other classes add to it (bard song, bst crack, etc).<br>
<br>
&quot;Beastlords and bards have slow, but again, who cares? it's not the best.&quot;<br>
<br>
It works in a pinch, but people dont like it, why? their slow is ~30% and shaman or enchanter slow is 64-75% depending on class and level. Now that is a HUGE difference, I am willing to bet if the bst or bard slow was much greater (50-60%) you would see them being wanted for the slower in the groups. Here is another way of looking at it, which would you rather have as your SOLO mana regen, bst crack or c3? <br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to add res to that list, but with GY's, who cares? Necros and Paladins have res, and they still have problems getting groups&quot; <br>
<br>
Huh? So your willing to take the exp hit if you die? I dont know a single person that wont look for a rez when they die (where there are GY's). Paladins have problems getting groups? I can rarely find one when looking for a tank. Necros do have rez, do YOU want to pay the 300-600 plat component cost? <br>
<br>
&quot;The reality is this: no so called group friendly spell will ever get us grouped consistantly, unless it falls into one of those 3 spell lines&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree, if as has been suggested by others that our familiars did something for the group we would be wanted by more people in groups. It wouldnt happen overnight but I believe it would happen. I believe this b/c I in the past didnt think necros were good groupers (past tense), but as my roommate leveled his necro I began to realize they were very good groupers, b/c of their group friendly spells. If you fight a mana using mob, and everyone gets a FREE 300 mana (mind wrack) it equals less downtime, also with the FREE 1000 hp over time from zevefers means at least one less heal for the cleric maybe more if others are hurt, also for the shaman this is free mana b/c of canni. What all this equals is LESS downtime for the whole group, and everyone is happy.<br>
<br>
Yes, necros do have problems getting groups but I believe that is a perception problem NOT from not having group spells (which we suffer from).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seaotter42>SeaOtter42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 2:49 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: comments</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Beastlords do get 50% slow at level 60 (vendor purchasable no less)... and a 65% slow at 65. I don't know why anyone thinks BLs have trouble finding groups. In most zones I'd rather have a BL tank than a warrior for an XP-group.<br>

people love haste and buffs. But if wizards were given a haste buff, would they really be grouped more? You're still going to need a slower. You're still going to need a healer. Then your tank class.  mezzer is optional, but you'll want one.  haste will be provided by your slower.<br>

my point was if we were given res, we still wouldn't get grouped <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>consistantly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. i wasn't dissing res, I was showing that other classes have it and still complain about getting groups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I disagree, if as has been suggested by others that our familiars did something for the group we would be wanted by more people in groups. It wouldnt happen overnight but I believe it would happen. I believe this b/c I in the past didnt think necros were good groupers (past tense), but as my roommate leveled his necro I began to realize they were very good groupers, b/c of their group friendly spells. If you fight a mana using mob, and everyone gets a FREE 300 mana (mind wrack) it equals less downtime, also with the FREE 1000 hp over time from zevefers means at least one less heal for the cleric maybe more if others are hurt, also for the shaman this is free mana b/c of canni. What all this equals is LESS downtime for the whole group, and everyone is happy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
correct. necros are great in groups, and did you know that beastlords can give mana and hps at the same time? How long will it take for &quot;perceptions&quot; to change? Takes much longer than a couple of months. Mind wrack has been with necros for at least 2 expansions, nobody cares. <br>
<br>
What exactly can our familiars do that will make us more desirable in groups? mana regen? Well, we'll still have to compete with druids, bards, and beastlords. +attack for the whole group? You'll still have to compete with rangers and bards for your slot. Haste? Would be a nice option, but only attractive if it stacks with buffed haste, which would step on bards. Even with any of these we still have the problem of waiting for &quot;perceptions&quot; to change. <br>
<br>
Grouping more? We get res, haste, mana regen, hp regen we'll <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>still</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be competing for the last 3 slots. <br>
<br>
The only way we'll get grouped <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>consistantly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is if we're suddenly wanted for one of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FIRST</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 3 slots. <p>Sage Flintnilf Ironori<br>

I can understand all of the above arguments but I honestly don't have a problem.  I do agree that it would be nice if our familiars could help the group but unlike the first poster who said, let it help the group and not us, I disagree with that.  I keep flappy around because I'm used to him and like what he does for me.  It would be nice if he helped the group too though.<br>
<br>
I am lucky.  I generally group with a paladin of about the same level and sometimes a ranger.  From that, we usually put the group together.  I'm always in one of those first 3 slots when they're on.<br>
<br>
When it comes to being alone and looking for a group, I will enter a zone and ooc that I'm looking for one.  If people answer, fine.  If they don't then I start checking the zone and if I notice someone alone (and if I don't think I can handle things on my own) I'll ask if they'd like a partner.  I've met many nice people doing this and made many alliances.<br>
<br>
I will also, in some cases, initiate the group.  In this case, I am in the first group slot and I'm the one who puts a group together.  I was in a full group in POI and there were a bunch of people oocing that they were looking for a group.  About 4.  All they really needed to do (ranger, cleric, warrior and even an enchanter) was hook up together.  I ooced that they should and what do you know?  Yup, they finally got a group together, but they ooced singly for like 10 minutes beforehand.<br>
<br>
The other argument about people not wanting a wizard has never held true for me either.  I've had people go out of their way to solicit me for groups (when I was nonlfg and I didn't even know them) because I was a wizard.  And this is besides the normal, &quot;Will you port our guild to hate/sky?&quot; which I think all wizards get.  I had lfg on for less than 30 seconds for getting into raid groups and got 2 solicits for groups from zones away.<br>
<br>
However, if there are wizards who are having problems getting groups (and the only time I am having a problem getting a group is when I don't know what I want to do or where I want to go and none of my friends are on and I don't feel like making my own decisions) then maybe group friendly things would be nice.  Maybe a spell as I think was suggested above where we can cast on someone to increase their spell casting efficiency or something.  Kind of like how some classes get their own spell to make their weapons better.  Maybe making it so that those new dungeons need to be ported or gated out of.  Maybe making flappy more group friendly.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, good luck to all of you who do have problems getting groups. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questorsmoy.com/eqmemberinfopages/storyrenia/reniasig3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1550<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Andrael makes some valid points.

I think visual damage does help us.  Innate crits went a long ways in helping me personally to gain some nods from groups.  And now, with the display of non-melee damage, I am able to directly compare my spell damage output with other classes, as can anyone else if they want.  And in all my observations so far, wizards come out on top.  The DOT classes should have their damage displayable as well imho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadrax>Jadrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1450<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 4:06 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Any wizard that only bings DPS to a group is seriously underplaying our abilities.<br>

<br>
As a member of the 65 with 100+aa's crowd, I will leave it to the rest of you to decide if wizards need to be more group friendly. I do, however, agree with just about everything the original poster said. I soloed about 95+ percent of my exp/aa's because it was more efficient.<br>
<br>
I don't think there is any reason every class needs to be as group friendly as the next. A group &quot;unfriendly&quot; class would be acceptable to some people if the rewards justified it. For me quadding used to make up for the group unfriendly nature of wizards.<br>
<br>
I expected a wizard to be a weak character until the higher levels. This fits with the roleplaying aspects of wizards as portrayed in fantasy novels. I guess I was foolish to expect the disadvantaged suffered at early levels to be rewarded with the benefits one would expect from such specialization at higher levels. This doesn't work in the MMORPG world because then everyone would just PL toons through the crap levels to have god characters at the high end. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the generalist classes are usually to close in efficiency to the specialist classes without giving up the benefits of being a generalist.<br>

I am a 65 Wizard with 80 AA's and fairly well geared, I have raided up to but not including RZ PoP content, with Velious Luclin Kunark etc. all in the mix.<br>
<br>
Until I had my AA's, my FT13 in gear, my lvl 65 and SoS, I was a pathetic excuse for a class as far as contribution.<br>
<br>
The 50's were horrible, my groups were gotten because I can play my class better then anyone, and because of friendships...as far as contribution, it was rather pathetic.<br>
<br>
If familiar effects also added to groupmembers...all I can say is wow.
