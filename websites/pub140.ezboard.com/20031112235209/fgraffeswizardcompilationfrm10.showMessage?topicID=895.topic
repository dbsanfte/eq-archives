Well actually most get on pretty good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
But for those who wish to go down the &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mages get bigger nukes etc than us</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot; line...I'll explain something....<br>
<br>
When I get online as my  mage, I make a summoned bag, fill it with 6 weapons, 2 haste masks and 2 belts for my pets later on. <br>
If I log on and I don't have time to do that &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hey we need ya quick in POV!&quot;,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I have to make those items on the spot.<br>
<br>
My usual routine is:<br>
make pet, buff it, give 2 weapons, belt, mask, SUSPEND MINION so I have one pet &quot;spare&quot;, because PoP mobs *eat* pets. I have lvl 64 pet heal and 9 minute re-use pet lay on hands for 2.2khp thanks to AAs...and they STILL get ganked, you know what I mean if you're a mage, between 800+ hitters, pets lousy mitigation or having to use pet to off tank.<br>
Then I make another pet, buff it give it weapons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ever note how how long it takes for a mage to set up, hm</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How long does a wizzy take to set up?<br>
<br>
Mage dies....has to do all that again...wiz mems spells waits for harvest. Note epic pet isn't great on tier2+ mobs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>at all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in case you wish to point out that mages have that option: I use epic as back up in emergencies or for when we need to CR in some places, 5 min recast, 20 sec pet cast sucks.<br>
Pets themselves are *very* cheap for a mage to be honest, but the time taken to mem all the other stuff, cast it, equip it...<br>
<br>
WHen I get in a group or raid one of first thinsg I do is ask if folk need rods, focus items or &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pet toys</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;. Then go through that rigamrole if needed. I also do tons of COHs through raids and sometimes in nrmal groupings. I also dump lava diamonds, waterstones, coldstones arrows you name it here and there (did Sarryn today mid fight had to make shurikens for some folks while dodging that ** **hole bird, grr, Sorrowsong sucks)<br>
<br>
So , do you see wizzies doing that kind of stuff all the time?<br>
Be serious.<br>
<br>
Therefore, regarding the fact that the time taken to set up, and hassles mages get, do you realy feel mages have it too easy comapred to wizard, that it's too unbalanced?  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/sb.gif"alt="Silverblades Suitcase"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverbladetheenchanter>Silverblade the Enchanter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 4/13/03 1:22:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=swipey>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 664<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/13/03 4:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> Yeah, as a wizard I have very little down time when I first log on. Just a quick (self) port to Nexus for KEI, then gate to bind (I usually bind near where I hunt), run a very short ways, and start killing things.<br>
<br>
For me that is the real draw of a wizard, not the nuking (though that is nice too)<br>
<br>
Being a wizard doesnt mean you escape all hassles though, far from it.  When the Magician is busy CoHing and summoning crap for the raid, what do you thing the Wizard is doing?  If he is like me he's out there porting to nearly every person who is coming, see invising, levitating, Invising, and TLing/porting them to the closest zone to the raid.  On a big raid I can be doing this for an hour before the raid starts, since people straggle in only by ones and twos.  I usually miss out on most of the buffs because im the last one to actually enter the raid zone.  And I also often end up fetching whatever person shows up after the raid starts so that the mage can CoH him.<br>
<br>
How often does a mage have to stop doing his own thing an hour ahead of the scheduled raid start?<br>
Be serious <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But for those who wish to go down the &quot;Mages get bigger nukes etc than us!&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> For starters Mages do not get bigger or better nukes than wizards.

What boggles me even more is that you are half way saying that mages do in fact get better nukes by countering this claim. <p><center><img src="http://people.ucsc.edu/~arice/pictures/zuratulisig.jpg"><br><b><font face="Comic Sans"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> --  I been stompin' in my air force ones for 65 levels.</b></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/13/03 7:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> My only complaint is that sometimes posters in this forum overreact and exagerate various posts in the magician forum, which I moderate.<br>
<br>
For example, another thread in this forum complains that magicians want concussion, and this is just another foolish want in a long list of mage complaints, as if mages were no better than druids.  However, if you actually read the thread in question, you would discover that:<br>
<br>
1) Someone reported that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">considering</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> giving concussion to mages<br>
2) Some mages said that would be a useful thing to have<br>
3) More mages said that it was not needed<br>
4) A few mages said that it was needed on raids<br>
5) Other mages suggested that in the context of increased aggro for spell casters it might prove to be necessary<br>
<br>
No burning desire for concussion, just a reasonable range of reactions to the news that concussion might be under consideration for mages.<br>
<br>
The same poster that complained about mages wanting concussion also suggested that mages wanted root and slow as well, making us out as selfish babies.<br>
<br>
But again, if you read the threads in questions, you will find a discussion with varied points of view, but with the majority of mages suggesting that neither slow nor root are needed.<br>
<br>
Nor are either of these completely irrational or selfish suggestions, but arise from actual problems that mages face.  <br>
<br>
Mages are defenseless without pets and largely helpless against adds, so it is only natural that some mages would suggest a simple remedy like root, which is already had by almost all other spell casters.  It is argueable whether root would solve mage vulnerability without being overpowering, but then that is what the mage forum is for: discussing ideas.  Even if root is inappropriate for mages, much is gained by the discussion, for example, sharing tactics for coping with adds.<br>
<br>
Likewise, since <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Planes of Power</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, mages have been concerned over the fact that our elementals die rather quickly when faced with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-style mobs.  This translates to a dramatic reduction in soloability post-60, whereas many mages were originally attracted to the class in part due to our solid soloability.  Many remedies have been proposed, but it obvious to anyone that slow is nearly required to melee effectively in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Planes of Power</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Therefore, it is as certain as the sun rises that some mages are going to suggest some kind of slow in order to restore the relative tankability of elementals.  Reading the threads in question, and you will discover a broad range of opinions, but a nearly universal agreement that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">something</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> should probably be done to restore mage soloability.  While slow would obviously make elementals tank better, most mages realize that slow is a powerful ability and difficult to justify.  Other alternatives are considered, such as improving air elemental stun, or otherwise increasing damage mitigation for elementals.<br>
<br>
What I don't like to see here in this forum is the smearing of the mage community solely on the basis of the entirely human desire to explore solutions to class problems.<br>

Mages already have very good nukes, you crit for just as big as us, although not as often, you have incredible DPS output with these pets, and you have utility about equal to our own.  I am aware that your pets have tanking problems, but SOE should remedy that directly by modifying the pets, not by giving you a spell line from a different class that you have never had access to before, thinking of the &quot;mages should get slow&quot; argument.  <br>
<br>
Our classes are very similiar and a wizard's true advantage lies in concussion, in the ability to do lots of damage via our nukes.  I personally see it as unfair for mages to gain this, or root, or snare, or slow, etc etc, because your pets are now so very strong DPS wise, coupled with your nukes having been upgraded as well, and a solid utility.  If wizards were clamoring for pets as strong as yours because we &quot;needed&quot; them for one reason or another, you would be equally miffed.  Our classes are already very close in power and abilities, if you gain concussion, it would put you over the top in terms of overall balance, imo.  You make the point that you are just throwing ideas around.  We are pointing out flaws in those ideas, as is our right when the idea will effect our balance relative to you, which is something apparently many mages do not consider.<br>
<br>
As far as the points you make about your initial downtime, before PoP my wizardly life was truly hellacious due to the amount of taxiing i was forced to do when i logged on, before the raid, during the raid, after the raid, etc.  For a long, long, time, playing my wizard was all about ZONING, and getting other people where THEY needed to go.  It sucked.  PoP has solved this problem for me, since we rarely leave the expansion and there is easy access for all to all zones.  I am really enjoying the peace and quiet, but lower level wizards, and those whose guilds are in older content still have serious transportation demands placed on them.  Although comparing our utility as a basis for comparing something which directly influences DPS is kinda silly. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sillyjanine.com/mybases.html"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.cestusdei.org/uploads/images/luxysig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/14/03 10:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> Giving concussion to mages was not the idea of mages, but was reported to be under consideration by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, at the same time caster aggro was being tinkered with on test.  Blame <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for weakening class lines further, but do not blame mages.  Once it is suggested that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is considering concussion for mages, it becomes mages' duty to discuss it in detail.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has a poor track record when it comes to tinkering with classes, and it seems possible that we will get less screwed if we chew on the consequences and alternatives first, as well as be better able to propose better solutions when <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s failed.  For example, I believe the discussion of the rod nerf made the fix much better than it would have otherwise been.<br>
<br>
Yes, mages have powerful pets, and far too many mages either fail or refuse to realize just exactly how powerful the ability to summon a viable tank for little mana is.  These mages often ask for unneeded abilities, either out of greed or ignorance.  Yet the discussion that arises from that is useful to the mage community.  It serves to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the class, as well as provide a context for sharing mage tactics.<br>
<br>
For example, mages can cope with adds by using the earth pet to root, not to melee, but not all mages realize this.  The AA ability <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Quick Summoning 3</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> allows mages to summon a fighting pet in only five seconds, making them much less vulnerable, but not all mages have thought through the consequences of five second pets.<br>
<br>
The lack of tankability is still under discussion, and no clear consensus has emerged.<br>
<br>
But what right do wizards have to be angry about conversations that mages are having among themselves about possibilities?  Should mages be so sensitive to wizard opinion that they not even consider alternatives that might not be appropriate?  Remember that the essence of brainstorming is to toss out ideas, good, bad or indifferent, and to let those ideas inspire other ideas.  Concussion might well be a bad idea, but discussion of it might lead to better ideas, or at the very least, a better understanding of how aggro works and is managed.<br>
<br>
If there were consensus, or even a strong minority in favor of something, I might worry, but it is all just discussion.  There are no petitions or demands for this or that.<br>
<br>
Just mages discussing the strengths and weaknesses, the facts and tactics, of their own class.<br>
<br>
Rather like this board for wizards.<br>

<br>
So SOE is tinkering with giving mages concussion, it does not change my position on the matter, which is that concussion is not appropriate for mages, since mages and wizards are already at a finely balanced point, and one of the weights on the wizard side keeping that balance is concussion.  If they give you concussion they must do something for us to maintain balance.  This will then throw mages and wizards out of balance with the other classes, which will require adjustments, ad infinitum.  I don't BLAME mages for anything sir.  I happen to adore mages.

Send them Ho's back to the swamp so the frogs can continue to pwn em.  Beat up and kicked out your house by frogs.  lol<br>
<br>
I hate gnomes - 'cause, well no reason really.  They just funny lookin'.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is the game is supposed to be fun.  Lets have some fun with it and leave all that politically correct crapulence at the door.<br>

No anger here, and i understand that many magicians dont want root, slow, or concussion.<br>
<br>
The goal of my post was to make sure this kind of discussion wouldnt go unnoticed, for dev do read boards and things can be decided very quickly.<br>
<br>
If Wizards were to ask for a true form of pets, i dont feel that Magicians should be left out of discussions (not that we could prevent that anyway).<br>

Funny.<br>
<br>
I am one of the Mages who posted saying concussion would not be a good idea.  Slows are not a good idea.  blah, blah, over and over.<br>
<br>
Lots of classes changed completely post-PoP.  Our solo-ability went to hello.  That was a big reason I chose to play a Mage to start with.  So our class got changed, not nerfed, and lots of us want to solo efficently again like we used too.  Lots of Wizards want to mana burn like they used to too.  But I don't see either happening.<br>

They just are annoyed at the same things and compete for the same basic slot in the game.  Both suffer from crappy design by Verant, design that they've never fixed and perhaps couldn't with the way Everquest works.  Each class is primarily focussed on offense with minor utility, and each wants to do that best while pointing to the other things the other class can do.<br>
<br>
Then on top of that you have the game company its self making statements like &quot;wizards are the masters of magical damage&quot; and defending them with absurd stretches of logic: &quot;well, uh, you cast faster... usually... in most levels... well you are more efficient!!!  sort of, well unless you count pets or charm... uh... go away!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mages are cool, I wish more were around, I'm confused why groups don't get how powerful and useful magi are to have around.  They do more damage than Wizards most levels and can sustain it better ALL levels.  Magi make all casters better than they were.  How much more do you want from a class?  Freakin invite one to your group - if you can find one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyphyr>Zyphyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/03 4:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> Having seperate Magician and Wizard classes ranks right up there with Complete Heal and Slow in the colosal design blunders category.

mages do not, and cannot solo the melee mobs in PoS, please get your facts right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
They eat pets in seconds and then the mage: go see how fast they eat tanks, then pets, then speak on this again. Like other classes mages solo the *druid* trees and them alone.<br>
And mage soloing went pear shaped with PoP   :/<br>
<br>
I for one cannot go from &quot;oom to FM in 2 minutes&quot;...Pet cannibalization sucks --useful but dumb, and I took Improved Reclaim Energy way back as an AA skill (before the problem was realized but I didnt mind it on normal solable mobs, not these 5 second pet killers in PoP)...so pet cannib is not very efficient for me.<br>

Obviously he had alot less mana than you would now at 65 and alot higher mana pools and I guess it will be different when comparing 3.5 or 4k to 5k or 6k mana.<br>

Anyways yes you can solo the casting trees in PoS. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A> at: 4/26/03 8:15:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverbladetheenchanter>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1002<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/27/03 1:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> Zuratuli,<br>
<br>
I have IMPROVED RECLAIM energy AA skill, this gives mana back based on cost of the original spell, where as normal reclaim energy gives mana back based on the *current hit points* of the pet. If the pet is full health when reclaim it without the AA skill you get +mana return.<br>
<br>
Improved reclaim gives around 90% of the mana cost of the spell back no matter how few hit points the pet has. So when soloing, I would fight with a pet, and reclaim pet at end and get it's full mana back and some change with AA skill, because I had a SUmmoning efficiency item. Ergo I could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ad infinitum</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> solo shrooms in FG for example.<br>
<br>
However it cuts down the efficiency of &quot;pet cannibalization&quot; by a huge margin, and no pet will last longer than a few seconds against a PoP mob...when I got the skill almost nothing was known of it's ability *sigh*<br>
<br>
I'd need a Summoning Efficiency IV item to get decent mana reclaim back (I still do get a +mana return with AA skill but it's not huge), and there's only *one* item with that focus in game mage useable I know of, and have never seen it drop and only seen for sale once:<br>

1) Pet cannib is also *SILLY*, it makes little sense, and I for one dislike it :/<br>
<br>
2) Even with Suspend Minion 2, I dont like the idea of not having a fully buffed GTG pet up at all times, and I sure would never pet cannib where there's aoe mobs aorund (I have pet hold but if your busy chaining pets thinsg can go pear shaped)<br>
<br>
3) I carry a ton of gear, really need to get Elemental Pact so I wouldn't go through tons of malachite. Rather get Spell Casting Subtlety (3) etc first. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/sb.gif"alt="Silverblades Suitcase"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/27/03 1:56 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages n' wizards are never happy less they've got a war!</span><hr size=1> Gonna try and find the mage who pet cannied all the time in an AE group I was in.

While soloing it seemed to add about 15 mana per tick on average, though it adds less as your mana regen goes up(uptime increases meaning you have less time to canni).  Without Suspend Minion 2 it is not feasible in a normal group.  I'll see if I can dig up the details on the logs though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=895.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=895.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=895.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=895.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=895.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=895.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=895.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
