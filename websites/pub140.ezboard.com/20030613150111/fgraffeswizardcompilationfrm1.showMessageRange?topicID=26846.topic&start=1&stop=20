Is anyone planning on playing one of these other than as a mule? Is anyone actually excited about the fact that in order to get the best loot your probably going to end up having ot haul one of these useless gimps around to loot no drop tradeskill shit so they can make you loot?  In WHAT way is this an improvement over JUST LOOTING THE STUFF YOURSELF!?<br>
<br>
Does anyone else think the idea of turning the click combine tradeskill system into a similuated combat style encounter complete with abilities like &quot;cool metal&quot; is a tad cheesy. Let me rephrase that.  How about a freaking joke on all of us.<br>
<br>
Next lets go on to item wear and repair.  I understand the concept behind item wear but I fail to see exactly how the need to feed your local tradeskill gimp plat to perform a nonsensical service actually adds to my experience.<br>
<br>
Speaking of wear I can see so many ways this could be fubar, heres a short list.<br>
<br>
Certain items shouldn't decay AT ALL, I've seen no mention of exemptions.<br>
<br>
It's presumed that people will grow out of items mostly before they wear out.  What situations in eq1 would this not be true hmmm.<br>
<br>
Situations where items that have some sentimental value (for some anyway somewhat cheesy I know)<br>
<br>
Situations where items that are essentially good for a large range of levels especially when upgrade options are lacking.<br>
<br>
Situations where items which take an extreme time commitment.<br>
<br>
The fact that some people reach a point in the game and don't progress towards uberity and are thus stuck with certain things for a long period of time. <br>
<br>
Situations in which people aren't that concerned about gear and keep similar gear for long periods.<br>
<br>
Situations where people choose to hang out and have fun in eq and not pursue gear upgrades.<br>
<br>
In all of the above have fun recamping gear that decides to poof.<br>
<br>
Lets move on to the single most idiodic portion, the death system.  This just takes the cake.  I guess what happens when you die is that when you croak you have 2 choices.  Hover at your corpse until rezed with no ability to play at all ever again until a rezer is found or destroy a randomly chosen possession for the privlige of playing at all.<br>
<br>
Bet you thought rez dependance was bad in eq1 well you obviously haven't seen anything yet.  Nobody will go anywhere or do anything without a rezer present.  <br>
<br>
Soloing is pretty much out especially in out of the way places.  Ditto with exploration.  I don't know how the hell this would work with pvp and I guess if your rezer dies he'll be all but forced to sac an item and more likely than not do it frequenty in order to be able to get everyone else back in the action. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hibashira>Hibashira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 468<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The blatent stupidity of certain aspects of EQ2</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, contrary to what you think, one of my first toon will be a craftsman (or whatever they call it) class.

Goodness knows the number of times I go LD and come back dead.  Heck it happened 5 times in one night once, each time I was in a zone so far off the beaten track I never saw anyone let alone a rezzer in that zone or in any of the ones around it.  <br>
Oh, and that was with a Bard so LD &gt; Speed.  What a fun night that would have been, I'd have been 5 items down right there.<br>
<br>
Think how fun its going to be for buffing classes on raids now.  No mass buffing, every buff you want to cast you have to maintain.  How fun is that going be.  What did you do on the raid?<br>
Nothing, just read a book, my character was only there to maintain buffs for a group.  I wasn't even allowed to cast.<br>
<br>
I loved how tradeskill classes have ZERO combat abilities.  Just why would you include them in a group then?  So they can loot no drops and sell items made with them for their own profit?  What fun lol.  Welcome to mulesville.  Population, bazaar.<br>
<br>
Raises another interesting point.  Will items have a timer showing how much time they have left?  I don't want that bracelet I just bought to vanish 20 hours of /played later.  Is there any need to add decay to No Drops then?  How much use would a typical staff of the wheel or J-Boots have seen?  Say 50 days /played?  It'd be fun re-questing something like that every 10 levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derangedcreature>Deranged Creature</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The blatent stupidity of certain aspects of EQ2</span><hr size=1> I think they are trying to make the game a bit less item based, I am sure there will be some &quot;Industructable&quot; items that are for the &quot;ubers&quot; that no trade skill person could get.  However i see no problem with losing my new chest guard and it not being a big deal.  The game being more revolved around you knowing what the hell your doing etc.   I can see the uber gear changing alot of that, but really it all depends on how they do it.. no one really wants to farm for a high end item over and over because it keeps breaking or however they plan on doing it...<br>
<br>
It is fairly hard to comment on it because the game isn't even out yet but i am sure once it is out it won't be as bad as your making it seem.  We don't even know what all the trade skill class will be able to do, i seriously doubt that they won't be able to fight at all... Again we will just need to wait and see...

The result of their existance...<br>
<br>
Providing them with something to do would I think be the only reason for repair.  Item wear by itself accomplishes every possible positive effect while repair only provides a means for craftmen to leach off the rest of the population.<br>
<br>
If no drop components for tradeskills are needed then the need to bring a craftman along by neccesity decreases the total effectiveness of the group.<br>
<br>
The focus on tradeskills means that instead of just aquiring items everyone will have to aquire random hordes of components to get the best gear.<br>
<br>
In addition if tradeskills are vital to eq craftsmen will be present even on pvp servers despite the fact that they will most likely be sadly easy prey for everyone else and a major stone around their groups neck in pvp.<br>
<br>
The craftsman class = a leaden weight for the entire game system to bear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cantatus>Cantatus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/face.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The blatent stupidity of certain aspects of EQ2</span><hr size=1> Yeah, as much as I enjoy tradeskills I really don't like the idea of seperating tradeskills into a seperate class.  It basically means you won't get to experience a large part of the game.  I do like how they are changing it into a more combat like system.  As cheesy as it is, it definetly beats the click-combine carpul tunnel curse that is the current tradeskill system.  It's also neat how they are allowing multipe traders to build large structures.  I'd probably start a Trader if I played EQ2, but it definetly wouldn't be my primary.  I'd much rather have a character that can go play in the zones and group with people.<br>
<br>
I completely agree on the death system though.  I like if I die knowing that I have a 3 hour window to get a rez where I can run off and do other things.  If there is no Cleric/Paladin in the zone I can continue to solo until I see one.  It'd get a tad boring having to wait on a rezzer (and I'm betting this ability will be given to more than a couple classes) to come near you.  The problem they have though is they can't let people &quot;eat&quot; deaths or there would be minimal penalty to death.  The way I understand it, when you die you have an exp debt that you have to pay off.  However, it slowly reduces on its own over a period of time.  For example, if you die you get a debt of 100points.  5% of your gained exp will go to pay that off.  However, if you log off and come back 24 hours later your debt will be mostly gone.  <br>
<br>
Item Decay is one of those things that you are probably going to be seeing in more and more MMORPGs over the future.  EQ's economy and the mudflation in it is quite an example to other developers.  No item can ever retain it's original value.  Items removing themselves from the game ensures that there will never come a point where an item becomes near worthless.<br>
<br>
However, they haven't really said too much on how this system is going to work.  It might not be too bad overall. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
&quot;Yes, we have a solid plan for death penalties. Our current system has two options upon character demise. You can: a) Sacrifice an appropriate item (more on this further down) and return to an appropriate bind point with all other items intact and equipped or b) remain in your corpse until another player or event resurrects you.&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;and you stay with your corpse when you die. This means you will never see a situation where the character exists alive within the world and has a corpse within the world. You're one or the other, never both.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or remain in your corpse.  As in you are unable to play the game at all.  You just sit their in permenent fd mode till someone comes to rez you or till you decide to annihilate the item the game has chosen for you whether it be your breastplate or your ear slot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derangedcreature>Deranged Creature</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 5:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The blatent stupidity of certain aspects of EQ2</span><hr size=1> The death aspect seems to just be against the &quot;solo&quot; players, it may suck but hopefully there will be enough people where it won't be a problem, or it won't be as easy to die in this game as it is in EQ1...

<br>
Here is the peoblem they are amking with EQ2.<br>
<br>
They are attempting to capture the casual player, but at the same time are trying to push the hardcore gamer away.<br>
Why do I believe this, lets look:<br>
<br>
1) Non Dropped Items. I can understand the need, but hardcore gamers *WANT* to show off the fact that they have the best gear, the most xp, the best skills, whatever.  &quot;I got this from Fennin Ro&quot; vs. &quot;I had a grand master tailor craft this from Fennin Ro's hair!&quot;  Tradeskill items == Questing. Questing == needless time sink.  Time sink == stupid waste of time.<br>
<br>
2) Item loss. Holy shit Batman, didn't they learn after Veeshan's Peak, or Plane of Fear, or even Plane of Hate?<br>
<br>
3) Anti-mudflation.  Basically this requires all gamers to take the same ammount of time to reach the max level.  Which means if you join the game, and 90% of the players are level 150, and it takes 2 years for a normal gamer to reach level 150, then you still have to work for 2 years.  After which the original players have been playing for 4 years, and likely can get to even higher level.<br>
<br>
4) The only way to Reward Tradeskillers is to allow their items to be better than many other items.<br>
<br>
5) They are appealing to the casual gamers. This is stupid.  EQ should be their hardcore genre, not the casual genre.  What is the purpose of EQ? To raid.  Sure, maybe 10% don't really raid, but why are those people playing the game? Because of their friends, who are more likely to play because they like to raid.<br>
<br>
6) Item wear.  One of my good friends was in an uber guild. He got lots of nice drops, and then burned out on the 'must raid 8 hours per day' mentality, and started a guild that was much lower. Thus he never needed upgrades, and had his items for far longer than their duration.  He is thus being penalized for NOT keeping the same pace, since his items will last for longer than their planned lifespan.<br>
<br>
7) Hyper realism.  Sony is attempting to make the game as &quot;Role-play&quot; as they can make it. Sorry, if I want to Role play in a 'realistic' world, I will bust out some character sheets and my dice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laerielarcanium>laeriel Arcanium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 5:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.directsecurity.com/MJ.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The blatent stupidity of certain aspects of EQ2</span><hr size=1> Your bitching about a game that isnt even beta yet?  If you think they are going to just leave in things that are detrimintal to the profitability, i would say you are in for a shock.<br>
<br>
See its stuff like this that makes justification for a beta phase, since by letting people play it they can see what works and what doesnt, and make changes accordingly.<br>
<br>
Also on the issue of anti mudflation, i cant see the life expectancy of items being short to the point that people will have to replace there uber robe ever 3 months....but i am not sure since they were not clear on that.<br>
<br>
Wait, bitching abouit a game before beta is like saying you will only love a baby when its born if it comes out a certian sex, its just foolish by todays standards.<br>

Now you may think that your there target because you have burnt out of EQ, but your not. They watched the huge fuckup that was DAoC and have realised that people who power through games and then burn out arn't good for suscriber figures, as they create a huge game death when they all quit after beating a years content in 5 weeks. Also your aded cynical and bitch a lot.<br>

EQII is going after people who like online roleplay, im not convinced there are that many and i know that i'm not one of them. (I like the idea, but in practice it stops me killing my mate's god's minions for lewtz, and thats the suck.)<br>

<br>
This totally legislates against the casual player who wants to log in and play for a bit - not spend hours LFG...<br>
<br>
Sony has proved time and time again with EQ1 they are unable to a) balance classes as far as grouping is concerned and b) make grouping faster and easier... The so called solutions they introduce (LFG group) and I predict the XP changes tomorrow (another solo nerf IMHO) will be just as FUBERed as all the rest...<br>
<br>
So you get a problem - the hard core players are put off for the reasons listed in other posters above but while they are trying to attract casuals those casuals will try and quit within weeks urely because of this blinkered (and IMO downright retarded) vision of a grouping only paradigm. By all means make grouping the preferred option (through XP bonusses etc) but make soloing possible. <br>
<br>
I am really pessimistic about EQ2 right now... other than the graphics (which are nothing short of amazing) everything I hear about the game puts me right off...<br>
<br>
Still I'll give it a chance and try it though ..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zurrenal>Zurren AL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 603<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 6:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Has there even been mention of no-drop items? I doubt you'll need to lug a mule around to loot tradekill components.<br>
<br>
I havnt read the EQ2 update yet but, heres my two cents on item wear<br>
<br>
- Item wear, all around is a great idea I think. I'd say the best implementation of it so far is probably in Ultima Online however, this is largly due to (atleast when I last played, the damn game is allways changing), the near-best armour you could use was a Grand Master crafted set, minus rares like deamon armour, vanq, armour of hardening, etc, and for the most part, the &quot;good&quot; armour could be gotten via normal gameplay largly, and it entered the game at such a rate that most players got a piece now and then, and trades people would collect it and have it on their vendors.<br>
<br>
Losing a full set of armour of hardening or whatever the best while a bitch, wasnt earth-shattering like losing a full set of it in EQ, and hell..death in UO wasnt that bad, pretty easy to get all your stuff back, and if it wore out, *shrug* chances are you had a few backup sets allready.<br>
<br>
With that being said, for item-wear to work effectivly, people need to be able to get armour upgrades/backups/etc via &quot;normal&quot; game play (ie: not sit and camp all day). And the baseline armour in which people are balanced for needs to be READILY available. Sure, have great/rare/powerfull items but dont balance it so people NEED those items to be effective.<br>
<br>
Thinking in EQ terms of years ago : balance it so a warrior in crafted armour is &quot;balanced&quot;, not a warrior in full cobolt. Sure, if hes in cobolt he'll be better, but its not needed to be considered effective.<br>
<br>
I am a big fan of item wear, if the speed of items that wear is reasonable, and if the itemization in the game is done in such a way that it is NOT tedious to the player, but enough to get items out of the economy at a reasonable rate. People shouldnt be having to run back to town to repair their armour every 2 or 3 hours of play.<br>
<br>
Ideally, it'd be nice if armour didnt need repaired/etc for lets say, every 20-25 hours of actuall &quot;play&quot; time (so, for avg joe blow who plays 5 hours a day, has to repair about once a week)<br>
<br>
and, shrug, tossing numbers out of my ass, if after like the 5th repair, it can no longer be reparied any more (so, little over a month), though 'normal' game play (ie: not camping), said player should allready have a replacmeet item or two readily available to them so they dont need to go out of their way to camp gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kinanifarslayer>Kinani Farslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 6:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Actually I hope everything they are touting is put in exactly as is. That way the game will be an annoying piece o crap that other mmporg designers look at as full of things not to do ingame P. The key in any future mmporg imo will be to find a way to let people interact and form friendships forged in adventuring togther. When EQ sucked and it often did the friends I have ingame still made it great. Who among us has not shown up and made a significant contribution in helping a friend get epiced or cr from some nasty place etc etc.Riding the edge of what your guild,group or friends were capable of and coming out on top with items in hand were some of the best times in EQ. Farming to gear a guild up for the next step built cohesion and trust in your friends and guildies. <br>
<br>
 Radical changes to any class could throw out months of careful planning and gear selection and are BS. Being treated like mushrooms by assorted VI/Sony folks was inexcusable as well. IE kept in the dark and fed a bunch o shite. Timesinks put in deliberately are something I will not tolerate in the next game. I really don't give a flying F what the developers &quot;vision&quot; is for the game if it becomes a tedious chore to advance IE commiting to 5 plus hours a day to advance I will account cancel asap. <br>
<br>
Just musing but the tradeskill class is just another timesink/cashcow for EQ 2. You will need to have one just to maintain your mains gear. Or Eq 2 will be single character only<br>
and the tradeskill class will have to be a second acount. Either way a considerable amount of time will be spent accumulating resources to feed your tradesman P. You really don't think your going to sell any of that crap do you ? Everyone with a macro is going to have a tradesman P As you slaghter stacks of non xp mobs and fill up bags with components in EQ 2. Perhaps you will get a sense of deja vu.<br>
Shawl quest 1-8 part 2 anyone ? Aid grimel's great great great<br>
granddaughter ?  Enjoy all I can hardly wait for the EQ 2 reviews in the coming year )<br>

Also I've got to agree that it's fairly stupid to get worked up over the appearance of how something is going to be handled in a game that isn't even in beta yet, let alone close to being released.  Give it some time, a lot of really stupid ideas sound cool at the start of game development and get discarded when they meet the reality of play-testing.<br>
<br>
And call me what you will, but I think that cynicism about both EQ and EQ2 are uncalled for, this isn't like the old days where Brad and the Vision were nerfing everything left and right.. the majority of the changes made to EQ in the last year have been positive and have made the game more fun for the average player (not all the changes, but the majority of them).  Give them credit where credit is due, and reserve judgement on the game for after the game is released. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=614716">Thyrbit Firefrog</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seiryueq>SeiryuEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 7:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26846.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Remember that EQ 2 isn't an EQ 2.0.

I highly doubt that they will have no place in a group.  They may have some form of buff to offer, such as huge AC bonuses for 're-inforcing' armor, enhancing weapons, ect.  They may also offer other forms of support, as it would be logical for them to be as good or better at getting through a locked door than a rogue, or perhaps be able to span a gap with a bridge so you can get further into a dungeon.  Perhaps they will be able to manufacture trader only weapons, such as primitive guns?  Who knows, but I very, very seriously doubt they will have 0 use to a group. <p><br>

<br>
I used to play a game Meridian 59.  It was PvP.  When you died, anyone, could loot your corpse clean.  Often there would be a race to a dead corpse, some would loot and hold the items, try to find you and give you back what you lost.  Others, if nobody was around to notice, would just loot you and sell off your gear anonymously.<br>
<br>
Now, if this happend in EQ, people would be screaming.  Imagine dying while soloing in some remote area only to come back and find a naked corpse.<br>
<br>
However, it worked in Meridian because it did not take you long to gear up again.  Losing all your items hurt some but it was not the end of the world either.  More of ones strenght was based on their learned skills and abilities of the character.  <br>
<br>
There were some irreplaceable items in the game that were given out by the &quot;gods&quot; (GMs) for winning special events, these items were very uber.  You didn't see people wearing them out and about thought, they would be banked except for screenshots and special events where the risk of them being lost was nill (like an areana tornement)<br>
