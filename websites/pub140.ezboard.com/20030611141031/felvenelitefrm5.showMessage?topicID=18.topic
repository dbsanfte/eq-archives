<br>
&quot;Hail Elite,<br>
   Although nothing requires that I do this, I feel that it is Tunare's wish for me to record my experiences from tonight.  I think this is to show us the way out of the brambles that obscure the path we seek.  However, I shall stay to the facts and leave the interpretation of divine guidance for someone much wiser than myself.<br>
   This evenings events were started by a question brought about by Farigorn, and this set in motion the events that followed.  On the discussion of should we allow Ogres within our ranks?<br>
   My immediate thoughts went to their god of Rallos Zek, as well as their association with the Dark Elves.  I was immediately against Farigorn's suggestion for these two reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pauses and thinks about this evening's encounter.  Fighting off the urge to sleep by replacing it with his will to finish and see the completion of his self-imposed task, dips his quill and continues writing in the flickering light of the banquet hall.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Farigorn asked me then if I would journey to Kaladim and meet someone.  I sent notice that I would and left from Orc Hill, where I had been watching over the young people who have taken up the fight against the Orcs.<br>
   Upon reaching Kaladim, I waited outside, running into two of my old friends and stopped to visit with them for a bit, waiting for this person to show up.  After a few minutes, I ventured inside the city and this is where my encounter begins.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pauses again, considers scrapping the parchment, wondering if he is even doing this with a purpose, and then decides it would be senseless to stop now.  He continues to write, come what may of it.<br>
<br>
   &quot;As I stepped inside the caverns and walked to the gate where the Priest of Discord can usually be found, and there was the biggest Ogre I have seen.  He saw me and after introductions, we started to talk.  Then I realized we were both speaking Elvish, to my surprise.<br>
   It was then I started to rethink my earlier views.  Much like how a fog will slowly clear with the sunrise, so I found myself all of a sudden very much regretting my earlier thoughts.  I think this is Tunare's way of reminding me that one's race does not always determine someone's character or morals.<br>
   I learned that Stampie hates and despises the Dark Elves, and that most of his friends are Elven and Dwarven, and he has done much to further both of the causes, having killed so many orcs that the guards of Kaladim, Felwithe, and Kelethin will trust them within the walls of their cities.<br>
   It was during our conversation I watched him be the first to offer to guide a young wood elf the way to the warrior guild, so he could turn in the belts the Orcs wear.<br>
   In the course of our conversation, I also asked him what god he worships.  Much to my surprise he responded that he did not accept Rallos Zek or Innoruuk as his god. He said he realized at an early age that there were other gods out there, but in his home his only alternative to those two choices was to declare that he choose neither.  However, he has great respect for Tunare and does believe in her, even if he may not formally admit for fear of the repercussions from his people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pauses again, fighting off the urge to sleep once more, his task almost complete.  Knowing what he wishes to say, picks the words as carefully as if he were selecting an arrow from his quiver.<br>
<br>
   &quot;I believe that Stampie should be allowed to walk amongst our ranks, upon completion of his other requirements, of course.  After all, Eanin has declared himself a follower of Rallos Zek and has turned his back on Tunare, yet he still walks amongst us while we wait for the time when he returns to Tunare.  Stampie wishes to join and further the cause of Tunare, having been denied being able to acknowledge her for fear of his people, but yet acts at every chance to get further her cause.  So if we allow Eanin to come back and yet he follows the enemy of Tunare, yet we do not allow Stampie to walk amongst our ranks for his race, what does that say of us?&quot;<br>
<br>
A passing guard asks the ranger if he would care to stay the night, too tired to do anything else, Kaleran nods and thanks the guard with a tired smile.  Dips his quill once more and finishes.<br>

<br>
I have given long thought to Stampie and his admittance to our Elven Fellowship and Guild Hall.  In meeting Stampie and teaching him Elvish, I have been impressed by his heart and soul and his desire to live among the elves.  His renouncement to Rallos Zek and his warrior trainers has proven that he strongly desires our friendship and guidance.  I therefore passed on to him a token of membership within our guild.  I have spent long hours helping him to learn Elvish and teaching him more of Tunare, a difficult process considering our language differences.  To this end he has taught me Ogre, this may enable me to further Tunare's teachings among his people.<br>
<br>
I realize turning his back on Rallos Zek and accepting Tunare has alienated him from his homeland and his people.  He is no longer welcome to walk the streets of his hometown nor visit his family and friends.  We must strive to be kind to him, we must strive to become his new family.  A pleasent greeting in his native tongue may serve to meet his needs.<br>
<br>
In speaking of Eanin, I have sought the council of Mother Tunare and she has passed on to me that we must continue to help this wayward Paladin.  His imprisonment and escape, which he deems to be the work of Rallos Zek, may actually not be so.  We are to help him return to the enveloping embrace of Tunare.  Shunning him while in this state of turmoil would only send him further into the void he trys to fill by claiming allegience to Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
Take Eanin in stride, be courteous and help him as much as you can.  In the end he will return to the embrace of our Goddess Tunare.<br>
<br>
Slaini, once again dons her helm and gloves.  Sealing the scroll with her personal seal she dispatches via the Antonican Bards for Kelethin and the young ranger.<br>
<br>
Take care and may Tunare watch over thee<br>

Slaini Litebringer<br>
Cleric of Tunare<br>
