Nearly every RL female gamer I've met in EQ is very uncomfortable with the term being tossed around the way it is but don't want to get in the way of the boy's locker room mentality that pervades EQ social circles.  Can't say I blame them.  So please, if you are one of the subhumans who loves tossing around words whose meaning you really have no concept about, give the term 'rape' a rest.  Nothing that happens in a game, not the most poorly executed ubermob raid or most lopsided duel, even comes close to needing a comparison to rape. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 1015<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 9:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> Main Entry: (2) rape<br>

I will admit that I myself have misused the word gay but I try not too.  I now replace it with &quot;dumb&quot; or something like that.  But then again, I don't think society will ever be pure enough to not misuse those words.

Being raped by dictionary that is used to define the word rape...mind...irony...cannot cope...meltdown imminent...<br>
<br>
Generally speaking I agree with you Grindel. The only time I use rape in that sense is with my best (male) friend of 15 years (and only when others are not present), but he and I are both fully aware that we are invoking our darker sides when we do that. Think of it as novocaine for the evil in the world, enough so that we can cope with the bad things when they happen. I don't know if that makes sense, but fuck it.<br>

Rape is often the most extreme form of violence that a person can think of for a single syllable word.  It's offensive-- that is the whole point.  Other bad language is so overused it becomes tame so people need to find something else.  Unless some major culture shock happens, pretty soon rape will get old and people will start comparing hockey victories to Nazis slaughtering Jews in concentration camps, note the SZ intrusions we have occaisionally where they post pictures of naked old women eating their own feces and call their activity a &quot;jihaad.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I mean, consider the word &quot;owned.&quot;  Does the phrase &quot;haha you just got owned!&quot;  bother you at all?  After all, it has serious slavery undertones.  Do you know any actual slaves and how they feel about that? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phaedran>Phaedran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 696<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 12:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> When people use this word casually in the game, I cringe and my stomach turns.

You shouldn't be using words you don't have even the slightest idea of their meaning.

You don't joke,  make commentary askance, or make mundane issues out of acts this horrendous. <br>

This is a very valid question.  Unfortunately, I am pretty sure the only songs by this clown I have heard were the theme song to that movie of his I didn't see and a few bars of &quot;Slim Shady&quot;.<br>
<br>
On a broader note, that kind of music sells in part because it stretches the bounds of what 'mainstream' society considers acceptable.  Angst sells.  15 years or so ago Prince was singing Erotic City and Madonna was juxtaposing Christian symbols and sex.  Before that it was Bob Dillan singing about how everybody must get stoned, and before that it was Elvis thrusting his hips.  Yah I think certain elements in the corporate music industry push things to far to sell, but I state that knowing that my mom probably felt the same way about what I listened to as a kid.

Most people don't even understand that &quot;rape&quot; the word and &quot;rape&quot; the act are two different things.  Granted, I would never use words &quot;rape&quot;, &quot;fucked&quot;, and what-not in real life, infact I'm very careful of what I say IRL.<br>
<br>
When someone says they &quot;raped&quot; something in-game do they mean they took the mob forcefully and against its will, bent it over and committed violent and explicit sexual acts against it?  No... they don't, lol.  If a person or a victim of rape is unable to comprehend that difference and / or is shocked emotionally when they hear that term they need to seek counseling because they seriously and honestly need help dealing with it.<br>
<br>
Phaedran, typing something in a game is different than saying something IRL... you need to realize that.  I'll bet that half the stuff you say in-game you wouldn't say in real life.  Heh, on the same note I bet half the stuff you say in real life when you’re with your friends you wouldn't repeat to your mother. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm waiting for the rant about people saying &quot;owned&quot; because someone's great grandfather was killed by someone who &quot;owned&quot; him as a slave back when slavery was legal!  Or how about when someone says &quot;we murdered that mob&quot; and Soandso breaks down because her 8 y/o sister was brutally murdered a month before?

The strange thing is, though, I can't stand it when someone says, &quot;He looks pimp&quot;.  THAT phrase gets under my skin.  &quot;that's gay&quot; gets under my skin.. and I'm not even bi, certainly not gay.  However, I DO understand that the word rape used in this way is meant to have a deeper meaning than the men in this thread have admitted.  It IS meant to express an utter and violent domination.  The actual action of rape is not about sex, ever.  It's about domination, force, violation, and fear.  I do tend to have a different opinion about someone who uses the term in EQ.  I do not choose to hang around with those people, because they tend to show other behaviors that prove them to be unsavory types along with it.  However, it doesn't cause me the same annoyance and disgust towards that person as &quot;looking pimp&quot; and &quot;that's gay&quot; do in and of itself.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps because I could easily injure a rapist in a severe and radical way (if a man tried to rape me, I would put his eyes out, bite his ear off, whatever form of extreme harm I could manage against him), while I feel that pimps perform a more subtle and ultimately more damaging evil due to the slow degredation of the woman. Instead of a violence that at some point in the near future ends, and which warrants a direct responsive attack like rape, it is a less visible harm.  To react in violence against a man who sells women would land me in jail if he has not provoked me in a direct manner.  Attacking back when raped is not, on the other hand, a jailable offense.  In short, I feel there is recourse against rapists, but not against pimps.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;that's gay&quot; thing, it's just annoying because not only is it bigoted, it's childish and stupid.  I just can't stand childish infantile stupidity. <p>&quot;By unlocking at all risks his human doors, man is caught up into the life of the universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law.&quot;<br>

The problem is the attitude of 'Fuck those around me, I want to use the word the way I want because this is in a game and not rl'.  Well we make a decision on whether to carry our moral compass with us each time we log in, just like we do each time we lace our shoes up and leave the house.  Only the immediate consequences vary, as noted by the mom - rape - slapped face scenario points out.<br>
<br>
Guilds and similar groups can develop a men's locker room mentality.  And it is true, most people who play EQ are males.  But not all, and I'm stating we should be cognizant of that.  'Rape' may seem k3w1 to you, but maybe, just maybe, it does bother other people who play with you?  The fact that others posted opposition to the term in this thread indicates that I am not alone in disliking its use.  Maybe others don't speak up because they don't want to rock the boat?  I know that in my guild I've gotten several 'thank yous' when guildchat got too far out from people who just don't want to cause a stir.  But the fact is, these peoples' fun is infringed upon by your 'freedom' to say whatever you want.<br>
<br>
&quot;But it's a game, it's not real!&quot;  So are things that get modded on this board, it's not a 'real' conversation.  But as limits are necessary here they SHOULD be present in the game.<br>
<br>
At least in the States, slavery has no recent manifestation.  Women are still raped and probably will be as long as people are born.  So 'owned' has no comparison to 'raped', although 'we owned that nigger' would be a more valid comparison.  Would you argue the latter phrase is no different than the former?  One uses charged language that is particularly painful today, the other does not.  But it's OK to mention rape every 4 words in guildchat etc. because, well, nobody knows anyone who has really been raped IRL, right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amris>Amris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> *shrug* It's still annoying.  There are so many other words they could use, but they choose to use that one.  It's annoying to me.  I don't have gay friends. I'm not a gay activist.  I don't feel any need to defend gay people.  I simply find that phrase annoying.  Add to that, it's (for your benefit) potentially bigoted.  Which only makes it more annoying, even if it weren't annoying on its own.  It's meant by the people who say it to be annoying, The fact that they are purposely trying to annoy people does not endear them to me.  That is probably the nutshell of why it annoys me right there.  It's an obvious attempt to gain dislike.  I aim to please... ask me to dislike you, I'm happy to put you on my ignore list.  That's my opinion, whether it's right or wrong (there is no right or wrong about opinions, as they are not facts- but you get the idea). <p>&quot;By unlocking at all risks his human doors, man is caught up into the life of the universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law.&quot;<br>

No, that's not the attitude.  I could care less about using these terms as could just about everyone else who uses them.  The problem is people taking them to literally and bending things out of proportion.  Re-read what I said... \<br>
<br>
Amris, you understand that the term &quot;gay&quot; applied to a homosexual itself is, quite literally, a bigoted term but people still use it to describe a homosexual person (your posts for example)... correct?  The original word was not meant to describe a homosexual person, others turned it into that, and it was an insult when it was first used.  Guess what, so was calling an African American &quot;black.&quot;  The acceptable term 50 years ago was &quot;colored.&quot;  Do you know the looks you would get if you called someone &quot;colored&quot; today?  Lol, you'd probably get beat up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxum>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Pics plz thx :(</span><br>  Posts: 2158<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 2:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nearly every RL female gamer I've met in EQ is very uncomfortable with the term being tossed around the way it is but don't want to get in the way of the boy's locker room mentality that pervades EQ social circles. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Add me to your list Grindel.  It makes me extremely uncomfortable, makes me cross my legs irl, but i have never made a big deal about it since most people justify it in the same way Rombus does above.  It certainly downplays the emotional impact of such an event, which may have actually happened to one of your guildmates who may not wish to be reminded of it every time you raid.  <br>
<br>
There is something very callous about using that term in such an offhand way, i always assumed that men are not bothered by it since to them, rape is a joke, something that will never happen to them unless they get sent to prison.  To me, it is not a joke, it could happen to me, it has happened to some of my friends, and hearing that word tossed around in such a casual manner is scary because it would seem to indicate that the act would be treated in an equally casual manner.  Which is not to say that everyone who uses this term casually is a closet rapist, just explaining the kind of latent worries it awakens in me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7080<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 2:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> Heh, Luxum, like I said... rape the word, not the act.

Fuck those around me, the problem is you being hurt by me using the word, not me for using it.  Which is just another way of saying what I first stated.  Have we all lost the ability to grasp cause and effect?<br>

You could care less about using the term.  You, you you you, it's all about you.  EQ is a social game though, and you have to interact with all the non-yous out there.  But fuck 'em, it's their fault for being uncomfortable with the word.  You you you you are being a jackass every time you say you are raping a mob, whether you deny it or offer lame-ass excuses why you should be able to or not.<br>

Again, not true, read what I'm saying.  Do you even understand the difference between the word and the act?  There's a rather huge difference.  As I said, I know not one person, NOT A SINGLE PERSON, male or female that doesn't take rape, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the act</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seriously.  <br>

Did I say that?  No, I didn't.  I personally don't like the word, I don't use it.  I don't think people should be shocked when they see it used though or even offended if it's used in the tense you're bitching about.  Bitching about... hrm, we could start another thread on that I guess!  We have quite a few females in my guild, I've seen them use the term as well.  You see, people are oversensitive when it comes down to this stuff, and very selectively might I add.  This entire thread is so ironic it's not even funny.  Complaining about people &quot;misusing the term rape&quot; while using other offensive words to do it.  Right then. <br>
<br>
In today's society, in today's world, with today's language you should never be surprised at what you see within reason.  Being offended because someone says they &quot;raped Xegony&quot; is just so eyes shut it's not funny.  It also shows lack of understanding for the word, and lack of thought.  Mind you, I'm not condoning using this word, as I've said I don't care for it.  Thing is, it's not what you seem to think it is, and you should never let a word get you bent out of shape especially in the context it's being used in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pedidustyboots>Pedi Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 733<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 2:39 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> I agree 100% with Luxum. <br>
