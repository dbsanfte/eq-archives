<br>
The bar was like most places in Freeport.  Namely dark, damp, and dirty.  Ikeya sat in a corner, as out of sight as he could make himself.  Being inconspicuous was not an easy task, however.  He was a Koada’Dal, or as the humans called him, a High Elf.  Most humans could not tell one Koada’Dal apart from another; their ignorance was appalling.  About the only thing worse than their ignorance was their greed.  A fine bottle of Elvish wine had cost him a platinum coin.  Despite the bar tender’s claims that the wine was the finest that could be imported, Ikeya had his doubts.  It was bland and stale, offering little taste. Elvish perhaps, but only in name.<br>
<br>
Ikeya had arrived in the town of Freeport two weeks ago by boat.  He stayed only because he had no place to go.  The guards who brought him to Freeport had taken his staff away, limiting his powers.  He could still cast simple spells, spells that had been used for countless centuries.  The more complex spells, however, often needed something to conduct the vast power that was called upon.  That conduit, for most wizards, was a staff of some sort.  He had been stripped of his own foci after his little revolt against the Koada’Dal monarchy.  His kin obviously had not taken well to his transgressions.  Ikeya had replaced his former possession with a simple staff he acquired from the Academy of Arcane Science.  The staff was little beyond a carved stick, really designed for those who were mere infants in arcane study, not for those who had achieved the grand power that only Evokers and Sorcerers could channel.<br>
<br>
His escort had, however, left Jather with his staff; he mused that the guards probably didn’t want to leave their kin completely defenseless, even if they were traitors. That had probably been a mistake. Ikeya’s mind had been mulling over his situation for several days.  So far, he hadn’t discovered any way to take true advantage of that fact.  One of the first ideas that had presented itself was the destruction of Freeport building by building.  But that would prove to be counterproductive in the end probably.  To achieve his desire, he would need help.  And Freeport undoubtedly housed some potentially powerful allies.  However, exactly what he desired continued to elude him.  Vengeance?  Of course he wanted vengeance.  But there was something else.  Something greater. <br>
<br>
A crash jolted Ikeya out of his thoughts.  He looked up lazily.  A table was overturned; coins, candles, and plates were scattered across the floor amongst shards of thick glass that were formerly drinking mugs.  A man in a leather tunic was standing, his outstretched arm pressing the point of a rapier at the throat of another human.  Ikeya grimaced.  His choice in a bar had not been a good one.  He heard a second sword being drawn, and the rapier wielding man had a longblade resting warningly on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Of course, this had not been enough.  The size of the impending scuffle continued to grow.  A man behind the one with the rapier at his throat, whose expression was calmly unreadable, drew a bow and arrow and took aim at the man behind the leather-covered one.  Ikeya watched with idle interest.  He knew humans to be violent, and this group didn’t seem intent on disproving his past experience.  Finally, a fifth human stepped in.  He was of medium height, and strong, by his looks.  He placed his hand lightly on the wrist of the man wielding the rapier.  <br>
<br>
“There is no need for violence,” he said.<br>
<br>
Ikeya lifted his glass, watching the developing situation through the rim of his half-empty mug. (Couldn’t humans even bother with another type of drinking instrument?)  The tension in the air grew palpable.  Ikeya would have laughed, but entertainment this good wasn’t common. He didn’t want to spoil it.  <br>
<br>
“I don’t think you know what you’re getting yourself into, monk,” the rapier wielding man answered.<br>
<br>
“There is another path to settle this dispute, whatever it is.  You must remain tranquil and calm,” the monk answered evenly.<br>
<br>
Ikeya smiled.  If his prediction were correct, that would settle it.  He took a draught from his glass.  He set it back on the table, loudly.  That was the trigger.<br>
<br>
The rogue exploded into action.  He ducked down and to the left, swiping his rapier in a wide arc, forcing the three men around him to scatter.  The first victim backed up, without knowing it, into the bowman.  The man’s shot was loosed wildly.  Ikeya couldn’t tell who he had been aiming for, but the arrow ended up piercing a table on the other end of the room.  The monk’s leap took him over another table.<br>
<br>
The rapier wielding man was engaging in a deadly dance with the second swordsman.  Humans scattered as the dance brought them close to their tables.  The bartender was shouting something, but Ikeya couldn’t hear it over the scattered cheers of the crowd.  The bowman had pushed the original victim off of him and was trying to hold off the monk with his bow.  Ikeya could tell the fighters were talking with each other, but like the bartender’s, their words were drown out by the drunken cheers.<br>
<br>
The fight was progressively making itself towards Ikeya.  Of course, he had no intention of moving.  If they were so eager to fight, they could do it around him.  They didn’t need to drag him into this.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, they did drag him into it.  The swordsman stumbled into his table, falling over it and knocking Ikeya’s wine to the floor.  Ikeya gazed down into the warrior’s eyes.  His own eyes blazed with anger.  “Enjoying yourself?” he asked rhetorically.  The warrior ignored him and rolled off the table, a rapier suddenly stabbing down into where he was.  The rapier removed itself and was thrust towards the warrior.  The swordsman parried, sending the thin blade to the side.  Its new trajectory brought into the space Ikeya was, unfortunately for the wielder, occupying.  The rapier smashed into an invisible magical barrier projected only millimeters from Ikeya’s skin.  A golden ring rippled around the magical barrier.  Ikeya turned his attention to the wielder, the flames in his eyes growing.<br>
<br>
Ikeya gave the leather-covered man a wicked grin.  He pushed his palm out towards the human’s chest, a rift of magically energy racing outwards.  The blast slammed into the human, tossing him back into the air.  His shout of surprise and the crash at the end of his trajectory silenced the cheering crowds and ended the second duel.<br>
<br>
“There is no need for this!” the monk tried again.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s gaze fell upon the human, a sphere of flame forming in his palm.  “Oh, shut up.”  Ikeya hurled the sphere of flame at the monk.  The human screamed as his flesh was burned and he was catapulted into a wall.<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s eyes narrowed onto the human warrior who had spilled his wine.  “You haven’t answered my question, mortal,” Ikeya said, his voice soft and menacing.  The human’s face paled and he began to scramble for the door.  His retreat was cut short.  The wood planks of the floor buckled to reveal tendrils of earth that moved and grabbed onto his feet.  The man yelped in surprise and fell to the floor.  Ikeya casually walked towards the man, ignoring the petrified audience.  He bent over and whispered in the man’s ear, “Next time you try to save a comrade, you’ll know better than to spill my wine.”  Standing up, Ikeya left the bar and walked out into the streets.<br>
<br>
After crossing the dirt path, Ikeya turned back and launched a ball of arcane energy into the tavern.  There was a shout of horror, followed by a low rumbling noise as the crowd began to stampede out of the bar.  They didn’t make it in time.  The ball exploded, sundering several support beams.  The roof caved in, trapping the humans inside.<br>
<br>
“Ah… I haven’t had that much fun for centuries,” Ikeya muttered. He could already see the flames from broken lanterns growing from within the tavern as he began to cast an invisibility spell.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“Ah, lord Vashanti!  An’ lady Leopa!  A pleasure t’ see the two of yeh again.  So, tell me, what can ol’ Eddard get for yeh?” an old and bald man shouted boisterously to the newcomers in his tavern.  Eddard had spent his younger years as a member of the Freeport Militia, and they had taken their toll.  His eyes were sunken deep in their sockets.  His face was grim, though tempered by an easy smile, and he still held himself proudly erect. At the old age of forty-seven, he had retired from armed service and opened a tavern.  It was a respected establishment in the West Freeport district.  Often, members of the Militia who were off duty came in for a drink, giving Eddard plenty of time to talk with comrades old and new.<br>
<br>
“A bottle of your finest, or whatever your horses left in their trough, whichever’s strongest,” Vashanti answered with a smile.  Vashanti, though a wizard, wore the rare and startling Elven Chainmail armor, which was a high prize among the Koada’Dal for its beauty and craftsmanship.  Only a master smith could forge the armor, and while smiths were not a rarity in Faydwer, finding one with the skill needed to craft the armor was.  The fact that Vashanti wore the armor either suggested that he was wealthy, or an extremely skilled craftsman.  Eddard hadn’t managed to discern which, and never cared enough to ask.<br>
<br>
To Vashanti’s side was Leopa, another elf, of the woodland variety.  She wore a collection of druidic items, which in Eddard’s opinion only enhanced her natural beauty.  Eddard was not sure on how the two had met.  Vashanti came in with her one day and the two had shared a bottle of wine.  Their relationship was a unique one.  There was no love between them, as humans knew it, but more a desire for companionship and mutual good company. And, Eddard thought, Vashanti’s imposing armor probably drove away most of the thugs with more wit than sense who might otherwise have set their eyes upon the alluring Feir’dal.<br>
<br>
As Eddard served the two their wine, he could not help but notice the two seemed distracted.  “Yeh mind tellin’ ol’ Eddard what’s the matta’?” he asked, his tone gently inquisitive.<br>
<br>
Vashanti chuckled inwardly at the man’s take on the common tongue.  It seemed as if the older humans became, their more twisted and unusual their language became.  “Ah… Eddard.  To be perfectly honest, there is nothing truly wrong.  A few weeks back was the Tunarian Festival.  Just a bit depressed that my studies kept me from attending,” Vashanti answered.<br>
<br>
From the corner of a room, a figure hidden in shadows snorted.  “Trust me, brother, you should be glad your studies kept you away,” the figure said.<br>
<br>
“And just who might you be?” Leopa questioned, her sharp eyes fixed on the figure in the shadow.<br>
<br>
The figure strode out into the light, revealing a Koada’Dal in a blue robe, two golden spheres attached to it at the chest.  It hung loosely from him, but was short and tight enough not to constantly wrap around his feet and trip him as he walked.  “You may call me Jather,” the elf replied with a nod. It could have been either diffident or simply mocking; Eddard couldn’t really tell.<br>
<br>
“Would you care to tell us why we should be thankful for missing the celebration of Tunare?” Vashanti inquired.<br>
<br>
Jather chuckled.  “Because, brother, the festival was more of a war than a celebration.  A wizard worshipping Solusek Ro attacked King Thex.  The king was saved by the intervention of the Avatar and a gnome, and the wizard was imprisoned.  Enchanters stripped his mind of his spells and mana daily.  A… colleague of the wizard smuggled him a modulation rod and his spell book, allowing him to escape.”<br>
<br>
“I fail to see anything that resembles a war in your story so far,” Leopa said. <br>
<br>
Jather’s eyes flickered toward the druid.  “Impatient, aren’t we?  The two made their way to the castle of Mistmoore and struck a bargain with the Vampire Lord.  Mayong Mistmoore would assault Kelethin, drawing troops from Felwithe.  In exchange, the wizard would deliver King Thex into Mistmoore’s hands.  Of course the wizard had fully intended on killing Thex.”<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Leopa asked, her eyes narrowed.<br>
<br>
“In short, the wizard was foiled and the army of Mistmoore was driven back.  The two elves were exiled from Faydwer for their actions,” Jather answered.<br>
<br>
“And you took part in the fighting?” Vashanti asked.<br>
<br>
“Nay.  I know this because—”<br>
<br>
“Come, Jather.  It is time for us to go,” a figure interrupted from the doorway, his features hidden by the glare of the setting sun at his back.  Jather favored Vashanti and Leopa with a wan smile and miniscule bow before he turned his back on them, walking towards the figure in the doorway.<br>
<br>
“Wait a minute,” Leopa called out, taking a step after Jather.  The figure in the doorway made a gesture with his hand and a pair of chairs shot into the air from a nearby table towards the Feir’dal priest.<br>
<br>
“Leopa!” Vashanti shouted.  Leopa gave a shout of surprise and dropped to the floor.  Vashanti raised a hand, and with a flash of energy, halted the chairs in mid-flight.<br>
<br>
“What was that for?” Leopa shouted, gathering herself up from the floor.<br>
<br>
“Curiosity killed the druid… almost,” the figure in the doorway answered darkly.  His shadowed head turned back towards Jather.  “Are you ready to leave yet, brother?”<br>
<br>
“Now wait a minute,” Vashanti began, his hand gesturing quickly to drop the chairs softly back to the floor,  “You’re not going anywhere until we get an explanation as to why you attacked us.”  Leopa gave her agreement as she stood up.<br>
<br>
Jather turned his head again to face the two new opponents, but the figure in the doorway turned impatiently and headed out into the streets. “Come, Jather.  There is nothing here for us anymore, and we have work to do.”  <br>
<br>
Jather’s gaze lingered on the two for a moment before turning to join his companion outside.<br>
<br>
“Let’s follow them,” Leopa whispered.  “There is something odd about those two.”<br>
<br>
Vashanti merely nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
The two elves maintained a fair distance behind Jather and his companion, taking their steps carefully as to not alert the two of their pursuit.  The streets the two took were old, dirty, and all but deserted.  The walls were falling apart with neglect.  There were ashes from fires and ragged tents that suggested that people lived here.  None of them were present however.  The path taken seemed to be utterly random, with no apparent reason to their turns.<br>
<br>
Vashanti finally noticed that they were nearing the western gates.  Vashanti frowned as he realized this.  There were faster ways to the western gates.  Why were they taking this particular path?  He cursed softly when he realized the answer.  Perhaps these two weren’t just casual wizards from Faydwer.  He tugged on Leopa’s arm and whispered to get her attention.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“You have got to be kidding me,” Ikeya said simply, staring at the open street sewer.  “You want to go through <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?”<br>
<br>
Jather smiled, his gaze still focused on the sewer.  “Of course I don’t,” Jather retorted. “But your little show at that bar has probably got the entire city looking for you.  Would you like to stroll past the militia house, or would you prefer to leave this filthy city in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> piece?”<br>
<br>
Ikeya snorted, stepping hesitantly into the sewer.  The water was an uncomfortable shade of green, the occasional piece of refuse floated past every so often.  Ikeya craned his neck and eyed where the sewer led under the city.  The stone tunnel went straight under a building before spreading out into a seemingly endless number of branches.  “Oh, come now,” he grumbled.  “Would you deny an old elf a moment of fun?” Ikeya’s smug attitude suddenly vanished, yelping in surprise as Jather pushed him into the ooze.<br>
<br>
Ikeya hit the water hard, droplets of the murk spraying all over the place.  “Hah, hah,” Ikeya said, spitting the water out of his mouth.  “Very funny.”  Ikeya stood up, his robe drenched.  Jather merely smiled at him.  Ikeya growled and began trudging through the knee-deep water of the tunnel.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Leopa watched the two robed figures head down the tunnel, making no effort to hide the disgust on her face.  She looked down at the green water, fighting against a suddenly strong impulse to be sick.  How could they willingly walk in that filth?  To her side, Vashanti wore a similar face of disgust.  The idea of discovering exactly what the two were doing suddenly didn’t seem so great.  She turned her head to face Vashanti.  “Erm… maybe we shouldn’t follow?” she suggested hopefully.  “I mean, as you said, they’re avoiding the guards.  Maybe we should go and alert the militia?”<br>
<br>
Vashanti shook his head grimly.  “I wouldn’t trust D’lere’s hired dogs to get anything done.  Freeport isn’t exactly a city of justice.  If the paladins ran this portion of the town, I wouldn’t hesitate.  But the militia…” he sighed, shaking his head.  “No.  We’ve got to do it ourselves.  It’s the only way we’ll find out anything.”<br>
<br>
Leopa grimaced.  The thought of stalking through the sewers of Freeport was not a pleasant one.  Struck by a sudden thought, she turned to Vashanti, trying to hold back a smile of relief.  “I think I’m going to return to Faydwer and see what that wizard was talking about.  I’m interested in what has happened recently, and I don’t trust his story.”<br>
<br>
Vashanti nodded, grinning ruefully. The same thought had struck him at first sight of the sewers, but oh well.  Leopa stepped back and began summoning the forces of nature to her.  “Be careful,” she ordered, her face betraying worry before it vanished into a portal of wind.  Vashanti turned, peered down the tunnel… and snapped his head back as a stream of fire came roaring out at him.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
There were nearly two dozen humans crammed into this section of sewers.  They had appeared from crevices and crannies of the wall and surrounded the two Dal companions.  They claimed they were a guild of some sorts and had “business” with Ikeya.  Jather suspected it had something to do with Ikeya’s leveling of the bar.  He leaned towards the closest human.  “Would you mind telling me exactly what this ‘business’ is about?” he asked.<br>
<br>
The human turned and looked stupidly at Jather for a moment before directing his attention back to the fight, deciding to ignore Jather.  The human fighter shouted another mindless battle cry as he lunged at Ikeya.  Jather’s ears twitched in discomfort.  These common humans were such barbaric creatures; even their northern cousins possessed a sense of primitive nobility.  Even so, Jather never understood exactly how they had all avoided being killed off by wildlife during their infancy as a civilization.  That was, of course, if you could apply the word civilized to humans.  The sewers lit in a brief golden flash as the human fighter’s dagger tried to penetrate Ikeya’s barrier.<br>
<br>
“Alright,” Jather said as the flash faded.  “This has gone on long enough.”  He twirled his staff; runes of fire encompassing him.  The runes began to burn brighter as Jather chanted an incantation, his words echoing with primordial power as he summoned his magic.  The air crackled and burned and the humans retreated back against the sewer walls in a panic.  Without warning, the runes of flame vanished, the air around Jather still sizzling as he stopped twirling the staff.  His arm came down, the butt of his staff slamming into the brick of the sewer floor with a resounding clap.  A sphere of flame exploded outward, expanding in all directions.  Water boiled and evaporated, brick charred, and human flesh was scorched.  The brief cries of the humans could not be heard above the roar of the flames.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Vashanti crept hesitantly down the sewers through the thick haze, fighting off the sickly-sweet smells of ozone… and burned meat.  He dearly hoped that another attack wasn’t coming.  Freeport was dangerous enough without two wizards using magic with reckless abandon.  He grunted as he tripped over something.  His hands reflexively shot forward to break his fall.  “Just great,” Vashanti murmured.  He quickly stopped examining the object which he had tripped over.  His ears twitched as he heard someone cough.  <br>
<br>
“A bit of overkill,” a voice said in between coughs.<br>
<br>
“At least I exercise some constraint,” another voice interjected.  “We’d be seeing daylight overhead right now if you had your own staff, assuming we were still alive at all.”<br>
<br>
Vashanti’s ears twitched in agony and his hands shot up protect them as a loud thunderclap echoed in the closed quarters of the sewers.  The sewer walls began to crack and buckle as arcane energy flooded the tunnel.  There was a second thunderstrike accompanied by a searing light.  Then the darkness of the haze and silence of solitude once again claimed the sewers, and Vashanti was alone.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“Neriak?  Really, Jather, your choice of destination was ill contemplated,” Ikeya muttered, stepping down off the pyramid, his robe dragging along, leaving a wet trail on the stones.  The dense forest blocked out the sun, casting the forest into utter darkness.  A minor inconvenience, only; it was only slightly darker than the forests of Faydwer, and Ikeya had little difficulty adjusting to the lack of light.<br>
<br>
Jather, on the other hand, seemed to be at home.  He quickly passed Ikeya as he ran down the steps.  “It’s not all that bad,” Jather replied.  “The Tier’Dal seem to enjoy culling their ranks by sending the weak out on patrol in the forest.  This forest is infinitely safer for us than Freeport.  Well, after what you did, anyway.”<br>
<br>
Ikeya drew a stiff breath, tired of Jather’s constant reminder of what he had done to the tavern. It could have been worse; he could have set it on fire himself.  He stepped off the pyramid, joining Jather, his eyes scanning the horizon for anything that resembled a landmark.  He hadn’t been to the Nektulos Forest for almost two centuries.  His memory of this menacing wood was lacking.  Indeed, Ikeya had very little reason ever to come to this wretched corner of Norrath.  The affairs of the Tier’Dal didn’t concern him.<br>
<br>
Jather, however, apparently took a keen interest in the forest.  Ikeya suspected that the young elf had spent lots of time in this area.  Exactly what Jather would do in this forest… well, Ikeya wasn’t sure it was in his best interests to know.  However, Jather was gratingly calm in this environment.  More so than he had been since before the… incident at the festival.<br>
<br>
Ikeya was shaken out of his thoughts by a cruel and twisted voice.<br>
<br>
“What have we here? A pair of Dal, <br>
Looking lost amongst the forest wall.”<br>
<br>
Jather turned slowly to scan the forest, looking for the source.  Ikeya joined him, looking for anything that could have spoken the words.  “Who’s there?” Jather asked impatiently.<br>
<br>
“Hidden in shadow, hidden from star,<br>
Lurking and waiting, is I, Mdar.”<br>
<br>
A short figure stepped out from the darkness.  He had pointed ears and the approximate build of a Koada’Dal, only he was shorter.  The defining difference, however, was his skin.  It was a dark blue, that of a Tier’Dal.  A dark elf.  “And tell us, my dark friend, what do you want?” Ikeya questioned.<br>
<br>
“I want what I want and nothing more,<br>
Just your twin heads upon my door.”<br>
<br>
At that, Ikeya could help but throw his head back and laugh.  It echoed off the twisted trees of the forest, filling the entire area.  Struggling to regain control of himself, Ikeya tried to face the Tier’Dal.  A wide smirk filled with contempt danced across his face.  So predictable.  The Tier’Dal’s face became twisted with hatred.  He lashed out with a crude dagger that instantly shattered into so much iron scrap as it impacted Ikeya’s protective barrier.<br>
<br>
“Ah… my poor naïve Tier’Dal.  Surely you can show a bit more sense than that.  Your patron may be the Prince of Hate, but come now!  Control your emotions.  I have questions to ask.  Answer them simply and I shall reward you.  But utter one phrase that so much as flirts with rhyming and I will have your tongue upon my door.  I trust I make myself clear, dark blood?” Ikeya threatened.  The Tier’Dal merely nodded meekly.<br>
<br>
“Excellent,” Ikeya continued his tone noticeably lighter.  “Tell us, who are you and whom do you serve?”<br>
<br>
“I am Mdar of house Kelf, a wizard of the Spurned.  I yield to no deity or god.  My loyalty is to myself, not to the weak fools who infest Neriak.  They truly have no idea of the world.  They cling to their blind hatred – and one day it will be the end of them,” the dark elf replied.<br>
<br>
Jather arched an eyebrow in curiosity.  Now this was most interesting, he thought.  It was not often you found a Tier’Dal who went completely against the foundations of their society.  Most of them would be dead, and the rest shouldn’t be anywhere near Neriak, unless they were very brave… or very foolish.  He chuckled slightly.  Here was a Tier’Dal who was rebelling against his society, just as Ikeya and he had rebelled against the society of the Koada’Dal.  The Dark Elf was in a situation similar enough to Ikeya and his own that, to a casual observer, it might have proven amusing.  His chuckle brought back the spark of hatred in the Teir’dal’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“And what is so funny?” Mdar hissed at him.<br>
<br>
“Nothing.  Nothing at all.  Except that our situations are quite similar, my blue friend,” Jather answered.  “Perhaps if you were to hear our tale, then you might realize that your hatred for us is not only completely unfounded, but also completely foolish.  We know the type of situation you were in.”<br>
<br>
“The tale can wait,” Ikeya interjected.  “As it stands, I want some simple information.  And I’m sure our friend here would be more than willing than to reveal to us the direction to take to reach the Temple of Solusek Ro.”<br>
<br>
“You wish to travel to that worn down temple?” Mdar laughed.  “Don’t be stupid.  Only a handful of fanatics inhabit that place.  It is a waste of time.  Whatever it is you want of them, they will refuse to yield it.”<br>
<br>
Ikeya’s eyes flickered briefly as the thought of scorching the ignorant dark elf to the ground flashed across his mind.  He quickly silenced the urge and forced his face to remain passive.  “Actually, I believe the ‘fanatics’ would be more than willing to give me what I want.  I can be most persuasive.  Regardless, the intentions I have for the temple are not of your concern at the moment.  In the future they might be.  But until that time comes, you would be wise to keep your opinions to yourself.  Now, relinquish the directions I require.”<br>
<br>
Mdar hesitated, but only briefly.  “Travel north.  To the Lavastorm Mountains.  There, you will find a great crater filled with lava.  Along the wall of the crater you will find the entrance to the temple.  But I warn you once more: you will not be well received.”<br>
<br>
Ikeya nodded his thanks.  “Your help is most appreciated.  In time, we shall need your assistance again, I imagine.  I assume you lodge within the Spurned’s guilds.  If that is the case, I shall contact you there.  You will know what to look for.  Come, Jather.  We have much work to do,” Ikeya said with a tone that silenced any attempts to continue the conversation.  He turned, his red robe fluttering in the wind, and made his way into the dense woods, Jather at his side.  Soon, the darkness of the forest clouded them from sight.<br>
<br>
“Mdar!” a voice shouted.  “What are you doing here?”<br>
<br>
Mdar turned to see a guard in steel armor, painted with the colors of the Indigo Brotherhood, with a rock golem at his side.  “Nothing.  Nothing at all,” he muttered, stalking off into the darkness.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Jather’s body racked as a violent cough seized him.  The numerous lava pits that marred the mountains constantly spewed sulfurous fumes into the air, with nature’s usual regard to whatever might be near by.  Jather and Ikeya had already stumbled upon numerous goblin camps and a shadow man outpost, and they had managed to get chased away from a druid monolith after insulting several druids.  Jather was still perplexed exactly what was so important in these forsaken mountains that druids would take such keen interest in the land.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure you know were the temple is?” Jather asked.<br>
<br>
“The mountains are only so big.  We’ll find it eventually,” Ikeya said gruffly.  Jather shot him a nervous glance.  “Yes, of course I know were the temple is.  It’s right over this ridge.”<br>
<br>
With that, Ikeya finished the ascension to the top, Jather following.  When the younger elf joined him, all he could do was look on in awe.  Stretching across the barren landscape was a crater.  But not just another of the small craters that seemed to fill the mountains.  A massive crater, possibly formed from the results of a volcanic eruption.  Thick smoke rose from it, thick enough to choke someone who could go without breath.<br>
<br>
“We go,” Ikeya ordered, pulling out a pair of batwings from beneath his robes and handing one to Jather.<br>
<br>
“Go… across?” Jather asked.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Ikeya answered as his feet left the ground.  “The temple is on the other side.”  Ikeya floated forward off the cliff into the smoke, leaving Jather.<br>
<br>
Jather peered down over the cliff, gazing down into a seemingly infinite expanse of magma, clouded by the haze of sulfurous smoke. Taking a breath, Jather summoned up the courage.  Using the batwing to grant himself levitation, Jather joined Ikeya… knowing that his future would forever be changed by this elf.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
It was impossible.  In this dark and twisted tunnel stood a massive iron door with symbols of the sun burned into it.  It was impossible.  No architect would ever do something so foolish.  To construct an entire temple inside a volcano was the very definition of asinine.  And yet, here he was.  He could not refute what he saw.<br>
<br>
“Welcome… to your new home,” Ikeya said, stepping forward.  The massive iron door shrieked as it ground against the cave to open.  Finally, Jather caught a glimpse of the temple – reaching out to welcome them with arms of fire.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
There were no words in the Elvish tongue to describe the grandeur of the temple.  The crimson red lava pools, the iron doors engraved with the symbol of the sun, the columns of fire opal all reflected the sheer unrivaled glory of Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince.  Throughout the temple, wizards of all races were present.  Some spending their time worshipping and praising the Burning Prince, others doing research, and still others performing experiments with recently discovered materials.  Jather saw the occasional bard and thought he had even spotted a converted Paladin in one of the larger anterooms.<br>
<br>
Ikeya had left him earlier, mumbling something about needing to speak with someone.  Jather had spent his time in the temple so far attempting to familiarize himself with the layout.  It would be a long effort; he was still startled by the occasional imp or fire elemental that floated past with little regard to the world around it.<br>
<br>
Jather found himself jolted out of his awe by a female human cloaked in a red robe.  “I have not seen you here before.  Have you come to pay your respects to the Burning Prince?”<br>
<br>
Jather paused for a moment.  He wasn’t entirely sure as to why Ikeya had brought him here.  His mind began to search for an answer.  Should he lie?  Should he tell her what had happened at Faydwer?  Was it safe to tell her?  “Let’s just say I’m looking for a new home,” Jather answered.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
“Ah… Lord Searfire and Lord Lyfyx, a pleasure it is to see the two again.”<br>
<br>
A short, plump, bearded man looked up at the source of the voice.  His comrade, a tall elf in gleaming silver armor did the same.  “You,” the short man hissed.<br>
<br>
“Come, come!  Is that anyway to speak to an old friend, Searfire?” Ikeya answered.<br>
<br>
“Friend? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Friend</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!?” the other snapped.  “You nearly took us to war with that wretched magician Najena and her followers.  After what you did, you expect to be welcomed here?”<br>
<br>
“Still obsessing over that little incident, Lyfyx?  I angered a little Tier’Dal magician.  Such a tragedy.  It’s a miracle Solusek Ro hasn’t struck you down for your sympathy towards heretics,” Ikeya replied.  “Really, you are blowing that entire incident out of proportion.”<br>
<br>
“Your actions single-handedly inspired Neriak to launch—” Lyfyx began.<br>
<br>
“Regardless of what happened in the past, this is the present,” Ikeya interrupted.  “I am in need of information.  More specifically, information on the current ladder of authority of the temple.”<br>
<br>
“Why?  So you know—” Lyfyx began again.<br>
<br>
“Calm yourself, Lyfyx,” Searfire interrupted stiffly.  “To put it bluntly, times have changed here.  The followers are becoming more devout in their worship of Solusek Ro, and alas, more imprudent.  One of them managed to find an old book on the teachings of Lord Seru.  He was already a zealot, but the book’s ideas seemed to have pushed him a bit too far.  He began preaching about the Burning Prince’s superiority to all.  Promises of glory caused many to listen.  There are few of us left who so much as tolerate the… uncultured.  Indeed, the Temple is becoming more of a military garrison than a religious house,” Searfire explained.<br>
<br>
Ikeya smiled.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Excellent</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought.  “These zealots,” he asked, “who leads them?”<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Ikeya left Searfire and Lyfyx in good spirits.  The human leader of the fanatics had done an excellent job.  He had managed to take a handful of loyal followers and increase the intensity of their faith in Solusek Ro by a hundred fold.  Those followers in turn had sought others, who too rallied under the new leader.  The human had done a most excellent job in crafting a blade.  Now all it needed was a hand to wield it.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
The efreeti levitated over the lava pit, his arms crossed over his chest, his eyes closed.  “So… the prodigy returns,” it said.  His eyes opened, revealing an unending inferno burning within them and gazed into the soul of his guest.  “Are you sure you wish proceed with this?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed I am, Lord Tazgar,” the other replied.<br>
<br>
“So be it.”  The lava in the pit came to life, stretching upwards in a pillar toward the platform the guest was standing upon.  Upon reaching the platform, the pillar of lava parted, revealing a black obsidian tablet with runes etched in it.  “May the Burning Prince guide you,” Tazgar said as the guest reached for the tablet.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Ikeya spent the next five days in the library trying to decipher the runes on the tablet.  He had exhausted Solomon the library keeper’s knowledge within the first day.  Solomon had managed to translate a couple of runes, but that resulted in little gain.  So far his work had born only frustration.  What he had translated made little sense, making references to Mistress of Shadow, men of shadow, and someone named Korasivan Ash`Iar.  Ikeya knew of the Mistress of Shadow, the goddess Luclin, and the shadowed men who had been at war with the Temple of Solusek for countless years.  However, who this Korasivan Ash`Iar, Ikeya had not the slightest idea.<br>
<br>
He had already exhausted most of library’s ancient texts and was becoming close to the text of the current age.  His mind twirled with an endless stream of knowledge, most which his memory instantly discarded.  He had learned several interesting things about the ancient races, but so far nothing mentioned a Korasivan Ash’Iar.  He was like a shadow: there, but only until the light tried to reveal him.  Ikeya knew he existed at one point, the tablet said as much, but he couldn’t catch him.<br>
<br>
“Interesting…” he muttered, finally identifying another string of runes.  “…Shall the burning staff herald the restoration.”  Ikeya mulled over what this could possibly mean.  It couldn’t mean what it literally meant.  A staff set to fire couldn’t restore anything.  But if it was a metaphorical reference, what would be restored by this “burning staff?”  He needed more information.  But the only library that exceeded the resources of those of the Temple of Solusek Ro was that in the ancient draconic city Skyshrine.  Ikeya grimaced.  The dragons of the icy land of Velious did not care much for him.  He would need someone else to find the information for him.<br>
<br>
“Jather!” he shouted, his voicing echoing throughout the temple.  Jather soon appeared in the closest doorway.<br>
<br>
“You bellowed?” he said sardonically.<br>
<br>
“Yes… I need you to find someone for me,” Ikeya said, pulling his lips back in a grin.  “An Erudite, by the name of Eamin Whitefalcon.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aurianne>Aurianne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3750<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dawn of Inferno: The Temple of Solusek Ro</span><hr size=1> I finally had the chance to read this in its entirety.
