PvP is poorly implemented and a lot of the fun and satisfaction actually comes from enforcing server &quot;standards&quot; such as LnS, which are not VI implemented.  Sure shit happens and people break the &quot;rules&quot; but generally speaking they are followed fairly well and though the losing guild is usually pissed as all hell, life goes on and they leave.  <br>
<br>
Suffice it to say, PvP is fun for me and a lot of others, but putting it on the blues where people havent been dealing with it since lvl 6 woudl cause a lot of issues. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=234597">Master Aueadill Winds</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

  <br>
(just to restate, the question is, &quot;Why is becoming PvP-enabled (PoD) on a blue server such a PERMANENT choice - and would there be any problems/abuses if there were a relatively simple way to toggle your PvP status off again?&quot;)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. Go to the priest of discord. You will become a player killer on a blue server, thus you can PVP all you want against other players on a blue server. The SEVER [sic] LACK of Player killers on blue servers SHOWS that the majority of players do NOT want to engage in PVP. - Gemlin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think your conclusion is somewhat unsubstantiated here.  Many people on blue servers enjoy PvP action - but I would wager that it is the PERMANENCE of making the choice to &quot;go Red&quot; on a Blue server deters a lot of people from doing so.<br>
<br>
I personally play mainly on a Zek, and although mass PvP at a high level can get very close to greifing (long-term CCing of an entire guild is the equivalent of cock-blocking on blue servers), casual PvP action is actually quite fun.  And if I'm not mistaken, that is what Nextonex is looking for.  A simple way to temporarily dip into the PvP world without having to change servers or start an entirely new character from scratch on a Zek.  PvPing against friends is half the fun, anyway, and unless you can convince them to make toons on a Zek too, you'll never be able to run around WK or some other non-Arena zone with a dozen friends all duking it out.  (Arena zones are VERY limiting in terms of PvP strategies, and facing multiple opponents makes things a lot more interesting/fun).  <br>
<br>
On a side note: Nextonex, I liked your idea of making people in your group/raid immune to AoEs in PvP.  Would be a nice change on the Zeks, too, although I'm sure mass PvP would turn into Rain city pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just my 2cp.<br>
<br>
Edit  -  although it's not really on-point to Nextonex's question, with respect to Gemlin's concerns about people running in and dotting someone, and letting them take an exp death, or more people training and justifying it with PvP as an excuse:  currently, the majority of people (on Tallon, at least) are pretty good about PKing.  If someone is engaged with a mob, they'll wait until it is dead before attacking.  If accidental exp deaths due to PvP action do occur, most people (guilded, anyway) will arrange for a rez for the victim (90-96%).  <br>
Realistically, griefers are griefers:  changing the PvP system on blue servers won't make non-griefers into griefers.  The people that train you after a PvP change are the same ones that will train you now.  Taking actions like that will ruin their reputation pretty quickly, regardless of whatever lame excuse they try to provide.  Besides, you guys actually see GMs on your servers occasionally, so you have recourse to deal with them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarbonius>Zarbonius</A> at: 3/19/03 2:54:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seaotter42>SeaOtter42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 3:01:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=53>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
PvP on blue servers isnt supposed to have a reward. If any sort of reward system existed for PvP then players who don't want to PvP would miss out on content simply due to not wanting to PvP. This undermines the whole point of having non-PvP servers. If PvP was so popular, the PvP servers would rank a little higher on the population chart. As it is now, the Zeks are comparatively empty. <br>
<br>
If you dont like the existing PvP options on the blue servers, don't use them, but don't expect PvP rewards on a blue server, because it wouldnt be fair to people who have come to expect to experience *all* available game content without having to engage in PvP. <br>

SeaOtter, I could be wrong, but aren't people who don't like PvP already missing out on the content of GM-run PvP events?  GM events can be (arguably) some of the more interesting content in the game.  I'm also not sure how adding an additional dimension (eg. increased roleplay via faction-based PvP) to the game, all of which was completely *optional* (i.e. red players can still only PK other red players) would detract from the enjoyment that non-red players would take from the game.  That's like saying adding more tradeskill items is unfair to people who don't want to tradeskill, no?<br>
<br>
The Zeks are emptier than other servers because PvP is a full-time system there, and not many people are willing to put up with the major pain in the ass that it can be at times (go start a non-twinked rogue on a PvP server, and you'll see what I mean).  But if you could bring only the best aspects of PvP from the Zeks to the blues and leave the negatives behind, why wouldn't you?  Especially if it's all optional? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarroslivinglight>ZarrosLivinglight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 3:34:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.e-cadfael.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/larger/70x100/70_057.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> Here's a twist on PvP that might be fun.<br>
<br>
Give players the ability to join existing factions in-game.  By doing so they become PvP+ to the enemies of said faction, and can PK them in return.  Meaning a shadow knight could join the Coldain faction, and would become PvP+ to anyone allied with the Kael giants as well as being able to PK them.<br>
<br>
This would be turned on by visiting an NPC in the faction's headquarters (Thurgadin in the case of the Coldain) and telling them &quot;I want to join&quot; which would incur +faction for them and -faction for their enemies (on an NPC level).  It could then be turned off by telling them &quot;I wish to quit&quot; which would incur a faction hit for that faction only (their enemies are still mad at you though.)  <br>
<br>
A limitation would be that you could only be a member of one faction at a time.  And they would have limited numbers of enemies.  One could walk up to the Indigo Brotherhood in Neriak and be able to engage in PvP conflict with those who joined the Emerald Warriors, Knights of Truth, and Guardians of the Vale.  Joining the Freeport Militia would make you PvP+ for those allied with the Knights of Truth.<br>

The thing is, EQ's faction system isn't as black and white as that. While I think this could work in some areas of the game, such as Velious, the rest of the game just doesn't support it.<br>
<br>
Imagine if factions were the PvP switch; Being KoS to a faction opened you to attacks from players that are allied with that faction. This could work, and since factions can be changed pretty easily, it would allow players to move from +PvP status to -PvP status with relative ease.<br>
Since all factions between KoS and Ally would be -PvP, it'd allow people to choose their own allys, and even cater to those that don't want to PvP ever.<br>
<br>
Rewards? Think about all the quests you have to be allied with a race in order to complete; There are tons. <br>
So, by becoming a races ally, you'd be able to do those quests and reap their rewards, but you'd be open to PvP while you were allied. Once you've finished the quest, you could drop your faction back to Warmly, and you'd no longer be +PvP.<br>
<br>
The problem is there is a large portion of the games factions which are impossible to raise (like Goblin faction in Kunark, or Ring of Scale faction), and many factions don't have a opposite (Dwarves Vs Frost Giants, Dragons Vs Storm Giants). In order for a system like this to work, it'd require a serious overhaul of how the current faction system works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1163<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 5:36:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=57>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> Before Gem can respond yet another time with his macro, in case anyone is still unsure, pvp is implemented on blue servers.  <br>
<br>
Let me explain what I meant by rewards.  I probably shouldn't have used the phrase risk versus reward, but rather risk and no reward.  If you start a red (pk) player on a blue server, he is doomed to never enjoy content that he cant do without help from players that are non-pk.  Good luck finding a guild and enjoying the high end content if you go red.  <br>
<br>
The permanence of the red player designation causes most players (myself included) to shy away from using it.  Its silly to go red at all, in fact.  I'm with Nek, the 'going red' aspect of pvp could use a tweak on the blue servers.  His suggestion is a good one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1683<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 10:12:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> I agree I would try going PvP red on blue servers if I knew I could almost as easily change it back for a guild raid or if some idiot was being a greifer and camping my corpse I could change it back and go get my corpse without being attacked.<br>
<br>
I like this toggle Idea and I don't see how a griefer could easily abuse it and it would alow for &quot;Casual&quot; PvP and still alow people to do things with guilds and people not interested in PvP.<br>
<br>
Though I don't think there should be a time limit on toggling, just a monetary cost like 1pp per level of the character to change it back.  So if your level 1 and you go PvP you must spend 1pp to change it back.  If your level 65 and go PvP you have to pay 65pp to change it back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gemlin>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/20/03 8:08:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25419.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blue Server PvP Thought for discussion</span><hr size=1> There is a toggable flag.<br>

I don't think a faction based PVP would ever make it to a blue server, there are too many unknowns, and PvE was never designed with that in mind, though it does sound cool, I'd love to be able to spank some DE's killing my evlan brotheren, but in reality, it won't happen.<br>
<br>
That being said, Gemlin, Where would be the harm in turning off the Voulentary PVP tag using a Priest of Discord, after a specified time, at a reasonable cost to the players.<br>
<br>
The more I think about this, the more fun I think it would be.

<br>
With the idea of changing name to red and being able to change it back you get variety and unexpectedness, WITHOUT MOVING TO A PVP SERVER and without hafting to permanatly sacrifice your blue name.<br>
<br>
Now Gemlin, I want to see if you can actualy post anouther post without having the advice to /duel, /guildwar, go to arena or zek server if you want PvP.<br>
<br>
Just throw that advice out the window for now and focus on the question at hand.  Which was, would being able to change from red name to blue name and back and forth on a blue server be a bad thing?<br>
<br>
-Now /dueling people is lame becase you bolth know when its comming and who its comming from, it's to controlled.<br>
<br>
-/guildwar is fun but good luck finding anouther guild of the same strength willing to do this, most arn't.<br>
<br>
-Going to arena is also similar to dueling, controlled environment.<br>
<br>
-Going red on a blue server sucks becase you can't change it back and can never group with your friends again or do things with your guild.<br>
<br>
-Moving to a PvP server sucks becase then you have to deal with Zekies.<br>
<br>
SO is being able to go red named on a blue server and being able to change back to blue named a bad thing and why?<br>

1. If you are a player killer and you kill another player killer, you are allowed to LOOT him.<br>
<br>
- Would it be fair for you to be able to loot an item from him and then change to blue so he couldn't have a shot to get it back?<br>
<br>
- Would it be fair for you to kill every player killer on the server, get items from them, be immune to the Play Nice Policy towards the other player killers then change back when you think they are going to camp your corpse after the carnage you caused?<br>
<br>
- Would it be fair for you to change back to blue, get completely buffed by another blue player(s), then go back to red going Player killing hunting fully buffed with buffs you can't get normally?<br>
<br>
The REASON why you are red and stay red is so that people dont abuse the Player killing. Go play on a zek server (I HAVE) and people who are JERKS get their corpses camped, they get hunted, they just get trashed into complying. If you allowed people to change back on a blue server theres no recourse for people teaching a jerk player killer some manners.<br>

Presto...no training!<br>
<br>
From a RP stance it makes as much sense as not being able to harm other player-characters on a blue server.  I can cast nukes at another PC all day long and if we aren't dueling, guildwarring, on a zek, or in an arena (/wave Gem) I can't hurt them.  This means if I have my dragon-allied toon training on raids into NToV even if I wanted to.  It would be impossible, the NPCs would be immune to my attacks and would laugh-off any means I would have to anger them.<br>
<br>
The only exploit I can think of would be surrounding having your healers on the faction of the forces you're attacking, and using the &quot;no-aggro&quot; rule to avoid having them get eaten or even having to worry about camping them out in a raid wipe.  The solution I contemplate is akin to the &quot;blues can't affect reds&quot; rule and that is once someone aggroes your faction, you are unable to affect them with beneficial spells, although the coding for *that* would be nightmarish I have a feeling.  Even without that, its no worse than having cross-team healers in a PvP teams server be immune to the other side's attacks. <p>--------------<br>

PVP on a blue server will just not work. Fact is the majority of the players on Everquest do not want PVP. They like dueling from time to time, but as far as full time PVP, wont happen. Thats why the population on BLUE servers are so much higher than RED servers.<br>
