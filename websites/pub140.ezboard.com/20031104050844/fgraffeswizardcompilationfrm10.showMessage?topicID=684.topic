<br>
1)  Make Wizard DPS HIGHER than that of a rogue or a monk.  And lets face it, Verant is NOT going to do this.<br>
<br>
2)  Introduce several melee proof mobs in the game.<br>
<br>
3)  Break from the Vision and give Wizards some useful utility spells.  My personal suggestion would be a breeze type spell that can be cast on other people.<br>
<br>
Lets pretend for a second that Verant increases Wizards DPS to be the same as a rogue or a monk.  Guess what, most groups will STILL want the rogue or monk over a wizard.  Why?  Because they can tank, have more hps, have higher AC, can taunt, and you don't have to worry about their mana supply.  Wizards cannot take a hit and will crumple like a piece of paper when high level mobs aggro on them.  So even if they do the same DPS as a monk, who really cares?  I'd still rather have a monk!<br>
<br>
Most groups don't care about evac.  Root and snare are easily obtainable from other classes.  Wizards have nothing to offer a group except damage, which is easily obtained from other classes.<br>
<br>
Now if you give a Wizard a breeze type spell that stacks with enchanter mana buffs, many groups would consider taking a wizard who was lfg, especially if no enchanter was available.<br>
<br>
This would not be unfair.  Enchanters can nuke, just like wizards (though not as good as a wizard).  Why shouldn't wizards be able to cast mana regen, like enchanters (though not as good as an enchanter)?  It fits with our class.  Wizards are totally dependent on mana, after all.<br>
<br>
This would also help the DPS situation.<br>

WGBulter  I believe you have good intentions at heart, so I will respond with my ideas.<br>
<br>
1) I believe has everything to do with time frame.  Wizards have always been and always will be a burst class.  Meaning we do our damage in quick bursts then we are out of the battle for a while.  I do agree with the idea of having our Burst DPS greatly increased to be more on par with Melee.  I have seen posts where ppl estimate Rogue dps at 115.  I have no problem entertaining the idea of Wizards doing 300-350 dps in the first 2 mins of a battle.  as long as the wizard is out of the battle for the next couple of minutes.  I have also seen posts where wizards have stated they have reached 300 dps.  But that was at level 60 with a LARGE number of AA points, and using a very specialized spell (banes).  I would like to see this scaled back and made apporpriate to each level. <br>
<br>
2)  Melee proof mobs would be nice but at this stage in the game very inpracticle.  Because of the way taunt/hate works.  Melees only generate hate when they hit a mob.  Therefore a melee proof mob would be ping ponging around killing all the casters.<br>
<br>
3)  Honestly I don't like the idea of buffing.  I would rather leave that to the shaman, druids and clerics.  I buffing as a bigger headache than TLs, and ports.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 3817<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/24/02 4:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard Balance</span><hr size=1> 1. We'll never be higher than a Rogue or a Monk, nor should we be.  They are doing in the pure melee field what we're supposed to be doing in the pure caster field.  We need to be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> on par</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with them in the short and semi-long run.  Sustained damage is the biggest problems Wizards face.<br>
<br>
2. The only way I can think of to create a melee proof mob is to build a mob that does nothing but cast, is rooted, and is invulnerable to melee attacks.  Personally I think that would be an increddibly boring fight... I know I wouldn't want to participate it in.  The more reasonable solution is a melee resistant mobs, these mobs have been in the game since Kunark and we're seeing them more than ever in Luclin.  These mobs do ATK debuff curses, AE slows, have high AC, etc etc.  These are the mobs that you need your casters (specifically Wizards) on and everytime you go up against these mobs a Wizard will be the top damage dealer for the fight.<br>
<br>
3. We have translocates and ports and that's all we need really.  I personally picked a Wizard because buffing sucks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   People have already posted several times about how much they despise Spell Shield so I doubt buffs (especially ones that would be wanted by anyone who couldn't find an Enchanter) would be welcome.<br>

Well, first of all neither Monks nor Rogues have a taunt ability.  Secondly, a Monk can make a decent tank but Rogues can't tank mobs efficiently unless they are well equipped.  Furthermore when they're not using their backstab ability you'll see a dramatic drop in their DPS.  Our job is to avoid agro and maximize damage, this is why we have concussion.  A Wizard should avoid agro at all turns.<br>

Every casting class in EQ can nuke, so this isn't a very good argument.  We should also get Superior Healing because Clerics can nuke just like Wizards.  And we should get pets because Mages can nuke like Wizards.  See what I mean?  Hehe.  It really doesn't fit our class either... Warriors are dependent on HP, should they have heals?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The best solution IMO would be to give us better sustained damage over time as that really is our biggest problem. <p><br>

That's a plain asinine way to design a class.  Wizards should be terrifying and unparalleled at short term damage, at the cost of mana and aggro.<br>
<br>
At present we do ok at short term damage but the price in mana and aggro is too great most levels.

How much each does over duration. If a Monk can sustain 60 DPS over a ten minute duration, a Wizard (if that's who we're compared with) should do roughly the same DPS.<br>
Now how they do their damage over that ten minutes isn't important, it's that they are equal in tens of damage over the same amount of time.<br>
Obviously, Wizards were designed around burst damage; high ammounts of damage in short amounts of time. So of those 10 minutes, should a wizard have done all of their damage in 3 minutes, and it takes the Monk an additional 7 minutes to do the same damage? <br>
That's what it comes down to. How much time should each class do their damage, and still remain balanced with each other.<br>
<br>
The problem with &quot;melee-resistant&quot; mobs is the same problem as magic resistant mobs. When you use a tool like these, you're leaving alot of classes out of the picture. Casters hate magic immune mobs. They can't do anything but sit there the entire fight.<br>
Melee classes feel the same way about these &quot;melee-resistant&quot; mobs. The thing is, they're still required to do these encounters. If there were no one to tank these mobs, the casters wouldn't be able to do their damage, and those mobs would be hard as hell.<br>
I can totally see both points of view. A melee class isn't going to want to raid a mob on a regular occasion where all they're doing is getting healed while the casters do all the damage. They strive for kill shots, and so do we.<br>

Wizards are about FAST damage, and in a 3 minute period, we could be able to do FAR FAR more damage than ANY other class.  We should be able to do 10 minutes worth of melee damage in 3 minutes, but then be forced to med up.  And really, the way to allow this to happen is to eliminate that damned recovery time that forces us to wait one and a half seconds after casting ANY spell before beginning to cast another.<br>
<br>
<br>
If melees had to wait half a second IN ADDITION to their delay on their weapon for every swing of their weapon, they would be rather upset.  But I don't see wizards getting upset about our ability to burn through our mana bar being intentionally nerfed by design.<br>
<br>
We have cast time, recovery time, recast delay.  Melees get an instant attack with the delay that gets reduced by haste items.  Nothing eliminates the recovery time.  We even have a bug in the game where if we cast our level 1 and 4 spells, we often get a message saying we can't cast yet?  WTF?  If we want to blow all our mana as quickly as we can, why the recovery time that's static and doesn't take any spell data into account?<br>

At present we already DO do about 10 minutes melee damage in 3 minutes or so.  If I emptied my entire mana pool without resists into a monster, it would be a smoking crater to the tune of around 11k damage.  That's a lot of hitting a monster, especially at 20-30 a pop like most melee average.<br>
<br>
The problem is that we can't do that, not in any real part of the game, not against anything that matters.  The trinity of control (aggro, mana use, and time) keeps us from dumping this on each monster, or we really would be overpowered.  But if you look at what we can do now, even with Clarity 2, I can only average about 2-3 blasts per fight, which limits my damage output significantly.  The need to wait for aggro control and the speed monsters die prevents me from nuking much more than that, even assuming my mana was coming back much faster.<br>
<br>
In other words, the things that need to change aren't the raw damage output, its my ability to apply my damage.  It really doesn't have to be much of a change, just a few small nudges in damage numbers.  Damage numbers don't need to change except in a few specific areas and levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 513<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/02 10:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: damage</span><hr size=1> Grim, we obviously can't do this if our damage output over time is that low.<br>

If we cast 2 times per mob, we still end up being out damaged by the melees.  If we dump our mana, the time it takes to get that mana back should allow melees to catch up to us, not outdamage us.  That's the balance problem.<br>
<br>
To look at balance again, let's use Elnerick's for this example.  1890 damage in 7.5 seconds for 525 mana.  Now, how long does it take to regain that 525 mana?  If that time exceeds the ability of melees to do 1890 damage, then they will outdamage us over time.  It's not the delivery time(7.5 seconds), it's deliver time plus recovery time.  <br>
<br>
Since Elnerick's is as rare as the good melee drops off most uber mobs(not the best stuff like in ST), we can see that this is the balance that needs to be struck.  And since it's clear that melees CAN exceed the 1890 damage mark, or even 3780 crit with disciplines, that's why the class needs to be properly balanced.  Focus items MAY do it, but until we know what the top end is on focus effects, we will need to wait and see.<br>

If you make it up to lvl 60 (and beyond that with AA skills) you will see its worth the effort.<br>
<br>
I guess we all agree that the melees are only that good if their equipment is that good. Fast weapons, Haste, additional buffs or effects on weapons etc. With the appropiate classes in the group (on raids you nearly allways have at least one of each class for buffing purposes, so I wont talk about this) they can do their maxed damage. What about Wizards? Nearly the same. With C3 (and in some cases with additional Manasongs) your mana recovers fast... add SCM (less mana per nuke), SCF (crits), add MC and FT Items (which you CAN get in a good guild, even up to FT15 when you give your guild some time to get enough that you can obtain some yourself) you are fine. Add Nukeitems like Robe of Invocation and you are set. All you need now is a good taunter to hold the aggro (the better he taunts including procs of weapons or spells) the earlier you can start nuking (and if you nuke - concussion - nuke - concussion etc) you can do a lot of damage without getting aggro. Now add Bracer-earring, you will do more damage/avoid aggro. Once able to do some more AA-Skills, add the loweraggro skill and the problems with aggro become less again. So you see in the long run (if you make it till here that is) you can do a lot of damage in short time without endless recovery. <br>
<br>
I had a hard time to level up till lvl 60. And to get the AApoints (still working on it and will do for a long time I guess), but I dont hide behind any melee any longer. I am curious as hell what focus items VI will offer, and I will work on getting those with the most effective use for wizards. You can work on your char the same way a melee has to work on his, and you CAN be a VERY good class for groups, even xp groups not doing ae, as long as you are skilled enough to play your wizard. Just stop whining and prove it to your group. Dont overnuke, dont whine or compete with other classes (and bump your whole mana in one mob when its not necessary), use your power and it will work.<br>
