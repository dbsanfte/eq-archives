There's no way to know the intentions of EQ developers (intention is something behind the scenes, and sometimes people act in the straight opposite to their intentions!).<br>
<br>
There is no way to know that something is NOT natural in EQ - nor that something is natural.<br>
<br>
All one can conclude by mere logic is: &quot;works this way&quot; =&gt; &quot;is ok this way&quot;.<br>
<br>
All the other definitions that this thread brought up are: &quot;if I compare the way X to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Y: how a holy trinity group of the same level like level of mob with equipment dropped of same or lower level does it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> AND it is the same major pain&quot; =&gt; &quot;is ok&quot;. And that's the only intention that sometimes shines thru when a SOE CSR *censored* says anything - the game shall be a pain, go and suffer. And honestly, all people who think that definition is sane are by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> definition insane. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The only entity who were in theory able to define which benefits are exploits is Sony. And as they are too stupid to set a defining rule, we can only conclude it backwards by a) people who get warned/banned or b) by patch messages.<br>

(I don't even want to start about the fact that they put &quot;bug&quot; into that definition.

Twink gear doesn't really even come close to what the buffs do for you. Not to mention the buffs are actually easier to come by than a lot of the twink gear and don't prevent you from using the twink gear as well. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It took extra work to put that coding in, and all the clever &quot;well, maybe it's a way to force level 10s to group with level 60s&quot; stuff doesn't really convince anyone. The &quot;we can't decide&quot; stuff is some of the most weak-assed stuff I've heard from the EQ community in a long time.<br>

My answer was to a different question, who it hurts. And it hurts the non-exploiters, just like SEQ hurt them, just like people using safe spots hurt others, and all the rest of the exploits: Cheaters have an unfair advantage in a game that is all about being part of a giant community of players.<br>

If you like KEI on lowbies, just say &quot;fuck it, I know it's bullshit, but until they fix it, you're damn right that I'm taking advantage of it.&quot; The world won't end. But let's not pretend anything else is going on other than people (in droves) taking advantage of another piece of fucked-up Luclin coding, of which we've seen a great deal -- surely I'm not the only person who remembers the horse fix from a few weeks ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tigertailz>tigertailz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 445<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 12:17:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> bah from reading all these posts it appears that the definition of an exploit is anything that makes it easier to level that you had it.....<br>

It does have a level limit if you try to cast the buff on a low level directly.  Heck all buff spells have a level limit when trying to cast them directly on a target.  But many buff spells come in a group cast able form, and there is no coding for not buffing someone in your group based on their level.  <br>
<br>
So the getting low levels buffed with high end buffs that are group based is a workaround from the not being able to cast high end buffs on a low level, and is an exploit.  Heck I can't even cast the level 24 levitate spell on a level 1 character becase it is a target only spell.  If it were group based then I could exploit it.<br>
<br>
I'm in the boat of yes its an exploit but untail they do something about it im going to continue to use it.  Just like with the horse thing and no models that they finaly fixed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1204<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 1:56:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=95>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> I'm still on the fence about the buffing thing.

<br>
I believe SoE is allowing people who want to to have fun - both first generation players who'd NEVER play EQ in the harsh unforgiving slow-as-mollases way it was when we started, and the alts who just want to chill out for a while.<br>
<br>
It doesnt affect high levels except that their skills arent as leet at lvl 50 as they might be (though it's foolish to think that deaths/kei wearing off doesnt happen often *enough* to at least train the player a little in mana management etc. They know how to manage mana by and large they just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dont want to play that way</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->). By the time they are 30+ kei isnt altering gameplay much more than clarity/bardsong does, and a first generation who only wants to play in God mode will find lvl 50+ too hard and boring so is unlikely to ruin your leet hardcore 60+ game anyway.<br>
<br>
It's a whole different world; and SoE is trying to keep happy very hard core and very soft core players here and it's prob one of the decisions Brad left over. I dont know if I agree with it or not; it doesnt affect me so I guess I dont think about it too much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 3749<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/1/03 4:45:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Gains at zero risk: I just made a mistletoe cutting sickle without leaving a combat-safe zone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That's not zero risk.  You risk failing the combine.  Honestly, gains from zero risk are pretty rare.  And as far as tradeskills are concerned, they get nerfed all the time.  The most recent one I remember was the cheese exploit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Harassment is bad or wrong, but how did it enter into a discussion of exploits? I'm not clear on that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Because you gain advantages for yourself by hurting other players.  It has at least the same effect as an exploit, actually worse.  I believe I gave an example:  Intentionally crashing a zone is harassment to the players in the zone.  Someone doing that is exploiting a bug.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In such general terms, you can't expect this to be accepted as a logical definition which does not rely on opinion and individual interpretation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Why not?  I think you are perhaps wanting exploit to be more meaningful than it is.  As I stated in the remainder of that post, there are many different levels of exploit, and players can't be expected to recognize all exploits when they see them.  The definition of exploit must therefore be loose enough to cover everything.<br>
<br>
As you must understand given that list you made, the quality of a situation, either &quot;exploit&quot; or &quot;not an exploit&quot; is boolean.  There are only two possible values.  No matter how you define the word, you won't be able to cover everything.  The range of actual possibilities is just too big.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The major problem is that you defined exploit using equally undefined and judgemental words:<br>
Define what is fair or unfair.<br>
Define what is intended.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Intended is not undefined.  However it is unknowable for certian by players, and it is not necessarily constant from the developers.<br>
<br>
However, just because players can't know for sure what is intended doesn't mean that the term is useless.  One can analyze evidence and hypothesize the developer intent.  In the case of the group buff, one can show a lot of evidence that suggests this is an unintended effect.  One could also show evidence that it provides a large amount of benefit.  Whether this is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>unfair</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a matter of opinion, yes.  Unfortunately, that this game is at all fun in the first place is largely a matter of opinion.  While logic is helpful, Everquest wasn't borne from mathematics, it came from a vision-- an opinion.<br>
<br>
Unfair is a matter of opinion however I think there is enough objectivity in people such that the term is useful.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>CoH is disabled in many zones, therefore using a rogue to drag a corpse to the raid is against what is intended for those zones, and this definition clearly labels that an exploit, but this is contrary to the opinion of verant and most players.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My definition does NOT clearly label this an exploit.  My definition requires analysis in order to conclude developer intent.  You have given one piece of evidence and drawn a conclusion from that piece of evidence.  The problem is that you haven't given very convincing evidence.<br>
<br>
That CoH is disabled does not automatically mean they do not want you to be able to bring late people to a raid.  CoH moves a live player across <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any terrain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and from a certian distance away it immediately clears aggro.  CoH takes 6-12 seconds to cast.  CoH can be used in combat for positioning and aggro-clearing.  CoH may be disabled for those reasons.  If it is, the argument that CoH disabled therefore they don't want you to add players to the raid holds no water.<br>
<br>
Additionally, disabling CoH and not SoS-dragging allows mages and rogues to divide responsibility from raid to raid.<br>
<br>
Now, suppose there is a situation where an event is limited to 3 groups.  CoH is disabled, but you can get past the 3 group limit using a SoS rogue to drag corpses or a necro to summon.  That is most likely an exploit.  The fact that the event seems designed for 3 groups is evidence showing that they do not want people added to cirvumvent this.  The exploit is, then, increasing the number of players for the event.  The fact that CoH is also disabled is only one piece of the evidence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Group buffs were explicitly changed to take hold on low level group members, but some people call it an exploit anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->When was this?  I never remember a time when group buffs would not land on low level players.  But again, this is just one piece of evidence.  We'd need enough for a reasonable conclusion of intent before deciding whether or not it is an exploit.<br>
<br>
now for your scenarios:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a) Killing mobs from safe spots.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Exploit, because of the zero-risk cause.  However, this may or may not be serious.  For example: a magician tries to pull a mob to his pet.  The mob gets stuck.  The mage has to sacrifice pet dps that he was counting on and has to spend more mana killing the mob, leading to more downtime.  Exploit?  Yes.  Serious?  No.  Now, say the mage does away with the pet.  Say this mob is instant respawn.  The mage uses nukes and boots of bladecalling to farm this mob for 3 hours straight.  More serious.  Now lets say the mage figures out how to get 10 mobs trapped where he can hit them with scintillation for AE-group level xp solo.  Fairly serious exploit.<br>
<br>
All three are exploits, but the consequences for each will vary, and the developer priority will be different.  Although in the first case, developer priority might increase because of the inconvenience to the player.  The first scnario is as much a workaround as it is an exploit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>b) Using corpse dragging to simulate CoH where disabled.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Covered above.  Not Enough Information.  This would have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis since corpse dragging can not similate CoH in many circumstances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>c) Using tradeskill containers to transfer nodrop items.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No drop items are not intended to be traded.  That much is fairly obvious.  The ability to trade no drop items gives you an unfair advantage in the economy because it allows you to trade items you aren't supposed to.  This is an exploit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>d) Using summon corpse to hop islands in sky.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This might be an exploit.  Hard to say for sure.  I think there is a lot of evidence both ways.  There are certianly advantages, but necro cothing is nowhere near actual CoH speed or cost effeciency.  Whether it is intended is a complete mystery.  It is obviously not something you'll get banned over.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>e) Casting KEI on low level players.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Exploit because it is unbalancing and I believe the evidence shows that it is unintended.  If you believe that it is intended for lower level players to have access to KEI, then you would not consider it an exploit.  I don't think they want low levels to have KEI, though, and the benefits are significant.  The consequences are somewhat serious but nowhere near banning level seriousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>f) Charming a very powerful mob to kill a named with great loot solo, when a full group or more would be needed for a conventional fight.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Possibly.  For some encounters, they may intend for charm to be that powerful.  For some encounters, maybe not.  This is like the SoS/CoH thing, not enough information.  Killing wuoshi with Rolandal is an exploit(albiet impressive).  Killing a BoT mini <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>g) Splitting pulls by means of feign death.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not originally intended.  However, adjustments were made such that the benefits of feign pulling weren't huge... at least not to the devs.  Also, future content was designed with FD in mind.  FD was also nerfed a bit at higher levels.  The &quot;unbalancing, unfair&quot; portion was removed and the technique became accepted.  Not an exploit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>h) Quad kiting.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is another one that falls into the &quot;not enough information&quot; category.  Sometimes quad kiting potentially allows for extremely fast, easy xp.  If there was a zone with huge, safe, open areas to run around in and an infintie number of xp-level mobs that all ran the same speed and the zone had a huge xp bonus...  then quadding those mobs in that zone would likely be an exploit.  Again not one that I'd expect players to recognize, but it would be an exploit.<br>
<br>
This gets fixed not by nerfing quadding, but nerfing the zones to slow it down to a reasonable level.  Shimmering Rockfiends....<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>i) Using high level equipment on a low level character.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not an exploit unless you are twinking.  If you are twinking it is an exploit.  However there are limits now to prevent the most extreme cases of this, and in my experience the advantages aren't quite as big as people seem to think.  In any case it is a very non-serious exploit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>j) Powerleveling using non-damage abilities to help.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'd argue that unless you were using level-restricted buffs, powerlevelling is an interactive activity and not likely an exploit.  However a case could easily by made that PLing is an exploit and I would probably wind up agreeing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>k) Powerleveling with memory blur.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Most powerlevelling issues would fit into the same category.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>l) Pulling the Dain to the pits under icewell keep.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I don't know enough about how that pull works.  We don't kill Dain in the pit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>m) Using fear where a mob runs away to one spot and stays there.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Exploit, yes.  Serious, depends.  However also note that my definition was of the NOUN exploit.  If you're talking exploit the verb there would be subtle differences.  You'd have to determine player intent.  If he intentionally gets the mob stuck using fear then he is exploiting.  If it happens accidentally, he's not exploiting just dealing with the situation as best he can.  But the situation itself would probably be called an exploit.<br>
