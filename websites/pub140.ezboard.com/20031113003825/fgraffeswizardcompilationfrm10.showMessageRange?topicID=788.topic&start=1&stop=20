In fact, the easier it is for everyone to get around, the better it is for everyone, including Wizards.  That's a benefit to the game and to Wizards constantly harassed by teleport requests.<br>
<br>
However, that all said and agreed with... Wizards have been long described and explained as having at least part of the balance for the class taking place by Teleports.  When Wizards had their power cut in beta testing, the loss of power was compensated partly by teleports added to the class as well as sight spells.<br>
<br>
So what happens now that its a matter of a few minutes to move to nearly any place in the game, with no mana cost?  Have Wizards been considered to be balanced so well that the loss of emphasis on this this specialty is meaningless?  Does Verant believe that fewer port requests makes up for the effect?  This doesn't affect Wizards at high levels exclusively, its any Wizard past level 20 that loses some of their unique validity as a class.<br>
<br>
Is there any plan or intent to look at Wizards and see what the status of the class is at present, if this has had any effect? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garrathmoore>Garrath Moore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 372<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/02 2:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So what happens with us now?</span><hr size=1> I have a question for the people who have been playing for a long time:<br>

Who was the first class with SOW? Druids? Shaman?<br>
Did all of the classes that can cast it now always have it?<br>
If not, did the class that originally had it get something additional when it was given to the other classes?<br>
<br>
That is what I equate our ports to, a useful utility that many classes have access to.  <br>

I made a lot of money porting, I imagine I will still do so.  Just curious what happened in the past. <p>Garrath Moore &lt;BR&gt;<br>

<br>
Wizards have said over and over they don't want to be a buffing class, which basically kills any idea of a spell that would make us more group friendly.<br>
<br>
Wizards have said over and over that they don't want pets, even though every class has a pet (or pseudo pet) at this point.<br>
<br>
I think what we're really lacking as a class is something that nobody else can do, or match in one way or another. Something that doesn't exist in the game at this point. I don't know what it is, but if anybody things of it, they should definately post it on this part of the board. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jarnin Fisheermann</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Wizards have been painted into a one-trick pony corner now.  That trick is nukes and now the wizard nukes are challenged by many other classes for many reasons: DPS, spell availability, aoe.  <br>
<br>
My observations is that wizards are useful in raid scenarios (DPS is important in PoP) but group usefulness is falling even more.  This newest patch only serves to push the LFG wizards trying to solo even further out which saddens me.<br>
<br>
I agree that wizards need some new unique things.   Some things that come to mind are ....<br>
-- Anti-summon spells.   This should not be used in raid scenarios for ping pong reasons but will help wizards tackle some the nasty mobs in a group and solo scenario.<br>
<br>
-- Anti-gate spells.  I don't see gaters as often as I saw them in Luclin. But still has usefulness in raid/group/solo arenas.<br>
<br>
-- Dimensional phasing.   New spell line that would allow a wizard to exist/not exist in the plane (like being partially ported in).  This would allow a wiz to travel accross some nasty zones (cannot attack or be attacked since you are not fully there).  This can be self only since using this on a coth mage would allow content avoidance.<br>
<br>
-- Globe of invulnerablility.   New spell line that would be similar to Divine aura (and bestow divine aura) except you can attack through it.<br>
<br>
-- Dmg focus buff.  New spell line that allows a wizard to increase the damage abilities of themselves and others within the group.    While in this area, the spell haste buff clerics received perhaps should be a wizard spell also.<br>
<br>
-- TL to flagged zone.  Since the relative usefulness of ports has been notably downgraded this will help.  A TL that takes the person that will (without some sort of menu pop-up) allow them to go to any plane in which both the portee/porter have the same flags.  If the wizard does not have the Terris lair flag, he has no knowledge of it hence cannot port the person there.   If the wizard has the Terris lair flag, but the portee does not, it is a no go again.<br>
<br>
This represents some of the ideas I have had in this area.  <br>
<br>
If VI does not provide other abilities to wizards to offset this.  Then wizard spell damage should be increased, recast time decreased, cast time decreased and spell availibility increased dramatically.  When I see mage FoT doing big dmg, pets doing 70-80 DPS not even counting procs, DS and such, I am being excluded from groups now because my short/long term DPS is being outclassed.<br>

For druids, what can you really add that they don't already have? For wizards, what can you add that doesn't just increase our ability to solo (which apparently is something the Vision doesn't want)?<br>
<br>
It's a lose-lose situation. Nothing they give us will satisfy everyone so no matter what they would be in for a new round of bitching. When all is said and done, I don't think I've been affected negatively by the addition of these free teleports. <br>
<br>
I think the only issue is that teleportation was previously considered a balancing point since it was &quot;exclusive&quot; to two different classes. Of course, I seem to recall when Luclin was released some people were up in arms over the Nexus and the &quot;easy&quot; transportation it provided. That's right. The same ports everyone begs you for because they don't want to wait heh. <br>
<br>
I dunno if there is a solution, Grim, but I'm sure both the wizard and druid communities would rejoice were something offered. /shrug.<br>

<br>
First off, Wizards solo with their AE spells, making better DD spells wouldn't put a dent in that.<br>
<br>
Second, Verant just got done overpowering the priest classes with the justification that they should all group, raid, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SOLO</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> at a similar level of ability.  Get that last boldfaced word?  It would be absurd of Verant to pretend they don't want people to solo very well having just made Clerics better at it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: the only reason not to make Wizards more balanced at lower levels is that they don't give a rip.  But making Wizards even less balanced than before is something I have to wonder about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milaru00>Milaru 00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 710<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/31/02 3:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Unique things to help wiz</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Second, Verant just got done overpowering the priest classes with the justification that they should all group, raid, and SOLO at a similar level of ability. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

They usually don't have a &quot;Class balance and Bugs&quot; section of the board.<br>
<br>
Clearly wizards lack something. It has nothing to do with raid abilities or solo abilities. It has everything to do with group abilities. We offer nothing visible to groups. We have no buffs minus a few damage shields. Our primary aspect is that we do damage, and we do that fairly well, but groups most groups don't recognize that as a grouping aspect. They think it's just what we do. Same with a tank; you group with tanks so you don't get hit, or you get hit less. Tanks also add damage, but not as much as the specialized damage classes that are monks and rogues.<br>
Yes, we do damage. We can't tank. We can get you out of trouble! But if you're doing things right, getting out of trouble never comes up. Hell, I now have a bowl in my inventory that can get my group out of trouble! But I only use it once every blue moon.<br>
<br>
I won't argue that we rock as damage dealers because we do. I won't argue that we have the best teleportation skills in the game, because we do. We're great soloers, and a great addition to any raid.<br>
We are lacking in the group benefit portion of the game, and I'd like to see somthing done about it. It doesn't matter if it's a skill, or a spell; allow us to contribute <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>visually</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the groups we want to be in.<br>
<br>
So, the rules are:<br>
<br>
1. No buff spells (no targeted spells that benefit another)<br>
2. No pets for wizards (because wizards don't want pets) <br>
<br>
Now come up with an answer. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A> at: 11/1/02 12:38:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 800<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/1/02 8:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Unique things to help wiz</span><hr size=1> Why don't better rains work?<br>

3) Change the Mana Cost of Rains.<br>
<br>
The damage should match closely necromancer DoT's, but the mana cost should reflect the lack of a lich series of spells. <br>
<br>
DoT's would still be superior since Rains are stationary damage, and have the drawback that they can't be used in combination with mezzed mobs.  <br>

Wizards should be able to put out solo-level, and above, DPH in a group.  Anything else is broken.  Wizards being crippled to using less efficient abilities when teamed up with people is a broken game mechanic.<br>

Shamans are a very effective defensive class.  Notice that shamans solo by soaking up the attackers attacks, and slowly wittling them away?<br>

See, wizard's don't rock as damage dealers.  Monks and Rogues match or outpace them up to L 60.  At L 60, the top end wizards can gain 2x the XP by soloing over even the best groups, because their most efficient spells don't work in groups.<br>
<br>
You end up with wizards with max AA and gear either grouping only inguild for friendship, grouping in a handful of camps for gear, or grouping because they are tired of soloing.<br>
<br>
The wizards who do group are skewed towards the less well equipped/geared/AA'd ones.  Which hurts wizards reputation, which makes good wizards tired of LFG, which. . .<br>

The damage should match closely necromancer DoT's, but the mana cost should reflect the lack of a lich series of spells.<br>

DoT's would still be superior since Rains are stationary damage, and have the drawback that they can't be used in combination with mezzed mobs.<br>

The point of Evac was originally designed to take you to a save spot in the zone, and also to make it so you can't just run back in on a failed fight. This would basically do the same thing except it would drop you in the same spot you were in. Now, just imagine if you're fighting in the room where your group failed. You'd pop back in the same spot, not be able to move or cast, and you'd be indifferent. As soon as the effects wore off, you'd get slaughtered.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Double the efficiency of DD, and watch wizards use them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What do you mean our most efficient nukes don't work in groups? OUr nukes work in all situations, but they don't get us group slots over a monk and rogue. They don't require rest in order to fight while grouped. They require heals to fight. Since there isn't a class in the game that can &quot;heal mana&quot; eventually wizards can't keep up in groups like they can, that's why we're not the first pick for damage dealers in groups.<br>

Again, I don't understand you. Players group in order to get exp faster. They don't solo for items, they group for items, or they raid for items. Solo wizards have very little problem gaining exp for AA or levels, but they do have problems getting that exp faster in groups. Yes, we can actually get more exp by grouping than by quading. But since we rarely quad while grouped, we don't get group invites.<br>
If you had a group of 2 wizards, a tank, a healer and a CC class, the wizards could quad while the melee does their thing, and you'd see exp soar. But nobody invites us becuase we can quad.<br>

Heh, rains wouldn't help me at all. I play on Rallos where using a rain on a stationary target in a group means that I'm killing my tank. Sure, they work ok on blue servers, but the add potential is crazy. They break mobs that are mezzed. They break mobs that are rooted. And the system with the waves is totally fubar'd. Sorry, rains won't be changed at all.<br>

Perhaps I should have added to my rules above:<br>
<br>
1. No Buffs<br>
2. No Pets<br>
3. No changes to our nuking ability<br>
4. No changes to our current AoE spells<br>
5. Our new ability can't allow us to raid better<br>
6. Our new ability can't allow us to solo better<br>
<br>
Now, try to think of something that will get us invited to groups. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A> at: 11/1/02 12:45:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 6251<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/1/02 3:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tboots, minor?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I doubt people would even solo kill creatures if that was true.  However, there is obviously a point of outlandish absurdity nobody would ask for let alone assume was possible wherein boosting DD spells would make Wizards solo better.  In theory, if I jumped hard enough from the right spot on the right day I could reach the moon, but lets discuss the realm of reality.<br>

Shamans solo exceptionally well, group exceptionally well, and raid exceptionally well.  I play one as well as a Wizard... I know of which I speak.  Shamans are perhaps too powerful but God love em I wouldn't ever bring that to Verant's attention.<br>

Grim, they won't make sweeping changes to how our class functions. They won't make sweeping changes to how our spells work. If anything, they'd give us a new ability, or a new line of spells. That's it.<br>
They won't do anything that takes alot of time, or changes us alot from where we are today. Too many people would complain saying they like how wizards are now, and want no changes. The only change wizards might like are beneficial ones which would get us into groups, and I can see SOE possibly doing such changes.<br>
<br>
I've seen what you'd have them do to fix us, and while I think your ideas are great, it's just too much change for a class that's been around since the game started.<br>

I'd call that a sweeping change, certainly more so than a slight tweak to casting time and mana costs, which is all I've called for.  The most radical change I suggested were some utterly non-game balance affecting sight spells, and making AE Rain spells single target with slightly more damage below level 50.
