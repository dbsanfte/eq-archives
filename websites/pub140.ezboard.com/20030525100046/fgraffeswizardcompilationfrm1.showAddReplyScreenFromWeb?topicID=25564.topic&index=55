<br>
I also tend to head towards the 'reasonable man' definition.<br>
<br>
An exploit to me is a unintended aspect of gameplay that a reasonable man would see gives an unfair advantage.<br>
<br>
An exploit that 'breaks the game' is one which reduces the number of strategies for that aspect of the game so much that, ultimately, the exploit is the only worthwhile strategy.<br>
<br>
eg if duping were widespread, there would be no other worthwhile way of making money - indeed other sources would literally be worthless. Nuking from a safe spot or tracking named using SEQ would be less extreme but still serious examples.<br>
<br>
The more unfair the advantage, the more people feel forced to use it, and the more it 'breaks' the game. <br>
Exploits per say are tolerated by SoE; it's only when they approach game breaking that they become serious.<br>
<br>
A complication here is that buffs are *designed* to be an unfair advantage. Someone with a buff is *intended* to have a big advantage over someone without. However it's obvious to me that 3 years ago when Kunark opened, lvl 51+ buffs were not intended to be used on green con players, despite the fact that, objectively, it is a bit arbitrary to have a 49 buff ok on a lvl 1 but a 51 buff not ok on a 33.<br>
<br>
However, many aspects of the game including fd pulling, fear kiting and quad kiting were never intended. Instead of being removed they became 'tolerated exploits' that VI simply chose to make less and less viable as you levelled.<br>
<br>
Whiz, you say that quad kiting got a semi-official endorsement when classes got upgrades to ae snares. You could equally argue that buffing green players was given a semi-official endorsement when SoE added MGB - a full, what, 18 months after the group buff 'exploit' was first created? Not only did they not fix the old Kunark problem, in other words, they made it massively easier and more effective. Now whole zones of newbies could be buffed kei or aego at will. It's hard to believe this aspect went unnoticed especially a year on from luclin now.<br>
<br>
You also argue that quad kiting would be easy to fix simply by making mobs move at a random +/-5% of their snared speed, therefor, again, since no fix has been forthcoming this past 3 years quad kiting is semi-officially endorsed. I'd argue equally that it surely cant be that hard to move the buffing code from checking the target of the spell to checking the recipient. Or an uglier fix would be to allow the group buff to be cast, then simply to check the recipient's buff list once per tick and make any too powerful fade instantly *shrugs*. Again; 3 years of non-fixing is surely as much of an endorsement as quad kiting has ever had, and I assume you have quad kited without qualms.<br>
<br>
So .. why have SoE allowed it to stay with such an agreeably massive effect on low levels? I'd argue that though it was an unintended bug, it had unintended effects that met with new goals that occurred around DAoC (a shift in viewpoint that ultimately caused Brad to leave).<br>
<br>
Certain things were massively complained about about during the first 2 years of EQ's life (during the so called reign of the 'VI vision'). (Not mentioning my views of these complaints) these included:<br>
- overly harsh death penalty &amp; CR, especially for melee who had to run all the way from their town bind point<br>
- forced grouping, esp. indoors for the best loot and xp (though this was first unintentionally changed with the newbie bonus in loio)<br>
- overly slow mana regen<br>
- begging for player ports and binds<br>
- forced spellbook viewing<br>
- buffs not lasting long enough, not enough group buffs, buffs costing too much pp-wise<br>
<br>
Around this time there was also a big reaction to DAoC which promised to be more 'fun' based and eliminate all these alledged frustrating and unnescessary timesinks (again, the complainant's viewpoint not nescessarily my own). SoE feared they would lose a number of their casual minded players, didnt want to give up a single one and so decided to massively broaden their appeal. They wanted to keep their key hard core who they would go on to satisfy with an ever toughening end game, and yet keep happy the 'soft core' who would go on to have almost all gaming frustrations removed.<br>
<br>
- hence the death &amp; CR penalty were largely removed by extra resses, evac's and NPC ports and books (and no CR under 10)<br>
- soloing made increasingly easy for all classes with ever better weapons, armor and potions<br>
- outdoor grouping increasingly made as fast as indoor<br>
- fast mana regen for all (more on this later)<br>
- NPC binding, porting and books<br>
- forced spellbook viewing gone<br>
- buffs doubled or tripled in duration, many more group buffs, one shot raid buffing (MGB), reduced pp cost (eg group virtue half the pp of group aego; force shield, enc rune made componentless etc)<br>
<br>
Lowbies have had a massive boost in regen since kei but so have high levels. Take a look at the difference between a lvl 65 wiz now compared to a lvl 50 wiz pre-kunark (ignoring the manastone nerf):<br>
<br>
+8 - harvest+harvest 2<br>
+8 - druid buff<br>
+8 - flappy<br>
+3 - aa<br>
+10 - improved enc regen<br>
+10 - improved bard regen<br>
+15 - ft (if you're uber)<br>
+20 - horse (if you're outdoors)<br>
+?? - necro &amp; sk boosts<br>
---<br>
80+<br>
<br>
And, you cannot ignore the effect of SCM and MP, because it produces an *effective* mana regen increase of ~15% on top (if it costs less to cast each spell, you regen the mana back quicker so it 'appears' you've had a mana regen increase. With the above level of mana regen SCM3+MP4 produces the same effect as an additional KEI would).<br>
<br>
Now, high level mana increase was largely not done to remove frustrations, it was done much more in the name of balancing melee/caster damage output, and also to balance against casters doubled or tripled manapool.<br>
<br>
I believe it was entirely unintended that kei and aego would affect the low level game as they have - it was a combination of 3 things:<br>
- group buff bug<br>
- 3 hour duration<br>
- serverwide central meeting point (first nexus then pok)<br>
<br>
Lose any of these 3 factors and you'd lose the kei/aego 'effect' on the lower level game.<br>
<br>
But as a final point: SoE doesnt mind the lower level game being imbalanced as long as it is fun for all. In fact fun&gt;all now there, balance only being addressed if it seriously impacts fun. Once you get past 50 they want the game to be increasingly more balanced with much harsher RvR 'old school style' even if it has to come at the expense of fun - eg. allowing classes the 'fun' ability to solo is not in the least a consideration unlike for low levels (though it is still much less harsh than it ever used to be). Hence nearly all the nerfs you see are aimed at balancing the high level game (but occasionally unavoidably nerf the low level game too - eg horses, monk nerf). When was the last purely low level targetted nerf anyone can remember?<br>
<br>
In addition, psychologically people can happily deal with being imbalanced if they know that as they grow levels and gain aa they will become ever more balanced. It's much more frustrating as a gamer to go from a position of being relatively balanced to unbalanced. Hence why the relative importance of fun+balance in the game shift as you grow.<br>
<br>
Stuff us 'hard core' players see as valuable (such as mana management) simply get learnt later than they ever used to (though other stuff like aggro control still has to be learnt). It's a price SoE is prepared to pay to keep their fanbase as broad as it can be and I for one think the balance there pretty good atm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 3/31/03 6:29:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izelin>Izelin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 7:37:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> An exploit is something you didnt realize you did, then VI bans you for it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=absolutemaster>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 8:12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't call me a noob.

<br>
Did I call you a noob? If you believe that SOE intended for newbies to get KEI, then sure go ahead and put yourself in the noob category. They have a level limit on high level buffs for a reason. If SOE intended KEI to be used on low levels, then why would they force you to group with them as the only way to cast on them? You can cast on them due to a bug. Working around a limitation (level limit) by use of this bug is an exploit, it's simple logic. As for the thread, it's in a forum called the Newbie Zone, so a good portion of posters are in fact newbies.<br>

Link to the quest please. If it exists then it is a pretty bad design flaw which needs fixing. Muti-questing IS an exploit. Go ahead and try to get reimbursed on items you handed in as part of a multiquest gone bad. They don't reimburse something they don't approve. You have doubts? Am I making this up? Here's SOE's reimbursement policy in regards to questing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>12. Quests<br>

<br>
Yup sure sounds as if SOE approves of it. They aren't planning to change the issues (they tend to be rather lazy to fixing bugs which require re-coding of game mechanics), but they make sure to point out that they do not support it.<br>

<br>
I have to say that managing my mana and agro was an important lesson for me to learn.  So important that I commonly watch the &quot;2 days to 50&quot; wizards get slaughtered on the march to the arena in Kael.  I've had one wizard accuse me of not casting.  I told him I know when to cast, and when not to cast.  I also know how to effectively use concussion.<br>
<br>
When they argue with me I just tell them, &quot;hey, you've been a wizard all of 48 hours, of course you know much better than a wizard who is played for 3 years.&quot; and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Simply put, if KEI is not intended forplayers under 45, the spell should do a check of everyone in the group, not just the target.  That the spell does not do this, and that it's yet to be patched, tells me that Sony does not care to &quot;fix&quot; this oversight.  If you've ever been working on tradeskills in PoK and seen the same level 7 caster coming back every 5 minutes for KEI because he thinks he can hunt in LOIO with it, then you know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
Now players evidently feel that KEI is not a nice thing that happens now and then, they feel it's a necessity or even a right.  I've seen them get very exercised about it when no one is in PoK or Nexus casting it.  It's not an exploit, just poor design. <p><img src=http://24.26.194.142/sevepic.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1013<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 9:36:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nadiar.com/pics/sigico.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If SOE intended KEI to be used on low levels, then why would they force you to group with them as the only way to cast on them?

Considering that there is no targetable level-limited version of that line of songs? Hard to say, since even though you assume there might be a level limit, it is never seen. I guess you will see if it's intended or not when they fix KEI and the group coding<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Even then, songs work differently then spells. The level 4 cleric will not have the benefits of the song without the bard (well not for long anyways). The level 4 cleric will have all the benifits of KEI without the ench for 2.5 hours+.<br>

<br>
Nadier, the point was to see if Goladus's definition agreed with your opinion on each case.  You forgot to evaluate whether or not each case is an exploit according to the definition and why.<br>

The clever response would be to add some new cases that illustrate close calls and show strengths or weaknesses of the definition.<br>

From the Customer Service FAQ, (which I discovered while reading up on how to email a Server GM to get back my bridle lost in an LD corpse looting fiasco):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Q. I think someone on my server is exploiting a quest.  He has pulled the two NPCs close together so he can get the quest item and turn it in very quickly. Is this ok for him to do or should I report him?<br>
<br>
A. This is indeed an exploit.  Please report this with a petition as soon as you notice.  Be sure to include the name of the player involved, the name of the NPCs, the zone that player was in, and what the person was doing at the time.<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now, this seems to refer directly to this quest: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=141">everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=141</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Problem is that this is a pretty old quest.  Erudin's been around for awhile, and I challenge you guys to find a site that lists this quest and doesn't specifically mention hauling Slansin up to Toresian.  Most people that have used this quest have at least considered doing this.  It's also easy to do, since nothing in the Tower of Erudin assists Slansin if you pull him and root him up there.  There is also some risk involved depending on your level, since Slansin's lvl 10, if you tried this at the first level you got root, he'd probably drop you before you managed to get up the stairs.  While I might understand the issue if this was on a different quest, my question is, 'Who does this hurt?'<br>
<br>
The only major advantage you get out of this exploit is that you don't have to run up and down 3 flights of stairs anymore.  Anyone else trying the quest isn't hurt by having the NPCs this close, since they still can complete the quest.  The exp gain is also pretty marginal.  Unless you've got a major running fetish, I don't see the harm.  Yes, Slansin has been moved out of his location, but he's only there for one quest, and he's now right next to the NPC that starts the quest.  Is there some kind of problem with people getting lost five feet from where they started?<br>
<br>
If SOE wanted to fix this one, they'd have had ample time to do so, all they'd really need to do is make Toresian assist Slansin.  Changing one NPC would have the effect of rendering this quest exploit a deathtrap, as everything else in that room would auto assist Toresian, and that many lvl 60 casters would burn you down pretty fast.  I have personally used this exploit before, though I've since started doing it the long way after reading the FAQ.<br>
<br>
That may have been a bad example, but I think it illustrates a major point I have on what is and is not an exploit, HARM.  If you can prove to me that something is damaging to other players, then I can see the point about banning it.  <br>
<br>
I've schooled a lot of tanks who think quadding is an exploit by letting them watch what happens when I actually do it.  All it usually takes is one good snare resist, or getting stunned by moving just a little too close to my mobs for them to see the actual risk we take soloing this way.  When they see the work I actually have to put into first planning it out and then doing it, they generally change their opinions of the tactic.  <br>
<br>
One of the major problems with any kind of list like this one is that even this late into the game, we still have no clear concise definition of what we should and should not be able to do.  Look at the class descriptions for example, they give only the most bare boned information on what each class is capable of.  We started out 'masters of DD', then 'masters of arcane teleportation'.  I expect to be 'master of Cabilis's sewage system' by sometime next year.  They're inconsistent over time, and they don't really give you much info beyond the RP aspect and a very general overview.  If someone came out and wrote up: &quot;a wizard's job in a group is to do X, to assist in doing Y, and to pull off Z when all else fails&quot;, that would probably help with some of the problems we see in the game now.  Also, how is a group supposed to work according to: &quot;The Vision&quot;?  I've never seen &quot;The Vision&quot;, and I'm of the opinion that keeping this secret from us, even long after they've supposedly dumped it in favor of &quot;fun&quot;, is a mistake.  <br>
<br>
If I can't see how I'm supposed to be playing, how do I know if I'm doing anything wrong?<br>
<br>
That line probably seems stupid, but think about it for a second.  If someone had done all the up-front work on writing out exactly how they expected the game to work, and what each class's role was, would we have as many problems today defining what exploits are, and have to continually ban or warn players about them?  Yes, that style is more than a little limiting, and penalizes players for 'thinking outside the box', but is it really realistic to send people into a world with a pat on the back and a few toys to play with, then punish them for using those toys later because they don't conform to our unwritten rules?  While I don't personally advocate using any form of exploit, the enforcement policy does seem overly arbitrary at this point.  If you're going to punish me, at least spell out for me what is and is not legal before the feds start knocking down my door.<br>

He has about 30 Hitpoints, hits for 1 damage 99% of the time, Burst of Flames (not often) for 4 damage <br>
But, I couldn't do much more than 1 damage to him 90% of the time, and did maybe 3 and 6 the other 2 times I did do more than 1 damage. In other words, VERY easy fight. <br>

(Note: The frost covered hopling can be summoned any time by saying &quot;Lumanes&quot; in that spot! It's basically a newbie Monster Generator!

The question I'd have for anyone exploiting this is, 'Why'?

The fact that level-based checks were implemented poorly doesn't mean they have to be implemented poorly, of course. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A> at: 3/31/03 8:31:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=merkusstormcrow>Merkus Stormcrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 7:47:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> Is an unintended feature an exploit if Sony is aware of it but does not enforce any punishment for a player using it? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=merkusstormcrow>Merkus Stormcrow</A> at: 3/31/03 7:47:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2500<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 8:02:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> &gt;The fact that level-based checks were implemented poorly doesn't mean they have to be implemented poorly, of course. <br>

If they had done it the right way and either had the recipient check to see if it should take effect or had the effects scale based on the recipients, it would have been better. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Zulatuli, ALL 50+ spells are level restricted.<br>
<br>
Read that twice.<br>
<br>
Bard songs will say they are restricted too if the target is too low. <br>
They ONLY work if you don't have the person targetted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=c0ren>C0REN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 8:07:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> Honestly, there is no possible sane definiton as the core rule is ridiculous:<br>

There's no way to know the intentions of EQ developers (intention is something behind the scenes, and sometimes people act in the straight opposite to their intentions!).<br>
<br>
There is no way to know that something is NOT natural in EQ - nor that something is natural.<br>
<br>
All one can conclude by mere logic is: &quot;works this way&quot; =&gt; &quot;is ok this way&quot;.<br>
<br>
All the other definitions that this thread brought up are: &quot;if I compare the way X to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Y: how a holy trinity group of the same level like level of mob with equipment dropped of same or lower level does it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> AND it is the same major pain&quot; =&gt; &quot;is ok&quot;. And that's the only intention that sometimes shines thru when a SOE CSR *censored* says anything - the game shall be a pain, go and suffer. And honestly, all people who think that definition is sane are by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> definition insane. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only entity who were in theory able to define which benefits are exploits is Sony. And as they are too stupid to set a defining rule, we can only conclude it backwards by a) people who get warned/banned or b) by patch messages.<br>

<br>
(I don't even want to start about the fact that they put &quot;bug&quot; into that definition. I'm a programmer and all possible definitions of bugs I could think of are in clear contradiction to &quot;benefits&quot;. A bug is typically something which stops a program function from working at all, destabilizes or plain crashes a program. Anything else will be sold from the first suit noticing it right from the most recent compile as feature.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1201<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 8:10:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=83>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> Personally I can't believe all the fuss over being able to cast a level 50 plus spell on anybody.
