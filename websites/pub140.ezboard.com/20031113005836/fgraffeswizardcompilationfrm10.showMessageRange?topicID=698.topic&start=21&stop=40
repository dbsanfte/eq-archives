<br>
As far as nukes are concerned, downtime is factored in just about equally for a wizard as for a magician.  Actually, a wizard might find himself able to meditate more, as a magician will often need to stand up to control his pet or avoid aggro.<br>
<br>
As far as the pet is concerned, he averages 5.8 damage for every second that there is a mob there to hit.  Sometimes it's a lot more, somtiems it's a lot less.  The pet hits for as hard as 28 damage per hit, but sometimes he misses completely.<br>
<br>
The point of this is to show how little damage the pet is actually doing during this time when the wizard is supposedly useless.  In many cases, a wizard sitting down has already outdamaged the magician and the pet is playing catch up.<br>
<br>
In higher uptime groups, it's true that a magician and pet will deal more damage than a wizard.  This is how it's supposed to be, it is a natural relationship between melee damage and mana based damage.  However, the point at which a magician starts to outdamage a wizard(amount of uptime) is not fixed, and in many people's opinion that number is too low.<br>
<br>
Don't overestimate the power of a pet relative to your nukes unless you just don't want to get groups<br>

At this level so are there lots of outdoor zones to group in. OT being the prime example of a large place with almost limitless new pulls. And groups at this level can easily handle yellow and reds, so they will last a few seconds at least. Its mostly up to what the group can handle. What are the normal uptime in your groups? At what point do you want to be balanced against pure melees?<br>
<br>
Danak, your prime defensive spells comes in earth, water, air and fire flavours. And you also got the main caster rescue spell, gate.<br>
<br>
Back to Goladus. Yes, at some point wizards should be equal, but at that level this point doesnt excist. Unless you count less then 3 mins fighting each hour a normal xpgroup. Mana efficiency isnt realy a factor then either. With 25% lower mana cost for wizard nukes so would that point be 20mins fighting each hour.<br>
<br>
I didnt include damage shield either when I did my comparison, mostly because its not easy to do. At this level its quite possible for a magician without pet to outdamage a wizard with nukes and damage shield. I know that your pet numbers may not be true, but I am mostly talking about how things should be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1588<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/02 12:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> I would say that it's almost certian that a magician will outdamage a wizard hehe, and yeah a wizard's long term damage output should probably be closer to a magicians.<br>
<br>
My objection is to the people who try to say that magicians are wizards with pets that fight while they med, which is really not the case. <br>
<br>
Still, the 30s are basically just as much Limboland for Magicians as it is for Wizards.<br>
<br>
After offense and defense, the additional magician abilities during this time are Sword of Runes, Staff of Symbols, Summon Coldstone, Dimensional Hole, and expedience.<br>
<br>
During this time, the wizard non combat abilities are the first two rounds of group gates, Iceclad, and Great Divide self gates, oh, and magnify <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to make the argument that non-combat abilities should have an impact on damage output but....   over these levels wizards get far more useful spells.  If you want to count the utility spells 20-24, then you'll have:<br>
<br>
Mage:  Waterstone, Summon Arrows, Summon 20foodwater, Spear of Warding, Staff of Runes.<br>
Wizard:  Six or so self gates and Levitate.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but in my experience many players that have a teleporter as a main character don't really appreciate how valuable the ability really is and how much time it saves.  They park their self suffecient twinks in a levelling zone and leave them there, never experiencing what it's really like to want to meet your friend in Guk when you're in The Overthere and have no port. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/02 1:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> Ah, Goladus, you actualy forgot the new summoned focus items.

I think verant actualy made a big mistake giving Magicians instead of wizards good damage shields. Wizards would have been alot more group friendly with damage shields as an efficient way of dealing damage. And, even more important, without damage shields so could mage pets have been made alot stronger while leaving a mage equaly good at solo. And it would have made mages alot better later for raids and groups if the pets could have had bigger punch and more hps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1593<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/02 4:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> No I haven't forgotten them, I've deliberately left them out because the original game was not designed with focus items in mind, they are part of a balancing process which is not finished yet.  When it's done, we can reevaluate the situation.  The Cinder Bolt vs. Ice Shock debate was going on long before focus items were put into the game, and my argument was meant to justify the original game designers decisions, not to validate the current state of the game.<br>

<br>
At low levels magician nukes are really only slightly less effecient than wizard nukes.  They are very close, and over a significant period of time, a nuking magician will not be that far behind a nuking wizard.  The pet then adds a fairly significant amount of damage on top.<br>
<br>
What Znail is saying, and I mostly agree with, is that the real solution that wizards need is a decrease in the mana cost of the spell.  The max damage number isn't really that important.<br>
<br>
I said a bunch of stuff about utility comparisons only as an aside really, that's not supposed to be part of the main discussion.  Some people (Like Rombus <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , seem to have this funny notion that magicians aren't supposed to be better damage dealers than wizards, and I just like taking an opportunity to tweak his nose)<br>
<br>
At high levels, it's no contest.  Wizards outnuke mages by a large margin in every way you can think of (ok scars of sigil with a 2 second cast time, I'll trade that one for any post 50 wizard nuke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I think that pretty well covers lower levels.  <br>
<br>
Average difference in time: .47<br>
Biggest time difference: .85 (the level in question)<br>
<br>
How long do you suppose your pet and damage shields will take to fill that gap?  Yeah, one hit, maybe two if its a bad one.  Mages outdamage Wizards in very, very short order.  The only time a Wizard really is going to be able to outdamage a Mage at these levels is at level 1 (no pet) or by casting a single spell that kills the monster before the mage's pet can engage.  Using the staff of temperate flux, the Wizard could probably chaincast a faster blast and get the kill if the pet wasn't hitting very well or was casting a lot - especially nondamaging spells.<br>
<br>
I hope that makes things a little more clear.  There was no good reason for having the damage set up in this way, I am still convinced it was done because of a lack of context.  They adjusted the numbers without comparing them for Wizard and Magician.<br>
<br>
Note: edited average cast time, not sure what mathematical oddity I managed to generate before. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 4/9/02 7:49:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 320<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 8:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the facts for Goladus</span><hr size=1> Mages should get long duration lower damage damage shields,<br>

Oh and dont use the anti-summoned spells, Grimstaff , as a comparison, they are odd anyway, faster casting than normal, somewhat harder to resist a think, but not a normal nuke at all. Very few places to use them :&lt; Kind of like debating average wiz damage, using banes in the process.<br>

<br>
mages should do more damage than wizards over time and by a good bit, but whats wrong is wizzys dont get far more mana efficient nukes, so currnelty it is  probably balanced too much to wards mages, I think wizzies need about a 20% improvement in mana/damage/cast time across the board.<br>
mages need +1-4 levels on 50+ pets, and +1-8 hp damage on their melee post 50,a nd a nuke that hits armour class or dodge skill. (sorry fed the HELL up with resists, whats' so damn wrong with the idea of conjuring up an object, a bolt, a meteor, hell an avil :&gt; and dropping it on a mob?)<br>
<br>
As another point, masters of DD, so why don't wizard's get &quot;anti-resist skills&quot;?, say -5 resists per 10 levels?<br>
mage antisummoned spells should either be lures, un-resistable or MUCH better efficiency. Currently they are so so.<br>
I use them in the Hole because I am sick to death, at lvl 60, of seeing resists from light/low blues on fire and magic nukes *sigh*<br>

<br>
I left them entirely out of the comparison, the numbers do not take them into account in any way.  The only reason I listed them was so that people wouldn't say &quot;d00d they do too get a blast, they get an anti summoned one!!!! they rox0r!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Basically the anti-summon spells probably seemed like a good idea at the time but are so rarely useful (and Mages get them so late) that they are just an oddity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 1603<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 10:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> Sorry, I was unclear.

Also, I'm not a little confused about how you came up with .12 as your average, it looks to me as if you counted the levels where magicians got no nuke at all as a difference of 0.  Which leads me back to the level one shock comparison.<br>

<br>
I think what it boils down to, is that wizards had, pre focus items anyway, some issues with long term damage in experience groups.  I think the problem in long term damage isn't as big as people try to make it sound, however, and problems in short term damage are certianly not significant relative to magicians, who are also &quot;fast burn&quot; damage specialsts just as wizards are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/9/02 6:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: anti summons</span><hr size=1> Grim,<br>

About how much damage a wizard do or dont I realy suggest that you take a look at Armok's tables. Its even more interesting for a mage as they can be changed to work for a mage with some work. All that is needed realy is some pet dps for diffrent levels. Damage shield might complicate things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 5092<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/9/02 9:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> odd yeah</span><hr size=1> &quot;Sorry, I was unclear.

<br>
The casting times are so close together that it will take about 4-5 casts before the Wizard can get ONE more spell off than the Mage.  If the Wizard has the SOTF it will take 2-3 of them.  The edge in speed, quite honestly, is absolutely not a major issue, except at level 34.  And its still less than 1 second difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also, I'm not a little confused about how you came up with .12 as your average, it looks to me as if you counted the levels where magicians got no nuke at all as a difference of 0. Which leads me back to the level one shock comparison.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I left them off deliberately (as stated above), but the number looks wrong to me too, I'll do it again and edit the results if I get a different average.<br>
<br>
This statement bothers me a great deal though:<br>
<br>
&quot;I also may have been a bit careless with my use of the word &quot;significantly.&quot; I consider nuking slow enough such that my pet is required to break even with a wizard significant. I don't believe wizards should be outdamaging a magician+pet in the short term by much, if at all.. though who is ultimately more effective is highly dependant on the situation and skill of the player(which is as it should be, imo).&quot;<br>
<br>
I see two problems here.  First, your belief that you'll need a pet to equal my short term damage a significant difference, and second that you &quot;I don't believe wizards should be outdamaging a magician+pet in the short term by much, if at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
See, you have a pretty odd philosophy about what a Wizard should be.  Apparently you are of the opinion that Magicians should be better than Wizards in combat, and that a Wizards only edge should be as a taxi, moving the characters to where they need to go.  How you can even remotely attempt to justify wanting to continue the already absurd situation where Mages can comfortably outdamage Wizards in the short term and ENORMOUSLY in the long term I can't imagine.<br>
<br>
Why, precisely, would anyone ever want a Wizard in a group again?<br>

<br>
If mages and wizards are both fast burn classes, and mages do more long-term, I don't really see much point to adding a wizard to a group. <br>
<br>
First off, the very point of fast burn, has been pretty much broken down. As Grim mentioned, you need 4-5 casts to even see a difference in fast casting. If you chain-nuke like that, 1 of 2 things (or both things) will likely happen. You will get aggro and get pounded on, and/or you will be OOM really quick.<br>
<br>
Wizards are a nuking classs, it is all we have to do damage with. If we are not, and I actually believe this, the most damaging class in the game, then thier really is little argument for taking us over another class that does MORE damage but also has defensive skills. <br>
<br>
Mages have a pet. Warriors, rogues, rangers and monks all have more AC and skills, if needed, to avoid aggro. More than any other offensice class, the wizard totally and completely sacrifices defense. The reward for that should be terrifying, and unparralled. <br>
<br>
But it isnt, furthermore there are many who apparently think it should be. If we are to keep finishing somewhere in the middle of the pack of damage dealers, there is simply no argument for this class to exist, except as TLers.<br>
<br>
Fast-burn, as a concept, is situational and certainly not needed in a group. If you plan to take away even that, then you remove the final, though creaky, argument for even having a wizard around.<br>
