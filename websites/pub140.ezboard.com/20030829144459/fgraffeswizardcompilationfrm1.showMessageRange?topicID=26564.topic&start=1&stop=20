I was at E3.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to say that, regardless of my comments about what I feel to be the fact that EQ is not being left behind in any way, shape or form, I am also aware that the poll showed that a large percentage of you think that it is.  Obviously, I don't want you to have that impression, and there are probably a few things we can do to change that.<br>
<br>
So how about this, let's see what we can do over the next few months to change your minds.  Maybe we can have another poll then and see how it goes.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the information and the conversation.<br>

<br>
I was a totally loyal customer until recently.  The game has become a total and utter timesink post 50, with minimal gain at enormous cost of time and effort.<br>
<br>
Then I went to play Anarchy Online out of pure frustration.  The single problem they have, as far as I can tell, is that they need to learn more about networking, since the one problem they have is that they have alot of lag.  And even that was recently radicaly improved.  Besides which, when you lag in Anarchy, mobs lag with you, so it rarely kills you, unlike in EQ.<br>
<br>
Nearly every other gameplay issue is vastly superior in AO.  Classes are far more balanced. Graphics are superior to pre-luclin with a similar type of engine used.  Post Luclin I still give to AO since I've yet to see a melee in AO skewer his head for any reason.  Personally generated dungeons, complete with boss mobs and *good* loot on team missions... Not so much camping mob_x for such and such.  Loot on several creatures that is often worthwhile for the character, as opposed to total crud/vendor fodder not worth equiping or else rare as hell items barely adequete at the level they can be obtained.  The skill based system of AO is far superior to EQ's level based one... mostly because it benefits casters and melee equally--melee can get super buffs and equip super weapons relative to level, and Casters can get super buffs and learn super spells relative to level.<br>
<br>
This and many more aspects of AO are far superior to EQ... and yet I hold open my sony account, and log in from time to time on EQ, hopeing for a better experiance one day...  I just wish I wasn't constantly disappointed. <p><br>

<br>
as for high end content tuning- taking 6+ months to tune the elemental planes is, well, bad. people shouldnt be done with something by the time it's toughened. as for potime, I'm hoping that it doesnt suck so bad when I'm there. I'd personally want for the devs to make the events in Time something thats great fun, rewarding, and scuttle all of those complaints. when balance is tuned and exploits fixed, having it done hastily and poorly is crap... especially when you leave stuff unfixed for months, and release something that the live servers test.<br>
<br>
coming enhancements? Can I have more AA abilities, hm?~ After 150, wizard AAs are basically fluff and I still quad, but the defensive lines do little or nothing against a pancake-smasher anyway. There's 250AAs atm that are very marginal or not much usefulness, and doggone it I'd like something more to look forward to. While I can still xp, good old SOE doesnt give too much of an incentive to keep going at it. even if it costed 8, 16, 32 per rank, I'd spend time into another scs type aa. or creative fun stuff. in general, wtb xp w/o some wall that I'd hit while doing it, where everything I train is essentially meaningless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glinlor00>Glinlor00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Site Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table><br><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif><a href=mailto:glinlor@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><font color=#FFFFFF>Contact Glinlor</font></a></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1731<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 11:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Sorry Absor I closed it a little sooner than I had thought I would, I won't be on tommrow (at least I don't think so)<br>

Our AA's do one thing for us and thats pretty much heal/cure/buff. <br>
<br>
They threw us a hammer with a proc but in elementals if im swinging instead of healing people are dying. And dying fast. Even with extensive AA we still die fast for a plate class and i still get interuppted by green mobs in newbie zones. We also have the nice fact that some of our 61-65 spells arent so hot and generally arent even worth getting(extreme cost comes to mind).<br>
<br>
<br>
Boredom is a problem; im sure its that way with most classes in the high end though. It's just compounded by the fact that we have only 1 role in the end game, sit/med/heal/buff/repeat.<br>
<br>
Another thing of general note. Tradeskills. Take pottery for example. Lastnight i decided to laquer 600 opals. Im max for the skill. Besides the insanity of having to click each component while holding down my control key the amusing part was that out of 100 combines i failed a trivial item exactly 11 times. I did this for a total of 600 combines and when done i failed laquering a trivial opal 66 times. Seems to me that some things are not so random as they make them out to be. What id like to see at least for tradeskills is things like laquering gems or making stacks of items, let us combine the entire stack of 20 items with 20 components and let the random generator figure out how many times in that stack of 20 you failed, and give you the end result. <br>
<br>
Thats my biggest frustration. Sitting for hours mindlessly clicking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nanur>Nanur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 11:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> I think there do need to be server-specific GMs <br>
<br>
All GMs are not created equal. In other words some have told me outright misinformation either it was a lie or they did not know. This has cost me vaulable  in game experience and time.<br>
In short they all need the same manual to work from.<br>
<br>
I do play to have fun. When i am met with in-game bugs or problems not my making read: zone crashes i do not enjoy being told sorry your out X-loot but nothing i can do.<br>
<br>
I think at the very least some small effort should be made to investigate and then respawn mobs lost due to bugs or zone crashes. NOT the standard sorry nothing i can do. The reality is this detracts from the FUN when your shortchanged on a legitmate kill. I know there maybe a 100 hundred reasons why this can  not be done but that still does not give me back the FUN. <br>
<br>
The reality maybe that EQ is not on the backburner but as you pointed out that is the preception. It really does boil down to customer service. I think the pain of  buggy/unfinished content could be eased with  the appropiate customer service. This game earns millions and it is about FUN not punishing the players for bugs or zone crashes. I think the number one rule should be &quot; will this take the fun away from the player?&quot; You can have the strictest policys you want but they do you no good when you have no one to enforce them on.<br>

There are some time sinks in game that should be there and others that make something outright anoying and a pain in the butt to the point of no longer being fun.<br>
<br>
Take the 8th coldain shawl for instance hafting to get all those trade skills up is time consuming enuff, but then adding rare drops from mobs for the shawl combines just makes it even more tedious and a pain.  I feel the 8th shawl quest would be more enjoyable if some of the necesary drops were slightly easier to get.  Take velium hounds in WW for instance.  After spending months getting all your trade skills to that point and getting to that point competting for semi anoying to find fast moving mobs that drop the pelts  on a rare uncommon chance is lame.  They should be a common drop and drop for every wolf killed.  If your afraid that means people will use them to get tailoring above 158 easily make the combine for the padding a lower trivial and make the pelts no drop to reduce farming.  The gems off the geos should be more common in drops either that up the chance for shimmerings to spawn dramaticaly.  Shard wurm bile should become a common spawn as well with all the threads you have to collect in velks.<br>
<br>
To make a quest chalanging and fun you don't need to make it OVERLY time consuming.  There are other quests as well that would be more fun if you could complete them in a more resonable amount of time.  I feel there is enuff chalange involved for the 8th coldain shawl with the last fight and the time it takes doing the trade skill raising and the completion of each part that so many parts of it don't need to have rare or uncommon drops.  Not to mention level itself makes the quest progressive.<br>
<br>
Many things in Ever quest are fun and chalanging but arn't overly time consuming.  Take the Qeynos badge of honur quests for instance, fun, chalanging for a group in that level range and not overly time consuming.<br>
<br>
There are so many time sinks in this game that could be done away with and not make a huge inpact on the time it takes JOplayer01 to go from level 1 to uber level 65 well equiped maxed AA character.<br>
<br>
Now some may disagree with me but I feel there are a lot of unnecesary time sinks in game that actualy take away from the fun of doing something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=macfudd>Macfudd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 2:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back burner</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To make a quest chalanging and fun you don't need to make it OVERLY time consuming. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Second I read this I thought, if only there were more Qeynos badge quest type quests.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to get together people to help me with this, instead of waiting for ages for some rare mob to spawn or parking a group in a corridor for hours on end after a rare drop we could buff up, hand in the pieces, spawn the mobs and repeat for everyone in the group who wanted a go.  More or less anyway, there is still a fair amount stuffing round unless you have the help of some bard speed and ports. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=codegurux>CodeguruX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 2:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ugh</span><hr size=1> The real test won't be in a few months it will be in a year or whenever you guys get around to releasing EQ2 and SWG, then we will see how focused you still are on EQ.

Well when all those people that think its on the back burner quite for EQ2, or WoW, or SWG, and truly leave for those games and don't come back, will they care weather EQ is or isn't on the back burner? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caldabuse>Caldabuse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 3:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> I'm not certain I'd say that I feel that EQ's been put on the backburner. There've been so many new features within the past few months and more new zones than I've seen before in such short succession. However. Personally, my experiences these days have been mixed. I find PoP at the level i'm at fun and exciting. However, Luclin timesinks have sapped my will to play. And since the PoP endgame seems to have been neglected, this has a trickle-down effect of negativity. Why does FoH's experiences matter to someone who isn't even in the elemental planes? They don't, really, but as the community gets more negative, I get less enthusiastic about playing. So I'm in a weird position. I'm glad for all the work that seems to have been put into making EQ more friendly to newbies and all the new features. But the messed up endgame does sort of sap away some of the excitement and feeling that I have something to work towards. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78952">Caldabuse Betelgeuse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arcanist and Pirate Queen of the Timorous Deep<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Erollisi Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etelka>Etelka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 3:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ugh</span><hr size=1> To convince me that EQ isn't on the backburner:<br>
<br>
1) Stop killing our spells just because they're inconvenient for you. See: manaburn, GFlux, summoning mobs, etc. (kudos on the final HoH fix btw, great idea!). Also: fix resists on Rains. A 22 percent resist on a lure-based spell is ridiculous.<br>
2) Better CS. Not only more people available. What's much more important: right now, the only thing your first line of support (your guides) can do is to apologize, transfer it to the second line, and apologize again after a week if second line doesn't resolve the problem. Also: why is it that the main function of your customer support is being a police force? Doesn't it feel a bit odd that a majority of your customers is not glad at all when there's someone of your CS dept in the same zone?<br>
People can say all they want that CS in other games is even worse, I don't care: I don't play other games, I play EQ. If you guys are so passionate about it as you say, then why is &quot;good enough&quot; suddenly &quot;good enough&quot; when it comes to CS?<br>
3) What was all that stuff with the Rathe being unkillable for so long? Over here, it's all speculation of course, because no one not working for SoE knows what really happened, but to me, and many others, it pretty much looked like PoTime was still unfinished more than half a year after release. If we were wrong on that, then why block guilds at that encounter for so long? If we were right about it, then will we be seeing that again in new expansions? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~tom.van.der.veen/Sig-custom.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ganguskann>Ganguskann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 3:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> Ok Absor, this is my first and last post I'll ever direct at you since there is some chance that you may read this.<br>
<br>
I've read recently of a few changes on test, one being that Iksars have tinkering? If you could explain some type of roleplaying reason that iksars have tinkering now I'd be happy to hear.  There are a lot of gnomes out there very unhappy about this.<br>
<br>
Bring back server assigned GM's, on Tribunal we used to have some pretty cool ones but we never see them anymore.  Also, introduce some way of having players evaluate these GMs.  While I've never had a problem with them personally but we all have heard of really ignorant and rude GMs out there.<br>
<br>
Since PoP came out there seems to be a lot of anti-soloing nerfs-fixes-etc.  I enjoy soloing, I don't exp much at all mainly because I find it boring.  Please give us this option again, even if we have to use a lvl 52 &amp; 57 spell to do it.<br>
<br>
One last idea, that's been mentioned in the serverwide.tinker channel is that we should be able to make Tinkered Tracking Devices.  Seeing as how we can track corpses I don't think it'd be hard to track other stuff as well.<br>
<br>
And FFS, give us pointy hats please!<br>
<br>
I'm at the point in this game that I find it so boring that something as simple as giving Iksars tinkering would probably make me quit.<br>

Is it because the game is bad or becuase you can only play something so much before it just isn't the same game anymore?<br>
<br>
For me and others there seems to be a fealing of stagtisim of going know were fast.  Wich realy shouldn't be a problem, lots of people before now have felt it was time to move on and stop playing this game.  But lattly for whatever reasons it seems as if a larger amount of people are feeling this way at the same time and when they all up and leave it will have a cascading effect.  <br>
<br>
I have a RL friend for instance that plays and I know a few other people tht play only becuase such and such other people play.  They've had fun with the game and don't realy see much wrong with it but it's to a point were enuff little things have added up that they just don't care much anymore.<br>
<br>
So if a bunch of old timers leave at once a number of others will follow suite, and others may follow after them sence they were looking for a final reason to find an end to the game.  There are a lot of people that keep playing for some reason or other that are looking for that final excuse to stop playing and I think that excuse may manifest itself if enuff of the right people quite the game weather friends or otherwise.<br>
<br>
So on that note there is definatly a back burner feeling for reasons that the majority of the EQ population (or those that voted on the above poll) seem to feel even if SoE hasn't and isn't putting it or intending to have EQ on the back burner.  I guess you could say the air feels charged as if something is changing in reguards to EQ's future.  Were its going or were it will go at the moment is anyones guess bolth with content and comunity.<br>
<br>
The comunity on ECI for instance seems to have died off a bit and numbers of mid tier guilds have just ceased to exist lattly.  There are quite a few unguilded high level characters running around it seems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gresteh>Gresteh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 5:42 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> Well, customer service is horrible if you play in european time. i know that is hard to keep 24/7 Game masters, but not impossible, some servers as Solusek ro server are full of european people that don't want to change of server because they are there sice 3-4 years ago.<br>
<br>
But i dont think that everquest is in the black burner, but SoE has to work a little harder to have their customers happy.<br>
Let's hope that the new bank slots goes live, and that they do more zone revamps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26564.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26564.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26564.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26564.topic&start=81&stop=95>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26564.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26564.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26564.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
