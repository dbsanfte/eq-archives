And in my 4 years the only time I've seen a female character treated differently is by over hormonal boys, I've never ONCE seen a woman who wasn't acting clearly in an incapable and confused manner given patronizing advice or treated as a second class citizen.  I've seen a lot of double entendres and &quot;hon&quot;s thrown around but never someone treated like a child or a moron simply because they are a female character.  I find it hard to believe this guy ran into a lot of it when I've never once seen it, and the majority report here is that he's talking out of his briefcase.<br>
<br>
Basically he wrote a paper on a subject his superiors would have zero clue about saying what they'd like to hear about something they probably hold in disdain.

Sure, some men might buy a bra and wear it but that has nothing to do with gender discrimination. Is it so discriminating not to want to have cute blue breasts? I admit that I do treat most women online differently from men, but would never get into an online relationship of any sort. For the most part, I slide to one of 3 extremities with them online: dead neutral, excessively nice, RAR YOURE GONNA DIE. Personality quirk? I guess so, only 2 so far have entered rar you gonna die and that takes borderline harassment or more! The other half dead neutral, and the other half say sometimes I make them blush irl. the rest I don't discern at all between female/male when considering them. personality quirk? maybe.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't agree with rombus on saying that women don't know how to play but he might have not been serious. After all it was in a news page, and I got put on a news page when I said something not serious and after that maybe 6 people asked me if I'm an engineer. What IS interesting, though, is that those wizards who study/work in engineering and have mentioned it are the ones who ask me the most questions, or advice, or about caster loot. Being more adept with math than other skills does change your thinking- and I don't know how being female changes that. <br>
<br>
Theres no female wizards in my guild, or necros/mages(which i basically class leader for all 3 though shamen and clerics occasionally turn up in my channel just to listen in ;p). They do own though, all of them-even apps-with the exception of one new guy. All now follow raid directions 100%, do their best job, think on strategy, always paying attention and are &gt; * other guilds ive botted on, and even people outside that in guild. Does this have anything to do with lack of females? I wouldn't think so, and I very rarely say anything positive about anybody as summed up on a thread from my server saying, `I'm not sure, but I think istari just gave the guy a complement. this calls for some celebration!`. I detest sucking though, and won't allow anyone to suck that I can tell otherwise. If I had a sucking Femwizzy, I would prolly tell her how not to suck, and I explain a lot to a wizard(even from out of guild) that wants to know things from me. <br>
<br>
One good thing about EQ is that theres some secretly nerdy women around... and i there's one thing I want in a woman, it's for her to be secretly nerdy!<br>
<br>
this Animal House spin can sum it up:<br>
`The issue here is not whether we broke a few rules or took a few liberties with out female raid guests- we did. But you can't hold a whole guild responsible for the behavior of a few sick, perverted individuals, for if you do, then shouldn't we blame the whole guild system? and if our whole system is guilty, then isn't this an indictment of everquest players in general? I put it to you- isn't this an indictment of our entire american society? Well, you can do what you want to us, but we're not going to sit here and listen to you bad mouth the whole United States of America! GENTLEMEN!`<br>

Whiz, Pedi, don't give that study more credibility than it's worth. The numbers are as misleading as the studies I've quoted as well. I found a few more that were so off-based I didn't bother linking. <br>
<br>
(I actually laughed out loud reading that the average EQ player earns $3.42 per hour playing his character, because obviously we're all going to sell our level 24 alts for hundreds of dollars.)<br>
<br>
Sadly, I don't think there IS a way of sampling enough of the EQ population to pull up any true statistics, other than taking guesses at the gender of the credit card holder. And Sony would have to do that, not an independant study on the web that can be easily fooled, tricked, and sabotaged. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://forcesunknown.homestead.com/files/ap-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I tend to agree with the theory that, since most EQ players are men, and a man spending money on an ebayed 'toon is likely to spend more on a male character.<br>
<br>
I also contend that, since EQ characters aren't designed to be auctioned off to others, the whole study is rather missing the point: the 'toons that are worth the most to their creators are the ones you will never find on the auction block. It's akin to basing an analysis of gender-based societal inequity on the daily profits of homeless people and panhandlers...you're not getting anything like the whole picture. <p>Chesse Defenestratrix Shardic, <br>

Yes I have gotten 'hon can you...' and a few odd tells from 14 year old teenagers it bugs me alittle, mainly b/c people assume I am a woman just from the name and I think the tells are different vs if they thought I was a guy. So I do think that women whether or not they are a guy in rl, get treated differently. Is it in a demening way? I don't know, I am sure there are jerks that do but I am sure there are alot of people who are gentlemen. <br>
<br>
But in my own personal experience I have to agree with Zarbonius.

EQ isn't a very sexist place in terms of demeaning women, they get treated as sex objects but not like idiots in my experience, nor, it seems, any of the posters here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izlaaru>Izlaaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/25/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I'm a 25 year old male playing a Female Erudite Wizard.  The reason I started a Female character is because when the game first started, most people assumed males were male and females were female.  I had originally a male character, but was getting annoyed at the &quot;mocho&quot; attitude that I was &quot;expected&quot; to uphold (In /tells etc..).  When I started a female character, I was respected more and even helped more.  Now a days, I still get a lot of people thinking I'm a female cause I don't go on the &quot;bashing sprees&quot; and the &quot;Hey dude, look over there at that.. &quot; type of trips.<br>

I just guess some of the hun/hon comes straight from RL. But being non-US and getting &quot;hun/hon/sweetie&quot; reference as a male in a casual conversation was confusing before learning to know the culture background. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

His being to stand aside probably had more to do with his inability to play his character then his sex. The sex may have affected the phrasing used but not the motive.<br>
<br>
Secondly. The main point is how much is paid for a character. Just a guess but Higher level characters with more gear would sell for more. The highest priced characters would tend to be ones that were played by a hardcore player with a lot of time. We know that there are less females then males in the game. I assume the percentage of hardcore players is even lower then the game average. Just my theory. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etnu>etnu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2755<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 12:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Penis.</span><hr size=1> There isn't a single character in all of EQ that has either a penis or a vagina, so this point is irrelevant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27071.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27071.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=27071.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=27071.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=27071.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=27071.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27071.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27071.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> -
