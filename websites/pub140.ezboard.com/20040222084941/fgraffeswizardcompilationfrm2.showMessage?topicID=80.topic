One, there is an abundance of negativity on this board, (maybe save it for the rant area?  or maybe stop it all together) how on earth can this be helping &quot;our&quot; class at all??<br>
<br>
We all know that it's difficult to actually read something on a board and know the actually intent or emotion of someone's post.  UNLESS I TYPE IN ALL CAPS AND I AM USING SWEAR WORDS.  So sure, sometimes people get the wrong impression.  But please the negativity isn't helping one bit.  The fact is we need to be pro active to our class and fellow wizards/wizardesses.  <br>
<br>
In regards to the FA weapon, this is what I have understood.<br>
<br>
1.  It's epic so therefore it's DIFFICULT to get.  Personally difficult to the point where it will come down to uber like guilds and or those who have enough friends and time to complete it.  I think that's realistic without sounding like it's a flame or &quot;I am pissed, it's only for ubers&quot;  <br>
<br>
2.  FA's were supposed to be EPIC right??  They defined this as something of an &quot;effect&quot; your class is good at or provides (I would assume this effect is supposed to help your group, because in fact it's supposed to be a group/social game).  Did verant say it would particularly be &quot;offensive&quot;?  I've heard a LOT of people say it was, but is it??  I thought it was more of a general role you do per your class.  I think that's about right isn't it?  The definition or explanation made by verant.  Now if I remember Verant had stated the wizard was the most powerful in forms of magic etc...  Basically saying they can blow stuff up, and FAST.<br>
<br>
3.  Effects of the Wizard.  Like said wizards do damage in the form of magical attacks (ice nukes, fire nukes,  magical nukes), they do it for less mana, and faster than any other caster, little to no refresh on casting the same nuke (again fast casts/turn arounds).  In addition (due to all the whinning), verant added &quot;harvest&quot; and &quot;manaskin&quot;, therfore a process for us to gain some mana a little faster (in no way is this a clarity effect though).  They also have stuns (not considered a primary attack) Area Effect, root type lines, evacs, 1 spell to lower aggro (remember 1, thats means its not what we are best at or use most of the time to give our class definition) and teleports.  <br>
<br>
4.  Class type definitions and how VI decided what to give the FA effect per class.  Here is the BIG one people.  Cleric, easy enough, healing, rez'es, buffs/shields, stuns, root (do they ever use it?).  FA effect free manaless rez.  Yes most definitely fits the class.  You couldnt give them a CH for free would be obviously to overpowering.  Res is one thing a cleric does a LOT.  Who does it affect?  EVERYONE and ANYONE who dies period.  Ever hear a level 20  asking for a res?  Yes I would say this weapon affect more than a &quot;group&quot;.  Easily the best weapon.  Enchanter FA effect.  I beleive it's a free group aug buff or something like that, again something an enchanter DOES is speed/slow.  Personally I feel the enchanter more of a defensive class but VI has put this effect on the FA as a lot of people complain about having to do it all the time.  Another very nice weapon.  Rogue FA effect, insane backstabs.  Not to hard to summerize here, simply put, damage and lots of it.  Another usefull tool for a &quot;group&quot;/raid.  I honestly don't know the rest of the effect etc.  but I would assume most fit, although I've read a lot of negativity concerning the necro FA.<br>
<br>
5.  The effect of the FA for wizards.  Uh oh, now I've gotten myself into the mess (heheh).  I don't think the &quot;stats&quot; are what is MOST important, so lets stick the the EFFECT.  A damage absorbing shield cast for free with some type of mana regen.  Hmmm this is interesting, a damage absorbing shield, ok we do have many a good buff line, but does'nt just about every caster class have something to this effect.  The mana regen with this effect, again we have only 1 other spell that gives us more mana.  Ok objectivly lets see what this provides us to ourselves or groups.  It allows us to seemingly &quot;burn&quot; more with an ability to get hit more and the added mana regen to be able to cast a few more time.  With this considered it is viable to chain nuke something take some damage then use the 1 spell (cinsidering you have to be 50 , I assume you SHOULD have the mem blur like spell) we have available to lessen aggro to have it turn back to the tanks.  I'm not sure if this effect provided is supposed to make this a viable solution for us to do.  That sounds like what it should be used for if you ask me.  I mean dropping big nukes on mobs tend to get them pissed off.  So is not the wizards main class definition to piss mobs off to take damage then mem blur it and recast the gemless dmg shiel lather rinse repeat?  I'm sure there are others way the damage absorbing shield gives you, but this idea of mine more fits the class definition (we do damage).  Now revert back to the other FA's, they FIT the class definition.  The wizards however is off base some.  We are not masters of damabge absorbing shields, we are not masters of mana regen etc.  So I ask nicely, what was VI idea of this EFFECT?  Has anyone figured it out?  Our main class definition is pumping out lots of damage fast for the absolutley least mana.  So I assume part of the damage absorbing shield makes some sense, but honestly, not much.  I will also take into consideration this effect is truely post 50, so this may in some way change class definition of the wizard, or does it??  The continuom of the wizard is damage from start to finish if you ask me (verant even said so).  So what do other people look for from wizards post 50?  Is this effect only have certain purposes in certain situations??  I mean is that epic??  Look at the other classes, for the most part all of them allow their class definition to be increased for effectivness whether offensive/defensive or a &quot;servie&quot; ie (cleric rez'es).  So maybe we can all objectively look at the definition of the wizard class post 50 (since its a post 50 weapon) and see if this effect fits.  Personaly to me, it does'nt make any sense at all.  Is'nt there a tank to taunt the mob off of me?  Is'nt there a cleric there to heal me if needed, is'nt there a enchanter to mem blurr or chain stun (to either get aggro lower or off) to completely unload all of my mana to kill the mob (beleive me I've gone from FM to 0 mana with chain stuns dropping insane damage, too much to count).  <br>
<br>
So anyone who can add inpunt please do, lets try to see what we can come up with.  Even if we never see it, it's always good to throw out new ideas.  Like maybe an effect that was available to use that allowed a certain nuke to go off with another nuke with 0 extra aggro added to the nuke cast and with a certain refresh.  I mean there are all sorts of ideas, lets look at alternatives and see what we come up with.  It's in fact a reason a LOT of classes have had spells/effects added due to us as players in the game.<br>
<br>
I hope no one reads this and says I am negative etc..  I've done an honest effort to define class definition and the effect of the epic FA's.  Please put forth your positive comments.  And remember this is our class, just like our all important reputation in RL be positive, be pro-active, and please don't slander people for their mistakes or newbie'ness no matter who it is.  Be proud of a class that is extremely diffucult at times to figure out.  There are'nt that many of us, be proud and protect our integrity and reputation of this incredible class!!<br>

So that you could cast your equip spells while still laying down the big nuke. Also, I have thought it would be cool to be able to sort of split yourself into thirds and have 2 of you med and the other one cast or have all 3 med or have all 3 nuke. Just my 2cp.  I think the epic has a nice effect but not necessarily something our class does or does well.  But it is personal buff so it does make some amount of sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujadefyre007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jadefyre007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/02 1:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FA effect per class, does the wiz FA fit?</span><hr size=1> Sorry, but I disagree.<br>

Yes, I am a Druid by nature, but I believe he has a very valid point..the Wizzy epic should be a personification of what the Wizzy class is best known for...either port/punts anywhere you choose...or a decently high level dd spell that either could have an extra long cast time, like they do for all the rest of our Epics. THAT would be more in line with an Epic personifying withthe Wizzy class..not some noob self shield...which is just ghey. I think that is just a waste of an Epic. <p>~Jadefyre, Child of Tunare~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufilastilapplepie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filastil Applepie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/02 3:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FA effect per class, does the wiz FA fit?</span><hr size=1> Though i dont have my Epic yet i dont want it to be changed i really look forward to the Epic and especially the Effect (gnarled staff missing). Especially with the chance to get a good right click nuke robe one day too (rend or conflag robe) and no i dont have one in moment i have not even the chance to see one of the mobs that drop them die. I think we get a good Epic just because it is no Rightclick nuke since we can get both that way.<br>

These are spells we get that relate to the epic. We get plenty of nukes and really dont need to improve in our nuking power so if the epic were to do something nuke-related it couldnt be that amazing. I think regen and a bunch of damage absorb is very useful. I use the types of spells listed above all the time and the epic's regen stacks with everything else, it also doesnt cost any mana and you dont have to deal with regents like with our actual spells. The wizard epic DOES NOT suck. It may not relate to the main purpose of wizards but i think it is quite high up there on the list of epics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=yiliamar>Yiliamar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/26/02 7:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FA effect per class, does the wiz FA fit?</span><hr size=1> Jadefyre,<br>

An 800 point rune with mana regen is &quot;ghay&quot;?  Man, you really are a hard person to impress.<br>
<br>
A wizard's job is to make things dead FAST.  That's all.  We can ONLY do this is TWO conditions are met.<br>
<br>
1) We are ALIVE to cast our spells.  Gee...  Maybe an 800 point rune will keep us alive a bit so we CAN kill what ever is beating on us.<br>
<br>
2) We have MANA to cast our spells.  Um... Mana regen is part of our epic.<br>
<br>
Now, you think we should get a nuke.  Ok, like we don't have enough nukes??  You want to put a longer cast time on it.  Why would we use it when we could get off an equivilent amount of damage using our regular nukes?  Cause it's mana free?  Big deal!  They would have to make it a MAJOR nuke, over 2k, for it to be worth it and they aren't going to do that.<br>
<br>
Wizard epic is fine, imho.  Yeah, I don't have mine yet, but I'll get it, never fear on that.<br>

<br>
The wizard epic has some of the most versatility for the wizard in the game. With a mana robe, a mod rod, or a mana stone, the epic buff increases its value even more than just a damage shield.. In the event of not enough tanks, wizard can go to stun mode and handle mobs as minor MT in XP groups. <br>
<br>
The wizard epic is perfect, and the stats themselves (especially the resists) really help out the wizard, as well as the right click buff.<br>

btw..I would like to tell u that the effect of wiz epic is USEFUL for serval reasons.<br>
<br>
1) mana-regeneration ( stack with all spells but BST clarity )<br>
2) Absorbing everything ( treat it as a extra hp buff )<br>
3) Faster mana recovering with mod rod/manarobe/manastone like someone mentioned it before.<br>
<br>
You are right epic &quot;suppose&quot; to be hard to get...but it is pre-sov..after sov is out...lots of epic quest become easier and easier due to the major upgrade on skill and equipment...<br>
I wont use it a lot if it is a DD...it is because<br>
epic was based on kunark, try to think if it was given a DD effect, how powerful will it be ? not really i would say with the cast time/dmg ratio...but of course...someone might claim it would be a manaless (lure maybe) nuke ~ but still....rend robe/velk robe/velk orb/lure stick/specter of channeled lightning/velious quest robe/akheva ice DD thing give the thing u want...and i am sure there will have something better in the future....<br>
but if u look at some free-rune items..there are not much we can use in game, for instance, shield of aura/orb of lost soul...and they are really hard to get plus orb of lost soul ( not sure on shield ) can only absorb melee for 150 dmg...<br>

The effect on the Staff of the Four while not necessarly 'class defining' is a great effect, take any of the many reasons above as an example.  Perhaps we should not look at the items' effect for 'definition' and more for usefulness.  Look at the necro/druid/shaman epics, manaless dot's but they don't stack, which cuts their usefulness in raid encounters down alot where as the wizard epic is helpful/useful to every wizard that has theirs.  So basically usefulness is alot more important than being defined, IMO.<br>

I can't understand how you don't realize this, it probably helps the user out more than any epic out there cept maybe magi and cleric. It's better than any other rune spell in the game that players get, its absolutely free, costs no mana no peri's you can chain cast it forever.<br>
<br>
Quite litterally thanks to my epic and c3 i can tank in sebilis. Disco, pyra, chef, whatever. I can just nuke to keep agro and let the sheild eat everything sometimes i can recast it with things beating on me. Given it works a hell of alot better with the mob slowed but still works.<br>
<br>
Its saved my life coutless times, ive had it since level 54 and been 60 for a while now... You can't know its greatness till you have it i guess. It just rocks.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Not to MENTION that its one of at least the top 5 easiest epics EVER. Probably just harder of Monk and Rogue in difficulty and easier than the Druids. (Reaver and Fay can be bastiges i understand) <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71166" target=new>Yian Crimsonsky</a> (Erudite) <br> <a href="http://www.bristlebane.com" target=new>Bristlebane Server</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urealwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Realwing</A> at: 7/11/02 4:25:47 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=80.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=80.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=80.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
