The goblins near the base see through invisiblity.  The ones at the top near the rod do not.  (/consider to make sure.)<br>

Without being able to use the waterline trick like you can in Oasis, though, Lake Rathetear is going to be fun.  :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwyzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#ffffff>(9/11/00 8:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: staff of the wheel, rod in eruds x-ing</span><hr size=1> I finally got a druid friend to buff me with invis to animals and 2 of the 3 sharks were indifferent and the other one left me alone.<br>

I had 3 level 50+s die helping me.<br>
<br>
1. Invis vs. animals doesn't work, neither does gather shadows, or superior camoflague.  This is from the 2 druids and the necro that helped.  That and I was camo'd more than a few times.  Wolf form doesnt help either.<br>
<br>
2. When I did it, the best option is to have a cleric get DA and DB up, and pop on DA and kite the sharks away while the wizard hops in and grabs the wand and gates/swims out.<br>
If the first attempt is failed, remind the cleric that the sharks are still agro, wait for DA or DB tor reload, and have him just step in the water further away from the wand.  The sharks will instantly agro on the cleric and will swim after him/her.  If they /q or log, they clear the agro and have to start all over again.<br>
<br>
3. However, the cleric I had needed sleep so I had to call in a necromancer friend.  He just popped on harmshield and feared the sharks while I swam in grabbed the wand and safely swam out.  Its the same basic concept.  The only reason the cleric option didnt work was because I couldnt find the wand on the ground.  You will need Endure Breath of an FBE (or DMF).<br>
<br>
The gobs in Oasis are indifferent to wolf-form.  Frankly I wouldn't do this quest solo, make some friends.  for me it was easy because I planned this a good month in advance, and had all the help I would need lined up (being a bard primarily looking for a new occupation, this proposed the biggest challenge I couold find that would hold my interest).  I got the wands in 3 days.  The toughest part is just finding the rods.  <br>
<br>
The 2 hardest to find are the qeynos catacombs, and the Everfrost wand.  I suggest getting a map or exact locs because these can become dangerous if you take a wrong turn (miragul is in the caverns that holds the everfrost wand, so a wrong turn may leave you at his feet).  I spent a good hour lost in the Qatacombs before getting a map.  After that it was easy.<br>
<br>
The most aggrevating wand (besides the erud's xing) is the Lake Rathtear wand by a long run.  The tunnel is hard to find since its underwater, and, a VERY dark tunnel.  Especially for an erudite like myself.  To ruin the surprise its on the backside of the 3 spawn Aviak Island.<br>
<br>
The easiest ones are in Unrest, DC, and Neriak (depending on race).  They are wide in the open and withe the right type of invis very easy to get.<br>
<br>
Like I said though, I was lucky to have the help I did, but it can be done with preparation.  You just gotta understand that the easiest ones are usually not easy at all, while the ones you dread are quite easy.  For instance, the Lguk rod.  I did this one as soon as I culd get a IVU and a TP.  Just ask is someone is camping the hand room (and it almost always is camped) just walk in, grab it and walk out.<br>

<br>
All you need is a druid to go along with you.<br>
<br>
Have the druid buff you up with all his best buffs.  Get sow too.  Levitate and invis yourself for good messure.<br>
<br>
Walk above water to the location of the rod.  Use /loc<br>
<br>
Have the druid levitate above water over the location as well.<br>
<br>
Swim directly down and grab the rod.  The second you have it tell the druid to evac.  Swim up and try to catch his evac.<br>
<br>
If you miss the evac (I did and had 3 sharks hitting me) get to shore ASAP.  Dont try to gate, just swim to shore as fast as you can.  The sharks won't follow you on shore.<br>

Start out with SoW potions, Invis to undead potions, and water breathing items (waterstones from a mage will do).  This may cost you upwards of 100pp but it's a small price to pay to ensure success for these valuable items.  You can substitute the necessary classes here and drag them along for the ride if you like.<br>
<br>
Azia:  The sharks are PCaggro.  This means that they won't con indifferent even if they can't see you.  (I am not completely sure they can see invisible, but I swam right next to them invisibly without getting attacked.)  The best strategy is to swim straight down and then straight back up.  The sharks circle the bottom and will stay there unless chasing you.<br>
<br>
Bezia:  Buy a SoW or a Sow potion for this one if you are too low.  You should be able to easily escape the skeletons and gate once you've gained enough distance.<br>
<br>
Caza:  The easiest way to find the entrance is to use the head bobbing technique.  You get your eyes just even with the waterline and you can see clearly long distances.  Note that the piece is on TOP of the tower.  The goblins here can't see invis but the others can so don't go mucking around the lower area.  When you approach come in from behind the direction the goblins are facing when possible.  This will make it harder for them to notice you when you go visible after taking the piece.<br>
<br>
Dena:  This piece is unguarded and easy to retrieve.  Regular invis should work.<br>
<br>
Ena:  This is the toughest of the lot.  Chances are invis to undead will run out before you get to your destination so there's really only two reliable ways to do this: either get a high level escort or buy several invis undead potions.  It also helps to do this piece on a weekend when guk is full and monster population is down.  Note:  To those who have never seen this room it is a high vertical chamber that is essentially a water tube.  You must swim up the tube to get to where the piece is.<br>
<br>
Fana:  Like caza the piece is on the very top area and the goblins can't see invis.    Approach wisely and you can escape unscathed.<br>
<br>
Geza:  This piece is unguarded and easy to retrieve.  Regular invis should work.<br>
<br>
Heda:  Invis and dive.  The shark is fairly low level, but if you are trying this at low level you may want to have a friend distract the shark.  Suicide pets work nicely as the shark can't come out of the water after you once he's done with the pet.<br>
<br>
Izah:  Gate after getting this one.  The safest area is probably the water.  Trying to get back to land will only get you killed.<br>
<br>
Jaka:  Unguarded.  If you can't get this piece I wouldn't suggest starting the quest yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udinaedinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinaedinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/19/00 8:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> How I got the Eruds x-ing rod</span><hr size=1> At level 46 I died a few times (those of you who have died in level 46 will sympathise with me on this one...) trying to get this rod.<br>
<br>
I had all the information, and had ample buffs and spells loaded. My vision was sharp, my strategy seemingly pure. I still died without getting the rod.<br>
<br>
I then meditated and recalled an item of lore of which I hadn't thought of any use when I first encountered it - The Shiny Brass Idol from Highpass Hold. Since I didn't have mine any longer, I immediately set out to purchase one from local adventurers.<br>
<br>
It casts one(1) charge of Divine Aura. DA gives an approximate 18 seconds of invulnerability. This was enough to convince me to levitate to the exact coordinares, use gator-vision to find the rod underwater using magnify sight, and prepare to swim down directly on top of the rod to get it.<br>
<br>
Once in position, and with the rod in sight, I casted diamondskin (or whatever is the best skin/rune/symbol you can get at the time.) I drank a SoW potion. I made sure that I had yonder in a hotkey (as well as /loc  just in case DA gave out, and the critters made me into Erudite Delight Finger Sandwihes.)<br>
<br>
Use the brass idol.<br>
Get the rod.<br>
Yonder (eeek, you can't cast while in DA effect.)<br>
Swim for the shore!!!!!<br>
Pant furiously, grinning with delight.<br>
<br>
Next rod...<br>

Go out get a lvl50+War someone with massive hp get 2-3 clerics and a good enchanter have the war go down Fully buffed and have him agro all 6sharks maybe 7 dont remember. But soon as he has agro have clerics start CH him so he can stay alive Enchanter starts mezing the sharks while you go down and pick up your rod soon as you get rod gate to shore and port them all out. This worked real well for me. And from what they said was great exp killing those sharks for them.

Don't need no stinking other Classes....</span><hr size=1> I did the Tarton's Wheel innumerable times. Whenever I couldn't find a group, as it yielded so much exp., I would go do it after L 29 when I first did it.  BTW the exp comes from turning in the Staff and the jewel.  Also gives BetaNeutral faction.<br>
<br>
NO invis or camo works all the time.  No aid of spell other than ours is of much use except a method of Endure Breathe and Sow (which is, as always, LIFE, as it allows backwards movement underwater).  <br>
<br>
The sharks are bad.  Very bad.  I am 55 and I don't think I would want to fight them.  However, there is a way to avoid them.  The sharks are in a triangle of spawn points.  <br>
<br>
From the beach, face the wreck.  Enter the water a bit to the left of the leftmost part of the wreck.  Swim out along the bottom.  Just past the ship, the bottom drops out.  Go straight down.  Stop.  Look for the sharks.  One is to your right 10 degrees or so off in the gloom, rather near the drop-off just past the right end of the wreck, but on the deeper bottom at your level.  The rod is about 45 degrees out from you to the right.<br>
<br>
The sharks swim a circuit of their triangle.  I recommend waiting a few minutes and seeing the movement so you realize exactly where they go.  The one closest swims out past the rod to his next point.  Wait till he is somewhat past the rod, nearly to his next point.  Then, swim to the rod, grab it, and swim back - don't put in inventory till you are clear.  MOVE.  NO DAWDLING.  DON'T GET NEAR HIM!  The next shark will be moving into the shore position that the other vacated by the time you have the rod and are moving back out of aggro range.<br>
<br>
Alternately, the sharks sometimes move differently.  The one that you can see past the rod on the left sometimes moves to his next station before the closer in one moves (I think this happens when a player or you have distrupted them).  In this case, swim straight out from your watch point to level with the rod (which is now due right).  Look to see if the other shark is coming from the shore area.  If it's not, you can reach the rod from this angle without triggering its aggro range - as long as it does not move.<br>
<br>
If you do this fast, the next shark is not in range.  If you are hit by a shark, Yonder and Gate.   Sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't.   Do remember though, that Yonder might fling you a LONG way or a short.  I always have a loc hot key and hit it while Gate is cycling.  I always write the loc down incase I lockup while LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  If the sharks get me, I come back with Levitation to the point and /corpse back to shore on the surface, there being no Z range to worry about.  I try to sell a few batwings to the Vendor so that they are there (unless someone buys or her memory of items is full).  I drop a couple on the beach just before I enter the water too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxaxia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaxia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/25/00 11:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: staff of the wheel, rod in eruds x-ing</span><hr size=1> I have 8 of the 10 rods now, with only the Hand Room and Everfrost ones left.  For me, the Oasis and Lake Rathe ones were harder than the Erud's Crossing one.  And here's why.<br>
<br>
I am 22 now (was 23 before this, sigh) and am doing the quest with Pause, who is 16.  I am indebted to Stillnight, a 51 wizardess who has helped us along the way and provided support.<br>
<br>
LAKE RATHE<br>
<br>
That LONG tunnel on the west side of the 3-spawn island was an omen for me.  I guess it's a test to make us all into brave little wizards and wizardesses.  I just have to say, I was scared to death!  Being Erudites, we started by casting Heatsight, used a waterstone, and Invised (regular).  Waterstones are definitely a must.  They are summoned from a 20th level magician and are NO RENT.  I heard wolf-from does not aggro the DW goblins, but we didn't have that luxury (and I'm not positive it works anyway).<br>
<br>
After we both found the tower, I actually entered it (stupid, stupid, stupid), swam up to the top floor, and instantly died.  As I lay there in a pool of blood, I actually SAW the rod beside me, but didn't have time to pick it up.  Pause stayed down for a couple of minutes and then gated back WITH ROD!  He is such an awesome wizard!<br>
<br>
This was his method.  There are 3 goblins on the top floor of the tower with an NPC Deep (she is non-aggro).  Con each goblin to see which scowl.  For us, one of them did, and this is the one that will attack if you go in tower.  The goblins have a VERY small aggro radius.  Swim above the window that has the rod closest to it.   It's the window with the two chests next to it; the rod is between the chests and very close to the window.  Float down to window but make sure you don't land on the ledge or you will aggro.  Keep clicking on the rod until you get it.  I had to swim up and float down about 6 or 7 times before I could click on rod.  BE PATIENT.  If invis breaks just swim away and re-cast.  Endure breathing lasts a LONG LONG LONG time.  Once you get the rod, swim away from tower, put rod in inventory, and Gate.<br>
<br>
I actually died twice here, but it can be done without a death, without wolf-form and without an uberguild.<br>
<br>
Stillnight retrieved both of my corpses and got the waterstones from a friend.<br>
<br>
OASIS<br>
<br>
Exactly the same setup as Lake Rathe, except there's no tunnel and the rod is unreachable from outside the window.  In Rathe, the rod is located very near the window; here the rod is almost exactly in the center of the floor.  I was attacked by a goblin and kamakazied it into the tower.  Fortunately, I was able to pick up the rod before I died.  When I did my corpse recovery, the rod was in my invertory.  Yippie!<br>
<br>
ERUD'S CROSSING<br>
<br>
I guess we both got lucky with this one.  Pause and I did this alone.  Read the Ice Comet spoiler here, under the rod for Erud's Crossing.  Also, what Mandos said is true.<br>
<br>
I cast Heatsight, Waterstone, and regular Invis (but this broke during and wasn't even needed).  Face directly west, with the ship on your right side.  Swim out (with belly on the ocean floor the WHOLE time - very important) until you hit the second coordinate of the rod (-2340).  You will be south of the rod now.  Face north, and go VERY slowly, inching your way to the rod.  Do not panic and more importantly: keep your LOC at -2340!!  I came to rod, picked it up, did NOT put in inventory, did a 180, and swam for about 10 seconds, then Gated.<br>
<br>
I never saw one shark or anything else for that matter.  It was nighttime (very dark under there!) and maybe they were all sleeping, dunno.  Pause then did the same thing and got his rod.  No sharks at all.<br>
<br>
Maybe this was pure luck, but I followed Graffe's spoiler to a &quot;T.&quot;  Thank you, Graffe! <p>Xaxia<BR>Erudite Wizardess<BR>22nd Season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ezelenerinyes>EzelenErinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/25/00 12:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah!

<br>
HAND ROOM<br>
<br>
Being my absolute first time in Guk, this place is a freak-show.  A 49th wizard led my to Lower Guk, got attacked by some nasties, and almost died.  I hooked up with another wizardess (35) who was trying to get the rod also.  I was there for about an hour and a half (crying over all the carnage, oh, the insanity!) and was escorted to the room by a very handsome 51 Ogre, Chubu!!  Thanks, Chubu!!  The hand was camped, we both got our rods and got the #$&amp;^% outta that hell-hole.  This is absolutely undoable at my level without some form of assistance.  You need both invis and invis to undead in Lower Guk.<br>
<br>
No deaths.<br>
<br>
EVERFROST<br>
<br>
I did this alone, with regular invis and a waterstone.  Boy, I wasn't expecting those tunnel to be so long.  I was petrified of meeting up with the Lich (50+) that wanders those dready tunnels, but never saw it (whew).  Anyway, the 3 ice bones did kill me (I'm only 22, gimme a break!) but I picked up the rod.  After corpse retrieve, I gated back to Sulgar.<br>
<br>
Whoopie!  I'm the proud owner of a beautiful staff!  So, in total:  4 deaths, 3 bubs and a level lost.  But who cares, the +10 INT is wonderful.<br>
<br>
I would recommend doing this quest at level 20 and above.  You absolutely need some form of help along the way, whether it's getting a few waterstones or just moral support. <p>Xaxia<BR>Erudite Wizardess<BR>22nd Season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jadrax>Jadrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/26/00 4:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: staff of the wheel, rod in eruds x-ing</span><hr size=1> Oh Wolf form does not aggro DW goblins btw.<br>

<br>
In fact there were no sharks around at all!<br>
<br>
I had a lvl 39 Paladin with me for this one and he took the dive to make sure first if it was clear.  He saw the rod but it disappeared at 7pm EQ time, a green circle appeared in its place.  We then sat and waited until 6am EQ time to go for it again.  Once more, not a shark around and the rod was there.  I manage to get it then.<br>
<br>
Anyone know if that part of the quest has change?<br>
<br>
Good luck to all who are doing it, and Congrats to the ones that have completed it.<br>

<br>
Grab the loc off of the sight... start from the left of the sharks (the sharks are off and to the right of the sunken ship) so about directly out behind the sunken ship go down, and head to the loc (w/o passing by the rod) and you wont piss off the sharks. <br>
<br>
Doesnt really matter which one, but get one of the locs to the right number... (and get it not to move) and then move to the rod, simple at that.. practice your locs! hehe makes EQing so much easier.  If you suck at loc... get a necro to cast DMF on you before you start heading that way... simple as that... (anyone on veeshan give me a tell and I will help you w/ this rod <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
