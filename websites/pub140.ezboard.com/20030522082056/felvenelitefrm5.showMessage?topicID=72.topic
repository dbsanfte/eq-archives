<br>
He made so much noise in all that clunking armour that she had been able to find  him very easily. Stealthily she moved up behind him and whispered in his ear (covered though it was in the strangest shaped helmet she had ever encountered)<br>
'Welcome to Nektulos, young Koada'dal, drop your sword and turn about slowly'<br>
<br>
The young paladin did so and came face to face with his first Teir'dal female.<br>
<br>
'I see your instructors still encourage you to come to our lands and endanger the lives of our young apprentices by attempting to slay our royal guards.'<br>
<br>
She paused as she studied his face. <br>
'Do you not hear the rumours of what I do to those I catch trespassing in my beloved homeland?'<br>
He nodded and squeaked his reply<br>
'We had heard that you were no longer here, that it was safe to venture once more into this foul forest' This last attempt at bravado amused Entice immensly.<br>
<br>
Chuckling in a rather disconcerting way she handed the paladin a peice of parchment, folded and closed with the D'Unnar seal.<br>
<br>
'I shall spare your life on this occasion. Take this letter to Felwith immediately, seek out Vladimirski and give him the letter. I do not expect a reply, but if one is forthcomming bring it to me directly'<br>
------------------------------------<br>
The contents of the letter read as follows:<br>
<br>
Vladimirski, you worthless Paladin,<br>
<br>
A long time has passed has it not since our swords last crossed. I take the blame for this. I confess to having treated you with a grudging respect in the past though you undoubtably are the embodiment of all I despise (and I despise alot).<br>
<br>
This final treachery is beneath even you however. You have brainwashed my husband to leave his home and serve under your 'leadership'. The Elven Elite - ragtag bunch of stragglers of all races though it is (why I even believe you have housed an old pet lizard of mine) is no place for a Warrior and Elder of Neriak, let alone Kenelan D'Unnar, Ambassador to House D'Unnar and, moreover, my husband.<br>
<br>
You would do well to release him into my care at the earliest opportunity. The results of not doing so may well be somewhat undesirable for you and your minions.<br>
<br>
Entice D'Unnar <br>

After reading it through and thinking a bit, he sits at his desk and begins a letter in reply.<br>
<br>
After he finishes his letter, he summons Wilwen The Hood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wilwen, please take this cautiosly to Neriak and deliver it secretly to the Lady Entice.  Be wary she doesn't catch you though, she can be, shall we say very evil when scorned.&quot;<br>
<br>
The contents of the letter read as follows:<br>
<br>
Lady Entice,<br>
<br>
So good to see your evilness back in Norrath!  And, Aye it has been a long time since we met.  I have always had respect for you, even though you serve the forces of evil.<br>
<br>
There was no treachery, that is not my way, this you should know by now.  I brainwash no one, all my people serve under their own free will.  I turn very few away whom seek shettle and company in the house of the Elven Elite, except the pure evilness of Shadow Knight and the most evil of all, Necromancers.  My &quot;leadership&quot; is about helping those who seek Truth and Honor for the &quot;good&quot; of Norrath and the lands beyond.<br>
<br>
The lizard you speak of has a name, and that is Carthaz.  He has alwaysseen the way of good.  He grew up with Paladins around him, and was saved at a very young age from the treachery and evilness that prevails in Cabalis.<br>
<br>
All in our guild are free to go anytime they wish, but you would have to convince Kenelan, not myself.<br>

It was good to be back in Neriak, for certainly all other cities paled in comparison to its beauty and tranquility.<br>
<br>
As soon as she opened the study door however her humming came to an abrupt finish.<br>
<br>
She sniffed the air..something was not right. Frowning she walked up to her desk and saw a letter propped against her tomes of House records. Closer now to the parchment and the sickly-sweet stench of Feir'dal was unmistakable.<br>
<br>
So early in the morning, and on an empty stomach, Entice felt a brief wave of nausea, and shuddered.<br>
<br>
'urgh',<br>
Snatching up the letter she yelled for one of the house serfs.<br>
'Kraveous... Kraveous... KRAVEOUS!' <br>
<br>
She span round as the door opened and the rather unsightly specimen that was Kraveous shuffled in to her study.<br>
<br>
'M'lady', he managed, bowing awkwardly.<br>
<br>
'Kraveous, remind me please..is or is not this mansion guarded by Neriak's finest, 24 hours a day?'<br>
'ye...'<br>
'How then,' Entice struggled to compose herself 'How then, might I ask, In the name of Innoruuk, can my private rooms be invaded by any Feir'dal that wishes to wander past?' <br>
<br>
Kraveous looked vaccant. <br>
<br>
Ignoring him now Entice opened the letter...a twisted smile playing on her lips as she read.<br>
<br>
...'&quot;Truth and Honour&quot;..deluded fool!...&quot;convince Kenelan&quot;...hah!' Her eyes narrowed as she re-read the letter. <br>
<br>
Kraveous was making for the door quietly when she snapped at him again,<br>
'Where is Qu'el'Velguk?'<br>
<br>
'er..'Kraveous stumbled, unsure of her meaning.<br>
<br>
'Tuard..where is Tuard? Oh never mind. I shall find him myself.' <br>
<br>
She swept out of the room, the door slamming behind her.<br>
<br>
Her mind focused elsewhere she still managed to nod at Lategrey and her young protegee, Jerlys as she met them in the corridor.<br>
'I hear good things about your progress, Jerlys' she said with a warm smile. 'You have a fine mentor'.<br>
<br>
As she marched on at a pace she muttered to herself again..<br>
'&quot; Convince Kenelan&quot;' she smiled..' how little you know me Vladimirski', and continued her search for Tuard. <br>
