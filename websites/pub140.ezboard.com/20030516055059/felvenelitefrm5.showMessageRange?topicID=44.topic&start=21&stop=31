But thought must be a bard , no one else can run that fast, then he heard a crashing sound, like 2 knight fighting, then soon followed the sound of breaking dishes, Lucman &lt;gaspes&gt; thinking I better hurry and get there, As he enters camp he sees Ary and Bwah sitting among broken dishes, and notices Bwah pointing at the wet floor, Ary's hands were kinda wrinkled, figuring that he just finished the dishes, and with both of them sitting on the floor, the crashing noise must have come from the blue streak that past him earlier, but still wondering about the other strange noise he heard, he asked the two guys on the floor &quot; As I neared camp I heard a unusual sound , it seem to stop after the crashing noise which seems to me by what I see, a Bard out of control.&quot; Ary replies &quot; Yes this crazy Bwah tried running me over, and look at the mess he made.&quot; Bwah's face turns a new shade of red. Lucman askes &quot; What was the other noise I was hearing before crash?&quot; Bwah replies &quot; Ary's was singing, at least trying too&quot; Lucman replies &quot; Ahh, ok &lt;chuckles&gt; I'm think I'll go to my tent and record my adventure to WW, I shall leave you two to your mess.&quot; lucman &lt;chuckles&gt; as he heads to his tent, as he walks to his tent he looks in one and sees Syrren sleeping and decides not to bother her, peeking into the next tent he sees Naminu looking very nice and says &quot; Greetings Naminu you look well.&quot;  Naminu replies &quot; Hail Lucman, I have just finished with a well needed bath, and getting ready to relax from a hard hunt.&quot; Lucman replies &quot; Very well, you get some rest and I shall see you later&quot; Lucman &lt;smiles&gt; as he heads to his tent, entering he walks to the extra large bed, reaches under to get his back pack and pulls out some parchment and lays it on the bed, reaching back in to get his quill and ink. &lt;gaspes&gt; Its gone !!!

He hunched inside his cloak against the cold of the slowly fading desert night, and listened to the awakening camp below.  <br>
<br>
Drifting upward in song came an ancient, gentle tongue.  The mere sound of Naminu's voice brought with it visions of Felwithe, family, old friends, and an unbidden smile that crossed his lips.  Ivy-creased marble towers seemed to form in the distance, eternal.  <br>
<br>
Another voice rose, not nearly so gentle.  &quot;Goddess no, not That ballad.&quot;  Somma could honestly say he had no memory of the battle.  Whether by injury or by his mind's choice he could not say.  He knew only that he had a scar which he had not previously.  The healers of the Elves were mighty, but always something remained . . . or something did not return.  He did not need the cold to remind him of his failures, but for the thousandth time he clenched and unclenched his mangled left hand.  <br>
<br>
A tall shadow covered him and he looked up at the bright shining knight young Aryllyian had become.  &quot;Hail Aryllyian, I was hoping to come and go quietly.  I just wanted to . . . listen to the camp a bit.  A lovely song for the morning, the Lady Naminu's that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aryllyian grimaced and crossed his arms before him, &quot;Well, had I known you were up here I would not have voiced that particular tune.  Why don't you come down and have breakfast with us.  I'm sure there's something hot left somewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, thank you.  Old habits.  I'll be moving on shortly.  Perhaps I'll return home to visit my parents.&quot;  He gazed out across the sea for a moment, as if trying to look beyond.  &quot;We have so many teachers in our lives, it seems the lessons never end.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ary looked at him quizzically.  He had grown accustomed to the old Elf's melancholic ways, but something had obviously changed.  &quot;What has happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sarnia was gone.  His old mentor had passed beyond the sea, like so many before, probably never to return.  She had been his first contact with the Elven so so long ago, his teacher and confidante.  She was Wisdom to him, and having done all she could within these lands, had finally moved on.  <br>
<br>
He squinted up at the shadow darkened form.  &quot;One last lesson from an old teacher.&quot;  Somma's grin was unexpected, and it startled even him.  &quot;But not for today.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aryllyian>Aryllyian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scroll Keeper</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(12/4/01 3:50:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An ever continuing thread...PLEASE POST!!</span><hr size=1> Aryllyian smiled and looked away.  He paused for a moment to consider what Somma had just told him and to kick at the sand a bit.  His mind filled with many things to say, but Ary dismissed each one as somehow inapropriate for a time like this.  <br>
<br>
He brought one hand up to guard his eyes from the tiny bits of sand that the wind carried and there for only one instant; Aryllyian saw a tiny beam of light on the horizon. In that instant Ary felt a subtle tugging at his soul, a yearning.  A yearning to go away.  He paused for a moment to examine his mentor.  It was clear to Ary that Somma was still watching that distant beacon; and that it was calling him, tugging at his soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;Somethings are best unsaid, Ary.&quot; said Somma in a stoic voice.<br>
<br>
Aryllyian nodded and watched the old paladin as he watched the horizon intently.  His heart was filled with a deepening sadness.  Only by looking away suddenly could Aryllyian avoid a tear.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Master Lord Somma?&quot; Asked Aryllyian, choking on his words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Ary?&quot; answered Somma in that quiet voice he chooses when he wants to be heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to hunt with you a bit more.&quot; Answered Aryllyian gathering his wits about him and deciding that this is the best strategy.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to hunt with you M'lord, ahem, while there is still time, that is..................&quot; Ary's voice trailed as if awaiting an answer.<br>

A big weakness for a warrior, but there seemed to be nothing I could do about it. <br>
I grabbed his hand and lead him to my room. As i began to take off my armor (which seems to weigh a ton) Thiba laid down on my bed. I took off my Tunic and made my way to his side. <br>
How close I felt to him now. How much I loved this little Wizzy. I leaned down to kiss him gently and I heard him ... SNORING... <br>
That blasted wizard I will show him... I quickly put back on my armor and before storming out of the room I grabbed a bottle of Elven wine. <br>
<br>
Wandering around drunk I came across a camp. I couldnt tell if they were live or dead or slepping.. but one figure stood in the shadows.. I slowly made my way through to the back side of the camp when I saw... a bunch of the EE passed out. <br>

The figure standing there...&quot;who is that cutie there?&quot; I asked myself, now all worked up and very frustrated...<br>

Wet with sweat and nausiated from the images that still crept in the back of her mind. Lighting a candle, Almalfia rustled herself from her covers and padded her way to her trunk. She withdrew a quill and ink and some parchment and began to write feverishly about her vision. <br>
           Journal entry...&quot;By Brells Beard&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;  Darkness and confusion were my companions as some unseen force was batting me around like some dwarven ball.<br>
Bodies lie all around their faces contorted in fear. In most unnatural positions.  Companions I have fought with and Healed many times were being struck down and I was helpless to heal. I could feel my own life fading but was unable to move. The stench of death filled my lungs choking me. then I awoke. I wonder if there is meaning? By Brell's Beard help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Malfi wrote she wrinkled her nose in disgust. What was that wicked stench? &quot;Has someone killed a goblin and let it sit in the sun for three days and just now slice open it's stomach?&quot; Malfi heard a low roll of thunder in the distance.  She remarked her aching shoulder must be gettin better. Since it were about to rain and her shoulder felt normal for a change.  &quot;well there goes my barometer. &quot;  Another waft of the foul smelling atmosphere floated through her tent.  &quot;My lands that is stifiling!&quot;   Malfi pondered the origin of this sudden afront on her senses.  &quot;Someone has to much meat in their diet or a gully dwarf has found refuge in someones arse and died.&quot;  Malfi prayed herself back to sleep. &quot;Oh Brell please bring me a change in the breeze&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=44.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=44.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=44.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=31><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
