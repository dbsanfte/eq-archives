Let me introduce myself first.<br>
<br>
Call me Moreden.  I am currently a wizard of the 32nd season.  My early tutelage was in Erudin with the wizards of the Order of the Crimson Hand in the palace.  They taught me control of flame and ice.  They taught me the application of power in efficient, lethal doses.  I learned that a wizard's primary skill lies in application of direct and precise damage over a short amount of time.  They taught me secrets that one day would allow me to be able to transport myself and others to various locations across Norrath, Luclin, and even directly to other planes!  Wizards wield considerable arcane power through many different types of spells.  <br>
<br>
I chose the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro, to follow as my deity because of the association wizards have with arcane, elemental power.  It seemed the most logical choice for me since I had chosen to wield great power as my primary profession.  Although I chose Solusek Ro, the influences of both Quellious the tranquil and Prexus were strong during my early days, making me less lustful for power than many of the Burning Prince's followers.  I believe that true power is best wielded with wisdom, control and meditation instead of simple desire for destruction.  My chief desire is to use my powers towards the advancement of good in the world.  Once my initiate training was completed, I set out to leave the peaceful shores of Erudin to start my career.  <br>
<br>
As I left Erudin's shores for the first time, my heart was both thrilled and saddened.  Thrilled to be starting my arcane career wielding vast amounts of magical power.  Saddened because of revalations concerning Komaru, whom I had once called sister.  My grandmother had, days before, told me the story of how Komaru was actually my mother, not my sister, and that her heritage was in Paineel.  Komaru had been adopted into the Wordbinder family of Erudin after a daring escape placed her as an infant at my grandmother's doorstep.  Grandmother told me of a curse that the evil god Cazic-Thule had placed on Komaru.  She would not say more about this curse, stating that it was Komaru's story to tell.  She went on to tell me that Komaru had been a prisoner in a dark tower but that a valiant force had freed her recently.  My uncle, Komaru's half-brother Eliezar, was one of the valiant warriors who freed her.  He said that though she was indeed free, she was changed because her soul was still being held captive by the evil vampire who rules the tower of her captivity.  So I left Erudin having much to ponder.  I am sure I will have more to say as more is revealed to me of this matter.<br>
<br>
My life has already been quite eventful, filled with people and places I will always look back upon with fondness.  I first set out for the Plane of Knowledge, where I saw members of many other races and many for the first time.  I had my soul bound there and used the various portals of the Plane of Knowledge to travel to and fro.  I traveled to the moon, saw the Luclin bazaar for the first time, bought my first dagger, and learned to use it.  Most of my earliest career was spent among the Vah Shir, learning their customs, language and ways while I practiced my arcane knowledge in the field for the first time.  It was during these days that I began to learn the strategical applications of my magic and even made a precocious first attempt to hunt multiple creatures at the same time.  I also handmade my first robe and other vestments from shade silks I had gathered while hunting.  After I had made more progress, my days and nights were spent in Kurn's Tower hunting the terrible undead, meeting those of many races and getting my first taste of real arcane power.  Then later, once I learned the spell of invisibility, my dangerous journey to the Temple of Droga to secretly meet with a human historian on the ways of goblins.  I also learned to cook fish rolls!<br>
<br>
Recently I met up with Komaru for the first time since the revalations made to me by Grandmother Wordbinder.  Our reunion led us to a tall tower along the banks of Lake Rathetear to gather a component from the undead inhabitants.  This particular component, a rod of bone, would allow me to complete a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro for a staff of vast arcane lore and power for wizards, the Staff of Temperate Flux.  We were successful as Komaru was strong and savvy in battle.  I later was granted my staff by the temple.  <br>
<br>
During our time together I did notice that Komaru was indeed changed just as my uncle had warned.  She recognized me but her eyes were hollow and somewhat pained, as if her mind were distantly occupied by some terrible fear.  I thought to broach the subject of the curse by the god of fear, but my better nature and sensitivity to her obvious pain withheld my tongue.  After seeing her I don't know if I believe all of what Eliezar said, but Komaru was clearly in torment and I can only pray that at least her torment ends soon.  If I can help her to overcome her demons someday I will. <br>
<br>
As for recent news, I am currently staying in High Keep, having rented a suite on the third floor.  I have made a kind of homebase out of this place, where I now am writing this first journal entry.  Many travelers gather in this place to hunt the Pickclaw clan of goblins that reside in the basement and underground levels of the Keep.  I have joined them on many a hunt and have met some of the nicest people of my travels so far.  Yasyne, a drow enchantress, has captured my attentions with her strong magical talents and wily cunning.  She has even taught me some words of her native tongue.  Also many knights and other magic-wielders I have had the pleasure to know: Cambridge, Jordh, Trotwood, and many others whom I hope to continue to hunt with in future days.  <br>
<br>
I recently learned of the deep corruption of the guards of this keep and their desire not to seek good but for only their own fortunes and ends.  For this reason I joined with others in hunting the guards of this keep secretly to prevent the knowledge from becoming too widespread among the more powerful leaders of the guards.  Last night I took my first tries at them solo but I was met with both defeat and victory after many risky attempts.  The security forces of High Pass and Kigh Keep have always seemed wary but they are now even more wary and suspicious, lately refusing to even have an open conversation.  I fear that soon they will declare me an enemy of the keep, and that would make trying to stay here and hunt more risky than I'd like.  If this continues to its logical end, it will soon be time for me to seek other hunting grounds.<br>
<br>
That is all I have to say for now.  Its time for sleep.<br>

<br>
Well, my time in High Keep has finally come to a close.  On my way out of the castle, my suspicions were confirmed when I was confronted by a guard who wanted me to come with him for questioning.  <br>
<br>
Knowing that if I went with him, I would end up in the keep for alot longer than I would want, I attacked him when he laid his hand on my shoulder.  He wasn't very difficult to bring down, but unfortunately the assault happened in open view of other guards.  Fortunately most of them were busy with other adventurers for whom they held similar disdain.  I took my chance to escape and gated out to the moon of Luclin.<br>
<br>
Having no plans, I inquired of other adventurers of places where someone like myself might find fame and fortune.  I ended up going to the karanas, The Plains of South Karana to be specific, and accompanied some others to the lair of the Splitpaw Clan of gnolls.  Both within and outside of this dungeon I grouped and also soloed gnolls for three days.  During this time I was staying in Shadowhaven, at an inn.<br>
<br>
My grandmother then let me know of a job that I might be interested in within the Palace of Erudin.  Since I was not otherwise occupied, I took the position.  It paid room and board, with a room for me right in the city offices!  My assignment was to gather information about the kobolds in the Warrens, collecting their armor and weapons to assess their threat to the city.<br>
<br>
Having been to the kobold warrens briefly before, I knew very well about their abilities, and that they were no threat to my beloved city.  I had put aside my dislike for stupid beaurocratic assignments to have the chance to be home for a while after my extended absence.  Anyway, there may be others around the city and region who I can actually help now that I have some more worldly experience.<br>
<br>
Still, I found it easy to make time for adventuring in far off places, especially with my new-found abilities to port myself.  I still visited and hunted in the karanas a bit and, most recently, in the crystal caverns, which contains an entire dwarven city in Velious.  I bound myself in my bedroom so I came and went without being noticed.  And I made sure and visited the Warrens once in a while to be able to report on some things.<br>
<br>
My job is now on a brief break, for citywide celebrations of the birth of Al'Kabor the great wizard.  Rather than join in, I chose to spend my time off on further exploration of the karanas.  I located a deep gorge that connects to the Eastern Plains of Karana.  In this gorge I have found a haven for some creatures I can only describe as 'evil eyes.'  Hunting them has been profitable since they usually carry unusual gems.  They have many abilities but they present little challenge to me.  <br>
<br>
I have heard that there is a goblin city not far which I may choose to explore next.  But I like this place.  I am, in fact, writing this entry from my camp in the evil eye gorge, where I will be hunting for the remainder of my break.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moredenwordbinder>Moreden Wordbinder</A> at: 6/8/03 3:40 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.showPrevMessage?topicID=64.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.showNextMessage?topicID=64.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.emailToFriend?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.threadControl?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42>Tales & Accomplishments</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
