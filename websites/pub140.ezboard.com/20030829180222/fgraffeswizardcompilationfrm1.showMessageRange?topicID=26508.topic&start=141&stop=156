What the hell was I supposed to take from that statement?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I said by your logic, Illusion: Iksar must be too hard to get for the level because its so critical that it doesn't fizzle which is your entire argument for why Concussion is too hard to get for a level 39 spell.

Illusion:Iksar, while challenging, is not of a similar ratio in difficulty to the Concussion quest.<br>

<br>
<br>
So by &quot;the same time&quot; you actually meant &quot;two weeks apart&quot; then. OK. See, I said &quot;significantly apart&quot; which meant &quot;a separate time period of subjective time.&quot; I thought it was longer than 2 weeks but then, at the rate of patches at that time it probably FELT longer than 2 weeks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
May 25-June 3 = 9 days. This is not a significant amount of time when we're talking about balance adjustments in Everquest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:They didn't make it fizzle a lot. That's the standard fizzle rating for any non-evocation wizard spell before level 50, which is easily dealt with by being above that level, which has the added function of making the spell easier to channel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know they didn't, that's my entire point. But you were making the argument that it had a higher fizzle rate than Atols (a well-known, notoriously high fizzle rate spell). The conclusion is obvious: the number makes it fizzle more. That makes your entire argument blow up, yet again, since they wouldn't make it fizzle extra then make it harder to get just so you wouldn't fizzle it as much.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Look at the spdat's again. And Atol's doesn't fizzle nearly as much now as it did before the past year.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:Um, no, exactly wrong. Higher means more fizzles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree that makes logical sense. But Atols has a lower number and fizzles MUCH more than spells of the same level with higher fizzle numbers. QED.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It may have before, but it doesn't now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>    Quote:The magician epic quest results in a no-drop spell scroll, which has to be scribed to be used. It is a level 46 spell, but it summons an item which cannot be used to summon the epic pet until level 50. I would think that would be clear evidence that the spell was intended for higher levels than can actually scribe it. This is not an AA skill, this is a quest spell with a scroll you must scribe. How is this different from Concussion? Now you're just making up reasons not to see what's plain as day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, your argument is regarding higher level for fizzle rates, which has zero application here. Second, the epic is given an arbitrary level, since you cannot begin your epic quest at level 46. Thus, it is simliar to the AA skills, which were just assigned a level.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The same way you can't begin the Concussion quest at level 39? Look, there are mages now who have gotten their epic at level 46. Read the damn <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=4356&amp;sid=1c31d36acba5e4bd2f4e9d75253ccf1c">post</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> I linked before. And read what I posted it in answer to.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>-If it were a case of it actually mattering, and the spell was deemed so important that you should get it only many levels after 39, why isn't that true of any other spell that is useful?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It is true of the mage epic. &gt;&lt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote: Um, no. Here, the patch message from January 23, 2002 in which Atol's casting difficulty was reduced (the second time this happened btw, oh ye of short memory), the January 8 2002 spdat, and the January 23 2002 spdat.<br>
Open them both up with EqCaster v5.2.4 (later versions don't understand the old spdat format), see that the &quot;Fizzle Percent&quot; was changed from 15 to 5, and eat your words.<br>
<br>
We all remember the fizzle rate got lower, but it STILL fizzles much more than other spells which list at a higher fizzle number - so we can't exactly learn anything from this can we? There's either something else involved that isn't showing up, or the numbers aren't as simple as you are saying.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I challenge you to prove this. Ockham's Razor, and all that. I think Abscond fizzles more than Atol's personally, and Atol's reputation was largely gained before its last casting difficulty adjustment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Either way the argument stands: the spell wasn't made a level 39 spell and quested at 50+ just to keep you from fizzling as much. Jolt would have been too if that were the case.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Except Jolt is for rangers, who have different casting mechanics, and Jolt is a vendor-bought spell. Risk/reward, and all that. For having to do the quest, we get a better spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:It just doesn't work that way. According to what was written, a wizard with 90 int and maxed skills would never fizzle above the 5% minimum, and this behavior is not borne out in practice. Face it, it's outdated info.<br>
<br>
Or the system isn't as simple as LUCY is giving you information about. Which is more likely, given the evidence? That spells don't have a minimum 5% fizzle rate any more or the fizzle information in Lucy is incomplete? You decide.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Then either way, what GZ said does not apply. And I would doubt you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>long</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> before I doubt the spdat file. Ockham's Razor again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:Um, wrong again. All the level 39-49 nuke spells have lower fizzle ratings, and always have, because at the time you didn't go above 50 to get the level-based fizzle deduction. The level 34 nuke has a fizzle adjust of 25, the level 39 nuke 15, the level 44 nukes 5, and the level 49 nukes 0. A fizzle adjustment of 25 seems to take 15 levels to disappear.<br>
<br>
Nice of you to say so but unfortunately we didn't have fizzle rate info back when this was written, who knows? Further, I was referring to higher fizzle rates, not lower - and there weren't any higher ones then.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
We did! The fizzle adjust field has always been there since original release back in 1999 (tho it was early on misinterpreted as a resistance adjust). And you claim that lower numbers in this field mean higher fizzles, when level 39-49 nukes have always had the lower numbers. This would be inconsistent with what GZ said, so ergo, your interpretation must be wrong, capisce?<br>
<br>
Ah, reading the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=591">article</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> again, each point of Int does not correspond to a % reduction. Also, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=35&amp;source=Live">Bind Affinity</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> was used as an example of a spell with a normal fizzle rating, and it has a fizzle adjust of 25. No spells with a higher numerical value exist, except for joke spells like Wizard Mastery, and spells like <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=659&amp;source=Live">Conflagration</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> have had a fizzle adjust of 5 since 1999.<br>
<br>
<br>

Which historical fact would that be you keep referring to? I've demonstrated over and over what is the truth here, I'm sure people are laughing their heads off over this by now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hm, the fact that higher level spells get a channeling and fizzle bonus? The fact that Kunark quest spells have a wide variety of levels? The fact that GZ said things that are no longer true?

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What's your position again?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That the fact that Concussion is level 39 is a bonus and not a curse? That if you wanted the quest to match the spell level, it would be level 51?<br>

I assume you are talking about canni II and no, it doesn't.  The crushed dread diamond is now the easiest part of the quest as its a ground spawn in TD.<br>

Oh, yes, the quest can still be done without Gflux, but warping him down or using the drape holder are two methods I consider a borderline exploit.  I'd rather them fix it where a reaver raid is not required to do this legitimately.    <br>
<br>
The problem I have now is the zone is completely empty nowadays unless someone is doing reavers and its like pulling teeth to drag guildmates to the zone.   <br>

<br>
I tried to pull him and do a turn in using the sneak trick instead of a charmer, so I could MQ with some guild wizards who play at awkward times; but sadly rogue sneak and undead don't always work the way you'd expect.<br>
<br>
It's worth it, though, to watch the human skeleton wander back to his spawn point, stopping occasionally to bestow *wizard buffs* on his comrads.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

As for the spell make time walls ermmmm &quot;taller&quot; comes to mind, or add that invisible wall effect on them so that you cant bounce over. I mean who didnt think Invert Grav when they saw a ss of the door? I take it that is they only thing that was getting exploited to the point of changing the spell (I say exploited currently, we all remember sseru and VT fluxes). now how were those other 2 events fixed..... could a simmilar fix work here..... <br>

<br>
Absor:  You wake to find yourself in a cramped, dark cell.  A dim light shines down on you from high, high above... it appears as though a window rests 50 feet up the wall.  You also notice the cell door appears to be of very low quality, with a well-armored ogre guard sleeping outside.  What do you do?<br>
<br>
Joe_Player:  Hmmmm.  Quite a predicament.  Time to cast KNOCK ON THE CELL DOOR!<br>
<br>
Absor:  I'm sorry, that spell does not work here.<br>
<br>
Joe_Player:  Erm, okay.  How about if I LEVITATE UP TO THAT WINDOW, and to FREEEEEEEDOM!?<br>
<br>
Absor:  I'm sorry, that spell does not work here.<br>
<br>
Joe_Player:  What the...?  Aha!  I know.  Time to cast CHARM on the SLEEPING OGRE GUARD!<br>
<br>
Absor:  Your target looks unaffected.<br>
<br>
Joe_Player:  Dammit.  Okay, I shout level 4 thief-mage looking for group.<br>
<br>
Absor:  You recieve no responses to your shout.  Additionally, it appears as though the &quot;frenzied ogre guard&quot; camp is taken.<br>
<br>
Joe_Player:  ...I'm going home.<br>
<br>
&lt;Door slam&gt;<br>
<br>
Absor:  &lt;Shouts&gt;  Thank you for playing EverQuest! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyron>Kyron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/25/03 9:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grimstaff puts his foot in it again</span><hr size=1> LOL <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fqubedf3povar>FqubedF3povar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/26/03 8:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grimstaff puts his foot in it again</span><hr size=1> Be more along the lines of &quot;that spell has been removed from D&amp;D due to incongruances with game material set up, you still have it scribed but it wont do anything other than wake the oger guard and have him barge in all mad&quot;......<br>
<br>
 But then again how much of this is &quot;shooting the messenger&quot; and how much is it really hitting on target, i mean Absor did you suggest inv and flux to get changed..... <br>

This whole Concussion spell quest just stinks!<br>
<br>
Level 50 Wizard, true new player BTW, been playing casually for 8 - 9 months I think.<br>
<br>
Third try with guild help to get to &quot;a human skeleton&quot; in CoM.<br>
Just getting into the right courtyard temple area then up onto walkway is a MAJOR hassle without some help.  Then the pleasure of not having the quest mob ever up.   Friggin placeholder after placeholder.  And yes I am SURE I had the right spawn point.  65 Arcanist in my guild was the one pulling.  He's done this quest several other times.  Never has this many placeholders spawned and NO FRIGGIN SKELETON.  <br>
<br>
Here's hoping SOE stealth moved him recently.  But I doubt it.   <br>
<br>
GRRRR!  Did I say this quest SUCKS?!?<br>
<br>
This quest is just too DAMN hard at my level, and I am ELEVEN levels above where you should be able to do it according to SOE.  Go figure. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nonyobidness>Nonyo Bidness</A> at: 5/26/03 9:34:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fqubedf3povar>FqubedF3povar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/26/03 12:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grimstaff puts his foot in it again</span><hr size=1> Bad luck, just wait and in about 5 lvls you can complain about PhishPhase never having your staff..... <br>
<br>
As for being a true new player that has nothing to do with youc capability, friend with a VERY (300k) twinked bard had a hard time doing it the normal way (ended up AE training everything and hoping the door opened on him. Meanwhile I hit F1 and /cast invert gravety..... poof your target resisted your invert gravety spell hehe did it a few more times then you pop up there staff the skele (bard trak was suddenly usefull) jump down and bard can train everything down charm it and keep the train moveing turn in and nexus portal out. <br>
<br>
Thats how it used to work, now you have to get him on some sort of aggro, oh well keep at it its worth it.<br>
