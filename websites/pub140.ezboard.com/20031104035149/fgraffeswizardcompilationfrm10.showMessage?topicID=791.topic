The design of the archtype toward groupability and the other is the perception of that class by other players.  Also important to consider is the difference of guild grouping for experience and pickup grouping for experience.  <br>
<br>
My opinion is that the classes are designed and balanced rather well.  Not perfectly, but considering the enormity of the task, they have done a down right spiffy job.<br>
<br>
However, here is a quandry, many people (mostly non-wizards, but also a few wizards have expeseed this opinion) do not readily see the advantages of grouping with wizards.  <br>
<br>
They can see the advantage of warriors, monks, paladins, shadowknights, rogues, and rangers because they are next to the MOB swinging weapons.  <br>
<br>
They can see the advantage of clerics, shaman, and also druids because they can heal and buff the people swinging weapons that are hurting the MOB.<br>
<br>
They can see the advantage of necromancers, beastlords, and mages from their pets and other sundry effects like splurt, damage shields, twitch, and summoned items.<br>
<br>
They can see the advantage of enchanters from clarity, haste, and mezzing.<br>
<br>
There are of course overlapping areas where people can see each class at work.  One issue with wizards is it is very difficult to easily see the impact of a wizard in a group.  Many people have pointed this out in the past.  Other than Invis, see invis, levitate the wizard does not get much in the way of 'observable' effects.<br>
<br>
There are innate crits, but these serve more to remind other players how much damage we can do.  They are, however, too rare to be considered essential.  (note: just referencing innate crits as other casting classes can get AA crits).<br>
<br>
There is Spellshield.  More of a raid-type buff, so seldom used and often never asked for in a group setting.<br>
<br>
There is the O'Keil's line of damage shields.  A two, three, and five point shield where you can stack to get up to an eight point shield.  Also has a increase in fire resistance.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge, those are the 'experience getting effects' that we possess.  Add to that the 'experience saving effect' of Evacuation, however, some people have the notion that once you evac the group is done fighting.  We also have ports and TL's (not experience getting effects, per se, just gets you to and from the fighting faster).<br>
<br>
<br>
Many people on Graffe's have suggested means by which to make the wizard more 'group friendly'.  I submit that we only need to have the perception of being group friendly and that we already do well in group setting (they just don't know it).<br>
<br>
General suggestions that I have heard from other people include:<br>
<br>
- A bonus for having a grouped wizard (increase in mana regen for example).<br>
<br>
- Various buffs (though many don't want to be buffers)<br>
<br>
- A pet (though many do not want a pet. Note that there is Xuzl)<br>
<br>
- Show spell damage<br>
<br>
<br>
So what to we do to improve our perception?  What can be added or modified by Verant to improve our perception?<br>
<br>
One suggestion I would like to pose, is adding form of Haste component as either a modification to an exisiting spell line (O'Keils is seldom used, maybe 4, 7, and 10% added to existed line) or as a clicky item (maybe an AE haste buff of maybe 10% with short duration, quested would be nice and allow a wizard to chose to become group friendly).  <br>
Why do I suggest this?  Melee types like haste and as much as they can get.  If they can get Haste from a wizard that stacks (might be a key point there: stacks) with other forms of haste, even if its small it will be a welcomed addition and, hence, perception improved.<br>
<br>
So as to not derail this thread with a suggestion, I pose again:  How do we improve the preception of the wizard as a group desireable class?<br>

There are obviously specialized situations where w izard vastly outperforms a druid in groups, like an AE group.<br>
<br>
I expect wizards to have the best short-term DPS in the game, that is, when a mobs has to die fast, a wizard is your man, if he's oom afterwards, that's okay, all he needs is a pittance of mana to succor to zone.  Like say when you get adds so you need to kill the first mob faster. <br>

Many stories have come about guild/group members not realizing how good a role the wizard plays in a group.  Don't recall the actual names of those that posted them, but:<br>
<br>
- Wizard arrives late for a Hate raid.  Keeps saying he needs a group.  Finally kill steals the exp on next two pulls before everyone wants him in their group.<br>
<br>
- Wizard in an exp group is rolling along.  One person states they could kill faster with another melee.  Wizards sits out next couple kills to show how much slower kills get without her help.<br>
<br>
-  Wizard shouts they are looking for a group and are told to go quad.<br>
<br>
-- and other stories continue to be posted on Graffe.  Are their that few wizards who can show groups that they are effective?  I do think that if they knew how effective a good wizard is (as it currently stands with no further fiddling from VI) that people would not think twice about looking for a wizard.  <br>
<br>
I feel this does matter.  From reading other peoples posts I feel it does matter.  Of those who do not have this problem, from what I have noticed, are those with regular guild groups that do exp session.  Those that I have noticed that in general have a problem getting groups are the casual player that logs on for a couple hours to get some exp.   <br>
<br>
I'm not certain why you dismiss perception of the class by other players so out of hand.  <br>
<br>
Add: Madai, if you don't know the person, isn't the only thing you have to judge them by is there class?<br>

Grim, this is not flawed nor an error. The reason why Wizards have problems getting groups is that the other classes that make up a group don't percieve us as much help to them.<br>
The fact that you don't see this is just further proving this posters thoughts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Wizards need some basic minor work done, and when its done, the perception will follow or it won't, but the work should be done either way.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Grim, I agree that we need some work done, but obviously they aren't going to do what you've said should be done, or they would have done it already. Obviously either your assumptions about a wizard fix is wrong, or SOE has been ignoring your posts for the past 3 years.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As a druid, I tend to fall into the same role as a wizard in most groups, so I tend not to group with wizards very often.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sorry Madai, you don't fall into the same role as a wizard. You share some of the same roles, but you also share many of the roles of a shaman as well. You luckily have a choice which role you wish to play, whereas a wizard does not. We either do damage, or we don't. We have no secondary roles to offer to groups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I expect wizards to have the best short-term DPS in the game, that is, when a mobs has to die fast, a wizard is your man, if he's oom afterwards, that's okay, all he needs is a pittance of mana to succor to zone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, it's not ok. This is one of our biggest problems. Why would a group want a wizard around <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>just in case</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> something needs to die fast? It's just like saying a group would want a wizard around <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>just in case</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> they need an evac. The truth is, they don't expect those situations to come up, and for the most part they don't come up. <br>
Sure it's nice to have those things, but, as you said, a Druid can fill the role of the wizard for direct damage, along with adding a buffer and healer, as well as evacs and ports.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Like say when you get adds so you need to kill the first mob faster.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This happens very infrequently in a good group. If there is an expectation of this happening, a group will add an enchanter or a bard to the group before they'll add a wizard, because they're designed to handle these situations.<br>
Yes, wizards can nuke down mobs fast, but the point is, most groups would rather have an enchanter around for their buffs and crowd control, rather than gain the ability to nuke a mob down fast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In a steadier, less burtsy situation, a melee or healer would be prefered.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup. That's our problem. &quot;Burstier&quot; situations don't happen all that offen, so a melee or a healer is always prefered.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In general, it's more about the person than the class anyway for getting groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup, I agree with this too. One of the wizards biggest problems is that other classes observe us as a great solo class, and most wizards solo alot. When we do go looking for a group, the group members think to themselves &quot;Hey, he can solo, we can't, so lets let him do his thing, and we'll get a class that can actually benefit the group more than just adding damage&quot;.<br>
Trust me on this, I also play a warrior and a bard. Everytime a wizard comes to a group I'm in, I tell the group about how much faster we'll be able to kill stuff. They don't see it. They see a class that sits on their ass 50% of the time, and they see a class that can't give them anything in the way of buffs. That's why most wizards that get turned down for group slots get turned down.<br>
<br>
Fixing wizards in group situations is going to be very tricky, because like I've said, they don't want buffs, and they don't want pets. For the most part they only want to do more damage, which is a problem, because more damage would allow them to solo and raid better, which isn't a problem. <br>
SOE won't make us better soloers, and they won't make us better raiders, so more damage or better mana ratios is all but out of the question.<br>
<br>
Once people realize that SOE isn't going to change what they want changed, maybe we can move on past these discussions and get to some with ideas that SOE might actually consider. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jarnin Fisheermann</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

You missed a word, go read again and edit if you care to or respond by reading the word &quot;EXCLUSIVE&quot; to my quote.<br>
<br>
Obviously the reason Wizards don't get groups is because groups don't see Wizards as being worth putting in a group.  This is a perception problem.  However, his entire argument is predicated on the notion that the ONLY problem is that people think Wizards aren't very good for groups, not that they ACTUALLY have problems that make them not as good for groups.  Thus, he believes the exclusive problem is perception and rejects the notion that there are actual problems leading TO this perception.<br>
<br>
The fact that some people are able to give anecdotes where Wizards rox0r doesn't really change anything.  Rogues used to save the day by being there when they sucked long hard logs (and had kick and taunt, but not sneak/hide, evade, nor poisons, plus backstabs had no minimum damage, was much less, etc etc).  That didn't mean Rogues needed no work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2522<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/4/02 5:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perception of the Wizards groupability.</span><hr size=1> I missed no word.

I started this thread to address the problem of perception of the wizard class (second sentence).  I believe that there are not huge issues to be resolved, however, by saying &quot;Not perfectly&quot; (First sentence) implies that there are still kinks to be worked out.<br>
<br>
Where I guess I disagree with you is that simply by adjusting mana/damage ratios will 'fix' us so that people may have to think &quot;do we want a wizard or this other class?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll ask you directly: How do you feel wizards are percieved when all another person has to go on is the class name 'Wizard'?<br>

I can't see the need for wierd radical additions to the class when just making us BE WIZARDS and be what we were clearly designed to be and intended to be before Verant messed things up with release.<br>

<br>
<br>
since i been 60 i been in groups that dont want  sk/palies/rangers/druids/mages/necros.  but i swear this is true.  i never been in a group that didnt want a wizard unless it just didnt work.  if they had 3 chain classes a shaman and cleric and desperatly needed a plate tank.   then maybe.  but in a well rounded group of 5 classes that could already get the job done.  i seen druids get turned down.  mages get turned down. sks get turned down.   palies get turned down.  rangers get turned down. and necros get turned down.  BUT NEVER rogues and wizards.  ive never seen anyone question the usefulness of a wizard.   Cept maybe peeps that group primairly with primal rogues.  those guys can be rather snotty.  no really.   I was in a planks groups where the tank wouldnt let us add anything *but* a primal rogue to replace me.  How bout him i would say and get no response or a no.  How bout him i would say again.  nope.  Had to be a primal rogue.  <br>
<br>
im arguing against change.  <br>
<br>
PArt of me remembers when we all turned 51.  everyone i know that turned 51 as predominatly the highest level person they knew +- a couple of levels swore that nobody wanted to group with there class.  Even i thought that.  i was sure nobody wanted to group witha  51 rogue because a 53 rogue was so much more damaging.  I made excuses, however, how that didnt apply to a druid.  Oddly though almost everyone i know did the same thing for their class.   Druid i knew told me how much easier i had it.  the tank told us how much easier we had it.  we told the tank how much easier he had it.<br>
<br>
but all and all the lesson i really learned was sometimes its just fricken hard to find a group.  Thats something i still experience.  Im a rogue im so desirable la~  i didnt just spend 4 hours looking for a decent exp group?  oh ya i did.   Ever pass a group of 3 exping and go hey i bet i could help them get more exp?  ya me too! ever ask them and get turned down?  YA ME TOO. ALOT! Im a rogue im so desirable la~  Of course i could make up things bout how nobody sees how damn good this class is but i know someone out there would slap me to my senses.   <br>
<br>
Groups just arnt there sometimes. I dont think wizards suffer from a specially acute case of &quot;cant get groupage&quot;.  i might actually listen to mages,druids, and necros  all of which my pick up groups this weekend turned down as the 6th person. (oh and dont let me tell you how many times i had to *FIGHT* to get my good druid friend into a group of equal level)  but not the wizard we scooped those up every change we could this weekend.  thats just and ancedotal topper.<br>

It's all classes for the most part. I think that SOE seriously need to rethink their grouping bonuses when it comes to all classes, not just Wizards.<br>
<br>
I commonly group with an Enchanter and Cleric. Many times we'll have a fourth from our guild, but if someone in the zone is looking for a group, none of my party wants to invite them. Why? Well, the chanter usually runs the group. His normal response is &quot;we don't need them&quot;, or &quot;we'll be fine without them&quot;. Most the time he's right, but what he fails to see is what could be done if we did invite those people to our groups. I've often got into it with him because too often he thinks we can do everything ourselves.<br>
<br>
The point is, it's not just our class that has problems grouping, but it is our class that doesn't offer much to groups in the long run. It would seem that rogues also fall into this catagory, considering they're commonly the major damage dealer in a group.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think SOE needs to up the group bonuses to exp gained per member. Another thing they might do is copy a method from a newer game called Earth &amp; Beyond.<br>
When you group in E&amp;B, each class offers a &quot;buff&quot; and additional bonuses on exp gain. For intance, grouping the wizard-like Jenquai Explorer grants all in the group a 5% gain in reactor regeneration. If you were to translate that into EQ, it'd be like 5% additional mana regeneration for each party member, including the wizard.<br>
These are buffs that instantly appear as soon as the members for a group, and do not need to be activated. The neat thing is, the &quot;buffs&quot; stack with more of the same class, but has deminishing returns for each of the same class in the group. For instance, if you have one Wizard, the group would gain 5% mana regen, add another, and you get 9%. Add another, and you get 12%. Add another and you get 14%. ONe more and it caps at 15% for a full group.<br>
<br>
I'll do a write up of this and start a new thread. Perhaps people at SOE will stop by and give it a read. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dlaren4444>dlaren4444</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 324<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/5/02 7:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Perceptions</span><hr size=1>  Part of this is because..........Grimstaff ~is~ correct-- under 60 we ARE under-powered. Wizards need upgrades below 60 (especially at levels 39, 44 and 59). And at 60, we need our spells not to be so rare. The rarity of Markar's discord, Flaming sword and Sunstrike ~should~ be an embarrassment to VI. (To be fair, this was addressed and fixed in PoP for our 61-64 spells) {And Markars is now more readily available}<br>
<br>
 Fixes: VI should make more caster ONLY gear, replacing melee drops. Melee equipment shoud be replaced on the loot tables with caster gear and spells. Plane of Fear should have a few AWESOME but rare wis caster items added. Whilst Plane of Hate should have a few AWESOME but rare int caster items added...... <br>
<br>
 Class defineing spells should not be rare. Awesome class defining spells ~should~ be rare.<br>
<br>
 I find it significant that I am asked for duplicate spells by the DRUID name of them (90% of the time, rather than the Wizard name) BECAUSE DRUIDS ARE SOOOOO  MORE Group friendly below 60. (And they get grouped over wizards BECAUSE VI has made them an OVER-powered class) The &quot;bitter&quot; druids do not want us to think that they are GROSSLY over-powered at 1-59. They only want us to pity them for their so-called lack of raiding power........ the &quot;bitter&quot; druids being incapable of adjusting to the raid level game whilst COMPETENT druids can.......<br>

<br>
I do agree that as Verant pushes more and more to get an exclusive 'group game' that rewards for being in a group and a reason for the average class to be invited to a group.<br>
<br>
In a full group of 6 and being the only wizard, I have had people openly question the need for 'a wizard' when they could get 'another damage dealer'.  Is this type of comment a function of someone who doesn't know the game?  Someone who doesn't know the wizard class?  Or someone who has a pre-disposed disposition on what an ideal group is?<br>
<br>
Does the perception of the wizard by other classes need to improved/altered?<br>

I just looked at a post on my server's board asking what they thought good group combo's for PoP were. Here are their recomendations, with a few left out that were jokes. Note that NOT ONCE are wizards mentioned, and only one person even left a spot we could possibly fill with the generic &quot;damage class (caster or melee).&quot; I think this is a fair sampling of other player's attitudes towards our class in general. We are not even considered, unless they are friends with you specifically and invite you out of pity or simply for your winning personality, while other classes are invited for their abilities.<br>

<br>
I hear this all the time in different circumstances.<br>
<br>
We get a few adds and we dont have a mezzer so i start to CC the mobs with roots and snare.<br>
<br>
Just finished burning down several mobs in succession and oom for the last.<br>
<br>
Ive heard this from several people in my guild sometimes more than once from the same person, and some i group with quite regularly. <br>
<br>
&quot;This mob sure is taking a long time to kill? Something healing it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dont think my haste is working&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The hp on this one must be really high&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This one must be a higher lvl mob&quot;<br>
<br>
And everytime i respond with &quot;im not nuking atm becuase of (oom, cc, etc.)&quot;<br>
<br>
there response almost everytime &quot;ohh&quot;<br>
<br>
Melee in particular never see what a wizard does becuase they have to focus on the mob. The only time we really get recognition is when theyre in the exp group on a raid, or they see the high damage crit that we might land every 10 nukes. <p> not allowed<br>

<br>
&quot;Actually, it's not ok. This is one of our biggest problems. Why would a group want a wizard around just in case something needs to die fast?&quot;<br>
Many exp areas have a variety of mobs.  Some mobs are weaker than others.  For the weak mobs where the cleric only have to heal the MT once, if that, during the battle, the wizard will nuke just enough so that they won't be totally FM before the mob is ready to die.  For a mob that can hit harder, and has more hit points, this mob needs to be taken out faster.  The &quot;named&quot; in the area.  So in normal grouping situations, yes, some mobs need to die faster.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just like saying a group would want a wizard around just in case they need an evac.&quot;<br>
People have to explore new area some time.  if you're not exploring with a druid or wizard, explore with a necro :P<br>
<br>
&quot;The truth is, they don't expect those situations to come up, and for the most part they don't come up.&quot;<br>
True, the need to evac is rare.  But one of the reasons I love my druid is I never have no choice but to die because the puller got stupid or the chanter went afk.  And I occaisionly play my friend's bard, and there've been quited a few times where I would've appreciated an evac to save the bard from my depredations on his exp bar.<br>

<br>
you can see a rogue backstabbing. hes standing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> doing it, his avatar is always swining his arms, always active. <br>
anyone can turn on others hits, log, and know just how much damage most rogues are doing.<br>
<br>
you cannot readily see the contribution an offensive caster makes. he sits down most of the time, and casts only a handful of times.<br>
you cannot log the total damage a casters spells cause, as there is no option to hear them.<br>
<br>
these double standards quite obviously do have signifigant implications on the subconcious of the average player, which is evident in their preferred choice of group member. <br>
<br>
i do think others spell damage should be hearable, and that it would not only solve alot of misconceptions about offensive casters, but also make gauging and identifing actual balance problems easier. <br>
<br>
remember when crits first came into the game? the collective respect for wizards as a potent offensive force went up like 10 fold after that. if people could actually see the rest of the nukes, that respect is bound to only increase.<br>
<br>
just my opinion though ;P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=damoens>Damoen S</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/6/02 11:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE:</span><hr size=1> Yes we all know once we hit level &quot;X&quot; we will have hit the promise land, and we all will be able to find groups.  Well X used to be defined as level 49, then defined as level 60.  Now I am sure it will be defined as level 65.  YAWN!  That is an argument that is so old it should be dead.<br>
<br>
The only reason wizards do not have a problem finding groups at those times is because those are the levels of our &quot;End all be all&quot; nukes.  At the &quot;last&quot; level our Nukes are guaged against the mobs of that expansion and found to be a most effective way to kill mobs.<br>
<br>
The levels leading up to the &quot;last&quot; level we are given sub-par nukes for NORMAL fighting situations.  But once all the loot has been found, the best exp locations mapped out and all the bosses have had tactical essays written.  Wizards lose all grouping ablity because it changes from a game of raids and exploration to a game of grinding and endurance.  <br>
<br>
The way to get wizards into groups more in my opinion is with large nukes and more mana regen.  Give wizzards at 55 a 1300 damage nuke with the SAME effiency as other spells that level.  And increase wizard innate mana regen.  And at level 63 there should be a 2000 damage nuke with the same effiency as other spells that level.<br>
<br>
The way I view wizards is large amounts of damage fast, BUT still should able to keep up with ALL other damage dealling classes in the long run.  If we can not do this why should any group want a wizard six months after an expansion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frodlin7th>Frodlin7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/11/02 1:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> This whole thing is crazy....<br>

I have an open DPS spot in my group.... I'm taking the first person who can help kill things faster who responds.  I don't give a WHIT about mathematical efficiency, mana/dmg, yadda yadda... I want someone else in my group to help me kill stuff faster so I get more experience.  Wiz/Mage/Rogue are my top choices, Ranger comes in right after.   Seriously, if you're quick to respond and get to where the group is, you get the spot, no ifs ands or butts.   I want to kill stuff NOW, I dont' want to wait around and hold a spot for someone else, I want to get experience NOW.   Forget your little diagrams of &quot;balanced groups&quot;, if I can get a person to heal me, I'll take any other 4 people, we'll figure out how to go from there.   <br>

PoP is all about Dps. Sure it brings the holy trinity back but with wizard in group it makes some serious difference.
