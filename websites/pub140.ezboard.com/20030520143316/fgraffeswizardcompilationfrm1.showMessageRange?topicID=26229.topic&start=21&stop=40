The put the zone back how it was, so no point in checking is there. There were some problems with the pogs before and they took them out, and they have now apparently fixed them and put them back. Bitching about it is kind of silly as it is an easy zone even with them there. It will not stop a group of casual players from going in and killing stuff, because even before Luclin came out casual players were going in and killing stuff. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Pretty much every mob outside of PoP is signifigantly easier than it was in it's respective expansion.  They're making the game easier, not harder.<br>

Oh, and FYI VI has been gone for a very long time.  Infact, some of the most positive game changes were made after the SoE team took over.<br>

Oh and PoG = raid zone.  Do you EXP in PoFear?  PoHate?  PoSky?  No?  Exactly.  Even now it's not impossible to EXP there as the protectors aren't THAT hard.<br>

<br>
It's not that I don't sympathize with casual gamers, I do.  It's that casual gamers should have figured out by now that Everquest is not a game for them.<br>
<br>
Simply put, the PoGs were removed because they were not behaving properly, as I understand it that is.  They have apparently taken their time in fixing them.  In that time people have grown accustomed to being able to do things that they otherwise would not have.  I say, tough luck, you should have known better than to get used to it.<br>

Yes, and 5 months ago most of the people in my guild didn't have AAskills, MGB, and had lots of Kunark armor. And on my very crowded server Kael is highly contested. We still don't have anyone with MGB. And I still wear one piece of crafted armor on my warrior.<br>

As this gentleman points out:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PoG was already much harder without PoGs than Kael imo, at least if you want armor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

PoG was a way for us to gear up, cause it is empty all the time, even on a FCFS server like Prexus. Two weeks ago we dropped Vindi, and we are not that interested in Growth any more. But it was an alternate route to Kael level armor for us, and now that option is taken away from other guilds.<br>

PoG may have once been a raid zone, but for some time now has been a place for soloers/small groups to farm.<br>
I don't visit the elemental planes, therefore I don't comment on them.  If you don't visit PoG, stick to what you know.<br>
I don't care to see this turn into a flame war, but it does piss me off to hear people talk about this when they don't know what the zone's about anymore.  <br>

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gameden.ca/EQ/PoG.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Yup checked.<br>
<br>
And before I get the 'OMG you are not a casual player', this was a community raid run by mostly casual players about 2 years ago back in Velious with a level average of about 54-55 (I was lower then 50 in that pic). While this one didn't go to well there were plenty other raids which went well, and done by 'casual players' of a much earlier era to boot. So unless people want to claim that the casual player of today sucks, then please stop with the 'OMG PoG is only for level 65's now'. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4356" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gameden.ca/EQ/sig2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/03 10:17:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26229.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whine over PoG</span><hr size=1> BPs in PoG are much more common than farming Kael all day long... <p><center><img src="http://people.ucsc.edu/~arice/pictures/zuratulisig.jpg"><br><b><font face="Comic Sans"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> --  I been stompin' in my air force ones for 65 levels.</b></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/03 10:24:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26229.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whine over PoG</span><hr size=1> They didn't nerf PoG, they returned it to earlier state after fixing something they broke temporarily.<br>

And an attempt to return it to even remotely challenging zone where small / casual guilds can practise raiding is a bad thing, how? Especially if it is empty most of time, which only should be cheered by casual people as they can then easily schedule a raid there from their busy RL and have content to raid. <br>

I know some of you people like to bash Sony/Verant/EQ but jesus christ do a little research into the history of PoG.<br>
<br>
The protectors are not that hard. If you don't like the game don't play.<br>

<br>
To keep people from soloing and small groups out?  News flash it goes on in PoP zones all the time.  <br>
<br>
For all the uber naysayers let me add another thing.  This is probably an incentive for many guild to not even try it.  Ever try to find a cleric to do PoG with?  Its damn near impossible because a majority of clerics (and a lot of druids and pallys) follow Tunare.  And in fact Paladins may not do it because there is a NPC for the paladin epic in Felwithe on Tunare faction.<br>
<br>
This pisses me off though.  Whenever I look for groups I always seee if there is a PoG group I can get in on.  I absolutely loved hunting there.  To me the mobs were powerful enough to act as a deterrant.  And one more thing.  This &quot;fix&quot; is probably going to kill the zone.  All of you uber naysayers will say I'm wrong.  Honestly though.  Will you want to go back knowing that all of the gear including godloot is now obsolete?  For you it isn't worth the effort.  For the low end people the PoGs will be a deterrant.  I wonder if anyone will want to go at all now?<br>
<br>
One last thing.  Ditch the damn &quot; I did it before PoP/Luclin/enter expansion here&quot; crap.  Despite what you might think there are people strugling to get close to where you were at that time.   <p>Baron Vladius Solarwind<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PoG is signifigantly easier than it was when people were doing it at the start and end of Velious.<br>
<br>
Pretty much every mob outside of PoP is signifigantly easier than it was in it's respective expansion. They're making the game easier, not harder.<br>
<br>
Oh, and FYI VI has been gone for a very long time. Infact, some of the most positive game changes were made after the SoE team took over.<br>
<br>
Oh and PoG = raid zone. Do you EXP in PoFear? PoHate? PoSky? No? Exactly. Even now it's not impossible to EXP there as the protectors aren't THAT hard.<br>
<br>
The only thing holding you back is your willingness to try. I don't want to get into the whole &quot;i walked 15 miles&quot; bullshit, but when we did Tormax / PoG / Velk / North we had no AA skills, no mass buffs, no &quot;uber&quot; buffs and were mostly in Kunark armor with Veeshan's Peak weapons. There was no such thing as Flowing Thought, focus items were not even conceived. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Easier how? Why would a 60+ guild and on top of that with AA's 'raid' PoG especially if they have kunark armor and VP weapons?Except for Tunare of course. <br>
PoG and Keal armor are for lev50-55ish guilds as it is now, perhaps up to 60 for really small or casual guilds and that wont change because of this patch either. It just means that even less will go there if they need 2 groups instead of 1 for BP/leg armor mobs now.<br>
If its a raid zone or not depends on what drops what, drop frequency etc imo. As it is now the drop rate is so low, except from mini bosses of course, that I cant see why any small guild would 'raid' PoG. And if this small guild can do everything except tunare they can do Vindi, HoT etc easy so why would they farm pog? Its pointless to argue about 'why' almost everyone do Keal instead of pog, it can be drop rates, it can be RvR, it can be because of faction, it can be that theres no zone out... Its because of something and thats why i hit repy. If PoGs have zone wide aggro again PoG is harder then it was last week. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taelenskychaser>Taelen Skychaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/03 12:06:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26229.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whine over PoG</span><hr size=1> Clearing PoG is enough of a royal pain in the ass without having to deal with the PoG's every what is it 22 minutes?<br>
<br>
The point is that some people are frustrated because they enjoyed PoG as an xp zone, a zone to make some pp, and to get some decent gear with a small force.  It had turned into more like the PoP zones where people could solo or duo and casual players and groups of a few friends could go.  Those people, those who don't have big guilds and time for big raids, but who play casually with a few friends, those kinds of people are upset, and I don't blame them.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the PoG's when we used to have to time them.  I hated them sometimes when we wiped and had to deal with them during CR's.  But they were a part of PoG.  But honestly, PoG was better without the PoG's chasing you down.<br>
<br>
There is a major major weakness in Everquest and that weakness is that it's very difficult to gear up at all if you play casually and with just a small group of friends.  If you are a hard-core player who raids all the time with a good-sized guild it's no problem, the game is made for you.  PoG was a place where the casual player could gear up with some decent gear, not great, but decent.  <br>
<br>
In my opinion there needs to be more quests in Everquest and more content that smaller groups can do to gear up.  Sure, a raid force of 30-40 should be able to get much better gear than a group of five, but there should be some longer quests that group of five can do to get some gear or some mobs they can kill.  PoG was such a place but with the change it is no longer that type of zone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taelenskychaser>Taelen Skychaser</A> at: 4/24/03 12:09:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 6820<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/03 12:17:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26229.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whine over PoG</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, and 5 months ago most of the people in my guild didn't have AAskills, MGB, and had lots of Kunark armor.

A few of our main Warriors wore Indo BPs when we did our first Tormax raid. ^_~  Still, a lot has changed and the game has gotten signifignatly easier at those levels.<br>

It was much harder because (get this) the reward and chance to get items was MUCH higher.  Try equipping an entire guild in Kael or PoG... you'll find it's much easier to do PoG than Kael.<br>
