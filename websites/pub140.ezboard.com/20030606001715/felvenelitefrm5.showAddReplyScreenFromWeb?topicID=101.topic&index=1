Karie suspected things about Kenelan’s feelings and attitude, his actions towards people. She also saw him as a block to further advancement, if he could be removed then Entice would lead the House fully and a female might well look more to someone like Karie when it came time to give out further promotion.<br>
<br>
Karie began to work on Kenelan’s mind, arranging meetings with him to discuss what he might think as important matters to the house. Subtle things, tricks over much time and from research she found ways to alter minds to dig up certain thoughts.<br>
Over the course of months she began to change Kenelan’s mind, not greatly, just to break down the parts that made him seem strong to other Teir`Dal. Her goal was to make him no longer seem true to Teir`Dal and Innoruuk’s ideals. It would have been quicker to kill him but that might cause the wrong reaction from Entice, so Karie kept with the subtler plan.<br>
<br>
Kenelan began to distance himself from the Reapers of Sorrow, seemingly like Utanaelia had once done but this was different. Utanaelia had gone through a change very different to Kenelan. He was starting to feel out of place among his own kind and still longing to be out and facing challenges in combat. He spent much time alone, struggling to keep his thoughts to that of what a Teir`Dal should be.<br>
<br>
Eventually it became too much, Karie’s influence and his own feelings combined, he simply picked up his weapons and left House D`Unnar one morning, never to return.<br>
He knew they would look for him, so he decided to find somewhere harder for them to locate him, Faydwer, home to many of those he considered lesser races and enemies. Not knowing that this was exactly what Karie had planned.<br>
<br>
He had been hoping to find battles, to come across new challenges to take his mind off of things. However, Karie’s effect on his mind was more than this, she had been hoping he might also seem a traitor to his kind if he were to leave in this manner.<br>
She had sent Teir`Dal agents after him already, to have him killed once it had been ‘discovered’ he was a traitor to the House and his race.<br>
Kenelan wandered the Faydark, his mind going over everything in spite of him trying not to think of it. After a day or so of this he began to feel tired, weakened, his mind cloudy…and then falling into unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
Over the next few weeks, elves in the Faydark began to speak of Teir`Dal who would appear at times and had been killing orcs and other evils in the area. The name “Kenelan” was heard also and this name reached some of those who knew of it in a group known as the Elven Elite.<br>
Vladimirski, Wyenea, Naminu and Carthaz among this organization knew this name well. They had faced a warrior by the name of Kenelan before.<br>
Vladimirski had recently been made the leader of the Elven Elite, hearing of this dark elf he asked for people to keep watch for him and report anything.<br>
<br>
Kenelan was in a dream, walking nearer to ‘light’ elves than he’d ever been without fighting them, for some reason they didn’t fear him as they once did.<br>
Wandering still, not sure what he was seeking, no longer wearing the plate armour he’d once had, it lost somewhere as he had roamed the great forest. He was hunting food deep in the Faydark when he heard a voice shout in the Elven language from behind him, he could make out that the basic meaning was to stop. He reached for his sword, assuming it was an enemy, as he did so roots sprung out of the ground from below him, entangling him.<br>
Kenelan turned as much as the roots would allow, he saw a female wood elf, likely a druid from her choice of armour, standing not far away.<br>
<br>
“Drop the weapon, dark elf” the elf this time spoke in the common tongue.<br>
<br>
Kenelan tried to move towards her but the roots wouldn’t break under his strength.<br>
The elf chanted and motioned with her hands, then pointed at Kenelan.<br>
Kenelan was blasted with an extremely strong wind, stunned for a moment and his sword knocked from his grasp.<br>
As Kenelan began to recover from the stunning blast the wood elf stepped forwards and picked up his sword, stepping back out of reach after.<br>
Seeing he had basically been defeated, lacking the strength to break free and now not have his sword Kenelan sighed and dropped to his knees before speaking.<br>
<br>
“Kill me then, tree elf,” he said, “you have won this”.<br>
<br>
The wood elf’s expression changed from one of distaste to one of slight surprise. She spoke then, clearly but not with any anger, which seemed odd to Kenelan.<br>
<br>
“I am here not to kill you but to take you back to see Vladimirski, the leader of the Elven Elite,” she said.<br>
<br>
The elf paused a second, seeming to be looking for Kenelan’s reaction. Which was no more than to blink as he tried to consider what that meant.<br>
<br>
“I am Nalilya, druidess of Tunare,” she tied Kenelan’s sword to her side as she said this, “you will come with me now and I expect no trouble or I can call down much more powerful forces of nature onto you should I think it needed.”<br>
<br>
Kenelan still had a fairly blank expression on his face, as if lost in thoughts.<br>
<br>
“The Paladin…” he said in a whisper.<br>
<br>
There was a very loud cracking sound, like thunder, around him that made him jump up. A spell of some kind.<br>
<br>
“Move, dark one,” Nalilya said quite loudly, “I have heard rumours of what you have been doing but that doesn’t mean I trust you so you will walk ahead”.<br>
<br>
Kenelan noticed the roots had fallen away from his legs, glancing back up he could see the elf pointing into the trees. He began walking; all the while trying to remember what it was he had been doing, like he’d woken from the dream suddenly.<br>
<br>
Much to Kenelan’s surprise it took them only half a day to reach the gates of Felwithe, he hadn’t realised he could be so close. The elf, Nalilya, said nothing to him beyond directions during the journey, which suited Kenelan as he was still deep in thoughts of the last few days, weeks maybe, he couldn’t remember.<br>
<br>
The guards nodded at Nalilya as they approached and gave Kenelan a dark look but nothing more. Nalilya ordered him to stop and tied his hands with some rope before motioning for him to enter the city.<br>
For the first time ever, Kenelan stepped into the city of the Koada`Dal, the high elves.<br>
He expected to feel disgust, an expectation that was a part of the twisted nature of the Teir`dal. However, he felt nothing, nothing at all.<br>
Nalilya lead Kenelan now, towards the guildhall of the Elven Elite. Glancing around the city Kenelan idly noted how bright and noble everything had been made to seem in its construction and decoration. Upon reaching the hall, Nalilya stopped to whisper something to one of the guards there that was giving Kenelan a suspicious look. The guard’s expression changed to that of surprise and he quickly ran into the guild hall.<br>
Nalilya turned back to face Kenelan.<br>
<br>
“Follow me,” she said simply and turned back to the hall and quickly moved inside.<br>
<br>
For a brief moment, Kenelan was tempted to run while she was facing away from him in spite of his low chances of actual escape but something of all this had made him curious.<br>
<br>
“The paladin…” he thought, “what could he want with me beyond my death?”<br>
<br>
He stepped inside, following Nalilya down a couple of well-lit hallways, to a room with two guards outside.<br>
<br>
“Wait here,” Nalilya said to him and opened the door.<br>
<br>
“Make sure this dark elf doesn’t go anywhere but don’t hurt him unless you have to.” She added to the guards before stepping inside and closing the door.<br>
<br>
The two guards now had their eyes fixed on Kenelan and had moved their hands to their weapons but hadn’t moved beyond that.<br>
Kenelan tried to listen carefully, to see if he could catch anything being said or done inside the room. He could hear voices but nothing more. Then about five minutes later the door opened again and Nalilya was standing there.<br>
<br>
“Come in now, dark one”, she said and stepped aside to let him enter.<br>
<br>
The room was a study of some kind, quite plain, with a desk behind which sat a high elf Kenelan knew, Vladimirski.<br>
Nalilya closed the door but remained inside with them, motioning Kenelan to step further in.<br>
As he did so, Vladimirski stood, looking directly at Kenelan’s face as if trying to judge something from it. He walked around the desk to stand directly in front of Kenelan before speaking.<br>
<br>
“Untie him and give him his sword, Nalilya,” he said.<br>
<br>
For the first time, Nalilya saw something other than the blank look on Kenelan’s face, surprise. This was mirrored on her own face.<br>
<br>
“I can’t do that,” she said after a moment, “he could attack you.”<br>
<br>
Vladimirski smiled, he moved back to the desk and reached down beside it to pick up a scabbard.<br>
<br>
“There,” Vladimirski said as he moved back over with it, “now I have a blade should that happen.” He grinned at Nalilya.<br>
<br>
Nalilya didn’t seem too comforted by this but she did as he asked, warily.<br>
Kenelan was still affected by the surprise of hearing the order to give him his weapon back when he noticed his hands were untied. Then he saw his sword, held in front of him. Slowly he grasped the hilt, noticing Nalilya back away as he did so then looked back to the paladin.<br>
Taking a deep breath first, Kenelan began to speak.<br>
<br>
“Did you send your druid to hunt me down and bring me here to give you the pleasure of killing me yourself?” He said.<br>
<br>
The paladin still had a smile on his face as he spoke.<br>
<br>
“Is that what you expect from those of the Elven Elite?” he asked<br>
<br>
Kenelan wasn’t sure how to reply to that.<br>
<br>
“Now you have your sword back what are you thinking of doing, Teir`Dal?” Vladimirski questioned further.<br>
<br>
Kenelan remember when they had met before, the natural hate had raged and been channelled as always into his fighting. Vladimirski had been his clear enemy.<br>
Something was wrong though. As he stood there, he couldn’t feel that rage of hate. He tried to dig around in his mind in confusion to work out why.<br>
The confusion must have shown on his face because Vladimirski spoke again.<br>
<br>
“Not sure are you?” he gave a short chuckle and then a serious look crossed his face.<br>
<br>
“Something has happened to you, Kenelan D`Unnar, once leader of those known as the Reapers of Sorrow and member of the house of D`Unnar in Neriak.” He continued to talk as Kenelan just stood there.<br>
<br>
“You have been seen killing orcs and other evils out in the faydark and crushbone areas,”<br>
<br>
“Orcs who I had heard were tied to the Indigo brotherhood somehow”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think you completely know why you have done this but I also do not know at this time, so cannot help you with that right now.” Vladimirski paused a moment.<br>
<br>
Kenelan’s thoughts were beginning to clear, he remembered killing the blue skin orcs now, though not why.<br>
Seeing something change in Kenelan’s face again, Vladimirski continued to talk.<br>
<br>
“However, I now have a Teir`Dal here in Felwithe.” He said, “I have two choices, I can either throw you in a prison based solely upon reports of actions I have not witnessed in your past and your race…” he paused again.<br>
<br>
Kenelan moved his sword and body to a defensive position expecting trouble.<br>
<br>
“…Or I can offer you the chance to be of use to me and the Elven Elite.”<br>
<br>
Kenelan’s jaw dropped at this, even his control wasn’t enough to stop his surprise at that. Glancing to the side he could see a scowl on Nalilya’s face, clearly this was not something she agreed with.<br>
<br>
“A trick?” Kenelan spoke at last.<br>
<br>
Vladimirski stepped forward to reply,<br>
<br>
“No trick, Kenelan,” he said, “you have a blade, strike at me with it if I am wrong in what I think.”<br>
<br>
Kenelan’s head was starting to hurt; he was trying to focus on what he once knew. This paladin, his enemy, to strike him down would be a great thing to aid his people.<br>
Nothing would come though, no anger, no hate. He raised his sword as if to begin a strike but then felt himself let it fall from his grip.<br>
Kenelan heard a sigh of relief from Nalilya as he looked at Vladimirski, his face seeming dazed.<br>
Vladimirski began to close the gap between where they stood, just as Kenelan’s mind reeled around trying to make sense of how he felt, or rather didn’t. Kenelan was exhausted from the roaming around in the forest and the effort his mind was exerting right now. He opened his mouth as if to speak and then blacked out, collapsing into Vladimirski’s arms.<br>
<br>
Vladimirski looked over to Nalilya.<br>
<br>
“Find him a room to rest in,” he said, “post a guard but don’t lock the door, I don’t want him to feel instantly like a prisoner”<br>
<br>
Nalilya moved to the door and then turned to speak.<br>
<br>
“You mean to have him join us don’t you? As an equal, you’re hoping, yes?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Vladimirski smiled again,<br>
<br>
“One day perhaps,” he said, “but for now I think he will follow as a soldier does, given the alternative”.<br>
<br>
“I want you to watch him though,” he continued, “if he does cause trouble you are to report it to me.<br>
<br>
Nalilya gave a small bow then opened the door to call the guards in to carry Kenelan out.<br>
<br>
“Mother Tunare, I hope I have made the right choice,” Vladimirski thought to himself after the door closed.<br>
