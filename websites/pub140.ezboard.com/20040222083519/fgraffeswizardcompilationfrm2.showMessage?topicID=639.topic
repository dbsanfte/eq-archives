Never before in my history in EQ, have I *EVER* touched a trade skill before, yet here I am.  6 days later.  with the 6th shawl, 7th very close to being completed.  Here's what I did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shawl 1&amp;2</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are just &quot;errands&quot;.  not really hard to complete at all, so I won't talk about them here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shawl 3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - First off, I had a ranger friend run around with me for this shawl.  Finding all the Snow Griffins and what have you.  BTW, best way to get them to spawn is to kill *EVERY* snow bunny.  aparantly the bunny's are on the same spawn table.  You havn't a chance in hell of finding those and the griffins unless you have someone with tracking with you.<br>
Once I had my reagents (all of them), I set to work on Baking.   You can combine Fresh Fish with um... I don't remember *laughs*, and that'll get your skill pretty high.  High enough to do all but 1 combine (the griffin one).<br>
All of that is store bought and fairly easy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shawl 4</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Again, this one isn't all that diffacult.  You can get your Pottery skill up making medium sized bowl's very easily.  Then it's just a matter of getting the few components you need from Crystal Caves and getting a combine done.  no problem at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shawl 5</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Ok, now we're getting somewhere.  This one is where it starts to SUCK.  Let me share with you what I did.<br>
First, I went to upper guk.  I killed the 14 spiders there (10 up top, 4 at the bridge) using Jyll's Static Pulse.  After they were dead (20 min respawn), I ran down to lower guk.  Just beyond the bedroom is a set of spiders.  you'll find 2 in the hallway, then 5 in the room, then another 2 more just beyond the bats, next to the 3 gargoyles.<br>
need 3 nukes to kill these.  Just start with static pulse, then do an jyll's ice, then another static pulse.  before your last nuke, all of them are going to be in &quot;run mode&quot; so run ahead of them and time it.  not that diffacult.  These guys are a 28 minute spawn.<br>
<br>
I did this for a while, and combine 2 silks in my kit for 15 skill in tailoring.  After that, I just collected as many silks (swatches) as I could, and started working on armor.  at around 60 skill, I went off to Velius again and camped the spiders in Crystal Caves.  1 full clearing of spiders left me with about 10 swatches.  I don't recall the respawn on them, but it wasn't that bad.  usually by the time your finished killing all of them, you have enough time to med to full + 1-2 minutes before the first set respawn.  Again, juse Jyll's to kill these.<br>
<br>
Then, I used their silk to take me up to about 85 skill (if I recall), then went back to upper guk again.  It wasn't long before I was at 118.  Now, the fun stuff.<br>
<br>
I collected all my velk's pieces and combound my shawl.  Did the shard-worm bile... that SUCKED!  10 hours in GD, killing *EVERY* shard worm that spawned with the help of a SK friend.  we were a wrecking ball crew.  Even invited a few lower levels to the group to leach xp off of our hundreds of kills.  at the end of 10 hours, my 5th bile dropped.  by hour 6, I had 0 biles, btw...  something's wrong there.<br>
<br>
Anywho, I got up the balls to hit combine and luckily... I got it first try.  On to more fun!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Shawl 6</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - I learned of a great place known as East Karana.  So with the help of my friend Lelaa (60 enchanter with dire charm) we went there.  We found her a Hill Giant to DC and her and I split up.  we killed EVERYTHING that moved.  for about 3-4 hours the first day.  I collected a ton of silk from that.  and started doing normal Silk armor.  got up to 131 skill without much trouble.  Then started with the hell that is Cured Silk and Master Wu's Armor.<br>
<br>
We set up a little &quot;sweat shop&quot;.  I bought her Vial's of Poison and Pearls in Shadow Haven, so she could sit in the bazaar with an AFK bard and make tons of Vials of Viscious Mana, while I went to Neriak to raise my brewing on Heady Koila's, while I... made just that.  Heady Koila's.  At first it wasn't that bad.  1 koila per combine.  So I gathered up as much silk as I had.  I might be saying this a bit out of order, these past few days have seemed to blur together into one.  But let me say this.  In one day I took my skill from 118 to 149.  using 201 silk swatches.  201 Vials of Viscious Mana.  and 804 Heady Koila's.  It *STUNK*!!!<br>
<br>
Thankfully, Lelaa also helped me with making the Heady's, over in Freeport while I worked the Neriak Circut.  After A few hours, I had all the koila's (little by little), all the silks, all the patterns and all the vial's all combound... and 149 skill.  Whew.  Passed out at that point.<br>
<br>
Day 2!  Back to EK.  This time, we went for 190 Swatches (not silks, I'm talking swatches here).  A few hours later, we had our goal.  And... back to Shadow Haven to have her make Vials, while I went and made heady's.  Shortly, I was up to using 2 silks per combine.  then 3 silks per combine.  When all was said and done, using 190 swatches I jumped from 149 skill to 157.  That's where I sit right now.<br>
<br>
After that, we started farming GD.  She DC'd a frost giant elite and started killing every wolf and giant that moved in order to find me a beard and 2 whiskers (no drop), while I was in CS killing all 9 or so Sirens (20 min spawn).<br>
When ever a Whisker would drop, I'd quickly gate over and loot it. I even found someone to sell me 2 manticore manes.  The first combine went flawlessly.  it was trivial.  the 2nd combine of course I failed...  back to it.  She did GD again, while I did CS.  Then together we went to EW to camp Manticores.  in no time, I had my things and went to combining again.<br>
<br>
SUCCESS!  6th shawl obtained.  So here I sit, working on all of my skills for the 7th and 8th.  I'm doing all the skills in unicin.<br>
<br>
I need this for both:<br>
Jewel Crafting: 182<br>
Smithing: 190<br>
Tailoring: 176<br>
Brewing: 162<br>
Fletching: 174<br>
Pottery: 162<br>
<br>
So, I grabbed a CHA buff from a friendly enchanter, gated back to neriak and started jewel crafting.  Malachite + silver took me up to 74 or 78 skill, then Malachite + Gold took me to around 130.  After that, I did Onyx + Gold.  Then jumped up 2 stone value's at a time till they were trivial.  Now, 3 or so hours later... I'm 186 JC.<br>
<br>
On to fletching.<br>
I read a thing on EQ traders on how to get fletching the fastest.  Skill 202 using only merchant bought things, all on 1 merchant.  Neriak again!<br>
I bought myself a Fletching Kit, and did this.<br>
Shaft Type - Point Type - Fletching / Vein - Nock - Triv Lev<br>
Bone - Field - Round - Large - 68<br>
Wood - Hook - Round - Large - 102<br>
Wood - Field - Bone Vein - Large - 162<br>
Wood - Field - Ceramic Vein - Large - 202<br>
<br>
I hit 179 skill easily.  only like 2.5 hours time.<br>
<br>
Now on to Brewing.<br>
I already had 46 skill from my Heady Koila's, so now I'm making Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew.<br>
That's pretty easy.  5 items needed to combine.  1 doesn't stack.  The non-stacking one is returned to you if you fail.<br>
<br>
1 malt + 1 yeast + 1 hops + 1 barley + 1 Cask = 135 skill (over time)<br>
You can get all of those reagents in Thurgadin.<br>
I'm currently at that part.  About to enter the next step of brewing.<br>
<br>
Minotaur's Hero Brew <br>
3 malt + 1 yeast + 2 water flasks + 2 short beer + cask = 248 (over a lot of time)<br>
This one is a bit larger of a combine so will take a lot more time.  Also a lot of trips back and fourth to the merchant that sells this stuff.  Another side-effect, is you have to Brew up your Short Beer's (35 triv.  barley + hops + malt + cask)<br>
<br>
So, do that step first.  Then start making the stuff.<br>
<br>
I should be done brewing tonight, then I'm gonna work on either Smithing or Pottery.  I can't decide.  Hopefully by late Friday night or Saterday afternoon, 7th shawl will be in my posession.  with 8th very close behind.<br>
<br>
I'm waiting till I'm done all my other skills to raise my tailoring up to 176.  that skill sucks the most =( <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

<br>
I myself approached a little different road and (unluckily) failed on the 5th shawl combine once. Yes, shardwurms are the royal pain of this quest I guess, much worse than snow griffin eggs.<br>
<br>
I still am working on the 6th shawl though. Cannot solo sirens, and guildies are afraid of Cobalt Scar since they are kos their. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh, and I guess AEing the spiders in CC worked only since you had epic, right? <br>
<br>
However, can you remember how much money you spent these days on your tradeskills? Roughly?<br>

Wow, soon (after I'm done the 8th), the guild can know that I'm back to working on my VT key *laughs*<br>
<br>
I failed my first attempt to combine it with 157 skill, but the combine took me to 158.  Luckily I had all the reagents in dupilicate between a friend and myself so I quickly gathered them from my friend and back to work.  this time I remembered to put my 5% Tailoring mod on....  also raised my skill to 160 before.  And BAM. Success, 7th shawl enabled.  on to 8th! <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

I only have 160 tailoring atm, but I don't feel like raising it.  I'll just play my luck on the Velium Hound Fur.<br>
<br>
So what did I do today?  Made close to 900 High Quality Rings, and combound the shit out of them with boots and tunics.  After hundreds of combines, I walked out with 192 smithing (from my 175 before).  Once that was done, it was off to WL to camp Genoids!<br>
<br>
I ended up having to get 3 diamonds 'cause I failed the refinement on one of them, but in the end, I left with 2 refined diamonds, 3 sapphires and 3 emeralds.  Then off to velk's!<br>
<br>
They say that Velk's sucks.  At 11:30pm EST, I must agree.  44 people in zone and not a mob to be seen.  So I did what any self respecting wizard would do.  /auction WTB *ALL* of your Blocks of Velium and Large Bricks of Velium!  100 plat per!<br>
<br>
Someone ended up having 14 blocks and 3 bricks for me, so I gave him a quick 2k for that.  then went back to auctioning.  about 1 hour later, a Brick finally dropped and someone ran it to me.  The block on the other hand was easy to come by.<br>
<br>
So now I fall asleep.  Tomorow I go to West Wastes to camp some Velium Hounds with my best buddy Lelaa.  Wish us luck gang!  (only need 8 pelts, but I anticapate failiing once or so...  not that bad, but 160 skill will do it.) <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

Those damn Fur's are *RARE!*<br>
<br>
I killed 17 wolves today.  no fur's.  Luckily I found people selling some (750 plat a piece), so I wound up with 7 that way.  Here's my progress.<br>
<br>
Tailoring - 160 (and 5% skill mod item)<br>
Smithing - 192 (and 5% skill mod item)<br>
Jewelry - 186<br>
<br>
Well, with my 7 Fur's, I had no problem combining them to make Soft Fur Padding.<br>
<br>
Now to combine the rest of it.  Off to Bazaar I go to buy some molds.  <br>
Bracer 1...  Check<br>
Bracer 2...  Check<br>
Boots...   Check<br>
Vambraces...   Check<br>
Gloves...  Fail.  ok, shit<br>
Helm...   Check<br>
Breastplate...   Fail also.  WTF?<br>
<br>
So, I combound all of that, and walked away with 5 pieces of armor.  Still needing to get 3 more wolf fur's, and also needing to go back to Velk's for Velium blocks.  crap crap crap.<br>
<br>
Ok, well while I'm out of WW, at least I'll do my jewel kit combines.<br>
of the 5 pieces that I had, 4 combined.  1 failed (luckily it gave back the crown!)<br>
<br>
I had another sapphire in the bank, and on the 2nd time it combined.  Damn again, now I have to go back to WL also =(<br>
<br>
So, by the time I've gone back to sleep I've already visited Velk's.  I have 8 sheets of folded velium ready for me.  Have 5 Velium Rings waiting also!<br>
<br>
Now hopefully my luck in WW isn't as wretched as today (17 empty fucking dogs!) and then maybe I&quot;ll get lucky in WL Geonid's also.  I'm hoping to walk away with an extra diamond, incase of failure on that one as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll give you my next update tomorow.  Good night. <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

Max Kos to coldain + 0 in all tradeskills was a rough start!<br>
Day 5 I get everything ready to start the quest.....shawls 1 to 6 in my hands in less than 12 hours.<br>
1-- piece of cake...did it 5 times for faction<br>
2-- piece of cake...did it 5 times for faction<br>
3-- borrow a druid account..put yourself on autofollow....slaughter....snow griffins arent near as hard to do as you heard they were..took me maybe an hour<br>
4-- piece of cake....getting tanik to spawn could be interesting if he spawns in different places....he spawned in one exact place...then later when i tried again...same place once again....static spawn for me...maybe it was just coincidence<br>
5-- Sit your ass next to the top spiders group in velks....simple as that....chat it up with the people..help them kill faster!  That took me maybe 2 hours of making friends.   As for the wurm bile...the whole glow in the dark thing made this soooo simple.  I went through the wurm cave from the thurg side..and sat out there in that valley thing.....had to wait for two EQ nite times....got 1 the first nite and 4 the second..its simple..just run around and kill all the wurms..eventually glowy ones walk by!  piece of cake!<br>
6--Did it the new way....took me all of an hour cause i destroyed my stack of small pieces of velium from before....had to go buya  stack in velks....cost me maybe 600pp but the 6th shawl was mine in less than an hour....one fail on the actual combine with a 155 tailor skill =)<br>
<br>
Now im on to #7.  All I need is a runed sea shell...gonna log on right now and try to buy one =)  This won't be that hard.  My goal is 1 - 7 in one week....ive got 2 days left! <p><c><IMG SRC="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/Kelacrit.jpg"></c></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxarpolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xarpolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Rhino Beetle!</span><br>  Posts: 916<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 11:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Well, another day that I've failed, yet this time it was the game and not me to blame.<br>
<br>
I wake up around 9:00am EST.  take my shower, run out to the store, eat breakfest and log on.  I'm in West Wastes at around 10:00.  there are 2 dogs up that I've found so far (accidently, by running around), and a 3rd yellow con one named Icehackle.  Those two dogs died faily easy.  One had a pelt too!  But.. I forgot to put my 5% Tailoring item on, and failed the very first combine =(<br>
<br>
Later, I get a 60 mage and a 56 ranger to join me.  We kill off Icehackle by taking turns kiting while the other nukes till agro.  He dies fairly easily (non-summoning)  Luckily he also had a pelt.  I didn't fail that one.  Even made it as far as the Imbued Royal Velium Gauntlets (for my failed gaunts yesterday).  So that's a plus.  All of this happened by 11:45.<br>
<br>
Now, I decide to stay in WW a bit longer.  The mage says there's a hound up with /pet kill, so the 3 of us take off to roam all over WW.  Luckily we have that ranger to track.  Sure enough... NOTHING.  no wolves at all.  That one must be under the world.<br>
<br>
So we kill the remaining 2 Glacier Mastodon's. There are still no Bronto's (rhino's) up at all.  Havn't been all day.  Then we decide to move onto Ice Burrowers.  We let our mage pull with Malo, then Mala(sp?) so we can land a snare.  Then I go to town nuking with sunstrike while our ranger keeps it snared and the mage pet chases it after me smacking it down.  We end up killing 5 worms this way throughout the day.  The only mob we encounter that proves to be a problem is Tantor.  No matter what we do, he simply won't snare.  Eventually we give up and zone.<br>
<br>
So...  here it is now, 1:00 (Wednesday now).  I just logged off, and not a single wolf has spawned in that zone since earlier.  none.  The only 3 up today were the 2 normals and the named.  A GM was finally called in to find the one that was under the world, and he /killed it.  But still nothing else.  Hopefully tomorow will prove better.  Only 2 fur's (hopefully) away from having my 8th shawl.  God, this gets frustrating.<br>
<br>
Oh, in other news we got Emperor Ssra to about 85% tonight (wow...), downed the Arch Lich and did pretty much jack the rest of the day.  At least I had WW to farm in that time, instead of sitting in ssra even longer.  Good night now, I grow weary. <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

You know the young ones drop them too?).  It is not this easy if you are working on it solo and broke.  <br>

I applaude you on your success and speed at this.  I am still trying to get into SG for a tooth and hide.  I just don't want people getting the impression that the shawl can be obtained this rapidly without alot of additional factors.<br>

I didn't give you an update yesterday so here it is.<br>
<br>
When I woke up, I headed off to WW and low and behold.  4 Velium hounds were still sitting on their spawn point in the DN Valley.  Of those 4, 2 happened to drop Fur's!<br>
<br>
As luck would have it, I took both of those all the way up to armor combines and had no failures.  Gem imbuing, also no failures!  So now I have all 8 pieces of armor.  I'm delaying handing in my shawl, 'cause I want the dain for my guild.  When we have sufficient numbers on for him, I'll finish it.  Then it's the easy task of the war.  I'm prepaired to win!<br>
<br>
So, I'm done.  I'm happy, and that's all.  Have a nice day. <p><font size=2> <P align=center>

<br>
We got a group of 25 people on.  I spawned dain, did my few hand ins.  Then killed him of course.<br>
<br>
Off to ice clad we went.  about 35 minutes later (due to general repeatedly attacking KoS people), 8th shawl was in my hands.<br>
<br>
This has me asking a question though.  What is the point?<br>
<br>
The Avatar of Below is a red con mob.  Dubious at that.  I'm wondering if he drops any loot.  Chances are, I'll re-quest the whole damn thing and find out.  who knows.<br>
<br>
That's my idea though. <p><font size=2> <P align=center>
