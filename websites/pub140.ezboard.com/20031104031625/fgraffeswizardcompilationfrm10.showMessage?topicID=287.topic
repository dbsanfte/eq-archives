Many of my ideas are adaptions or revisements of other suggestions by our esteemed brethren.<br>
<br>
1. Innate Mana regen boost: a stackable mana regen boost, like trolls have for hp.  This would operate on a graduated scale, and kick in like the troll/iksar hp regen boosts, and monk fist haste.  It should by all rights begin with the Concordance of Research Quests, the point at which the real wizard seperates himself from the man in a dress.<br>
<br>
2. Pre-Casting: The basic concept is to allow the Wizard to cast his spells before he makes use of them.  The mana is still used, but the damage itself is not released until the Wizard deems his prey is prepared.  Obviously this would require some sort of foci into which the Evocations would be projected.  Then, at the proper moment, the spells could be released, at which point they would fire off in succession, at the same time as the wizard himself was casting additional spells.  As long as the Focus Object could rack up its own hate values, it is not unbalancing, as the destruction of the focus would halt the casting of stored spells.<br>
<br>
3. Mana Control (A Channelers right): It seems only fair that Channelers(51+)should have some more advanced way to manipulate the mana of creation.  I propose that a spell be constructed which would allow a Wizard to harvest mana from inanimate objects, at a rate proportionate to an objects magical worth.  This would allow the wizard to gain mana by removing objects from existance, including summoned items, gems and jewelry, or magical words and runes.<br>
<br>
4. Mana Protection: The Evocationist surely must be able to draw mana from others who are less worthy of it.  After all, they will only waste it!  Allow the Evoker(55+) the ability to forcibly remove mana from other unenlightenned souls (Not usable on other wizards).  The power of this ability is also its weakeness:  As we are not in complete mastery of such a mystical force as the Mana of creation, it is an all or nothing sort of spell, with a twist.  For every point of mana the wizard is missing, he absorbs one from his target.  Until full.  This sudden surge of mana forces its way into him, causing 1 point of damage for every five mana his assumes.  Being painful to the target, those of less than amiable relations gain hate for the wizard twice-proportionate to the hitpoints he loses.  While not so dangerous in small amounts, a wizard who is nearly without mana could lose half of his lifeforce in such an act, and have the other half beaten from him.<br>
<br>
5. Flight: We are the Masters of Travel.  Our own Epic Quest speaks of Wizards powerful enough to fly through the air of their own will.  Teach us that which has been deprived!  All Channelers (51+) should be capable of this: At a cost of one less mana than the Wizard's Regeneration rate, allow him to harness the power of lightning, and project himself through the air.  This spell incorporates Levitation, and travel at 151-160%(based on level) normal running speed.  As is our way, the Wizard shall not extend this ability to others.  While in flight, the wizard should radiate 2 points of static electrical damage to all within point blank range every other tick.  This forces the Wizard to be careful where he flies.<br>
<br>
6. Magically Inclined: OH come on now.  How is it that we, as masters of the arcane, students of the ways of the universe, and scholars of all that is, has been, and will be are so horribly incapable of harnessing the raw forces of magic?  For a class of people so deeply interested in the forces that exist around us, are we so narrowly sighted as to miss that which is directly offered to us?  All Wizards (Player and NPC alike) should know better than this.  The forces of Mana are ours to wield.  Let us bend them to our will.  For all magically asserted attacks we resist, let us recoup one half the casting cost of the spell.<br>
<br>
7. I've never done a day's hard labor in my life.  Why can I carry more weight than a strapping young warrior?  Our abilities with magic are so interesting, it only makes sense that we have allowed our physical form to atrophy.  In exchange for our increased mana regeneration, remove one half a point of encumberance allowance for each point of enhanced mana regeneration we gain.(Refer to number 1)<br>
<br>
8. Pointy Hats.  Its a birthright issue, 'nuff said.  We should have ugly ones to tide us over until they are fabulous looking... we're ok with that.<br>
<br>
9. Mana to Mana (Level 20, Like a Damage Cap):  We make such wonderful, efficient use of mana that there should always be some to go around.  Let our groupmembers experience an additional 5% mana capacity while in the presence of greatness.<br>
<br>
10. The Dark Adapted Eye: Since we are not much for bashing heads, we employ others to do this for us.  These others are obviously mentally inferior to us, and would be hopelessly lost without us.  Because we are so interested in- well.. everything, let us pass on some of this knowledge to our faithful defenders.  There is, of course, one small issue.  Some people (fools, no doubt) scorn the use of mana.  They are obviously beyond reproach, so it is best to restrict one's dealings with them.  Besides, there are plenty of priest classes about to assist them.  Let us instead help along those who endeavour to understand the true power of the universe.  When we are not making direct use of the mana we control, let it surround those who dabble in its use.  As we bind our vision to others, let our added insight give them a glimpse of our protective magicks.  A Magical Damage absorption effect, subtracting inflicted damage equal by percent to the level of the spell, applicable to all hybrids, and int-based casters.<br>
<br>
The above are my thoughts and ideas.<br>

Some of the ideas were pretty...unique. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'll just comment on the ones I found interesting:<br>
<br>
Pre-casting: never heard this idea before.  Would be cool but probably too much of a change in Verant's game engine for them to bother implementing such a thing.<br>
<br>
Mana Control:  maybe.  But only if Verant suddenly changes their position that we need more mana regen then everyone else.<br>
<br>
Mana Protection:  are you suggesting drawing mana from both PCs and NPCs?  Such a power could be a source of abuse...VI would probably be pretty resistant to such an idea.<br>
<br>
Flight: Yes.  I understand we COULD fly in Beta using levitation.  Wish we had it again if only for the pure fun of it.<br>
<br>
Magically Inclined: interesting idea.  Gives added incentive for us to get resistance gear.  Would be interesting to see how wizards would react to actually having to SEEK getting nuked at. hmmmm....<br>
