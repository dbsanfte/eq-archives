Low lv up to high lv wizards are hurting badly. We are the worst grouping class in a game about grouping, an the 4th best soloer till we get to 54th lv and even then only get some semi-reliable quad kite ability. Post-50 we compete with druids mostly for groups, the single quality being looked at by high lv groups from wizards, Evacs, not dmg. Wiz evac versus druid evac, regen, heals, buffs wizards cannot hope to compete. For starters we need good buffs to give people in a group. Direct dmg doesnt mean anything when the mobs your group faces has 7000+ hps and the only thing you could muster per pull would be 650 from a draught(with C2 mind you), when the tanks are already mowing the mobs down one at a time in several mins.  650 you might be saving the tanks 10-25 secs of time which = a total waste of time and mana. Your mana cant hope to keep up with the tanks pull rate, its not possible. Tanks can deal infinite damage they arent limited by a mana pool or mana regen. they are only a complete heal away from continuity. If it was possible for wizards to keep up, wizards would be overpowered and there-in lies the problem. . .<br>
(650dmg x 4 secs cast time x infinity?)<br>
<br>
 We are wizards, so we know about all kinds of magic not just damage, incase your worried about it making sense.<br>
<br>
For instance Harvest should have a group effect to it, and after replenishing mana should have a clarity effect(that increases with you lv) for a long duration thereafter that stacks with other mana regens. (Groups tend to look for ways to improve their over all healing ability, so anyone with mana regen to cast on others is usually a good trait to have to get in a group.) Damage shields could use a SEVERE improvement up to along the lines of what magicians an druids get. Group Invisibitly, Group levitation, AoE Root, AoE ranged stunn. Group/single target Shield/hp buffs, Group/single target resist buffs.<br>
<br>
Low lv Single target snare- Would go a long way helping wizards for a single high lv dungeon group as well as solo. AoE snare in a dungeon? You have a death wish? Snare yourself an a few mobs that you didnt happen to see just around the corner?<br>
A wizard doesnt get a snare till 29th lv, trying to solo ANYTHING while below lv 29 for a wizard is pure suicide.<br>
Only if you have the impossible to acquire Jboots you have a CHANCE, but this is SUPPOSED to be BALANCED spell wise not the universal equip. If you dont have snare or a speed buff you have a pet, if you have neither your a wizard. Yet druids get a POWERFUL, RELIANT single target snare AND movement buff by lv 14. Why is the wizard hung out to dry? This needs correcting above all else for low lv wizards. Only having root an nukes is a sick joke. Nukes break root, druids of course have roots and dots, snares and nukes. Who is the sick mofo that came up with this? Why has nothing ever been done about this? Anybody have any explanation what so ever about this? Druids have nuke comparable to wizards, where is my sow an snare comparable to the druids? Balance my azz!!<br>
<br>
Our AoE snare sucks horribly, even on 54 I couldnt get reliable snare(Bonds or Atols) off on mobs that con light blue, its ridiculous. And even if it isnt resisted, then it doesnt last more than 1-2mins, druid snare last up to 10-12 mins? Balance my MFing balls!!<br>
<br>
Another beef, root an snare seem to work backwards. The lower lv the root the more likely it is to stick, the higher the lv of the root spell you try to cast the less likely it is to land, an if it does land it NEVER lasts full duration, it costs more mana, and has a longer casting time. How is that an improvement? This seem to be true for all of our root spells as well as our snares.<br>
<br>
Our AoE line for the most part EVERY single AoE we posses sucks. Only with the pillar line do we get decent dmg/mana ratios. Our rains dont chase mobs like the magician rains do and our rains have terrible dmg/mana ratios, yet rains make up about 1/3rd of all our spells, wtf?  Al kabor line again terrible dmg/mana. To fix our AoE line snare, root, an stun effects should be added to some of our rains an Al kabor lines. Also all of our rains should track mobs as it falls in waves like magician rains do and the dmg/mana ratios for all of our AoE DD and rains should be raised, except the pillar line they seem fine. AoE groups? I hear about em, but ive NEVER seen one after 2yrs of playing. Some of our rains MIGHT be decent in an AoE group but you have to agreed they must be few an far between.<br>
<br>
Our familiars nice addition, but why did they make us weaker when the exact lv/type spell druids get ADDS to their power making them sowed with more attack power, defense, hps, and the EXACT SAME mana regen wizards get? Our familiars die we take dmg an lose all our mana? Is this a joke?<br>
Lose the familiars and turn the spells into a buff, possibly one we could cast on others. The familiars also constantly make a annoying flapping noise which distracts you from the environment around you another reason to turn them into buffs ONLY and lose the animation and vuleranbility.<br>
<br>
No wizard spells should require components. All of our shield buffs(manaskin) should be component free seeing that we get no pet, ever. Yet seemingly every other casting class gets a pet at sometime or another.<br>
<br>
Reguarding our DPS, at the high end of the game we become the one pump chump with mana burn after spending an ungodly amount of time getting AA points. Before that though our DPS, without UBER FT items or our epic is for piss. We need more effecient nukes Post 50, fast casting SUPER LOW cost spells. If this truely is balance then I should be able to wipe out half a zone of green mobs without costing me nearly ANY mana, just like the pets can for their casting classes. Something along the lines of a 50+ lv spell DD that does 100 dmg/ 1 mana , lv restriction 30th mobs an below or just 20th lv an below.<br>
<br>
If all of these are implemented I believe the wizard class would be saved. But if only one could be implemented the single target snare, in my opinion, is perhaps the most help of them all. It would help the horrible 1-29 solo an the group situation throughout all the lvs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uenoah35.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/2/02 2:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not bad</span><hr size=1> Your ideas are good. I must say group harvest surely attract wizard to groups. But must say wizards are pretty needed in some high lvl exping zone ( at least my guild friends always sais they need me lol ). I usually exp in Umbral planes with my SK friend ( who duos with a shaman ), since the exp bonus went live. He takes about 8 min to duo kill a mob. With me in the group takes like 3min. He always say, Ill be the agro controler, u be the damage dealer. Fair enough. And I always have about 60 mana left per fight.<br>
<br>
I have to agree that wizards needs a bit of improvement before getting any of the AA skills. To become what I am now, needed to spend about 55 AAs. <br>
Before that my mana wouldn't last at the rate the tanks were pulling the mobs. Hence I felt useless since I had spent like 2fights medding to recover my mana. Balancing is a hard thing if you have to compare with another class. But again there are some things which remained unchanged for all casters I believe. The nuke damage scaling up per lvl. Honestly I think this could be the best way to improve a wizard. Dmg scales per lvl of droughts is a joke. starting at 620ish ends up with 688.  Ice comet now having cool effect but its nothing more than showing off to friends since it never scaled up from 1120... and mind u it started from 1100 something?<br>
<br>
Your ideas are cool, so as all the nice ideas that posts in this board.<br>
<br>
Thats my 2 cp.<br>

What are you trying to snare?<br>
<br>
I was snaring red cons at 52/53 in PoG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarnack25.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arnack25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/3/02 10:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Snaring . . .</span><hr size=1> I was mostly trying to snare raptors, ice giants, wyverns(Velious) an the other mob on the beach in Cobalt scar.   Those mobs resisted lots or snare wore off very quickly.  I would kite around trying to snare a single wyvern while a druid of LESSER LV was easily kiting 4 at once, much to my dismay. Druid killed his 4 before I could kill one, simply because his snare was more powerful. PoG you will land quite a few spells on red cons, thats just one of the ODD zones were wizard spells land like a mofo.  Could you name another zone/mob that was red you ever landed a snare on? Thats the only zone I can think of that I landed a snare on a red or full dmg with a nuke on a red. Course that was before the new patch supposedly removing/loosend the lv restriction for spells landing. Has it helped much?<br>
I remember going on a naggy raid trying to land Ice comets on Fire Giants at 49. Couldnt land one the whole raid an naggy should be a raid for 50th lvs. Went back when I got Ice Lure, totalled 600-700dmg the whole raid with Ice Lures alone on Fire Giants. Severly piss poor when all your doing as a wiz is trying to dmg with spells. Needless to say experiences like that made me quit, cause you are totally worthless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uenoah35.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/4/02 1:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Resists</span><hr size=1> Since the new Resist system went live, there were some cases where I was resisted constantly from a light blue mob. This was a WL frost giant sentinel, was too busy fighting him so thought I just root and be on my way. The bastard resisted 10 roots! Soooo time to show who I was to him ( meet sunstrike ).<br>
<br>
Ice giants are resistant sometimes. I always rooted him before snaring him just incase. Never kite, nor quadded wyverns so I can't give any info on him (<br>

I find that the first level or two of a new camp shows me occasional resists, (about 1 in 8, or none for a couple quads, then 3 resists in a quad).<br>
<br>
After that I get about 1 resist per day, (100-150 pulls).  Bof only wears off prematurely for me if someone snares or darks the same mob.<br>
<br>
Mob choice is hugely important, though.  With jboots, I can't outrun frost giants in gd far enough to bof them.  so it's either bof on pull or I'm in trouble.  Oh, and I'm only targetting blue, generally lower blues.<br>
