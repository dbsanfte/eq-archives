Other classes have been doing this for a long time now, and it's worked. So why don't we?<br>
<br>
Break your ideas down into two section. Upgrades and New things/ideas. Be reasonable in your ideas. Be smart in your reasons why.<br>
<br>
For example, How many vision spells do we need? We have infravision, ultravision, see invisible. <br>
<br>
level 4 see invisible.<br>
level 16 heat sight<br>
level 29 heat sight with Okiel's Levity<br>
level 39 Chill sight<br>
level 44 see invis and heat sight in one spell, castable on others.<br>
level 49 see invis with Familiar<br>
level 55 Plain sight and ultravison and see invis. <br>
<br>
Ok, so at level 55, I'm gonna get the spell plain sight? When, since I am a good wizard, always have my familar up so I have see invis anyway, and since I'm a good Sony customer I have Luclin, PoP and LoY so by 55 I have some long lasting form of infravision and see invis, which, is just fine. Oh wait, many of my magical items act as a greater ligh source too. Hmmm.<br>
<br>
See invis, heat and chill sight were part of the orginal EQ. Plainsight came out with Kunark, the familiars with Luclin, Okiels with PoP and Vision shift with LoY. Everytime we get new spells, one is always a vision spell that makes one or two other vision spells usless. <br>
<br>
This doesn't happen to other classes either. With pop, players got 2 new spells below 60. Well, we got one, and three ports. Um, ports to PoK. Um, yeah, isn't that what those book things are for? Granted, I use my PoK ports, but, um, we get one spell while everyone else gets two, cause we are also getting three port spells to the virtual Grand Central Station of EQ? Riiiiight. Clerics got spell haste buffs with PoP. That didn't make other spells of theirs usless, because they didn't have these before PoP.<br>
<br>
Ok see what I'm saying about how we get new stuff? Often it makes our old stuff usless. <br>
<br>
When Sony makes changes to the world, they should make changes to spells too. If your going to change the Temple of Cazic Thule to a level 50+ dungeon, then change the spell to reflect that. Dont leave it as a level 24 spell. <br>
<br>
So keep those things in mind when you post your ideas. After we get as many as we can, we should post which ones we really want first, and then we can all email Sony with our requests.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Upgrades:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Familiars need an upgrade. The level 29 familiar should start providing a 1 tick mana regen. We are a mana dependant class and have the lowest self mana regening spells or buffs of the four casters. Increase how often the can riposte. Many people don't even know they can do this because the noise they always make is so annoying they use the /pet get lost command. So remove the noise, or make it quiter. They could also do with being smaller in size. It wouldn't be as annoying if we had a shrink spell for them, but we don't. I would keep my familiar up if around when grouped if it wasn't in the way as much. Someone on the boards suggested that familars act like eye spells. I think this is a good idea and would love to see a spell called Controll Familiar, which puts you in the familar's body, and allows you to move him around and spy for you. Just like familars often do in fantasy litature. What would be even nice if our familars had small random procs. Enchanters pets attack when the enchanter gets attacked. Why can't our pets do something like taunt or cast a small DD on the mob to get it's attention?<br>
<br>
To that, if they increase familiars chances of riposting melee, they should improve and lower the mana cost of our Familiar buffs. Many people wonder why we even have these. It's because our pets can take a hit for us. But since many wizards get rid of the pet, they never see this, and never knew why we got a pet buff spell.<br>
<br>
Upgrade the shadowstep spells. Outside of PvP, there isn't much use for them. Even low level wizards that could benefit from them quickly stop using them. All it takes is two casts of Yonder and only moving 1 foot each is enought for most wizards to say, screw this. The spells need a set range of distance. Fade range 1-100 feet, Shadowstep, range 40 - 200 feet, yonder 100 500 feet. The point is, Yonder shouldn't have the chance to port you 1 foot. These spells could also use an aggro reducer component. Evac does, so it's not unheard of. It would also be nice if we got some spells like this that we can use on group members. That way people wouldn't be casting the spell on newbies to screw them over. Say your groups cleric got aggro, blink him away. This does't hurt any other class, and would make us more group desirable. A thing many wizards have issues with. <br>
<br>
If Sony doesn't want to give us bigger Nukes, then do one of two things. Lower the mana cost of our Nukes, or make them harder to resist. Lowering the mana cost of spells, say 50 and up would make us beable to cast more spells, increasing our sustatined damage. I believe this would make many wizards very happy. Other classes get spells to debuff the mobs so thier spells have a better chance of landing, why don't we? Many of our spells have a built in resist modifier. For the most part, it's -10. Even level 60 spells like Sunstrike. The lures have a -300. The regular direct damage spells should have a resist modifier that increase as the spells get higher in level. Something like Sunstrike should have a built in -30 resist to fire. Enchanters have Tash spells to lower a mobs magic resist, making it easier for all their other spells to land. Same with mages and shaman and necros. Yes we have Lures, but the trade off for lures is much lower damage. And I've seen and have had Lures resisted. Wasn't that the idea behind Lures for wizards? A line of spells that would land no matter what? Granted resists of Lures are far and few between.<br>
<br>
Show how much damage each spell does, not just the message So and so's flesh was rend/burnt/frozen. Maybe this simple change would make it so other classes know just what we are doing. Not just when we Crit. If we can see melee damage, then we should be able to see spell damage. Why one and not the other?<br>
<br>
Lower the mana cost of gate/port/translocate spells. It really doesn't make sense. The Luclin group ports cost 600, while the older ports cost 300. I can understand it costing more to port to the moon. The distance is great. But, um, hello, once on the moon, shouldn't it cost the same mana to port BACK? If I'm on Luclin and I port from Dawnshroud Peaks to Grimlings, a whole group, that costs the same as if I was porting from Norrath to Luclin.<br>
<br>
Roots. The only difference in any of the roots is the mana used to cast them, a nominal difference in casting time and the potential to last longer. All roots have a chance of breaking every tick or each time the mob takes damage. I would like to see the number of ticks they get a save increase per new spell. Root once each tick, Enstill once every two ticks and so on. Druid's roots aren't broken by thier own dots, which is a big advantage for them. Enchanters mezz spells last the whole time, unless they take damage. Since wizards get an AA ability to cast an unresistable root, I take that to mean roots are a natural function of wizards. So upgrading our roots does not seem out of line.<br>
<br>
It would also be nice if we got some graphic upgrades like many other classes did with LoY. Swarm spells look like swarms, choking spells look like they are chocking. Darkness spells look like clouds of darkness. Why do our ice rains look like fire? Same with Lighting? Spirals don't look like spirals at all. They just flash on each mob. We sersiously need our graphics to match the spells. Sony has said they are working towards this. Then how come just about every single class but wizards got changes?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Ideas or spells:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I think wizards should either get Call of the Hero, or a similar spell. While many mages would scream no, it is perfectly logical that we would get a spell like this. Or, if not this, then a reverse Translocate that allows us to teleport a group member that is out of zone into the zone. When a player has to go, and leaves the zone, but forgets to disband, by hitting the right F2-F6 key, you can then click disband. This can work. The coding is there. When a cleric targets a corpse, the person getting the rez gets a message box and poof, they zone in. This spell would become invaluable for helping raids along and getting one person that came late safely to the raid. Sony has made it clear that raiding is a main feature of the game, and PoP tells me that having people get around easier is also something they are in favor of. So this spell doesn't make it unbalanced. <br>
<br>
Since I'm talking about spells that move things around, I would like to see a knockback spell that moves a mob way back, but does no damage. So we can root a mob, and then move it away from the tank. This one seems the most unlikely to get, but you never know.<br>
<br>
Damage Decreasing debuffs. A line of spells that decrease the amount of damage spells cast by mobs do. This would only work against actual spells, not abilites, like breath weapons and such. Personally, I like this one, as it is something tangible like a slow or haste spell.  There could be a line of this spell that does first -5% then -7% and up. Remeber, these spells can be used against us by wizard mobs. I wouldn't even be against this type of spell becoming a weapon proc as well, for melees. <br>
<br>
Damage Increasing Self only Buffs. Mages get items that increase damage, lower mana cost, extend range, all sorts of things that make them much better. Plus, they can hand them out, and if you do the corpse trick, you don't have to bug a mage for those times again and again. We need a line of spells that allows us to increas the amount of damage we do. We got one with PoP, Iceflame of E'ci. So why not extend that line of spells down? Just like Iceflame works only on cold based spells 60-60 (rolls eyes) so can lower versions of this spell. There could be one for fire, one for cold, but not one for magic. They could also work on spells a certain level and lower. This hardly unbalances the game, since many wizards wait a long time to get any type of Improved damage item. Yes the new player made robe with Improved damage 3 on it is a blessing. I managed to get one for 20k. Generally speaking, they go around 30K. It will be a long time before many wizards get this robe. I've seen the price of jungle spider fur caps drop, but it has a REQUIRED level of 51 to wear it. Which means you might beable to afford it now, but can't use it to later.<br>
<br>
A new line of direct damage that the damage is based on how close you are to the mob. The closer you are, the better it is. The farther you are, the less damage it does. But for the same mana cost regardless. This might present some challenges to the programers. If you right up top on a mob, the damage, and to be fair, the aggro, are going to be incrediable. But if your sitting far away, the damage is going to be a fraction of what you could do. <br>
<br>
I would love to get an AE Root, but that might be stepping on the toes of Druids to much. <br>
<br>
Those are my ideas, and ideas I've read on here and really liked (credit to people that posted them, like the idea of familiars being able to act like the eye spells, and damage decreasing spells). <br>
<br>
Wizards, we have nothing to lose doing this, but could possible gain much more in return! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A> at: 5/20/03 12:15:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 1038<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/20/03 11:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ideas for Wizards</span><hr size=1> Extend Xuzl line to all levels... like 12, 29, 51, 59.

<br>
At 65, just from spells and AA...<br>
<br>
Harvest = 300/10 minutes = ~3/tick<br>
Harvest of Druzzil = 475/7minutes = ~7/tick<br>
Allegiant Familiar = 8/tick<br>
Force Shield = 2/tick<br>
Mental Clarity = 3/tick<br>
<br>
So, we can get around 23 tick that stack with pretty much everything in the game. That doesn't really seem that low, given that the 'self' buffs of most of the other classes have problems stacking with anything. So Enchanters would have VoQ, but VoQ also stacks with all our buffs. Necros Lich line of mana regen doesn't stack with it and also takes HP. Mages self buff is 6/tick, but it doesn't stack with Nine, which does stack with all our buffs. Enchanters do get Gather Mana, but tend to save it for emergencies/resses unlike the way we tend to use the harvests whenever they pop usually. Really, because of the stacking issues, wizard mana regen is actually pretty decent. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Most of what I said scales downwards to the point where you can get harvest. The big thing about wizard mana regen is it stacks with pretty much all other forms of mana regen. most of your ideas don't really help the class, they merely make it better at soloing. Not sure that the class needs any real help in that department at all, at any level.<br>

Actually, I liked it. A version that I can cast on other people is actually more useful to me than all the ones that were self only combined. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Single target snare could be any level (s) maybe with increasing duration as you got an upgrade   (levels 24, 49 and 60?) <br>

Or how about &quot;Knock&quot; like the AD&amp;D spell (level 54?)<br>

Yes, Familars can riposite and take melee damage. Go in a PvP with a friend and have him attack you're familiar, he can do it. I've had my familar riposte, or play interferance about 3 times the whole game. Once fighting Gull Skytallon with my cleric friend. I was DID YOU see that? He tried to hit Grubby! And a twice, a dot landed on him instead of me. <br>
<br>
That's why our Familiars have HPs and ACs. That is why our Firetrees Familar Enhancement spells give, HPs, increased speed and AC. what good is AC if you can only get hit with AE attacks? AE attacks don't work against AC. <br>
<br>
When in groups, I often get rid of Grubby with the pet get lost command. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3220<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/03 10:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: huh?</span><hr size=1> &gt;That's why our Familiars have HPs and ACs.

Actually, those spells are a relic from when you couldn't get rid of your familiar at all, which was at the start of Luclin. When the benefit of Improved familiar was that it was supposed to be more resistant to AE spells. And when the familiar died you took a penalty for it. The familiar was changed into its current form from that, I'd rather not set it back. The things you are talking about are all pretty much useless anyways. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Perhaps an AA.  I don't play my wizard anymore, but man, if those were spells, that'd eat up 3 total spells slots to have those two up with Harvest. <p>-Druzifer(x) Gnomercy<br>

IE: Me! I wish I would have done so now as I see wizards who did being able to quad frogs in Storms etc etc. But I did not and now face the 98% chance on a daily basis of not getting into a good xp group inspite of being in a great guild. So I'd just like a place to be able to gain toiler/raptor type xp post 60 for those hard to get a group times. I know post 60 is deigned for grouping but most players that continue to play post 60 are in a guild and have their raids for that. I just think it would be nice to have that wizard haven to go to during such times.<br>

<br>
Is the damage from Xuzl's considered melee damage? If it is, this would be a great spell line to extend down through the classes. We are the masters of damage, so having a line of spells that is based on melee damage, not fire, cold or magic would be nice. <br>
<br>
It really wouldn't give us tha ability to take on mobs that can only be hurt with melee, since the spells don't last long enough, but they would allow us to contribute to fights of those nature.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fqubedf3povar>FqubedF3povar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/1/03 10:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what kind of damage</span><hr size=1> Xul is melee dmg, he tends to hit for what was it 70s? anyway pritty gimp for a pet at lvl 59 so noone would raise the word, if it were lower lvls ppl wouldnt use them because they poof after mob dies, so it would take a bit to start using them, and by then they would fave flappy......<br>
