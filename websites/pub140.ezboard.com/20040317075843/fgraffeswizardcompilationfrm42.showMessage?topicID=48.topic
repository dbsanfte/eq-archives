<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The sword was barreling towards Merco's head...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Unblinking, at the last conceivable instant, the wizard raised his hand to meet the summoned sword. A pale white glow emanated from his palm. The sword and the glow made contact and instantly the glow spread across the skin of the Erudite.<br>
<br>
Completely surprised by this change of events, Sorkal's eyes widened. He was about to yell something before he completely disappeared...<br>
<br>
Minren walked up to Merco after dealing with the dead guards and asked him, &quot;Where did you translocate him?&quot;<br>
         &quot;Skyfire&quot;<br>
         &quot;What are you planning to do?&quot;<br>
         &quot;He is an issue that needs to be dealt with...&quot;<br>
         &quot;Are you sure you can fight him? Remember what happened last time...&quot;<br>
          &quot;What happened last time shouldn't be a problem&quot;<br>
<br>
Minren shrugged... she couldn't think of anything else to say to Merco as was staring off in a seeming daze. What the wizard was doing was memorizing the spells he would use in the coming battle with Sorkal. As a last thought, he quickly casted a spell which allow him to see beings who were hidden though means of sorcery. In hindsight, Merco was glad that he casted it.<br>
<br>
Turning to Minren, he said in a low voice,&quot;You know... if I don't make it back...I have to tell you something...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes?...&quot;<br>
&quot;I was the one who enchanted your clothes to disappear when you went in public...&quot;<br>
&quot;YOU BAST-&quot;<br>
<br>
Before she could finish Merco disappeared in an instant with a grin on his face. Minren sulked for a minute before she started her walk back to the blind fish to grab a drink before she began her clerical duties... She thought of Merco for a few minutes during that walk... but it was mostly thoughts of what she could do to get back at him when he survived.<br>
<br>
Merco appeared at skyfire to see a rather interesting display... ten wurms were found dead on the rock-caked floor. Scanning the horizon he sees many other large drakes littered among the dead. Pausing a second to realize the magnitude of what spell Sorkal casted. Merco suddenly heard the air moving quickly behind him. Merco's body was a quick blur as he disappeared and reappeared thirty feet to the south. What greeted Merco was possibly the largest Air elemental he has ever seen... Sorkal was levitating on the nearby mountain snickering.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look like you're at a slight disadvantage down there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you feel like making it a fair fight?&quot;<br>
&quot;No&quot;<br>
&quot;Figures...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tapping the staff Merco has held under the sleeve of his robe, a glowing aura covers the surface of the wizard's skin. Thank god he had see invisible up, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to detect the air elemental at all, other then the whistling of the wind as the air elemental strikes...<br>
<br>
The air elemental commences his attack by first activating his innate ability to generate large gales of wind to strike his opponent. The aura created by the staff Merco tapped protected him against the winds. Merco thus began his assault.<br>
<br>
&quot;Elemental Flamen Insumi!&quot;<br>
Merco's cry resonated through the mountains as he rushed the elemental. His hands seemingly exploded in the blaze of green fire he sent towards the elemental. Using a technique hard to find in the average wizard... the next spell he completed by incanting the spell in thought. Merco's hands flared up in waves of moving ice. Merco jumped towards the elemental as his first spoken spell made contact with the elemental, making the form of air recoil. Jumping through the elemental similarly as an acrobat would jump through a hoop, Merco spread his arms out to the sides, and lets the ice penetrated the insides of the elemental. Now... all it is now is a waiting game. <br>
    Sorkal, realized the spell that Merco used jumped down from the mountain he was on and began his fight. Speaking an incantation, Sorkal's fingertips began to emanate a red glow. The glow began to grow out of his fingers not too different from a snake slithering through grass. Eventually the energy worms grew to a point where the lengh was twice the size of Sorkal himself. Merco studied this as he was continuously dodging the air elementals attacks by shadow stepping all around it. The elementals movements are slowing down considerably and will stop in a minute, though Merco's priorities have changed to a more dangerous foe... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=merco81>Merco81</A> at: 1/1/03 2:36:31 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.showPrevMessage?topicID=48.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.showNextMessage?topicID=48.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.emailToFriend?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.threadControl?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm42>Tales & Accomplishments</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
