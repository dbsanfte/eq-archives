I happen to disagree, and find that all those who have this line of thought fit in a certain kind of category (level 60, in a big guild, on raids all the time) but I'm curious what others think is left to be done - at all levels. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umelcar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melcar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 388<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/7/02 2:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> I am level 46, for all the signs I'm about guildless(I do have a guild tag - but last time I saw more then 2 people on in the guild was about 2 months ago).  I am more or less happy with where I am right now.  Last time I was very discouraged was when I was around level 30-34 small group in Iceclad doing Dervs and Cougars with a Majorly twinked Rogue backstabbing for 200+ damage on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
We cannot Keep up with Twinked Melee, in damage, Duration, or durability.  I don't really know what can be done to correct this problem without Increasing Our power to the Point where we are severly Overpowered vs PVE and the few remaining Non-Twinks(Yes there are still a few out there), or god forbid - decrease others to bring us inline that way.  I don't think either one should be done at this time.  <br>
<br>
The Focus Items do help, but I don't think there are enough in game yet.  I also think the levels for them should have been done differently.  By the time you are able to aquire an Item through &quot;Adventuring/Questing&quot; it doesn't work effectively for you anymore.  I understand part of why verant did this that way - level 1 only working until level 20, was because they knew as soon as these items were added that the Highlevels would Farm them like crazy.  Instead I think the Focus levels should be shifted now, where level 2 items don't work below level 20, and level 3 items don't work below level 49.  That would seem to me to be More inline with the Items and where they drop.<br>
<br>
Also I would like to see the Ratios changed on them, say level 1 focus gives 1-10% bonus.  Level 2 gives 5-15% bonus, level 3 gives 10-20% bonus.<br>
<br>
In summary - Add more focus items, and change their effective levels and ratios to be more inline with where they drop at.  In regards to balance - we are unbalanced vs twinked melee, and always will be in Everquest.  Versus NPC's I think we are fine.  With exception to the way resists are calculated.  eg the 7 level spell hitting limit.  Also Level being Greater then the resists of the creature.  Frost giants should be More or Less Immune to Cold damage, and vulnerable to fire.  Not equally resistant to fire cold and Magic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5549<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/12/02 1:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Focus Items would be a good area for Verant to reexamine, their range and distribution wasn't very well handled.  Some of them are in locations inappropriate for their effect, and there are so many that they end up helping some classes definitely NOT in need of help a lot more than ones that needed it.<br>
<br>
Lower level spells need to be reexamined as well, Wizards can't compete with fellow casters, that's right CASTERS in groups (not twinked melee) until around level 49, which spells trouble.  Making things better vs melee is a good step, it was disgusting but the real problem has been there since day 1 of the live release and never touched by Verant yet. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udamoens.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damoen S</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/13/02 11:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> I agree that Focus items need to be looked at.  I have always thought of the focus items as trinkets and nothing more.  The current state of focus items are only good for twinked casters.  For each time a caster levels past a focus level that caster is now totally with out benefit of focus.  There are no other items in the game that act similarly.  Basically the focus items punish you for leveling.  <br>
<br>
Focus items for wizards are rather useless in their current state.  Why?  Because wizards only gain benefit from 2 maybe 3 categories of focus items.  Damage, reagent conservation and casting haste.  Considering these categories are so general every class would benefit from gaining them.  Also considering the large amount of caster equipment that the wis caster and int caster usable.  What are the chances of being awarded a 10 wis, 10 int reagent conservation 3 item on a raid?  Very slim to not at all, if a cleric is with the raid.<br>
<br>
The current implementation does not allow for any expansion beyond what is currently developed.  In other words there will never be focus 4 items.  The basic handicapping of casters with the status quo still stands.  So with the release with PoP we will only be able to look at maybe more Focus 3 items with different stats.  While melee will again gain better, faster weapons as they have with every expansion.  <br>
<br>
The difficulty for a caster above level 44 to obtain a focus 3 item is just insane.  And if a casters is on a raid that a focus 3 item drops, there are so many different categories of focus that the chance the caster can use the focus item, is very slim.  And as for wizards, they need the most help between 51 and 59.  The closer you get to 60 the less you need the focus items, because you can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  The chance of a 51 wizard getting a damage focus 3 item is nil.<br>
<br>
Those are the reasons I will never quest, buy or barter for any focus items.  If a focus item falls from the heavens at my feet I will pick it up and use it.  But other than that they are not worth the risk vs reward to obtain.  <br>

<br>
Every once in a while, you read something that stops you dead in your tracks.  I hadn't thought of this.<br>
<br>
...and the ramifications are pretty ugly.<br>
<br>
So, essentially what we're looking at here is that focus items are a patch job that don't fix the basic problem.  And a touch worse, the focus items really don't do all that much in closing the gap with melee's...yes it's nice to have a little extra damage for a little less cost...but I won't go into the comparisons found elsewhere about the increase in power melee's have seen since release as compared to casters.  Let's suffice to say that 10% is nowhere close.  Not even on the same continent.<br>
<br>
But more importantly, we're in the same position we were in the beginning...we're now considered &quot;balanced&quot;, but the implementation of that balance does nothing to keep it from getting out of balance again as time progresses.  Unless, of course, VI intends to never increase melee power beyond what it is now, which isn't going to happen because a million uber-60s will decide there's no point in playing the game anymore.<br>
<br>
My brother is in an uberguild.  Yesterday, he was awarded a drop from Vex Thal.  It's a 1hb, 1(one) damage, 1(one) magical damage, 16 bane<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> something, but whatever the word is, it's essentially all Vex Thal mobs), 18 delay.  So, quick math tells you that that's an 18/18 1hb that works only in Vex Thal.<br>
<br>
18/18 1hb.<br>
<br>
Random thought:  Maybe they'll incrementally increase focus percentages over time, to try and keep up with items like that 1hb...<br>

<br>
To address what else needs to be done?  I have to ask what has been done?  VI has done many things but what have they done specifically for wizards?  Crits, focus items, added some spells: lesser evac, Ancient spells, 20th level DD, Lunar ports, removed the mana soft cap, and adjusted the in zone port spells i.e. abscond.  But what havent they done?  They have not gotten wizards back into groups, or gotten wizards to participate in the game more, or balanced direct damage, or balanced casters vs. melee, or lessened the grip the MT/CH has on the game.<br>
<br>
My opinion of what the objective of caster balance has been so far, balance the casters against one another.  In other words they have been working on balancing the pet classes against pet classes, and the healers against healers.  Which is just fine, it needs to be done.  But that just means Wizards have not seen much balance come their way.  Yet?  Wizards only have damage.  Since every other caster also has DDs it complicates even the best balancing efforts.  Because even the smallest change to DD can effect every single caster, positively or negatively.<br>
<br>
Even if VI does get DD balanced, that is only half the battle in my mind.  Now VI has to balance caster vs. melee.  If VI doesnt balance this way then all VIs efforts have been in vain, because that has been the largest, most consistent complaint through out caster balance and before.  It is my opinion that the last time caster/melee balance was even looked at was beta.  Honestly I dont think VI has the correct equations, or understanding about wizards.  Otherwise why would they continually increase melee damage capabilities and strap the status quo to wizards?  For instance melee between 51-59 get an increase in weapon power with every expansion.  Yet wizards are still using Kunark spells.  And all but 3 of the pre-50 damage spells are the same since release.  <br>
<br>
I would like VI to reevaluate their vision for wizards.  And decide if they are still on track with their vision.  With the recent release of lunar ports, damage spells out number transportation spells by only 8 in the wizard spell book.  I am very grateful for the release of the new ports, but I never thought moving others around EQ would be my wizards primary ability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5584<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/15/02 5:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Actually a discussion of focus items is very much in line with the original question, their poor distrubution, type, and the density of kinds that help some classes as opposed to others all affect balance for casters.  They all are also exclusively for melee vs caster balancing with gear, and as has been well discussed here will become obsolete with the next expansion.<br>
<br>
The addition of lower level ports and evacs are great for the game, they make some areas previously suicide to enter more useful and attractive, but they didn't really do much for balance.  Adding in the Garrisons blast at level 20 was a great step, making it magic based was a step backwards from that attempt however - cold would have been more useful.<br>
<br>
A SMALL tweaking of wizard damage below level 50 without touching actual damage numbers for all but a tiny handful of spells would make a huge difference without a big change in raw power for Wizards.  All that is needed is to make up the gap between other casters damage output and Wizards.  Since Magicians are able to outdamage Wizards rapidly using their best tools (pets and damage shields being non resistable and costing no mana once in place), raising Wizard damage slightly by lowering the mana and casting time woulud NOT repeat NOT unbalance the game in any slight way.  If it would, then the mage damage output would already be causing problems.  Matching someone's already high damage output (damage with fewer drawbacks) would only help Wizards, not hurt the game in any way.<br>
<br>
For the few levels where Wizards have smaller blasts than other classes, obviously if its acceptible for them to have this much power it is for Wizards, since they have other tools and options Wizards lack, particularly Clerics and Druids.<br>
<br>
The first thing to go is the &quot;start weak end powerful&quot; bullcrap that people cling to idiotically from their AD&amp;D days.  All classes obviously start at a lower level of ability than they end up with, but handicapping Wizards at low to middle levels so that the last few levels (60 really) is amazing in power is a flat out stupid way to make a game.  That entire philosophy must be abandoned and a new one made that matches the other classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umelcar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melcar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/16/02 12:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> raising Wizard damage slightly by lowering the mana and casting time<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What exactly do you mean by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> slightly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
Lets assume 10% for a second:<br>
Garrisons Mighty mana shock - Currently 90 mana, Maxes at 148 damage.<br>
<br>
Drop 10% off the mana cost we'll round it to 80 just to keep the math simple.  Assume 200 int on a level 23 character(to get the Max damage).  That's 966 mana.<br>
<br>
966/90 = 10.7<br>
966/80 = 12<br>
So you get 1.3 More casts of Garrisons from Full mana to Empty.  Considering level 20-23 Mobs have what 500 hp's?  Does that 1 extra cast of Garrisons make a difference in what we can contribute?  Cast Once more before needing to sit out.  Whooopie.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Increased Damage for Wizards.  It would just have to be a SIGNIFICANT Increase to make a Noticable difference.<br>
<br>
In my opinion a better thing to do would be to Increase the Mana Regen, rather then decrease casting costs. (which Verant is working on doing - adding more Flowing thought items).  Half are No drop though so trickle down doesn't work.  More Lower level Flowing thought I think would be a bigger help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5586<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/16/02 3:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Well the combined effect would be noticable without requiring a significant change in each aspect.  For example, lowering mana cost by 10% of all blasts below level 50 would equal about a 8% total increase in your mana pool without requiring you to REGEN that mana.  So this is sort of like someone giving you an item at level 50 that gives 160 mana but the mana recovers no slower than without it (your 2160 mana recovers as fast as 2000).  This is an increase in damage without an increase in damage numbers, its an increase in mana without needing to recover the mana, its better than faster mana regen.<br>
<br>
How so?  Because if you don't USE your mana, you don't have to REGEN IT.  That downtime that Wizards pay for their ability to cast spells now is reduced in a manner that allows them to apply their damage better.  At level 60 I'd say you hardly need any help, that's a bad example.  Creatures you face at those levels are so immensely powerful that a small change is of virtually no use.  But at levels BELOW 50, where the most work is needed by far, the monsters hit points compared to your damage output isn't such an absurd ratio.  Small changes make big differences.<br>
<br>
Stack on top of that slightly faster casting times, by 10-20% for the higher level blasts (I'm sorry but 6.3 seconds casting time is an obscenity, its why Verant gave Draughts to Wizards, because they understood we were about fast blasts).  This allows us to APPLY the damage for less mana in a more timely manner, faster, better.<br>
<br>
Then we'd need either lower aggro (preferable) or a lower level concussion spell that does not, repeat DOES NOT require a quest like the present one.  Concussion works at all levels just fine - it just comes too late to be a factor when Wizards need help the most, and increased speed means just increased aggro which negates our ability to take advantage of these changes.<br>
<br>
There's other stuff that could be done, and should be in my opinion (based on three years of play and study) but I think you've all seen that list before. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 8/16/02 1:04:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udamoens.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damoen S</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/16/02 3:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Grim I agree to a point.  But I also think what you are saying only touches on the problems and only scrapes the surface of the solutions.  Here is what I think could be done for caster (wizard) balance.<br>
<br>
To get wizards back into groups, then these four things need to be done.<br>
<br>
Get wizards to participate in the game more adjust the down time for wizards.  Currently to meditate for a full bar of mana it takes me personally 11 minutes.  If that time were reduced to 7 minutes I would be willing to take a couple of nerfs, and do it happily.  If I were allowed to play the game instead of watching the game I would gladly take a nerf to my quad kiting capabilities.  I would be happy to see a level based cap to mana regen.  That would allow for adjusting all levels of the game to be more balanced.<br>
<br>
Balance casters vs. melee VI needs to pick a flat line.  For instance 2 level 60 characters one warrior one wizard, decked out in the best gear possible, WITHOUT AA POINTS.  Then calculate the amount of damage both those characters are capable of doing over the period of one hour.  But to be a fair test they both need to generate as much damage as possible.  I say without AA points because you are attempting to balance the classes not the AA points.  To fully balance the classes this would need to be repeated for all levels (10-60) at 5 level increments (60, 55, 50, 45,40.).  I suggest pairing Warriors with Wizards, Mages and Monks, Necros and Rogues, for comparing Damage per hour.  All six of these classes are damage-focused classes.  If spell vs. melee damage is not balanced the game is not balanced.<br>
<br>
Balance direct damage everything needs to be taken into account.  Casting time, recast time, recovery time, damage, mana, spell resistance type, aggression level, average hp of mobs that level, and finally what will happen when a mob has access to the spell.  I can not remember the last time VI said they were looking into the aggression level of wizard spells.  I personally feel the spell concussion was a cop out on the part of VI.  If aggression levels were in need of adjusting to the point of giving out a new spell, why not go in and fix the problem instead.  But no they make an Ancient: Concussion spell.  This is where VI needs to figure out if wizards were designed for magical damage or magical transportation.  Keep in mind DDs are throwaway spells, as you gain levels the chance you will use a certain spell decreases dramatically.  Wizards have eight more damage spells than transportation spells.  I believe Wizards are in need of more DDs.  I would like to see more large damage, slow casting nukes between 51-59 and faster casting low damage nukes between 24-49.  As for other classes I dont know what they need I am a wizard.  But I do know they need to be scaled to wizards the same way Monks, Rogues, Paladins are scaled to Warriors.<br>

Lessen the grip the MT/CH has on the game.  Simple start creating raid and grouping situations that require area effect spells.  For instance zerg a raid.  Create encounters for the 50+ crowd that entails 5-10 LOW hp mobs being pulled at the same time, maybe all 5 have the same hate list.  5 mobs are enough that is a group still attempts the MT route they will be hard pressed to pull it off.  I specify Low hp mobs because if 2 wizards can not handle them 2 casts each in a single group situation, you have just killed this possibility.  If you want a raid situation increase the number of mobs and also the hps on the mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5588<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/16/02 3:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah I left off one thing: items that help with mana regen are great.... if you are high enough level to get them.

<br>
-remove the level limit cap or raise it on monsters we can cast on, if melee can hit things that are 7 or more levels higher than us than why should we not be able to?<br>
<br>
-reduce the aggro on ae spells on all mobs other than the mob you have targeted down to 1 point.( this will allow you to use ae spells much more often in groups and the one point of aggro prevents people from killing mobs without a challenge solo)<br>
<br>
-add in more concussion type spells for all levels and maybe even a lure type concussion spell<br>
<br>
-add in more variations on nukes at all levels, like add in some more fast casting low dmg nukes and slow casting high damage nukes<br>
<br>
-add in a common fire or magic nuke at 60 so you aren't stuck with just ice spells ( draught of ice and ice spear), dunno about you guys but I feel kinda useless when raiding places like velks or kael and my strongest nukes are the ones most easily resisted.<br>
<br>
-maybe? reduce resists on all of our spells some more...( at level 60 I still get many many resists on light blue/green mobs in places like the hole and karnors, well which isn't too bad I guess seeing as to how I almost never go to either of those places, but still it's no fun).<br>
<br>
-add in a couple more harvest type spells perhaps? like one at level 20 and another in the fifties?<br>
<br>
All I can come up with atm, feel free to comment.<br>

<br>
Personally I'd like to see skin spells added at level 4 (Malachite (5 silver), 12 pts max protection) and 12 (Turquoise (1 gold), 30 pts max protection).  This would make Wizards more survivable at those levels without being overpowering in any sense.<br>
<br>
Put a mez-like minimum duration on Enstil so it acts like a very reliable root but has no soloing use.<br>
<br>
Turn Bonds of Force and Atol's Spirit Shackles into AE Root spells, if we are better in groups we hardly need to solo as well.<br>
<br>
Add in a faster-casting Gate spell for Wizards only.  If we are meant by Verant to be superior at teleporting, why do we have such a slow teleport home?  This would help us in emergencies as well.<br>
<br>
Fix the self-only ports to work past impediments and be able to port up (but only a limited amount, so you can't port on top of places that could be exploited easily).<br>
<br>
Add in a spell that eliminates environmental clutter for Wizards (no snow, fog, etc) at level 29.<br>
<br>
Add in a spell that makes water, blood, etc clear to see through at level 16.<br>
<br>
Lower Chill Sight to level 29 and Heat Sight to level 8.<br>
<br>
Put in a MR self buff, we get all the others but not MR, why is that?  Yes, the shielding spells raise Magic Resistances... just like they do for Enchanters, who can cast magic resistance on others.  It just fits the 'self sufficient world traveller' image Verant seems to have of Wizards and is consistent with the present spell list.<br>
<br>
That's just little stuff to jazz up the class and make it more survivable at lower levels.  It would mean we would be slightly more useful in groups as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unicolheartsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicol Heartsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 751<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/19/02 2:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> The anti-fog and see through water are pretty cool ideas, and actually something that we would have claim to as the seekers of knowledge.

Actually, I've been thinking this is something they should add just to the Al'Krappo line of spells to give us a way to make them worth using. Maybe even allow them to hit mezzed mobs without breaking mez. If they break mez and don't draw aggro to us the mob will aggro on the chanters and would not be very welcome in groups.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=123067">Merkus Stormcrow</a><br>Mystic Circle of Power<br>Evoker</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5628<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/19/02 5:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Yeah well none of this is likely to happen is it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   A swimming Eye of Zomm would be nice too, or at least give it 100 swim so it doesn't just stop dead when it hits water or ice. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umerkusstormcrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merkus Stormcrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/19/02 5:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> You never know, Grim.

You know, sometimes I think you are just restating what you remember from playing a wizard.  Please go back and start a wizard.  Concerned about how you stack up to a twinked melee?  Twink the hell out of them.  Now, I ask: why are you grouping with this wizard?  <br>
<br>
Honestly Grimstaff, I don't understand why you think that an untwinked wizard should stand up at ALL to a twinked melee.<br>
<br>
If you take an untwinked melee and compare them to an untwinked wizard the only problem you start to run into is the cost of gear to equip each--mudflation isnt working for casters because there is a lack of good high end gear.<br>
<br>
This isn't a question of a twinked xxx vs. a twinked yyy.   Those numbers would be so skewed as to no matter.<br>
<br>
Untwinked (meaning you attain all gear with the character and only buy things that you could attain) there is really no difference until around level 40 (when a level<br>
<br>
Generally whats the progression on something simple, such as a robe?<br>
All prices are Xev current market prices.<br>
Newbie Robe, Crystalline Robe(120pp), Froglok Bonecaster(3.5kpp), Tolapumj Robe(7kpp)<br>
<br>
In the mean time, there isnt anything high end that is driving the prices down, and all it would take is a little more mana, or a few resists, or maybe a couple of non-required stats.<br>
<br>
It's always depressing when you can look at people that are not in uber guilds and tell exactly what robe they are wearing.  Most classes can't do that nearly as easily. (even before luclin models) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 5631<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/19/02 7:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What remains to be done?</span><hr size=1> Actually I'm not concerned about melee, that's what focus items are for.

That's an area that, if anything, has gotten worse for Wizards and as of yet hasn't even been looked at by Verant.<br>
<br>
Incidentally sight spells make perfect sense for Wizards.  The original description of the class specifically mentioned sight spells as part of the class design, and Wizards have more than any other class.  By &quot;fog&quot; I mean &quot;additional environmental clutter caused by rain, fog, etc&quot; not the fog some zones have just for decoration or other reasons like Tox Forest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usiryakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/22/02 5:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> melcar, spell cost reduction does more than that.<br>
<br>
It allows you to do 10% more.<br>
<br>
Damage Foci allow you do to 10% more damage.<br>
<br>
Now, IMHO, focus items still need work.  I'm still for spell-specific foci.<br>
<br>
Wand of Ice Shock.<br>
Focus: Shock of Ice<br>
+300% mana<br>
+1000% damage<br>
<br>
Voila.  A Wand with a built-in level limit (in this case, L 1), that makes an old L 1 spell into a much much more powerful spell.<br>
<br>
Or:<br>
Halo of the Comet<br>
Focus: Ice Comet<br>
+100% mana (ie, 2x mana)<br>
+200% damage (ie, 3x damage)<br>
-20% aggro<br>
<br>
Tell me that wouldn't be a good drop off a L 65 mob?  And, even if it was tradeable, it wouldn't be treded for a long time, until mudflation set in.  Just like an uber DROPable warrior blade.<br>
