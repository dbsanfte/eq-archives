The tents of many campers were set on the flat land around the druid ring.  Among them, groups of adventurers were clustered, preparing for departure or splitting the loot they had gathered.  Vendors auctioned their wares, and porters shouted their destinations.<br>
<br>
Krushh stretched and scratched himself, then rummaged in his pack for something to drink.  His expression sobered as he came awake more fully and remembered his present circumstance.  He scratched despondently.  Jiori was gone, and would never walk Norrath again.  A terrible plague from a place called Camelot had visited the guildhall of the Adepts and his guildmates were fading away to ghosts.  Each time he visited the guildhall, fewer and fewer cloaks were hung on pegs by the door.<br>
<br>
He had been camped in the commons for several days now.  Sometimes he could find a group to hunt with.   Other times he searched in vain, eventually crawling back into his tent to lose himself in sleep. <br>
<br>
Gazing blankly at the shifting scene in front of him, Krushh became aware of something familiar.  There it was!  An Adepts guildtag!  Who still lived?  He rose to his feet, head and shoulders above most of the crowd, and spotted the wearer.   It was the guild's high elf wizard, probably doing ports.<br>
<br>
Krushh hurried toward him, hoping to get his attention before he poofed out of sight again.<br>
&quot;Hail, wizard,&quot; he said loudly, as soon as he was within earshot.  He wished suddenly that he was better at remembering names.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, Krushh,&quot; said Laenyel pleasantly, turning to face him.  &quot;How are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Krushh guud,&quot; he answered.  &quot;But no Adepts to fight wif.  Krushh sad.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; said Laenyel, his face clouding over. &quot;Most have fallen to the plague.  Seyah grieves sorely.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cleric alive?  Dat guud.&quot; said Krushh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, alive for now,&quot; Laenyel agreed, &quot;but she is not doing well.  The loss of Merwyn, Jiori, and the others has hit her hard.  She says with the guild dead she is useless, and has run off to Faydwer, no doubt to hide in that depressing forest.  I'm worried about her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around, Laenyel continued, &quot;Let's get out of this dust, shall we?&quot; and moved off toward a shady tree.<br>
<br>
Dumbfounded, Krushh followed him in a daze.  A useless cleric?  He boggled.  Why, if he had a cleric, he could hunt something.  Anything would be better than hanging around in the commonlands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Krushh need cleric,&quot; he said, sitting down beside the wizard in the shade, &quot;but she won't talk to Krushh,&quot; he finished glumly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, under normal circumstances I think she might speak to you,&quot; Laenyel responded.  &quot;She had a lot of fun in Crystal Caverns.  But in her current frame of mind, you're probably right.  I'd bet she's reverted to only speaking elven.&quot;<br>
<br>
They both stared gloomily at the druid ring in front of them, where casters in robes mingled with melees in armor.  Small halfling druids pattered through on furry feet.<br>
<br>
Laenyel broke the silence.<br>
&quot;Speak any elven, Krushh?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope,&quot; Krushh answered, with regret.  He wished he were an elf.  It would make things easier, sometimes.<br>
<br>
They sat in silence again.  A group of adventurers ported into the ring, laughing with relief, and walked a short distance before collapsing into the grass, happily discussing their spoils and dramatic escape.  Krushh eyed them jealously, then turned to Laenyel, his jaw set with determination. &quot;Teach Krushh elven...Please.&quot;<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
He skirted the edge of the dark, dripping forest, trying to remember everything the wizard had told him.<br>
&quot;Our names are Laenyel and Seyah.  See if you can pronounce them, now.&quot;<br>
&quot;If you have trouble with the guards in Faydwer, join the forces killing orcs in the North&quot;<br>
&quot;Try to be wounded when you see her.  She's a sucker for a wounded tank.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't eat anything that's still alive in front of her.  Here, these steaks ought to hold you for a week or more.&quot;<br>
His head ached with the knowledge of the lispy elven tongue.  But Laenyel had pronounced him understandable.  And it seemed he was.  A few dozen orc bounties had convinced the Felwithe guards of his good intentions, and they had understood him well enough to point him to this dripping forest of Lesser Faydark, where Seyah had last been seen.<br>
<br>
Rounding a small hill, he didn't see the elf at all until she slammed into his chest at a dead run and bounced off, falling backward into an undignified heap.  In a flash she jumped back to her feet, and, dodging him as though he would grab her, she ran around him and headed back the way he had come.  <br>
<br>
Krushh looked after her, mouth hanging open, wondering if that blur of gold was the armor of a cleric.  The sound of running feet made him look back to the front, and coming toward him were two dark elves, who immediately attacked him with their swords.  Krushh could see he would have his hands full; the dark elves were quite powerful despite their small stature.  He counterattacked by instinct, trying to assess his chances.  One of them alone he might have been able to defeat.  Maybe both, if he had a little help, but if that blur was the cleric he sought, she was out of sight by now.  Gah!  He decided he was going to have to run.  No sense in dying in this forsaken forest.<br>
<br>
He turned and ran, hoping he would find safety before the Tier'Dal finished him off.  He felt a dagger pierce through a slit in his treeweave, and recognized with a sinking feeling the burn of poison on the blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; he thought wryly, &quot;Now I really need a cleric.&quot;<br>
<br>
He sped along the edge of the forest, looking for a safe place to hide, wondering if he could find his way back to Felwithe.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly from his right he glimpsed a flash of gold, and quickly he ran toward it, seeing a hidden passage between high hills.  Safety at last.  Emerging into a small clearing, he saw Seyah, clearly ready to flee, but looking at him intently.  He stopped.  After a moment she approached him cautiously, and placed a tiny hand on his Adepts guild symbol.<br>
<br>
&quot;Krushh,&quot; she said, and he nodded in acknowledgment. <br>
Then, talking as though to herself, she continued, &quot;Those goons were so close behind me I thought you were part of their trap.  I didn't realize I'd seen the guildtag until I was at the entrance.  Wonder what you are doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Breathing heavily from his dash through the woods, Krushh said nothing, but smiled down at Seyah.  He could understand her!  He'd found her, and she spoke elven, and he could understand her at last.  His smile became a grin.<br>
<br>
She didn't notice.  She was staring dejectedly at the grass at his feet.  <br>
&quot;Well, two Adepts left, then.  A soloing wizard, and a smelly, stupid beast of a warrior too many seasons above me to find me of use.&quot;  Her shoulders sagged, and she sank to the grass. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Krushh thought about her words.  He looked down at his treeweave and took a surreptitious sniff.  Well maybe he had a little more &quot;extra AC&quot; than was strictly necessary.  But he hadn't eaten anything alive in days, since Laenyel explained to him about the elven diet.  Besides, really only froglok tads were tasty uncooked.  And true, he was no Erudite, but he'd been smart enough to learn elven, hadn't he?  This would be so much easier if he were an elf.  He scratched despondently.  <br>
<br>
Scratching reminded him of the wound in his back.  His expression lightened.  Laenyel said she was a sucker for a wounded tank.  Carefully forming the words so she would understand him, he asked, &quot;Seyah, heal Krushh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Please,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
Seyah jumped to her feet with a stricken look, her face reddening, chanting a heal.  As soon as she finished the words of the spell, she exclaimed &quot;I'm so sorry!  I forgot to look...&quot; her voice trailed off, and she stared at Krushh, a frown furrowing her brow.<br>
&quot;Krushh doesn't know my name.  And he doesn't speak elven.  Who are you, Foul enchanter, to take ogre form and trick a cleric?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Krushh blinked, wondering what to say.  Seyah began to back away.  &quot;Seyah stop!&quot; he said hastily, &quot;Laenyel teach Krushh, errrr taught me elven!&quot; <br>
&quot;And your name,&quot; he added sheepishly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why isn't he here with you then?&quot; she challenged.  &quot;And you're pronouncing my name wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He said you were angry with him.  And your name is hard to say!&quot; he said with exasperation.  Somehow this was not the conversation he had envisioned. <br>
<br>
To his relief, Seyah started to smile.  &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she said,  &quot;I guess that's true.  I was rather put out with him the last time I saw him.  It was just so irritating to have him come in loaded with pelts and bounty and brag about killing things four at a time.  I can't solo moss snakes.&quot;   &quot;Baby moss snakes,&quot; she added, ruefully, her face falling again.  She sat down on the grass again, head bowed.  <br>
<br>
Krushh nodded in agreement. &quot;Hard for Krushh, too.  Even with bandages.&quot;<br>
Seeing his opportunity, he pursued it.  &quot;Let's hunt something together?  How about um... inkies?&quot;  He jerked his head the way they'd come, thinking of their recent attackers.   <br>
<br>
Seyah looked up at him thoughtfully, and Krushh held his breath, looking for clues in her face.  She looked at him so long he had to exhale, and he shifted uncomfortably, trying to resist the urge to scratch.  Finally she squared her shoulders, and stood up, brushing off her armor and picking up her pack.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They tell me 'Go where you are needed'&quot;, she said, &quot;and I expect those inkies 'need' to be disposed of.&quot;  She smiled faintly, and nodded in the direction of the passage they had come through.  Krushh grinned happily.  <br>
&quot;Follow me,&quot; he said, and headed back for the forest.<br>
<br>
Seyah paused for a moment behind him, tipping her head to the side and looking skyward quizzically. <br>
&quot;I assume this is in answer to my prayer for a tank,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You couldn't have sent a nice Koada'Dal paladin?&quot;  Sighing resignation, she shouldered her pack, and turned her steps to follow Krushh. <br>
