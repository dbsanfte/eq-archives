I dont think you'll get most groups to budge from the cleric/good tank/ slower at all really.  So we're one of the other three.  So I guess thats what we're compeating against.  I get the LFG all the time, and ususally end up grouping with friends, and times I group with friends its the best xp I get.  Oh well, guess thats my thoughts.  I LFG a lot, but by no means does the wizard class suck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know it's been said time and again (or if it hasn't, ignore that and call me a pioneer) and make your own group.  Out of that list posted above you can make a kick ass group in PoV.<br>

I realize it's kind of hyppocritical for me to say this, as I hate leading groups myself and nearly never do pick up groups, but when 14 people at zone are LFG I often make a snide remark in /g.<br>

There are too many followers (and yes, I am one), and not enough leaders.  Nearly all my groups come from tells to friends asking if they have room.<br>

<br>
'A cleric lfg means I must solo'<br>
<br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
a) no group is going to take a second cleric over a wizard. The only group a cleric will get into is one without one already. Wizards and clerics arent seeking the same spots at all.<br>
<br>
b) if the cleric is lfg .. then group with them (duh)<br>
<br>
How do you think groups start? Do you think they magically spring into being in sets of 6? Invite that cleric/chanter/warrior/necro/bl/druid/shaman blah blah blah and look for more.<br>
<br>
I'll let people into a little secret.<br>
<br>
When I zone into PoV with my cleric, if I dont get a tell immediately (commonly I dont) I wait just as long as my wizard for a group. A zone can only support as many clerics as there are groups. 6 groups, 6 clerics max. 6 groups can support way more than 6 wizards. That's the counterbalance.<br>
<br>
The only way my cleric gets a group if the zone is maxed out is to start a new one. Grab a lfg .. wait .. grab a lfg .. wait .. See any clues here?<br>
<br>
Yeah everyone would love to get a tell to join a full group and go straight off hunting. But ya know what? 4 times out of 5 when my cleric gets that tell it isnt for a full group anyway. Guess what. We have to look for those damage dealers. And wizards do plenty of that.<br>
<br>
If my wizard is lfg, he can solo golems for 8% aaxp a pop. If my cleric is, he has to sit there. In this game not everyone is the same. Be boring if we were.

That seems to be the way that several clerics, enchanters and shamans think it should be.  I have had a few times where I invite one only to have him say 'Oh, I thought you had a full group&quot; and leave to go lfg again or if I ask if he want to join us he responds 'Do you have an enchanter already?'  <br>
<br>
Fairly annoying, but the ones that do that are usually the newbish ones.  <br>
<br>
The worst I have had is when someone was suggesting we needed a second warrior for more damage.  That confused me for a minute.<br>

Every zone I go to anymore seems to either have full groups or have a serious shortage of people to fill all the groups there. I just logged out after my group had to disband when a couple people left for the day. There was another group in the same zone (Dreadlands... yeah i know bad bad), that was oocing the whole time I was there for more people and we were short 3 ourselves half of the time. The pre 50 crowd doesn't seem to be too picky anymore when it comes to grouping with whatever class. at least that is my recent experience. I can't count the number of wizards I see grouped anymore.<br>
<br>
when on my monk alt I wish the younger ones would come here to figure out how to play them more effectively, but aside from that nobody seems to have a problem grouping them. there just isn't enough people left in the old school zones to be picky anymore.<br>

<br>
I have never had a problem finding a group when I want to, or building a group.  The only times I have is when there was really no one in the zone I was hoping to group in.<br>
<br>
I think to many people aren't aggressive enough in lfg or putting together a group.  If you see a half filled group, ask if you can join.  Most times people will say yes, if they are your lvl range.  If you /ooc, it is to easy for that group to just continue what they were doing before.<br>
<br>
With all the balancing effects put in to our class, and with the relative ease of having KEI, we are invaluable to most groups at least under 50.  I can almost chain cast Garrisons MM non-stop with KEI + Focus without drawing aggro or going LOM, and that is about 175dmg a pop.  And if we get adds, I can ghetto mez and burn down/kite adds.<br>
<br>
Maybe we should stop selling ourselves short in the community, and instead, post group strategies from time to time for other classes to see our strengths.<br>

<br>
That's the main reason why you will probably not get too many groups in PoV. I think it's more of a level thing then a class thing really. Are level 59's getting groups ahead of you (aside from clerics)? Or maybe it's a rep thing? Wizards are quite desired in PoV groups as damage dealers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That seems to be the way that several clerics, enchanters and shamans think it should be.

<br>
Guilty~. The reasoning behind this is that if you join a partial group and lose the lfg tag, you do not get group invites to already established groups. These partial groups usually just stay at the zone in not doing anything (even if they can kill stuff) and sit on their asses waiting for a healer or a tank and half the time end up disbanding. This means lots of wasted time not exp'ing. Nowadays, if I get asked for a group I always ask them who they have in the group. If it's a new group being started I let him know to give me a tell once he has an established group, but to say that I am part of the group when he recruits for people (more leverage).<br>
<br>
The reason behind the 2nd part is pretty simple (if speaking for enchanters), enchanters don't stack well at all when not in an ae group. If an enchanter is grouped with a higher level enchanter, he can't mez anything because all of his mezzes gets overwritten, or they bounce off mobs because the 2nd enchanter already mezzed them. Same things for buffs. Unless charm fighting or ae is gonna be the focus of the group (specialty groups), pretty much every enchanter will tell you that they do not group with a second enchanter.<br>
<br>
If other classes won't group unless the group has an enchanter, well they are dumb and probably not worth grouping with anyways..<br>
<br>
All that said, I often do create my own groups. Case in point in PoN one time there was 6 or 7 people lfg and not doing anything (they were all /ooc it one after the other which made it funnier). So I shouted out: ranger, monk, cleric, wizard, warrior come to graveyard for group. And the group was made, took 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
It often just takes initiative. If you are lfg, you should actually lfg. I see people too often just sitting at the zoneline, passively /ooc lfg every 5 min or so like if they are botted. Yeah that will get you groups fast, not. Take the initiative and you will get groups. <br>

<br>
I have gotten tells from people I have not seen in 3 months and 20 levels asking me to come to PoN, PoD, Chardok etc...When I enter into a zone I have grouped in often, I am normally only LFG for a few minutes. Either someone remembers me (common) and has a spot (rare) or I start rounding up the LFG folk. <br>
<br>
Yes, I shoot for melee/healer/slower/me then the other two, but in PoP you need to have most of those abilities to be successful. Once you have a slower, any tank type class is fine, and any of the healer type classes are fine.  There is nothing wrong with Shaman/SK/Druid/me (wiz)/wiz/other. <br>
<br>
Actually, the best PoI group I have ever been in was exactly that, and we did not even need to fill the 6th spot. We were in one of the junkyards on the left flank, broke the spawn and then just kept moving around the horseshoe until our KEI's and mana ran out, which was a good long while.<br>
<br>
Getting us into groups is more about the class than the player if they dont know you. Group has one more spot for a damage dealer, they taking me (58 wiz) or A_random_rogue01, if they dont know either of us?<br>
<br>
Getting into groups is more about the player than the class when they do know you. The longer you stay in the zone, the more regulars you meet and group with.  Be good at your class and you will not stay LFG for long.  <br>

Sure there are times when you can't find a group. I go quad, work on trade skills or farm for one of my twinks.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I despise pick up groups. There usually full of greedy morons that have no clue how to play the game.<br>
<br>
I usually group with guildies also. I have met quite a lot of people outside my guild that way.<br>
<br>
There are a few people I group with regularly now. I enjoy that the most because we all know who is going to do what in any given situation. ie. Shammy slows and dots I root mob so he stops being pounded on and he knows I will be doing that. He doesn't even have root loaded, so it opens an extra spell slot for him to utilize. Root any adds. And I always protect our healer or anyone who is getting pounded to death even if I die doing it.<br>
<br>
Not to mention blowing the hell out of the mobs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bounce --><img src=http://graffes.netfirms.com/smiley/bounce.gif ALT=":bounce"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You just have to find some people that play there class correctly and aren't selfish greedy asswipes and try to make some friends, which can be difficult to find <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Once you do the game really gets fun  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've seen some real duds in the war/cler/enc category and I've seen some real wonderful groups where our healer was a druid or shammy and the tank was a monk ... even in pop!<br>
<br>
Lately, my problem is not finding a group ... it's finding the time from all the other opportunities ... to go grind some exp! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=veccini>veccini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/13/02 9:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wizard groupability</span><hr size=1> I don't know if I just get lucky, but I tend to find groups fairly easily.

I have a serious lack of social skills?  Perhaps I do, perhaps I do not.  I know for damn sure that I need to update my sig.. Im not lvl 60, I am now Lvl 62.  <br>
<br>
On the worst LFG of my night perhaps a week or so ago, I went 6 hours trying to find a group in PoV at level 61.  Fuck, I tried being witty, smart, whatever you wanna call it.  And the most goddamn insulting thing was that I saw this happen sooo many times:<br>
    A monk zones in, sais LFG, and is picked up within 5 minutes.<br>
   A shaman zones in, sais LFG, and is picked up within 5 minutes.<br>
   A rogue zones in and before he can say anything gets invites to half a dozen groups.<br>
   Rinse and repeat for most classes.<br>
<br>
The absolute truth is that although social skills can help you get a group if you play an &quot;undesired&quot; class, you are having to overcome class limitations through use of your social skills.<br>
<br>
Sure, you guys can sit back and say that *I* suck without having any information to back that up.  You can say that I have no personality.. I won't get into a debate on my social skills.. I think they are just fine, thank you.  <br>
<br>
I am just sick of LFG.  I personally feel like I am playing a different game than those of you that say you &quot;never&quot; have problems getting groups.<br>
<br>
Please note that I am talking about PoV in particular here.  If I go to PoN and group with a bunch of mid fifties, they are happy to have me PL them for a bit.<br>
<br>
Do I solo while LFG?  Yep.. I solo golems.  Do I like it?  Hell no.  <br>
<br>
I want to kill mobs that are level appropriate for me--that means killing in PoV or PoS at the moment.  <br>
<br>
** No class should be forced to solo level appropriate mobs  in a MMORPG. **<br>
<br>
To those that made baseless personal attacks against me, fuck you.  To those that responded intelligently but disagreed--thanks but we still disagree.  To those that agreed, well.. look me up on ARo--wizzies stack well and we can duo the golems sometime.<br>
