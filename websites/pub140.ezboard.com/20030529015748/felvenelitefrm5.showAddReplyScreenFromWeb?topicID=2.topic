Drinks had been passed around and a sober halfling could not be found in the house. The laughter and shouting from the pub could be heard from far away as Misty Thicket where the creatures simply ignored the rowdy drunkards. <br>
<br>
It looked to be a regular evening in Rivervale with the worshippers of Bristlebane rejoicing in their faith, but the laughter stopped immediately when an angelic creature entered the pub. <br>
<br>
The young wood-elf entered the room with a smile on her face and a lute in her hands. In her shining blue armor, she greeted the halflings with a warm smile and with a few strums from her lute. Silence fell upon the room and there was not one to speak. <br>
<br>
“A bit quiet today aren’t we friends?” the young wood-elf said. <br>
<br>
Silence fell upon the room once again until one halfling mustered the strength and said with a tremble in his voice, “Are you here to tell us stories miss?”<br>
<br>
The wood-elf beamed a smile at the young halfling and said, “Of course, tis a bard’s calling. What stories would you like to hear of? Stories of heroes and villans? Stories of  cunning and adventure? Stories of deceit and treachery?”<br>
<br>
Upon hearing the bard’s last sentence, the young halfling’s eyes filled with delight. “Oh please miss, please tell us stories of trickery!”<br>
<br>
“A young rogue are ye?”<br>
<br>
The halfling simply nodded at the bard.<br>
<br>
“Very well then...” she said as she strummed a few chords on her lute.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The dark-elf made his way down the halls of Guk with the utmost caution. Guk was an incredibly  dangerous place and a few false steps could lead to death. He peered down every corner and sneaked down every tunnel until he reached his destination. The ghouls and frogloks of Guk did not look favorably upon a thief such as him, no matter how handsome he be. Every step had to be taken with caution, every breathe had to be treated as if it was his last because even the wisest of men could not tell what could happen to such a sly rogue as he. After making his way deep into the hearts of Guk, past a legion of frogloks and ghouls, the dark-elf had reached his destination. He was there for the blade of the assassin, a blade which could inflict fear into the hearts of any soul that the blade scaved. It was a powerful weapon and the dark-elf hoped it be his very soon. <br>
<br>
But when the rouge peered into the room where the assassin’s soul lived, he found not the assasin, but another dark-elf who undoubtedly was after the same prize he was. He glanced at the dark-elf and noticed he was a bit young to take on the assassin. The assassin was an incredibly witty and sly man -- such a young thief as the dark-elf that sat in that room would not be able harm the assassin. <br>
<br>
One thing all rogues know is that in the silence of the shadows, one can reign. So the older dark-elf sat quietly in the dark, hidden from view and silently watched the younger dark-elf as he watched for the assassin to show.<br>
<br>
Hours passed and the fatigue could be seen upon the young dark-elf. He had taken to the bottle several times throughout the period and to think that he was sober would be a foolish thought. More time passed and nothing showed.<br>
<br>
A small sound could be heard, the older dark-elf noticed it, but the younger one had not - he would most definitely pay for that mistake. He could not determine where the noise was coming from, but it was most definitely faint.         <br>
        <br>
Suddenly, a shout of pain echoed through the corridors. The assassin stood behind the young dark-elf and had given the younger rogue a stab to the back. The younger elf quickly moved away and drew his dagger to compete with the assassin. He manuvered around the assassin, trying to inflict any damage he could. The younger rogue was more agile than the older rogue had thought and he had done a great deal of damage to the assassin. The assassin’s mighty blade showcased it’s power though and it had inflicted a numbing fear onto the younger rogue. The young rogue stood there in terror, not able to do anything. The assassin took advantage of this and pierced and his victim several more times, leaving him mortally wounded.<br>
<br>
As the lurker watched, he silently stepped in and out of the shadows, plotting his next step. When it looked as though the younger rogue’s next wound be his last, he quietly left the shadows again and stabbed the assassin. The assassin reeled in pain as he turned to the older rogue -- the assassin would now have to gather his wits with two rogues about. <br>
<br>
The two fought each other and during the whole ordeal, not a sound could be heard from either of them. They both remained in the quiet while they worked away at each other. They maneuvered around each other, each working ferociously to gain the advantage of a backstab. The battle raged on and it looked as if the assassin had gained the advantage. <br>
<br>
        <br>
The wounded rogue watched in horror at the duel between the two. All of his senses were not with him at the time, but he knew he had to raise his dagger to someone - so he stood and took his dagger to whatever was in his way. He swung aimlessly  in the darkness, finding nothing for his blade to impale, but as luck would have it, his final stab before he collapsed fell upon the back of the assassin. <br>
<br>
That stab was the final one of the fight. The assassin fell and so did his blade. The young rogue crawled on the ground for the blade and grasped it in his hands. In his joy, he had completely forgotten about the other rogue who had saved his life. He laid there for several moments, just gathering his senses and pushing the pain away. He finally stood up to leave Guk, but the older dark-elf took advantage of this and backstabbed the younger one with a poisoned blade that would leave him paralyzed for hours. He looked upon the young dark-elf and simply smiled as he took the blade into his possession.<br>
<br>
Without any words, the older rogue reached for his face and removed the mask that he wore. The dark-elf illusion fell and before the paralyzed dark-elf there stood a half-elf. The half-elf smiled and said, “Be happy I spared your life -- your own race would have killed you long ago in your weakness.”<br>
<br>
Sarrick took his bags and proceeded out of Guk, watching his every step once again. He was lucky this time, but then again, he was always lucky - luck of the rogue perhaps.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The halflings stood with their mouths wide open. They obviously liked the story, and the bard was reassured of that when the sounds of applause and cheers echoed throughout the tavern.<br>
<br>
“Tell us another story miss!” one halfling shouted.<br>
<br>
“Day will soon be upon me lad, I must go out to other cities to tell the stories of Norrath. Perhaps one day I will return.” she said with a smile. Her enchantment washed upon the halflings of the tavern and the donations she received that night was very generous -- must be the charm of a bard.<br>
<br>
With drum in hand, she ran out of Rivervale to her next destination. Perhaps the Barbarians in Halas would like to hear her enchanting stories...<br>
