Yadgerobi tells the group, 'armok why ya have no armor on'<br>
<br>
I have this theory that for wizards in experience groups, equipment makes very little difference. In order to test this out, and to gather some more data for this wizard balancing effort, I ventured into Karnor's (vitually everything there gives experience again after the last patch) and got a group in Dog Tower for an hour. I took off all my equipment, but wielded my trusty staff of temperate flux, and kept barrier of force up. I also did normal buffs, including jboots, my Shield, symbol, heroism, and c2. In just the hour that I was there, we had quite a few rotate through, but the pulls were rather steady and we were engaged in combat half the time. In order to control for mana levels, I started with full mana and regained it at the end. My unbuffed INT is a rather pathetic 107. It made working in the mana range a bit challenging, but it was interesting nonetheless. I was on snare duty again for this. Because of all the tanks rotating through, I've ordered the list by dps rather than the usual total damage. Total time in camp was 58:08, though it took me another 2 minutes to med to full, or 1:00:07 (3607).<br>
<br>
(level class ... total dmg ... dmg/sec ... total dmg/sec)<br>
52 war .... 6417 ... 24.87 ... 14.26 (in camp for 7:30)<br>
51 rog ... 43346 ... 24.61 ... 12.42<br>
49 mnk ... 23937 ... 24.01 ... 14.78 (in camp for 27:00)<br>
60 wiz ... 40544 ... 23.02 ... 11.23 (*me*)<br>
5x shd .... 3023 ... 18.43 ... 11.90 (in camp for 4:15)<br>
50 war .... 9870 ... 15.45 ... 10.28 (in camp for 16:00)<br>
<br>
Only the rogue and I were there for the entire hour (as well as a chanter and a shaman... we had 2 clerics in the timespan). I'm not sure what level the shadowknight was.<br>
<br>
Here's a breakdown of my spell usage:<br>
9  Draught of Ice for 5264 dmg, 1720 mana (90% effective)<br>
(7  @ 731, 1@147, 0 resist, 0 fizzle, 1 interrupt)<br>
30 Solist's Icy Spear for 35280 dmg, 9000 mana (98% effective)<br>
(29 @1200, 1@480, 0 resist, 0 fizzle, 0 interrupt)<br>
44 Concussion 1063 mana (3 resist, 3 fizzle, 0 interrupt) <br>
22 Atols  2438 mana (4 resist, 5 fizzle, 0 interrupt) <br>
7  Bonds  525 mana (0 resist, 0 fizzle, 0 interrupt)<br>
<br>
total: 14746 mana (24.52 mana/tic); 2.75 dmg/mana (3.60 dmg/mana for combat spells + 1/2 concussion)<br>
<br>
In the past, I haven't controlled for the difference in mana levels at the start and end of a session. I'll try to do this more often, as it gives more accurate damage output figures. The exception to this is for single encounters, where end mana level does not matter.<br>
<br>
Adjusting for snare by multiplying the combat spell dmg/mana by mana used we get:<br>
60 wiz ... 53085 dmg ... 30.14 DPS ... 14.72 TDPS<br>
<br>
I asked all the tanks what weapons they had:<br>
51 rogue: gold plated koshi and lucustlure<br>
49 monk: wu stick and yak club<br>
52 war: runeblade sword of night and club of ice ocean<br>
<br>
For this session I was limited by agro about as much as mana.  Virtually any time I cast Icy Spear it virtually guaranteed the Drolvarg in question would pick me as it's next target for a couple rounds. Concussion would convince it otherwise, so I ended up casting Concussion a lot this fight.  The pattern was: snare it a couple seconds after it got pulled (unless it had a friend), land a concussion and sit down to med.  Start casting Icy Spear once it reached 75% health, concussion, and follow up with another icy spear or draught depending. It is very interesting to note that even with NO resist gear on, and only with my shield spell, I had a magic resist of 49; and yet I resisted 6/7 self snares.<br>

Edit: adding speculation about a 51 wizard in this situation<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here's a bit of speculation about how a level 51 wizard would do in the above test. Substitute Ice Comet for Icy Spear, and Draught of Fire for Draught of Ice:<br>
<br>
9 Draught of Fire for 4630 dmg, 1720 mana (90% effective)<br>
(7@ 643, 1@129, 0 resist, 0 fizzle, 1 interrupt)<br>
22 Ice Comet for 24147, 8800 mana (98% effective)<br>
(21@1120, 1@627, 0 resist, 0 fizzle, 0 interrupt)<br>
(rest is the same)<br>
<br>
total: 14546 mana (24.20 mana/tic); 1.98 dmg/mana; (2.60 dmg/mana from combat spells)<br>
<br>
51 wiz ... 28777 ... 16.34 DPS ... 7.98 TDPS<br>
<br>
Adjusting for snare gives slightly better numbers:<br>
51 wiz ... 37820 ... 21.48 DPS ... 10.49 TDPS<br>
<br>
These estimates are probably a bit on the high side, as they do not take into account increased fizzle and resist rates. Even so, the numbers are a bit lower than I had expected. It does indicate, however, that the numbers are not way out of whack with the others of the same level range. The damage rate is on par with the level 50 warrior, and is about 40% below the 52 warrior and monk, and 20% lower than the 51 rogue.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Edit 2: meditation calculation<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Through the magic of lots of interesting math and a little log scrubbing, I've determined that I gained mana through meditation for 45:18, and thus missed mana because of standing or FM for 14:48 (24.6% of the total). Given that we were in combat a total of 29:21, that was a whole lotta standing (50.4% of combat time was standing, assuming no wasted med ticks to full mana).<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Edit 2: combat duration calculation<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
There were a total of 32 fights at an average of 55.0 sec/fight<br>

Here is a log I parsed from this weekend when me and some friends went to farm gems in SG. BTW - we scored 9 BP gems, but anyway on to the log.<br>
<br>
This was pretty much a constant pull group with one exception when the ranger agro'd a bunch of sirens when he was GFluxed and we had to camp out. Naturally this does not count damage due to damage shields or any spells by others. Necro pet was not used the entire time because pathing made it a lot of work for the necro trying to do crowd control and keep close by.<br>

I had to use robe to keep up a decent amount of mana. I only harvested when I would go LOM, not every time it refreshed. Also had PotG and BoF for mana regen (9 mana/tick). The first 12 mobs I was on stun duty but the sirens still managed to debuff our warrior so I switched to pure damage after the 12th mob. Had I gone pure damage from the 1st mob I think I would have come closer to matching the rangers damage or maybe even exceeding it.<br>
<br>
Another interesting item is the relative inefficiency of Tears of Solusek. On average, each cast landed almost exactly 2 waves (1208 damage/mob average). Some debuffing (other than flux staff) would probably make this more efficient.  Next time I will try to get an epic rogue in the group to see how it changes the damage output of the group. <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: arial"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor Kilbringer</b></a><br>Evoker of the 58th Conclave<br><span style="font-size: 10px">Vini, Vidi, Nuki</b><br>

<br>
I did another session in Karnors last week. After a couple false starts, we finally settled down and spent about an hour and a half in dog tower. I wore my best equipment for this outing, which included a FT1 item (7th shawl). However, this time around we did not have the luxury of an enchanter, so no clarity was available. We did have a shaman for haste and slow, however. Primarily because of less healer mana, our fight time was about 39% instead of the more common 50%. There was a ranger in this group, so I was relieved of snaring obligation. As before, after I was done, I went to a quiet corner and meditated up to my start mana level (80%) to factor this out in the damage rate calculations. Total time in camp was 1:23:53, though I wasn't up to pre-camp mana level until 1:30:06. Total time spent fighting was 32:34, or 38.8% of the camp time.<br>
<br>
(level class ... total damage ... dmg/sec ... total dmg/sec)<br>
60 wiz ... 75372 ... 38.57 ... 13.94<br>
51 rog ... 58438 ... 30.92 ... 11.61<br>
53 mnk ... 56919 ... 29.13 ... 11.31<br>
53 rng ... 25857 ... 16.25 .... 5.14<br>
<br>
We also had a shaman and a cleric providing buffs and support. The Monk was the puller and main tank and took the most damage (14183). The ranger missed a couple minutes of action while out trying to track mobs, but still took 7216 damage. The rogue took 3125 damage. I drew agro several times, but the mobs never got through my damage shield so I took no damage despite 89 hits. Without the damage shield I would estimate about 6500 damage done to me.<br>
<br>
Spell breakdown:<br>
31 Draught of Ice: 13452 dmg / 4515 mana(2.98 dmg/mana) 87.6% effective<br>
--- (17@731, 2@439, 1@147, 1 on dead, 1 no-LOS, 9 interrupt)<br>
56 Icy Spear: 61920 dmg / 16050 mana (3.86 dmg/mana) 96.4% effective<br>
--- (49@1200, 2@960, 1@720, 1@480, 1 fizzle, 2 interrupt)<br>
17 Concussion: (1 fizzle, 1 interrupt) 413 mana<br>
1 Bonds of Force: 75 mana<br>
8 Harvest<br>
16 Barrier of Force (3 interrupt)<br>
<br>
Total: 75372 dmg / 21053 mana (23.37 mana/tick); 3.58 dmg/mana<br>
<br>
What I find interesting about this session is that my rate of mana expenditure (23.37 was extremely close to my rate during the naked karnors run (24.52). There are only a couple factors that I can offer to explain this: First off, I had an FT1 item. Second, I harvested 8 times in 90 min (2.67 mana/tick) vs 4 times in 60 min (2 mana/tick). That still leave about 8 mana/tick unaccounted for.  My guess is that the slower pull group resulted in me catching more med ticks. Also, being relieve of snare duty allowed specialization to kick in more frequently, and the mana savings does not enter into the equations as it is not knowable. Clearly, more study of this is required.<br>
<br>
Substituting our mythical 51st level wizard (who uses Ice Comet and Draught of Fire in place of Solists Ice Spear and Draught of Ice, respectively) gives us:<br>
<br>
31 Draught of Fire for 11832 dmg / 4515 mana (2.62 dmg/mana) 87.6% effective<br>
--- (17@643, 2@386, 1@129, 1 on dead, 1 no-LOS, 9 interrupt)<br>
42 Ice Comet for 42112 dmg / 15800 mana (2.67 dmg/mana) 95.2% effective<br>
--- (35@1120, 2@896, 1@672, 1@448, 1 fizzle, 2 interrupt)<br>
<br>
total: 53944 dmg / 20803 mana (23.09 mana/tick) 2.59 dmg/mana<br>
<br>
51 wiz ... 53944 ... 27.61 DPS ... 9.98 TDPS<br>
<br>
Note also that it is unlikely that a 51 wiz would have Barrier of Force and a FT1 item at his disposal.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Edit: meditation calculation<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Through the magic of lots of interesting math and a little log scrubbing, I've determined that I gained mana through meditation for 1:13:06, and thus missed mana because of standing or FM for 17:00 (23.3% of total time). Given that total combat time was 32:34, I was standing while in combat for 52.2% of the combat time.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>

I still need to factor in free nuke items, and the cost of snare when it is used, but that will come at a later date.<br>
<br>
Here are the formulas:<br>
<br>
TM = ((TT - (CT/2 + MT))*Med + (CT/2 + MT) + TT*(Buff mana regen + harvest*5/600))/6 <br>
TD = TM *dmg/mana<br>
TDPS = TD/TT<br>
<br>
TM = Total Mana used in combat<br>
TT = Total Time in camp<br>
CT = Combat Time (time spent fighting)<br>
MT = Move Time (time spent moving rather than medding/fighting)<br>
TD = Total Damage done<br>
TDPS = Total Damage/sec<br>
<br>
To convert TDPS to the DPS figures used by tanks and which is spit out by the parsing programs (and Copland's Weapon Analyzer):<br>
<br>
DPS = TDPS * TT/CT<br>
<br>
... and to convert the other way, putting tank DPS figures into TDPS:<br>
<br>
TDPS = DPS * CT/TT<br>
<br>
These formulas are generic, and can be applied to any level. One of the interesting implications of the formula is that wizard damage slowly goes up with less combat time, while tank damage rapidly goes down. There are some innaccuracies with the wizard forumula as you approach all combat and zero combat, but on the balance it's pretty good. The magic part of the formula is the prediction that 50% of combat time is spent in meditation, and all time not in combat is spent in meditation (except for time spent moving -- MT). Another magical assumption is that harvest is 5/6 efficient, which is being very generous. Finally, the formula assumes that no mana regen is wasted due to FM, though if you count this time as MT and it would work.<br>
<br>
Also, since wizard damage increases with slower pulls, and tank damage decreases, we can find the point at which they intersect, and determine the rate of pulls at which wizard damage efficiency equals that of the melee class we are comparing ourselves to.<br>
<br>
In the level 60 game, I've determined that top end rogues, monks, and warriors will do about 100, 80, and 60 dps in experience camp combat, respectively (discounting procs).  Applying my 3.6 dmg/mana from my Karnor's logs, and assuming a group with an enchanter, giving me gob, c2, BoF, and FT1 for mana regen buffs, here's the breakdown at various pull rates:<br>
<br>
25% fight time (this is VERY slow... almost raid level rate):<br>
Rogue: 25 TDPS<br>
Wizard: 23 TDPS<br>
Monk: 20 TDPS<br>
Warrior: 15 TDPS<br>
<br>
33% fight time (this is on the slow end of real XP groups):<br>
Rogue: 33 TDPS<br>
Monk: 27 TDPS<br>
Wizard: 22 TDPS<br>
Warrior: 20 TDPS<br>
<br>
40% fight time (a normal group -- should be our target)<br>
Rogue: 40 TDPS<br>
Monk: 32 TDPS<br>
Warrior: 24 TDPS<br>
Wizard: 21 TDPS<br>
<br>
50% fight time (fast pull group)<br>
Rogue: 50 TDPS<br>
Monk: 40 TDPS<br>
Warrior: 30 TDPS<br>
Wizard: 20 TDPS<br>
<br>
67% fight time (insane pulls)<br>
Rogue: 67 TDPS<br>
Monk: 53 TDPS<br>
Warrior: 40 TDPS<br>
Wizard: 19 TDPS<br>
<br>
Preliminary conclusion: a reduction in mana cost of DDs by 33% at level 60 would put us even with the monk in TDPS with a 40% pull rate. Cutting mana cost of DDs by 50% would put us even with the monk in a fast pull group.<br>
<br>
In the future, I'll compute the charts for other levels, and give some recommendations about that. In addition, my next formula will relate to wizard output in a boss encounter, where total mana and mana regen both come into play.<br>

<br>
Here's a couple more data points using applications of the formula:<br>
<br>
Comparison #1: twinked level 18 warrior vs level 18 wizard<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
My warrior twink was level 18 when I measured his damage output at 9.14 DPS in combat. He was dual wielding a light velium warsword (10/23) and a blackjack (7/21). These are nice weapons, to be sure, and are clearly twink material, but are not obscene (you could probably pick up the pair for about 5kp, depending on your server). I got the blackjack in a trade, and the light velium warsword when I was in a group in DN and no one wanted the drop (prior to my days in Triton, btw).<br>
<br>
My mythical level 18 wizard that I'm using for comparison has meditation skill maxed and thus gains 6.8 mana every tick. He also is fortunate enough to be fighting with the benefit of breeze. He is using flame shock, and is very successful with his resists, and so is 90% efficient. This gives him 1.272 damage/mana. Using the formula, this gives him 1.35 TDPS when fighting 60/60 minutes, and 1.76 TDPS when fighting 10/60 minutes.<br>
<br>
In this situation, our warrior and wizard have the same damage output when they are fighting 10/60 minutes (17% of the time). With our target range of 40% fighting (24 minutes), our wizard does 1.6 TDPS, while the warrrior does 3.9 TDPS. This means that our wizard in a normal pulling situation is doing only 40% of the damage of the warrior.  You would have to reduce the cost of the wizard's to 40% of it's current value to be able to keep up with the warrior.<br>
<br>
It is also interesting to note that my warrior has very good armor for his level, and takes about 2 DPS damage from the opponents he faces in the basement of Kurn's Tower.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: The situation is very dire for low level wizards competing with even moderately twinked melee's.<br>
<br>
Comparison #2: level 52 warrior/monk/rogue vs level 51 wizard<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It's a bit trickier to get good data for melee classes at this level, but scouring my logs, I think that it's reasonable to use 25 DPS as the damage figure for a reasonably well equipped level 52 warrior, and 30 DPS as the damage figure for a level 52 monk or rouge (same for both).<br>
<br>
The wizard is easier to figure out, as we just assume maxed meditation skill and 90% efficiency with draught of fire. I'm also assuming that our wizard has clarity 1 and harvest at 80% efficiency for mana regen. His damage rate works out to 8.97 TDPS when fighting 60/60 minutes. At the more leasurly rate of 10/60 minutes, it works out to 12.30 TDPS.<br>
<br>
The wizard will equal the monk/rogue at 22/60 (37%) active fighting, and the warrior at 26/60 (43%) engaged time. Our target of 24/60 (40%) puts the wizard in between the monk/rogue and warrior! It is a bit on the low side, but is in the target range.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: Wizards at level 51 are well balanced(!!). They will suffer a bit in fast pull groups (50% uptime), but with better buffs (c2/manaskin), wizards end up again between warriors and monks/rogues.<br>

 OK heres the deal, as a wizard, from the start from verant I was told I would be the largest direct damage dealer (direct damage includes melee). eventhough necros are more mana efficient, in raids or groups, their dots never come to fruition, but what about rogues. They outdamage me by like 3 fold on a normal pull. Rogues are low hp high dmg characters of the melee world, wizzies are the low hp high dmg casters, we should do comprable damage. Here's a thought that wouldn't unbalance a wizzie, give us an HP-proportional nuke! that would make us wanted and not enable us to solo too well, make the nuke a full bub of mana at like 55, and make it do 7%hp of the mob for high hp mobs, that way we can't solo with it but we are uber in raiding groups! for low hp mobs it could do 15%hp, so we still can't solo with it!<br>
I just find we suck in groups cuz any mob a wiz would want to group for has way too much hp<br>

<br>
In order to gather some more data for my formula for prediciting wizard damage over time in a group setting, I headed back to the now familiar confines of the Dog Tower in Karnor's Castle. As a bit of a side note, I found it extremely easy to get into the group I wanted in Karnor's. I just walked to where the group was, counted noses, and offered my services. This is while others were stuck shouting /LFG at the zone... All in all, it was a good chance to meet some new friends (and some old friends playing alts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )...<br>
<br>
For this outing, I was lucky enough to shoulder someone else with snare duty for the entire outing. Since I wanted to calculate the effect of using a Rend Robe, I used my Robe a LOT in this outing, though I also used Solist's Ice Spear and Draught of Ice quite a bit as well. I used concussion a lot less, and so I tanked a bit, letting my epic skin soak up some of the damage. The total time in the camp was 1:50:06, though 40 minutes in we had a complete turnover of most of the party. We were fighting for 13:24 in the first session (33.4% engaged) and 21:09 in the second session (30.2% engaged). The pulls seemed slow, though for the first session we only had a druid as a healer, so we were limited by his mana more than anything. For the second session, we had the druid and a cleric, but pulls actually went slower because of a dearth of mobs to pull. To give you an idea... the cleric got bored and started casting stuns...<br>
<br>
There was a short period at the start of the second session where we only had a 52 shadowknight and me as damage dealers, and I found it rather difficult to maintain my role as damage dealer in this situation as the SK could not keep agro and allow me to use my rend robe. We picked up a 55 rogue shortly thereafter, and it went much better. There was a low 50s chanter who kept me set with clarity 1 and gift of magic for the entire night. As before, I meditated to full after I was done to normalize the mana regen results.<br>
<br>
Without futher ado, here are the results:<br>
<br>
(level class ... total dmg ... dmg/sec ... total dmg/sec)<br>
<br>
both sessions (31.4% engaged):<br>
60 wiz ... 138076 ... 66.61 ... 20.90<br>
<br>
first session (33.4% engaged):<br>
52 rog ... 27949 ... 36.53 ... 11.62 (no epic)<br>
55 rng ... 18541 ... 23.06 ... 7.71<br>
51 rng ... 14365 ... 18.85 ... 5.97<br>
<br>
second session (30.2% engaged):<br>
55 rog ... 48575 ... 45.02 ... 11.57 (TDPS is really a bit higher, as he joined late, no epic)<br>
52 shd ... 19992 ... 17.75 ... 4.76 (he was working on 1hs, so his damage was below normal)<br>
<br>
My spell breakdown:<br>
90 Rend: 58958 dmg / 0 mana (83.5% effective)<br>
-- (74@784, 2@471, 1@dead, 13 interrupted)<br>
59 Draught of Ice: 26318/8708 (3.02 dmg/mana)<br>

4 trans, 1 interrupted, 675 mana<br>
30 Barrier of Force (14 sec each)<br>
<br>
total mana: 23608 (21208 after harvest) or 21.4 (19.2) mana/tick<br>
overall: 3.45 dmg/mana; 6.02 dmg/mana counting rend<br>
<br>
21 kill shots<br>
58 total kills<br>
average fight time: 35.74 seconds<br>
<br>
mob breakdown:<br>
1 Drolvarg captain: 0:59 avg time, 26.49 DPS<br>
17 Drolvarg guardian: 0:41 avg time, 20.75 DPS<br>
39 Drolvarg sentry: 0:34 avg time, 14.53 DPS<br>
3 skeletal guardian: 0:28 avg time, 21.68 DPS<br>
2 skeletal lookout: 0:27 avg time, 11.70 DPS<br>
1 spectral curate: 0:41 avg time, 2.37 DPS (caster)<br>
<br>
Mana regen buffs I had up:<br>
BoF (3), Clarity (7), FT1 (1) -- 11 mana/tick<br>
<br>
This was the first outing where I spent a notable amount of time at FM, so I had some mana potential wasted that way. At first this was due to the healer (druid) being OOM, but once we got a cleric in there too, the problem persisted because of a lack of available mobs. Since I ended up in a nominal tanking role for part of this outing, I made frequent use of my epic effect to save healer mana. According to the log, my manaskin absorbed a totoal of 162 hits. Assuming an average of 70 dmg/hit, that works out to a little over 11000 dmg absorbed. In addition, I got hit 12 times for actual damage. This puts me above the rogues in both cases, and taking about 1/3 as many hits as the main tank.<br>
<br>
I was the biggest damage dealer by a large margin. For most mobs I would open with Rend as soon as the mob was pulled, and follow up with another Rend or an Ice Spear and close with a Draught if needed. I found that extensive use of the Rend Robe basically meant that I was robe casting instead of meditating during combat. This should make it fairly easy to modify the wizard damage formula to account for the use of right click nukes. Total time spent casting Rend was 21:00, or 60.8% of the engagment time. Only 2 of the Rend Robe interruptions were due to mob attacks, the rest coming because the mob died before the spell fired, or I felt the need to switch to a faster or higher damage spell. Note that I had more than my fair share of kill shots this outing, but as mana was not a issue, this was not troubling.<br>
<br>
A rough guess would put mana lost to full mana at roughly 15 minutes of the total time, which would enable me to do a rough guesstimate of mana regen. 11 mana/tick * 950 ticks = 10450 mana from buffs. This leaves ~530 (600 - 70 for 30 clicks of epic) of meditation *20 = 10600 mana, for a total of 21050, very close to the calculated use of 21208 after harvest.<br>
<br>
Other than the wizard damage figures, the DPS of the 55 rogue is fairly interesting, as he attained 45 DPS without an epic.<br>

<br>
Though all the hubbub of late is about Luclin, I've completed another stage of my wizard damage output research and derived a formula which takes into account the use of right click nukes. This gets into a little bit of math, but nothing more complicated than algebra. I'm sorry if the formula makes it a bit unwieldy, but it really can't be avoided. When I'm all done with this, I will publish some nice graphs which illustrate the situation in a manner which is much easier to comprehend, but for now I'll stick with the formulas. As before, these formulas are for use in calculating a wizard's output in a conventional experience group where mobs are pulled and killed one at a time rather than by use of AE tactics. I don't have any provisions to account for snare in place yet, but that's next on my list.<br>
<br>
First of all, let's do a quick review of our formulas so far.<br>
<br>
TM = ((TT - (CT/2 + MT + FT))*Med + (CT/2 + MT) + TT*(Regen + Harvest*5/600))/6 <br>
TD = TM *dmg/mana<br>
TDPS = TD/TT<br>
<br>
TM = Total Mana used in combat<br>
TT = Total Time in camp<br>
CT = Combat Time (time spent fighting)<br>
MT = Move Time (time spent moving rather than medding/fighting)<br>
FT = Time in camp spent at full mana<br>
Regen = mana regen /tick from buffs<br>
Harvest = amount of mana returned by a single cast of Harvest<br>
TD = Total Damage done<br>
TDPS = Total Damage/sec (assuming all time is measured in seconds)<br>
<br>
To convert TDPS to the DPS figures used by tanks and which is spit out by the parsing programs (and Copland's Weapon Analyzer):<br>
<br>
DPS = TDPS * TT/CT<br>
<br>
... and to convert the other way, putting tank DPS figures into TDPS:<br>
<br>
TDPS = DPS * CT/TT<br>
<br>
For the dmg/mana values, I've found that multiplying raw mana efficiency by 90% gives a fairly accurate value for most exp camp encounters. The lost efficiency comes from fizzles, resists, mana from concussion, and nukes inadventantly landing on corpses. At level 60, this gives the following figures:<br>
<br>
cold (Ice Spear/draught): 3.6 dmg/mana<br>
fire (sunstrike): 3.2 dmg/mana<br>
magic (draught): 2.9 dmg/mana (this will go up with the new Luclin nuke)<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, on to tackling right click nukes. In order to get an accurate picture of damage output relative to tanks, it is extremely important to take these into consideration. Guilds which are equipping their melee's with primal weapons likely are also able to equip their wizards with rend or conflag robes. If we are going to use Primal gear as the standard on the melee side, we need to compare their output to similarly equipped wizards.<br>
<br>
This was a particularly difficult problem, because doing the simple thing of figuring out the theorhetical damage rate and multiplying it by the combat time always gave figures that were much higher than the logs I captured. The situation is complicated a bit by the fact that players will mix in some conventional nukes and other spells when mana allows. Also, the length of the fight had a huge impact on the ability to use right click items. If your average fight is 20 seconds, a Velious quest robe's 24-28 second right click nuke is not going to be very useful. To account for this, I needed to add another factor, which is the average combat duration. We also need to note the item's theorhetical damage output. For purposes of calculating this value, I added one second to the item activation time to account for control lag.<br>
<br>
ACT = Average Combat Time (per opponent, in seconds)<br>
IAT = Item Activation Time (in seconds: raw number + 1)<br>
IDPS = Item's effective DPS<br>
SE = Item's Spell Efficiency. I use 100% for lure, 95% for magic, and 90% for fire/cold.<br>
X = Item use factor (roughly, how many times in a combat the item could theorhetically be used).<br>
<br>
Here are the formulas:<br>
X = ACT / IAT<br>
rawdps = (item dmg) / IAT<br>
IDPS = SE * rawdps * (1 - (2/(X + 1)))<br>
<br>
The IDPS formula is the icky one, but it gives a curve shape that is very close to real world use.  If you plug in the numbers, you'll realize that when the average combat time is less than or equal to the activation time of the item, you get 0 or a negative value. This means that for combats that are shorter than our activation time, the item is worthless. Also, with extremely long combats, you can pretty much chain cast the item and come very close to achieving the theorhetical damage output of the item.<br>
<br>
In order to fit this into the base formula for predicting overall wizard damage, we take into account the fact that a right-click nuking wizard is not going to be spending much combat time meditating. The earlier formula allow the wizard to spend half of his combat time meditating and half doing other stuff. This time around we'll just subtract out that part and add in the IDPS:<br>
<br>
Formulas for TDPS of a right click nuke wielding wizard:<br>
TM(i) = ((TT - (MT + FT))*Med + (CT + MT) + TT*(Regen + Harvest*5/600))/6 <br>
TD(i) = IDPS*TT + TM(i)*dmg/mana<br>
TDPS(i) = TD(i)/TT<br>
<br>
I've plugged the numbers from a couple of my source damage logs that matched the parameters (ie: when I was not on snare duty, and using the Rend Robe) and the predicted value was within about 5% of the actual value.<br>
<br>
Groups I've found myself in tend to have an average combat duration of 45 seconds, though many are 30 seconds, and the hole group had an average of 20.8 seconds.<br>
<br>
One of the nice things about these formulas is that additional nukes and mana regen sources have the potential to change the numbers, but won't impact the formulas. In many ways, the results are similar to melee damage output calculations, where better weapons or buffs will improve their damage output, but the basic formula for calculating their damage output does not. <p>"Evacuate?

<br>
I'll apply some numbers to the formula to give it a bit more concrete meaning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
First off, let's look at the effective damage/sec (IDPS in the formula) of our main right click nukes, assuming an average 45 second fight time:<br>
<br>
Rend Robe: 24.84 dmg/sec (784, 14 sec cast time)<br>
Velk Robe: 18.75 dmg/sec (625, 14 sec cast time)<br>
Velk Orb: 14.31 dmg/sec (250, 9 sec cast time)<br>
Icicle Robe: 4.12 dmg/sec (360, 24 sec cast time)<br>
Solist's Wand: 5.47 dmg/sec (38, 4 sec cast time)<br>
<br>
At level 60, comparing a wizard to primal equipped melee classes, where a rogue does 100dps, a monk does 80 dps, and a warrior does 60 dps (with enchanter haste, of course). I'm using an average of 45 seconds per fight for these comparisons. For all of these values, I'm eyeballing it from my hand-drawn graph...<br>
<br>
With C2, BoF, GoB, and FT1:<br>
33% engagement (slow pull):<br>
Rogue: 33 dps<br>
Wizard: 27.5 dps<br>
Monk: 27 dps<br>
Warrior: 20 dps<br>
<br>
40% engagement (my target for balancing):<br>
Rogue: 40 dps<br>
Monk: 32 dps<br>
Wizard: 28 dps<br>
Warrior: 24 dps<br>
<br>
50% engagement (common fast pull group):<br>
Rogue: 50 dps<br>
Monk: 40 dps<br>
Warrior: 30 dps<br>
Wizard: 29 dps<br>
<br>
67% engagement (very fast pulls, not a realistic target):<br>
Rogue: 67 dps<br>
Monk: 53 dps<br>
Warrior: 40 dps<br>
Wizard: 31.5 dps<br>
<br>
I should point out that many factors used here are advantageous to the wizard. I used the 3.6 dps from using cold based spells. I used 45 seconds per fight which is on the long side, but within reason. The target balance up time of 40% is a bit on the slow side, and slower groups favor wizard's for damage output.  We *do* come out ahead of warriors in the 40% range, but almost exactly halfway between warriors and monks. My view is we should fall in the midpoint of rogue and warrior damage, or equal with monks, so it is my belief that a damage output boost is warranted even for high end wizards.<br>
<br>
As an interesting side note, if you add glades and bard song to our mana regen buffs, at 40% we exactly equal rogues for damage output at 40 dps. Of course, in a normal group situation, this is almost never going to happen. <p>"Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!"<BR>

<br>
I spent a couple hours in the Grey doing AE last weekend. There were a few groups doing it there, and the mobs spawn quickly, so there was plenty to go around. There was a fairly good natured pull contest among the tanks to see how big of a train they could pull, and they got monsterous.  The group composition was as follows:<br>
<br>
60 warrior (puller), 60 enchanter, 2*60 wizard, 2*60 cleric<br>
<br>
The session lasted 3:17:24, though we were only fighting for 19:33 of that, so we averaged about 10% engagement time. I did not bother to log the melee damage, and other's spell damage is not available anyway, so here's my data:<br>
<br>
60 wiz ... 746681 ... 598.3 dps ... 63.0 tdps<br>
<br>
Spell breakdown:<br>
Jyll's Wave of Heat: 56 casts, 1 fizzle, 12 interrupted (14877 mana)<br>
Jyll's Wave of Ice: 45 casts, 6 interrupted (12207 mana)<br>
Draught of Ice: 7 casts, 3 interrupted (860 mana)<br>
Harvest: 10 casts (+3000 mana returned)<br>
<br>
Total mana used was 27944 (or 2.36 mana/sec, or 14.1 mana/tick)<br>
Mana efficiency was 26.7 dmg/mana !!!<br>
<br>
Compare this number against 3.6 dmg/mana for our best DD spells (ice spear/draught combo).<br>
<br>
Kill tally:<br>
My spells killed 190 of our total of 453 mobs (42%).<br>
<br>
My limiting factor was mobs to hit, as I spent a significant amount of time at FM. The biggest pull we had was 57 (of which 54 gave experience), and that netted 2 blue bubbles and change.  The next pull was bigger but resulted in our only wipeout for the evening (though 3 of us made it to the zone). After that, I started pulling every other time. My pulls tended to be smaller (around 20) but took much less time to gather. In later groups, I learned that smaller pulls are far more efficient (roughly 1.5-2 times the exp rate).<br>
<br>
Average warrior pull: 37.5 mobs (10 pulls)<br>
Average Armok pull: 16.25 (4 pulls)<br>
Average other wiz pull: 8 (1 pull)<br>
Average cleric pull: 5 (1 pull) /snicker<br>
<br>
A very interesting factoid: Our warrior commented that he was getting faster experience soloing than pulling these massive AE trains. Soloing it took him about 3 hours per alt level. AoE, it took about 5 hours per alt level. Granted, this warrior is in full ToVN and Sleepers gear (his AC is around 1600 I think), but this is an important fact to remember before nerfing this zone/strat.<br>

<br>
Fast on the heels of my Grey AE (and the big Nerf(TM)), I figured it would be appropriate to post the results of a recent run we had in Chardok just after the Luclin release (but before GreyNerf).  I think it is especially interesting to compare the results of this summary to the Grey AE session. We had a bit of turnover, but our group always consisted of:<br>
1 Warrior (puller)<br>
1 Cleric (healer and extra AE)<br>
1 Enchanter<br>
3 Heavy AE (mage/wiz)<br>
<br>
The session lasted 3:14:53 (almost exactly the same as the Grey session I logged, interestingly enough). We were actively engaged for 22:52 of that, or 11.7% (compare at 10% engagement for the Grey). As before, I didn't bother turning on melee damage, and as we can't log other's damage output, I can only report mine. Without further ado, here's the summary:<br>
<br>
60 wiz ... 836418 ... 597.9 dps ... 71.5 tdps<br>
<br>
compare this with the data from the Grey:<br>
<br>
&gt; 60 wiz ... 746681 ... 598.3 dps ... 63.0 tdps<br>
<br>
Kill tally:<br>
My spells killed a total of 117/307 kills (38%)<br>
We had a total of 8 deaths over the course of the session.<br>
<br>
Hrmm... looks disturbingly similar. I can assure you that we had some good sized trains, but none of them came close to the size we had in The Grey. We had one wipeout at the very end while we were trying to CR our puller (he got too close to something big and nasty).<br>
<br>
However, the pull breakdown was vastly different. We had a total of 27 multi-pulls, and 17 solo pulls. Our largest pull was 17, and our average multi-pull was 10.6 mobs (vs a high of 57 and average of 28.2). Chardok is much more dangerous than the pre-nerf Grey, for several factors including higher hp, higher dmg, and higher MR. We killed a total of 307 mobs in the time of the log, and this works out to:<br>
<br>
94.5 kills/hour<br>
or<br>
15.8 kills/hour/person (almost exactly the same as quad kiting)<br>
<br>
Experience was about the same as in the pre-nerf Grey.<br>

The damage figures are sustainable and so can be applied to camps of arbitrary length.<br>
<br>
First, the disclaimers and assumptions:<br>
- damage is measured in TDPS (total damage/second) which is defined as the total damage done divided by the amount of time spent at the camp. Melee classes therefore do a lower TDPS figure when there is more downtime.<br>
- wizard's use their best DD spell for their level (no rains or AE). At level 60, wizards alternate casting Solist's Ice Spear and Draught of Ice.<br>
- Wizard is not casting snare. Captured data indicates that snare automatically reduces damage output of the wizard when it is in use because of mana cost and increased agro.<br>
- spells are 90% effective. The 10% damage loss comes from resists, fizzles, and concussion casts.<br>
- Wizards are using their best familiar for the level.<br>
- Wizards acquire their epic at level 55.<br>
- Wizards are using the best chanter buff available at the level, but never glades or bard song.<br>
- No figures account for any AA levels.<br>
- Wizard Item graph assumes a wizard is using a Solist's Icy Wand starting at level 12, an Icicle Robe at level 50 (notice the drop in damage output), a Robe of Torrefaction (from Velketor) at level 55, and a Robe of Invocation (Rend Robe) at 60.<br>
- Average combat length is 45 seconds.<br>
- Melee damage data assumes relatively high end (twink) gear. FBSS at level 9, RBG at level 36, CoF at level 51, and ToVN haste item at 60.<br>
- Melee damage assumes best chanter haste for the level is in use.<br>
- There are many holes in the melee chart for raw data. I used measured data for my warrior twink at 18 and 20, measured data from Karnors in the 50-52 range, and measured data for melee classes at 60. Other data points are interpolated.<br>
<br>
I will publish the spreadsheet in web form and downloadable form in the near future, once I add a page for easier manipulation of the figures. The spreadsheet itself has over 5000 numbers, but you only need about a dozen or so to tweak the interesting figures. The downloadable spreadsheet will allow the user to play game designer and increase wizard damage, lower resists, reduce mana cost, etc. to try to produce a graph that is &quot;balanced.&quot; It's tougher than it looks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Also notice the impact that changing the engagment time has on right click nuke effectiveness. <p>"Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!"<BR>

Our monk split the warlord room and had the warlord pulled out from under him, but that's Karnor's for you.  It was some consolation that the group that stole our spawn was unable to handle him and ended up training him to the zone.  Somehow, our warrior was on the hatelist and got summoned to the zone, which is why there is a Call of the Hero listed in my spell log.  Our group was monk, mage, warrior, paladin, druid, cleric.  We had no chanter or shaman, and at no point did I ever feel we were in real danger.  The monk is an awesome puller, and we never had more than 2 or 3 mobs in the camp at once, and when we did the druid effectively used root for crowd control.<br>
<br>
It seemed to me that the primary limiting factor was mobs to pull, and time spent pulling.  I was low mana most of the time, but we never had to rest for mana at all.  One reason I want to post this, is that it was an enchanterless/shamanless/bardless group.  We had no haste, no clarity, no slow, and no mez.  We actually had people complaining that we were pulling the hands from skel captian while otm(no one else was pulling from there, the complainers were people sitting at the zone watching camp checks)<br>
<br>
I used the total pet combat time over the overall time to determine combat uptime for the Magician and the Druid.<br>
<br>
Overall camp time = 3079 (00:51:19)<br>

42 Pet ... 14046 ... 25.40 ... 8.44 (33.23%) (553/1664)<br>
<br>
Estimates for damage shields and pet procs:<br>
<br>
~597 recorded hits from mobs.<br>
<br>
4 casts of Boon of Immolation(I think ~1,200 seconds, or 38% overall time).  If half of the DS time was spent in combat, a rough guesstimate says damage shields could have been active for about 65% of the hits, which is about 388.  It was a 25 point DS, so a guess of about 9,700 damage from damage shields.  (Also, there is some damage shield damage listed under magician nukes, since I was lazy and didn't edit out my own DS hits, which added up to about 250).<br>
<br>
113 recorded hits from pet procs.  Resist rates are completely unknown.  I believe the Max possible damage per proc is 104, so the maximum possible proc damage would be 11,752.  I have a feeling there is a fair amount of partial resists, however.  Given a 75% partial resist rate, the pets would have done 8,814 from procs.<br>
<br>
Here are the numbers adjusted for DS/proc guesstimates.<br>
<br>
55 Mag ... 59,378 ... 54.78 ... 19.28 (35.2%) (1084/3079)<br>

<br>
Preliminary conclusion would confirm what most mages already believe to be true, that is that we're fine in low-mid 50's xp groups.  One thing to note, however, is that an enchanter would actually have a mixed impact on relative value of the magician.  The mage would get clarity, which would increase the nuking portion of mage damage, but the pet would either not get hasted or be hasted for a net increase of about 5-6% more damage.  Slowed mobs would mean less damage from damage shields.  Mezzed mobs would make strategic nukes less important.<br>
<br>
Also note that, while overall I did significantly more damage than a typical wizard would be expected to do, the nuking portion only came out to 4.77 dps over time.  See actinic percussive's Dog Captian data with no clarity.  He was about 10.4 dps for a similar length session, their clarityless group averaged 41 kills per hour.  Armok's &quot;naked&quot; karnors log hypothesizes a level 51 wiz hitting 10.4 dps as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are a few Karnors logs now posted here on the site, and here are the kill rates for them:<br>
<br>
My log(no haste/clarity) : 33 kills per hour<br>
Naked in Karknors(with c2) : 33 kills per hour<br>
Karnors eq. no clarity: 34.3 kills per hour (32 kills per hour after mana level control)<br>
Actinic no clarity : 41 kills per hour<br>
Actinic RCY Karnors with clarity : 39 kills per hour<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to point out that a group doesn't need clarity to work, nor does having clarity ensure a better rate of xp gain.  My theory is that levels, skill, and the ability to work together are far more important than whether or not you have haste and clarity.  Mez is powerful, but obviously not needed in Karnors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br>  Posts: 598<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/2/02 1:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Level 60 shadowknight soloing in Velks</span><hr size=1> (copied from the general forum on 1/2/02)<br>
<br>
This is a wizard board, but I thought it would be important to show the effectiveness of high level melee classes soloing for experience, in order to compare it to wizard soloability. This shadowknight is level 60, and very well equiped (with primal 2hs and paladius axe from Vulak). He uses the primal until he procs avatar, then he switches to paladius to get the better damage output (it is a 51/42 weapon with an 80 pt proc). This SK logged about an hour of fighting (54:26 actually). He was engaged for 23:26, or 43% of the time. Average fight time was 94 seconds.<br>
<br>
lvl class ... total dmg ... dps ... total dps<br>
60 shd ... 89929 ... 63.96 ... 27.53<br>
<br>
Of his damage, 17481 came from spells (mostly procs and lifetaps, to keep himself healed).  He took a total of 25915 damage, and was only self buffed (meaning no clarity and no haste). Over the course of the log, he killed 15 mobs, or a rate of 16.5 mobs/hr (also 16.5 mobs/hr/person).<br>
<br>
I find it interesting to note that his kill rate almost exactly equals that of a quadding wizard, though the mobs he's killing are all deep blue and so will give better experience.  His risk factor is probably about the same as a quadding wizard because of his FD ability if things get nasty.<br>

- I can see an argument for lowering one of the lvl 60 spells to stop 60 being such a big bump<br>
- Without a click item wizards do poorly in &gt;50% uptime (but we knew that already), need some clickies between solist wand and velk robe<br>

I believe it is because each is treating 'uptime' differently in order to calculate dps.<br>
My program considers uptime to be the moment a mob is first registered hitting a player (or vice versa) until the last hit is registered (either way). ie uptime for every member of the group will be identical.<br>
I then divide total damage delt into uptime to give dps.<br>
Other parsers had different uptime figures for each player so likely consider uptime to be the moment that *player* starts hitting a mob until *they* stop.<br>
My method is more fair for comparative purposes since the ratio of dps's is *identical* to the ratios of damage dealt, but means that if a puller grabs a mob and it is 5 seconds before the rogue circles the mob and starts hitting, he is registering 0 dps for those 5 seconds. (However I wont hear the mob hit the puller until he is very close).<br>
In other words, I treat the start of the fight no different to if a mob ran across the room mid fight and the rogue lost contact for 5 seconds. It also means, for example, that time spent fd'd at the beginning of a fight counts against the melee. Dps for the monk and sk were higher in the other parsers because they ignored this.<br>
This is, I feel, the best way to compare melee and caster dps, but gives slightly lower results for melee than the 'traditional'.<br>
If it is confusing, I will post damage delt instead of dps, but understand that the ratios of damage dealt between players will be identical to the ratios of these dps. Maybe I should invent a new term fdps (fight dps) lol.<br>

Well I broke down and left my regular AE group to join some friends in HS for some conventional grouping for a change. I figured I might as well take advantage and parse the log to get an idea of where a non uber guild 60 wiz stands compared to melees. Here's low down:<br>
<br>
Group make up:<br>
60 wiz (me) - KEI, Greater Flappy, MC3, epic, 255int +1200mana, SCF1, no pertinent focus items<br>
60 Pali - Full skyshrine armor or better, epic (35/40), KEI, 36% haste + self haste buff<br>
60 SK - Full skyshrine + Vindi BP, epic (40/45), KEI, 32% haste<br>
60 Necro - stats irrelevant since I could parse his spell damage. He used 59 pet.<br>
59 Cleric<br>
57 SK - Full skyshrine + Vindi BP, 45/46 WToV 2hs, KEI, 31% haste<br>
<br>
The pulls were very fast, the Pali was pulling and he would usually be back to camp as the mobs where dying, sometimes pulling 2-3 at a time. We did North wing + keeper. We where at the camp a total of 84 minutes. Total fight time was 53 minutes for 63% uptime so the &quot;fast&quot; pull feel is right in line with Armok's numbers.<br>
<br>
We killed 104 mobs in that time or about one every 48 seconds. I used mostly Ice Spear and Draught of Ice, with a Sunstrike tossed in every once in a while.<br>
<br>
Damage totals:<br>
60 wiz - 108550 total, 34.1 fight dps, 21.5 total dps<br>
60 pali - 76384 total, 29.5 fight dps, 15.2 total dps<br>
60 SK - 105822, 33.3 fight dps, 21.0 total dps<br>
57 SK - 90459, 29.5 fight dps, 17.9 total dps<br>
<br>
I did have the advantage of KI the entire time and the melees did not get haste so that is one reason That I was able to outdamage everyone, but even with haste, the numbers would not have been all that different. We where able to keep up with the respawn so if anything, more melee damage would have resulted in more down time. It is unlikely I would have cast any less since I rarely cast more than 2 nukes per mob.  <p><div align="center" style="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial"><img src="http://www.bfdesigns.net/eq/wandor_sig.jpg"><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6103"><b>Wandor's profile</b></a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exarch.net/"><b>Fusion of Flame</b></a> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6102" target="_blank"><b>Moordian's profile</b></a></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uelasto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 451<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/26/02 4:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Damage logs</span><hr size=1> Results from another Seb group.
