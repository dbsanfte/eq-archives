LOL  consider this...since kunark came out, our max dmg has been around 1600 every 7 seconds (with no resists, of course), it has stayed there, and will stay there forever!  nothing we will ever be able to do to convince verant that anything needs changed, just learn to deal with it!  tank classes are always gonna get more/better hp/ac/haste items and will continue to WIDEN their lead on us in the dmg output department.  in order for verant to &quot;balance&quot; us now, they would have to double our dmg output, give us the ability to attain 5k hps/1k ac and give us no charge items that do healing/cast spells just to make us EVEN with tanks now!  BAH!  this is why I retired my wizzie 4 months ago, I am just now playing it again and am realizing once again that they still haven't figured this out (now there's even more uber tank items, YAY!).  It's common knowledge that verant has a boner for &quot;forgetting&quot; to add new items/abilities to wizards...  They, themselves, seriously have not played the class and don't have a clue what a wizard can/can't do, all they know is we got this big spell that does 1615 dmg and that sounds like too much for them, because they got warriors that can only triple hit for 200 or so every .00001 seconds with haste and that isn't as big as 1615 to them for some reason...not to mention the INSANE dmg they can do with disciplines!  I've seen some do 1k dmg/hit before with disc/rage going on...no way to compete with that at all!  I've been lvl 60 for 8 months, I felt cheated before...now I feel even more cheated...these new spells are just a way to say, &quot;you get to do 2k dmg, then DIE, thx!&quot;  it's a shame I can land a wimpy lure on a mob that does 825 dmg and out-agro ALL the tanks that have already done 2k dmg!  SOMEONE PLEASE GET A CLUE!!!  I'm not even gonna address the fact that after we put out our dmg, we are OOM and have to sit a good 10 minutes (even with clarity/c2)!  sheesh!  tanks get a cheal and keep right on going... /sigh  /wave wizzy<br>

<br>
Well, I was thinking about this whole wizard balance thing, and I started thinking of how wizards and tanks appear to be designed like cheetahs and wolves.  Cheetahs have excellent speed but have poor endurance (Wizards have the potential to deal massive damage fast but quickly use up mana).  Wolves can't run as fast but have great endurance (Tanks don't deal as much damage at once, but can keep hitting as long as hp allow, which is a long time with clerics healing them).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the Wizards at high levels are like cheetahs taken into the future with no chance to evolve.  Suddenly the wolves can run as fast or almost as fast as the cheetahs (better equipment) and yet they still have great endurance (healers and buffers haven't gotten any weaker which is good!).  To make matters worse, the prey (mobs) have also evolved so that they can run faster (high MR and AC) for longer periods of time (high HP).  What's a cheetah to do?<br>

But, yet again Verant wont fix it. I've had enough with their bs on balancing and what not and I'm sick of waiting. So... you can count me out of EverQuest forever, as for Verant's responses to our class don't thrill me at all. If that's what they think so be it, I'll just leave. Well, later all.<br>

We are not the only class with complaints, however after CAREFULLY examining the other classes complaints, I will list some of them and I assure you, wizards have it the worst and I'm not just blowing my own horn, I was just glad to get a group!<br>
<br>
Cleric complains &quot;my aggro is too high, if I heal I get the mob on me and druids can heal now so all I'm needed for is rezzes and all verant does is nerf me&quot; (fault, they get a rez stick for an epic (relatively easy to get too as well as healing BP's (recently nerfed) and Heal over time, invaluable to any xp or raiding group)<br>
<br>
Magician &quot;I get no root, my nukes don't hit alot of the time and my pet is weak for the mobs I want to fight (problem being, pets constantly deal melee dmg in a group even when they're OOM, they do still have comprabable nukes even though they do have a high resist rate (we get resisted our fair share too) but they do also get major debuffs as well as dmg shields for tanks.<br>
<br>
Rogue &quot;My AC is too low and my aggro is too high&quot; (yes this is what he said basically)(problem being that's their deal, high dmg for low defense and lower selection of weapons and armor, that was in their class description and they do get disciplines)<br>
<br>
Warrior (yes even he had complaints) HP's are not adequate for high lvl mobs, not strong individually and very dependant on spell casting classes. (duh I don't think tanks have any cause to complain, geez they were freakin handed cobalt armor which gives them spells and they get melee disciplines, they knew all that when they got the job, plus we all know invaluable as meat shields and taunt machines for mobs)<br>
<br>
Monk - He actually didn't have any complaints though I'm sure many monks have some.<br>
<br>
Wizards - Nowhere does it say that a wizard will a) be totally useless when out of mana b) is highly resisted even with his lure lines c) have excessive aggro even when outdamaged by a taunting tank d) Be unappreciated by groups and never improved by Verant.  What has me the most pissed off is instead of increasing our mana pool, mana regen, fizzle rate or resist rate, all which are directly related to mana and our effectiveness, they put in 2 lvl 60 QUESTING spells (if you don't have a high lvl group to kill these mobs for you, you're not getting it) which DO have a good mana ratio I think but is a) limited to selected targets b)  Probably do fizzle too much c) Cost 20pp to cast (geez who else has to use peridot's to cast a DD?) d) remotely balance the end-game at 60 and in no way balances the levels between 35-59 where you can hunt in velious but prolly won't get loot since most caster gear (especially wizard only) is NO DROP while melee's can buy a good deal of equipment (especially the kunark class armor, hell even monks got that new crescent stuff with kunark, what did wizards get? the Dagger of frost and a epic with a self only dmg shield YAY).<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the other classes complaints aren't valid necessarily, but at least they're desired in groups, if a mage's pet dies, at least they can cast another and keep on going.  Wizards are the only class with no direct melee ability via pet or otherwise and are completely mana dependant with no other redeeming feature than dmg (except for the obvious ports and evacs but we have no abilities or skills that are UNIQUE to us as a class).  The lure line has been so nerfed that the mana/dmg ratio is obscene especially with such high resists in velious.  The only class I think that may be more screwed over than we are, are the SK's (and they've recently been awarded new spells including necro's summon corpse, new disciplines and less resistance on their HT).  They need desperate help too, but we are Verant's problem child.  Hell, at this point I'd be happy if they just handed us a major debuff like malosi, that might help solve some of our problems, but nah, why would verant give us the ability to do what we were born to?  Just change the description and they can point to it and say this is what you signed up for. <br>
