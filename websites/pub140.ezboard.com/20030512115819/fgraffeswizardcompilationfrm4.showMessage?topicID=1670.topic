<br>
Bards Swarm kiting...This is proabablly the number 1 thing that drove me from my wizard..I flat out got disgusted with it. A bard..A jack of all trades..can kite 15+ mobs with virtually no risk to themselves and VI called MB overpowered? Hell even quadding was never that powerful..Goddamn that just pisses me off everytime i see it. Does anyone other then me..being in a bad mood in general see the Discrepancy here? I mean holy fuck VI Nerfs us and Several other classes If we so much As Breathe wrong..<br>
<br>
Wizards quadding was one damn thing...Druids Quadding slash multi root/dotting is one thing..There is a ton of risk inherant to this..mob resists snare..root etc oom you get the point..Bards swarm kiting has no god damn risk at all..I sat today and watch a Bard swarm kite over 25mobs! 25 fucking mobs Thats a normal AE group pull..And not once did Any of those mobs so much as get within Spitting distance of the bard. Im sorry but after 3 fucking years of playing this game i have to draw the line..this is Utter and Complete BULLSHIT. No class..I repeat NO CLASS should be able to Single handedly kite 20+ mobs within 4 or 5 levels of their level.. This just pissed me off beyond belief..<br>
<br>
Do bards have to have 24 damn AA points to have this ability? no..any rare spells or weapons? no..just their default songs. I dont normally jump on another class but this was simply too much for me to take..Ive sat back and been nice and understanding as far as other classes are concerned..and i dont hold it against the people behind bards..If i played a bard as a main i would take advantage of it..But at VI i am fucking pissed...this is Taking Class unbalancing to a whole new level..They claim they are trying to Balance the classes...this is why they yanked MB from us..and mod rods from the mages..yet They say this is ok? Sorry i fail to see the logic here.<br>
<br>
Im going extreme here but what the hell im venting..Verant wants to Balance the fucking game..heres how.<br>
<br>
Clerics lose Bash..WTF do they need it for anyhow..Next they lose the ability to wear plate armor..What utter crap anyhow..They are the ultimate healers...They damn well should be sacrificing something for this ability..as it stands Clerics Sacrifice not a goddamn thing..they have high AC, Decent melee skills, Nuking ability, Stuns, Roots you name it..fuck its rediculous...Clerics should be healers..cut their nukes in half while your at it..Clerics arent exactlly a Solo class.<br>
<br>
Paladins being the True hybrid of a healer and a tank..should have not quite the healing capabilities of a cleric but they get a good spell lineup as well as decent melee skills...Pallys have a long way to go..right now they suck ass..i dont know WTF VI is smoking give those guys a bone..damn they are the only class who get Screwed more then wizards and necros.<br>
<br>
Warriors..should be the undisputed Tanks...they should have By default 40% more hps then any other class..they are probablly fine the way they are..<br>
<br>
monks..as much fun as i had with my monk single handedly creating trains and derailing them thats again over powered..monks should deal high damage but maintain the best dodging, repost abilities etc their ability to avoid damage should be unrivaled...But their AC should be nowhere Near where it is..when they get hit..they should be getting hit damn near full..<br>
<br>
Rogues...rogues can deal insane damage But cannot stand toe to toe with any melee...From behind untouchable..however their ability to tank should be non existant...rogues are probablly pretty well balanced<br>
<br>
Rangers..Damage dealer with a nice spell lineup..not a tank...i would say well thought out at this point..could potentially use some tweaking..<br>
<br>
Enchanters...enchanters are fine..my wife plays a 60 enc and they do everything their class is suppossed too wonderfully.<br>
<br>
Wizards..Should be the Undisputed Masters of Magical damage..We sacrifice everything for this ability..no melee skills..no defensive skills a very few protective spells..no healing spells Pure Damage...Verants definition of Wizards from the new PoP book. Wizards are the masters of Magical Translocation...WTF 3 years ago when i started this game We were Defined as the Masters of magical damage..Not goddamn Taxies..If i had wanted to Be a Taxi I woulda Asked in Beta for a Transportation Class.. Fuck you verant..Fuck you Fuck you FUCK YOU..I give you a Big hearty Finger.<br>
<br>
Shaman....Tribal healer...They are a far cry from that in this game is all ill say..Shaman solos a dragon...brags about it...VI says Cool...5 Wizards MB a dragon...VI say oh fuck thats way overpowered...uh huh..whatever<br>
<br>
Mage..For christ sake Give them the undisputed best pets in the game..OMG thats what they are defined as are they not.? the premier Pet/summoning class? Perhaps theya re there now..havent talked to a mage lately..<br>
<br>
Necros...Necros are getting close to where they should be,,with tools like fear, pets a very nice array of dots..they are becoming what they should be again...not there yet<br>
<br>
Druids ..Interestingly a hazily defined class...lets see they have nice damage shields, Regens, heals, Buffs, snares, Dots, a pet...and self and group transportation...I would say druids are fine..and i have played one. So they dont do one thing Extremely well..what do you expect being able to do everything??<br>
<br>
Bards..What i started this post about...Everything virtually manaless..a ton of songs that have a huge variety of effects..Being able to kite 20+ mobs..I dont need to say more then that to show how unbalanced they are,.<br>
<br>
VI has proven so lack any competance in the art of class balancing...WTF is so hard about it anyhow..READ a GodDamn Fantasy book to get the Definition of a class...Fuck i swear to god its insane how Stupid they can be...They Talk about Balance..balance this balance that..Were gonna balance this class we are gonna balance that skill..Why the fuck does it get worse Every damn time..This game has amazingly Not been Balanced a Single Fucking time since the release of Kunark..Pre kunark it was balanced..Once they released kunark  they fucked it up and have continually fucked it up worse and worse with every expansion...Are they that damn clueless? Obviously they sure as hell Dont play the game..thats more than obvious.<br>
<br>
Im sure this will earn some flames...knock yourselves the fuck out..i dont give a damn at this point..Im so completely pissed off I welcome it..I just simply want to know If anyone else Can see how completely out of proportion the balancing is in this game and Verants Pedantic logic behind it..I mean talk about your supply of never ending bullshit excuses..<br>
<br>
Bleh..im tired of typing now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yea i just logged my wizard in for the first time in months only to get run over by a swarm kiting Bard...I have never had anything insense me so bad.<br>
<br>
So with that i give a Big Fuck you Verant to the Dev team..Balanced my ass.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

The point is, they're just as entitled to those spawns as you are, and getting pissy about it won't change a thing. Bards are a very tough class to play, and swarm kiting is just an awesome ability. It's no more overpowered than Wizards quading, or us forming AE groups and killing 40 or 50 mobs. <p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br>

      Okay, to the moron who suggested the unlimited target DOT method, do you realize how CLOSE you have to be to the mobs for that to work?     Not to mention you'd probably be fear kiting, which has problems of its own.<br>
<br>
     To the wizards and druids: A CLASS THAT CAN QUAD KITE HAS NO BUSINESS CALLING FOR A SWARM KITING NERF.  (And I think swarm kiting will be nerfed, not just because its overpowered, but because I think a lot of bards have been jerks about it.)<br>
<br>
     To my fellow bards: RESPECT OTHERS WHEN SWARM KITING IF YOU DON'T ALREADY.  JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE DOWN 40 MOBS IN 3 MINUTES, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD.<br>

  And why not? If druids could do it, would they not? If wizards could? etc, etc, ad nauseum.  If you have a skill you use it until VI nerfs it (example, manaburn).  Who doesn't want to use their most effecient method of gaining exp?<br>
<br>
  There are plenty of zones in the game to hunt in.  If a bard is in the zone you wanted to hunt in, swarming the mobs, go somewhere else. If you are there with your group/solo/whatever and a bard shows up, then the bard should go hunt in some other zone if they want to swarm.  To say a bard shouldn't swarm in a particular zone is ridiculous.  Every class can go somewhere else to hunt just as easily as a bard.  Please don't call for bards to leave hunting grounds you wouldn't leave in the same situation.  Everyone pays the same subscription fee to play this game.<br>

And what do you mean with that &quot;kite 20+ mobs&quot;? <br>
What use is it to have 20+ mobs chasing you when you are not killing them? <br>
<br>
Laralanla wrote:&quot;JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE DOWN 40 MOBS IN 3 MINUTES, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD&quot;<br>
Never heard of that, perhaps it could be done, perhaps a Wizard could do it too, I don't know.<br>
And if a Bard could &quot;take down 40 mobs in 3 minutes&quot; and that was bad, what's your opininon about AE goups?<br>
And you don't remember the charm &quot;nerf&quot; a few weaks ago?<br>
Also Laralanla, don't belive everything you read, try for your self, you're a Bard and all.<br>
<br>
A few general things about Bards.<br>
-If we chant kite we dot one mob at the time.<br>
-If we charm kite we use mana. We have meditate 1, and mana song does not work on Bards.<br>
-If some one is charm kiting 20+ mobs he's only killing one at the time.<br>
-10+ mobs when charm kiting is usually only a bad thing for most Bards in most places.<br>
-Can't charm 51+ mobs, and so on ...<br>
<br>
<br>
Well well getting trained is not fun whatever class you play.<br>

It seems like swarming 20 mobs at once would make it very difficult to time this correctly.<br>

Have had them blatantly spot me quadding and have them run over and try to steal my mobs.  Then of course when they fail they just run their pulls through me and charm one, leaving me to die in a matter of seconds since the bard himself has no actual aggro control and any PC nearby is in risk.<br>
<br>
Then the other day in PoN I had a 4 pull about 25% down in health already and a bard runs up and tries to make off with one of my spiders.  Then upon failing promptly go and get a few more spawns and come train me.  When asked why he did it he said I shouldn't squeeze him outta his spot, he was fighting there.  So I guess the 10 hours of quadding I did before he showed up didn't count, hmmm, k.<br>
<br>
On the Solusek Ro server I have yet to see a decent bard do this, and I have gotten into the habit of petitioning as soon as I see one since I'd just have to do it later after I get trained and/or die from them.  Of course it takes the GMs like 3 hours to show up and the bards usually leave after numerous people bish them out.<br>
<br>
So Just say NO to Swarm kiting.  Should be (and has shown itself to be) treated as nothing more than starting a train.  Don't have to nerf it, just have to actually give warnings to the dumbfawks who average more PC deaths than mobs killed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=absolutemaster>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/29/02 8:07:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: swarm kitting</span><hr size=1> Boofuckinghoo. Wizards and druids quad-kiting are just as bad if not worse then bard swarm kiters. NEWSFLASH every non quading classes have the same beefs with quad kiters, and frankly it is pure irony that a quad kiter is complaining that another class can do it better. For one it is much harder to get level 60 as a bard and requires quite an amount of skill to manage swarm kiting properly. Compare that to the little risk generated with quad kiting.<br>
<br>
Bards can only swarm kite once in a while because charming costs mana, which bards regen at an excruciating slow rate. There is no such restriction for druids and wizards, the downtime is much shorter.<br>
<br>
And as for the swarm kiting manaless dot thing you are talking about, the bard doing it is a moron. That takes forever to kill and he would pretty much be better off just soloing them, not to mention he would be at a high risk from needing to be so close to the mobs.<br>
<br>
Again, like I said in another rant about bard kiting before, I have been run over by wizards and druids quad kites much more often then I have been with bard swarm kites.<br>

We're not all illiterate bastards, some visitors just post very rarely.  Shouldn't be a crime worth attacking..  Enough on that.. on to the good stuff.<br>
<br>
Swarm Kiting... well... I know that playing a bard well, and to me that means the ability to twist songs and melee, is very difficult.  A bard that can play 1 song or twist two and melee is not difficult... I have seen bards twist 5 songs and pull before.. now that I feel is a good bard.  So, in order to swarm I would assume, not having played a bard myself I have to assume, would require a player to be excellent in that class.  This is a rare few.  So, let them be.<br>
<br>
The problem I have is this, their ability to kite this many creatures simultaneously.  Our AoE spells, the Al'Kabor line I believe, used to be able to hit a huge number of MoBs.  This was nerfed because &quot;Wizards are too powerful&quot;.  Now they hit a max of 5.  If our, yes I play a wizard, power was too great because we could AoE more than 5 creatures then wouldn't that apply to Bards as well?<br>
<br>
I do not want to see Bards nerfed.. I want the complement wizard spells re-instated.  I want to AoE more than 5 MoBs at a time.  If it is ok for a Bard to kite more than 5 then it should be ok for us.<br>
<br>
Now, my wizard has always been my favorite class.  I have played him for over 3 years now.  I am not, by far, the best Wizard.  I have not dedicated countless hours to the game, I have a job and friends that require an inordinate amount of time (damn RL)  :-)  So, if I have errored a bit in this post be gentle.  I welcome a good debate on these issues.<br>

Thank you for your time in this matter.  :-)<br>

<br>
And yeah, I've had my group in PoN trained by quadders much more often than I have been trained by swarmers. Most people hate quadding wizards, because half of them are retards who don't know how to quad properly, and end up training groups in the process. And being trained by 4+ mobs who hit for 260+ each really really hurts. <br>
<br>
To summarize: There are assholes in every class. Don't call for nerfs because of the actions of these select few. Remember the uproar Manaburn nerf caused? I really wouldn't want to see what happens to this board if Verant nerfs quadding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1670.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1670.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1670.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1670.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1670.topic&start=101&stop=117>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1670.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1670.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1670.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1670.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1670.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1670.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
