She lights a candle and pours a cup of Elven wine.  <br>
     Taking quill and parchment in hand, she sips her wine and begins to scribe her thoughts.<br>
<br>
<br>
      I was born in Kelethin, the daughter of a baker.  I never knew my father.  My mother never spoke of him so I kept my thoughts to myself.  My grandfather was a great druid and he said I had been given the gift of Tunare,  just as he had been given.  He told me that one day Tunare would call upon me to serve her and I should be ready to give all, even if it meant certain death.  <br>
     I knew at that moment he was right.  All my life I had felt like I was different from my sister who took any opportunity to kill the creatures of the forest, sneaking up behind them and killing them.  I was appalled.  I had always felt at one with the wolves of the forest.  At night as a child I would lay awake and listen to their songs, the songs they sing to Tunare and I felt a warmth that would lull me to sleep.  <br>
    When I became of age I was allowed to hunt in the forest around the city.  I became quite adept at stalking the menacing Crushbone around Orc Hill nearby and joined others in the fight to rid our fair land of these murdering beasts.  <br>
     My grandfather taught me how to use nature as my ally.  I learned how to call the wind to stun my enemies and how to engulf them in fire and thorns.  I was amazed and my curiosity grew.   I wanted to take my abilities and rid the land of the evil Crushbone.<br>
    On a warm evening in my sixth season, I headed out to fight along my Elven brothers and sisters.  The centurions were as thick as fleas which was very unusual.  The stench in the air was awful, the smell of burning flesh gagged me.  As I headed towards Orc Hill something hit me from behind and stunned me in my tracks.  I shook my head and could feel the blood running down my neck.  I turned around and I was standing face to face with a huge centurion.  I immediately began to call upon the great wind to aid me and in the blink of an eye the orc blew backwards in a gust, giving me time to trap him with the aid of the briars that grow in the forest. <br>
     As I started to bring fire down upon the beast I heard a voice shouting in the distance that Princess Firiona Vie was traveling nearby.  She was in need of assistance.  I felt something inside me, I knew I needed to meet this heroic princess.<br>
     I quickly finished off the groveling orc with a blast of fire.  I looted his belt and a bit of change and was off down the path to Felwithe.  I met up with a handsome young bard by the name of Sundaze and we traveled together to Felwithe.  We got word that Princess Firiona was at the entrance to Lesser Faydark.  I gulped, knowing that my mother and grandfather would be very upset if they knew I ventured in there.   Sundaze promised me that he would watch out for me and I agreed, knowing this was a chance of a lifetime.  <br>
    We quickly made the journey to Lesser Faydark thanks to the songs of Sundaze and there she was, more beautiful than I could have imagined.  She had a few followers with her and when I got near her I kneeled before her and praised Tunare for this wonderful opportunity.<br>
    We followed the Princess for some time, her friend the unicorn Equestrielle was to be found.  The brownies were about attacking the rude observers but they left us alone because we hid most of the time.  Finally Firiona Vie found the beautiful and timid creature. I listened intently as they chose the four elemental summoners.  As I witnessed it all, I saw the four chosen ones holding the ancient stones and Firiona called upon Tunare.  There was silence in the forest except for those begging for their lives running from the brownie scouts <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
