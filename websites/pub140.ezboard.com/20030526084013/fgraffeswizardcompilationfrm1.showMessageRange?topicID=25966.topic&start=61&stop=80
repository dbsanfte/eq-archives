And I think we can all agree that elemental gods are pretty much current high-end game?<br>
<br>
Let's look at some numbers... in 6 minutes from INC, I've been able to do 74.9k damage without manaburning, but using quite a lot of mana even with horse/bard/enc/dru/aaflappy2/mc1/ft15/etc. I think the final figure after 10 minutes was 30% mana left, 1 rod and HoD used. And total damage after 10 minutes was 152k damage done or 253dps.<br>
<br>
So, I wouldn't be able to push that damage if I MB'd for 19k or say 20k in the beginning. Not even close. And if I was doing that damage for the first 6 minutes, I wouldn't do 20k burn at six minute marker.<br>
<br>
If I burn first, and have 100 mana / tick regen, that equals to 2x ADoI in 18 seconds (except 2x ADoI takes 26s but I give it to benefit the MB calc). Wich means I can cast 40 of those from 0 to 6 minutes, plus say 3 from HoD/Rod but that makes some ticks lost. Now, an ADoI makes about 1700 damage on average, so those 43 would be about 73k. Add the 20k and you get 93k for me at 6 minute marker... but the remaining 4 minutes would be on still the same slow nuking rythm... adding about 27 more nukes or 46k damage... totalling to 139k damage from the wizard who burned first. Or... 232dps.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm no math wizard but even with new MB, it looks like I shouldn't use the MB. And if the MB result was based on mana left, then the 5th or 6th wizard shouldn't either... even SoM or AT or SoS should be better choice for 6s cast at that time. I might've error in calculations with the MB, if so, someone please correct me.<br>
<br>
On a shorter fight, maybe the first or 2nd MB would be beneficial, but spells like SoS doing easily 5-6.5k damage per nuke, I'm a bit doubtful at that. Also when you take into account that at 3 minute marker no wizard should be full of mana, because the dps lost wouldn't be made up for by MB.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS. Yes, I'd like to have 20k or 30k MB. It's a big nuke. I'd also like to have AE DT... now that would trivialize content and we could all quit after beating the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cendaercerliin>CendaerCerliin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 8:24:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25966.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raystonn=Brick Wall &lt;- bang head here</span><hr size=1> Ya know, there's nothing worse than number cruncher... oh wait! Yes there is! A number cruncher who is inconsistent, and bends the numbers to fit their whims!<br>
<br>
Raystonn, just get over it, it's an entirely moot point, since you've got a snowball's chance in hell at ever convincing anyone at SOE to add in any sort of ability that's even remotely like Manaburn.<br>
<br>
If you like it the way it is, fine, spend your AA's on it and then LEARN TO USE IT THE WAY IT EXISTS, THEN SIT DOWN, STFU, AND STOP WHINING ABOUT HOW YOU THINK IT'S NOT ENOUGH!<br>
<br>
If you're such a superior number cruncher, then try taking my first suggestion to you, and directing your energies toward formulating and then suggesting an ability or spell which is: 1) balanced, 2) feasable in it's implementation, &amp; 3) balanced (yes, i repeated this twice for the reading-comprehension-challenged Raystonn).<br>
<br>
This whole Manaburn thing was discussed months and months ago, then possibilities were suggested, then it was rehashed and discussed again, then, finally, the dust settled, and everyone went on their merry way.<br>
<br>
Now, here you are again, stirring it all up again, and even after numerous people tried to explain to you WHY it's not going to happen (e.g.: numbers just don't work out in a balanced way, SOE is totally against the whole idea of Manaburn at this point [due, mostly, to player complaints about the roving bands of MB crews], and, in the opinions of some, it's just not an ability that should have been added in the first place), here you are, STILL continuing to stir it up, and refusing to just let it go.<br>
<br>
If you think your idea is so grandly balanced, and heretofore flawless, then YOU start sending YOUR OWN personal messages to the developers, and YOU tell them how Manaburn should be implemented, in either it's old form or YOUR new one.<br>
<br>
Please, by all means, keep sending them your messages until they finally use your ideas, or maybe, even better yet, give you a job as a developer so you can just implement it yourself. With any luck, they'll name the ability after you... maybe something like &quot;Raystonn's Furiously Ominous Manaburn part II&quot; and then we'll all have to eat our words everytime we use this incredible ability that YOU came up with, and which YOU convinced the developers to implement.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you in your Manaburn endeavor, but you'll have to pardon me if i don't hold my breath while waiting to see this new Manaburn show up in my AA menu. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 838<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 8:30:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25966.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Planar Manaburn</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Rombus, you covered it alright... you said that you saw pre-nerf in action and you'd assume that 15k manaburn every 1 minute would destroy content. Not to mention you forgot that 6th wizard shouldn't have full mana to burn. You didn't saw the 1 minute manaburn, new proposed or current one do anything. Furthermore you seemed to pull the numbers out of thin air. Or did you edit post and what you wrote isn't there anymore?<br>

Nuking almost constantly for 6 minutes with all of the mana regen avail I will be at around 85% mana.  I can then use HoD + Harvest and a Mod Rod if needed to regain full mana and do a burn.<br>

<br>
If Fennin isn't good example of current end game (that MB supposedly would break) are you honestly trying to say that Terris Thule is end game? Rombus, from where I come from, TT is gimpy pushover mob that we do only if we have to for reflags. Maybe on your server it is endgame mob, I'd have to take your word on that.<br>
<br>
RZ, TT, Bert, etc. were broken by zerging already... now we have teams and guilds in ele planes who can't get Fennin killed even after having 5 spawns of him (that's some 30 hours of doing him). Making MB to be on one minute timer like it is now, but allowing it to do &quot;wizardly&quot; damage wouldn't actually broke any more content, more than it is broken. Heck, it wouldn't even help zerg forces because of that timer limitation.<br>
<br>
And where you put down people... &quot;If you only had seen what I saw, believe me, it broke everything!&quot; I'm sorry, but that's the attitude that tends to put people down. You could've left that whole thing out and produce numbers that actually show it would break content.

Again, as far as putting people down, I never said that.

Here is the number you posted. Then I posted calculation why in 10 minute fight, the MB wiz would do less damage even if MB did 20k damage than a wiz who is nuking without using MB. And that was the first wiz... the other wizards would come closer, but probably wouldn't exceed the one who wasn't using MB. Those numbers are the reason why I'm having so hard time seeing how it would break content.<br>
<br>
And if it would break TT... nope. Bringing 6 MB wizards there wouldn't break it any more than bringing 6 65th level wizards (with that much AA) would. RZ? Same thing. Bertox? Nope, not again. TZ/VZ? No. Elemental gods, no, not even Coirnav. Then again, some of those mobs have similar HP as mobs in Luclin have, the guilds doing PoP-bosses have just jumped in dps so that even though there are mobs with 500k and 1M hitpoints out there, they 'feel' like having a lot less HP than Luclin bosses. Which we found not to be true after visiting some old &quot;high HP&quot; Luclin friends.<br>

There is huge difference in doing 20k/min or doing X times 20k in one moment.<br>
<br>
I think the key here is that either you underestimate the effect of 1 minute timer or I underestimate the 15-20k per each minute (given that it is sometimes easy to nuke for 20k / minute). Seeing as how the MB would actually bring my dps down even when I'm using quite mana efficient spells, it is hard to see how it would trivialize anything.<br>
<br>
And finally, first you say &quot;I saw pre-nerf mb in pop and it destroyed content&quot; then when questioned you said &quot;well, I saw other versions too, but can't discuss&quot; which is discussing about it already. You're not making whole lot of sense there. We've both been posting here for ages, I have no trouble with you... but when math doesn't add up and I'm supposed to trust something you can't even discuss... that, is putting people down. As an example (again) uberguild wizards said that AE spells aren't worth using even after I presented numbers... and history showed nicely if they were worth using or not, regardless of how ubers saw them. That's why gut feeling, or I said so, don't carry much weight when things can be calculated with known numbers.<br>
<br>
I apologize of ever mentioning you putting anyone down and I'd say we drop that subject and concentrate on the topic, of how would actually the 1 minute recast MB trivialize content, if it did 3x manapool damage.<br>

you know you love it even if you do not possess a graphing calculator! this one will describe the Strike of Solusek if used after this... surely not a good choice always, but it's an example. Beware! this is not a fourier series of periodic functions, and wont represent all the dps action too well but I think anyone can understand this if they set their minds to it(unlike more accurate stuffs):<br>
<br>
dps = (9600 + (E)Rx + (1161)E)/(x +35)<br>
E = efficiency, average, of all the nukes. 9 = effic (arbitrary)<br>
x = the time domain<br>
R mana regen per second. 14/sec<br>
35 is the time lost in order to acquire those above constant values(manaburn, harvests) <br>
<br>
keep in mind that the above pretends that youre nuking for 9pts every second. this gives you the base dmg, then the dmg you get for using the harvests multiplied by the efficiency, and then turning damage into damage per second. please point out any mistake you see with the above, I'm hungry irl and waiting on good, prone to mistakes!<br>
<br>
let's say we use ratio 9 nuke in the above... any value under 35 in the equation will realistically default to 9600/x where x &lt;= 35. then there's the matter of your nuking. This is all important to keep in mind. Also, your dps as a wizard will always approach the sustained dps as you fight, but not in a decaying fashion. Here's values, enough blabbing:<br>
<br>
55 sec: 290dps<br>
90sec: 250dps<br>
130sec: 220dps<br>
160sec: 206dps<br>
250sec: 180dps<br>
<br>
Plan accordingly! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 842<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 10:33:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25966.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Planar Manaburn</span><hr size=1> Earlier you calculated your manaregen to be 87 mana per tick or 14.5 mana per second.<br>
<br>
My regular chain for 6+ minute fights is adoi/isos/eci/aconc and a bit into fight occasional som here and there. But if we go without som, that's still 240dps chain. Now, that chain drains mana... 250+300+255+25=830x0.7=581 per 17.2 seconds add second or two for reaction time and that is 30.3 mana per second.<br>
<br>
So even with raid manaregen of 87/tick, you lose 15.8 mana per second, or 5688 in 6 minutes. If that  lost mana equals to 15% of your manapool, then you have around 37,920 manapool raid buffed. Even if SCM, MP, specialization took 50% off from manacost, you'd still lose 2561 mana in 6 minutes and would need to have 17,075 manapool for that to be 15%.<br>
<br>
So either you're nuking something like 150dps or less and doing &quot;extremely high damage&quot;, or you are pulling numbers out of thin air. ADoI seems to be pretty manaefficient nuke, as is ISoS. And if you are at 85% mana after 6 minutes, while doing extremely high damage, I can't but wonder where I go wrong. Because with bard, buffs and HoD / Rod... I'm still nearing oom at 10min fights while doing damage that I considered pretty good.<br>
<br>
So maybe our disagreement stems from the difference of what we perceive to be high damage. 120-150 dps is something done against concussion resistant mobs and 200-250 are done regularly when concussion is useable, in my opinion. Then again, I always wondered how uberguild wizards are posting here that they never go oom in PoP... I guess the answer is in dps. The mana consumption between 150dps and 250dps is quite noticeable.<br>

you were given a few SPECIFIC examples in this thread...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh and most PoP encounters don't involve a single target. Lets take Xegony first. She calls an army of adds as you attack her. A boss in each army wields a fairly deadly AE. Most of them have very low HP. A manaburn blast of that size would mostly kill them, exposing your raid to the AE maybe once before its dead. Wizards could take turns MBing each boss wave. Being able to do so would drastically gimp the encounter.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
that is a specific example upon many.  Relatively low HP Mobs, where a FEW wizards doing more than &quot;normal&quot; damage can seriously affect the outcome of the encounter.   Yes you can still try and get 4-5X the amount of wizards to do the same'ish amount of damage, but that just isn't as likely to happen as manaburn.  (Those multipliers based on your NEW manaburn, not the current one)<br>

(which wouldn't kill none of Xegony minibosses).<br>
<br>
But for that to work for all waves you need at least 5 wizards. Since the fight takes significantly less than the recycle time of MB is. Now, if those same 5 wizards cast SoS on the miniboss when it arrives, they'll do on average 17880 damage. Which isn't that far off from the 18k-20k a MB would do. <br>
<br>
Now &quot;in future&quot; with the 5 wizards you could do MB+SoS, and nuke the minis for 32-34k (on average) damage. Which once again wouldn't kill it. But would bring it closer to death than without re-tuned MB, then you'd have the rest of each wave to deal with, with one of your 5 wizards doing gimped damage compared to non MB situation. <br>
<br>
The Xegony example tries to be a good one, but after doing that fight few times and now calculating the numbers... I've yet to find out the &quot;it would trivialize the content&quot; part. It would trivialize if the minis had 32k hitpoints, but as they're well over 100k range... even the re-tuned MB wouldn't make it trivial. Especially as Xegony is the longest fight in whole PoP for us, and in that I for example have serious mana issues pretty constantly. Meaning that MC15 and FT50 would be welcome to that fight. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Edit: The original quote mentioned the AE of those minis... which after thinking lead me to think that the original poster hasn't fought the Xegony at all. Because those AE's aren't a problem at all during that fight. Generally they get few off, and those are totally resisted with ease. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A> at: 4/15/03 11:38:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bernardoicecomet>Bernardo Icecomet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 11:27:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25966.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Planar Manaburn</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yep...

No offense Raystonn.  I think as a 59 lvl wiz, there should be no pre-nerfed Manaburn experience and lack of PoP boss raid experience.  Thats why it is hard to let you believe it by merely some figures mentioned above.<br>
