Id say that really depends on your server.  On mine, the prices are going up.  9 months ago then Torpor went on the market it hovered between 45 and 50K.  Last I saw Torpor was 2 months ago, and it was 65K.<br>
<br>
New research components?  Hmm...  Ive asked everyone I know to keep an eye out for them.  Ya know how many of the necessary components Ive gotten in the last 2 months?  Three...all the same.<br>
<br>
I will admit that I am on an old and lazy server and that really affects prices, as most folks dont even go to Kael and HoT anymore.<br>

In any case, I think all these research drops could stand to be upped dramatically and scattered in more zones.

The hard part is finding a system that does not disrupt, upset and shake the game up to much. If you take a very small step no one notices and to large and people shout they are cancelling their accounts, while I think EQ has taken some baby steps they could do more.<br>
<br>
 Some of the things they seem to be trying now feel like it is just a test to see how it works and if they can implement it in EQ2, if it fails or is good for EQ is no concern for them it seems to me they do not care if it hurts EQ if it helps EQ2 it a win for SOE. That is another thread though. I like the required and recommended levels, some things should not be able to be equipped at level one, fungi tunic, while others scaled as you level like with recommended levels is nice.<br>
<br>
 With RPG's it can be a little different than other games, you dont want some aspects of the game to feel linear and you want the player to feel they can roam and be involved in the world. Of course there needs to be limited factors so a low level character does not wander into a dangerous place without knowing but for the immersion factor it needs to make sense and have a reason other than just saying you are not of sufficent level.<br>
<br>
 Enough of the ramblings, with a little wine it is strange how quick you can get off topic :/. Another suggestion they could try is rather than make some weapons from the past useless or spells they could make things more situational. When Kunark came out, attach a category for the mob type say lizard blood of some type. While old world weapons will work on these new mobs, there effectiveness is not as good as some new Kunark weapons with a bane for lizard or some other value they make them effective for lizardmen. You could make some new spells with a bane similar to GB and DB. To find the new weapons you need to explore, hunt and progress through Kunark. Enter Velious and you have Giants, Dragons and Dorfs blood line so you need to progress through it the same. <br>
<br>
Maybe you need to have required and recommended levels for the weapons or you could add new skills in the expansions that you have to learn in that expansion before you can use the weapons or spells. I think they were on the right track with some bane weapons just how they implemented them was horrid. Not sure if this makes any sense.<br>
<br>
 One of the biggest problems I see wrong with EQ and mudflation now is with new expansions they become useless and while not completly and in every case, they make the past expansion and experiences almost pointless. Sure there is some things to go back to older expansions for, most the time the past expansion seem to die a slow death.<br>
<br>
 I dont think we really need a new backdrop ie new zones with more expansions but some changes to the old ones. CT is one example of a zone many of us grew up with and loved, the revamp breathed new life into it. Before PoP, CT was one of the most popular zones in game even though it was one of the oldest. I was hoping they noticed it but once PoP came out, CT turned into a ghost town again.<br>
<br>
 Sorry for the ramblings hopefully a little of this made some sense. EQ is/has been a great game and I think it could be fun for a long time, do not take some of this as bashing but ways to make EQ better and the game it can be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 876<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 8:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> They need to figure out how to get people to go after appropriate level drops OUTSIDE of the bazaar.  Now, this is my opinion, but that is the D&amp;D model, right?<br>
<br>
I mean, you go to slay the dragon, at least in part, because of the riches the dragon has.  In order to get to the dragon, you have to beat her minions.  That is missing, for the most part, in EQ.  Boss mobs should drop MORE items.  And they should be level appropriate.  And they should have level restrictions, but not NO DROP (I mean, what's the use of adventuring, if you can't sell the loot you don't want/need?).<br>
<br>
Reduce the drops of good items in &quot;outdoor&quot; zones, unless those zones have a &quot;camp&quot; or other RP purpose (Ogres in WK for instance).<br>
<br>
This wouldn't kill the bazaar or trading.  It would just change the focus a little.  Again, this is my opinion, based on my experiences with that game.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gemlin>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 485<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 9:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> If sony REALLY wants to fix the economy, they can do a system that old Text Based MUDs used to do.<br>

Have item limits.<br>
<br>
Example : Fungi Tunic would be a Common drop until the game had 50 or more in the system. At that point it would be changed to a Rare drop till 75 were in the game, then ultra rare drop till 100. At 100 none would drop anymore.<br>

<br>
Right now there is one source of money in the entire game, and nothing really to take the money *OUT* of the game.  Now, they put some things into the game such as peridots that take money out of the game, but this is the wrong way to do it imo.  I blame the reason for this on D&amp;D.<br>
<br>
The only method I can legitimately think of to fix this is if you *HAD* to pay for some sort of lodging when you were logged off, and taxes.<br>
<br>
Changing drops is going to do nothing. If you want items removed from the game, you make sure they are worth a reasonable amount of cash or xp to sell them back.  <br>
<br>
Mudflation is a good thing, its just that Sony is forcing the loot to literally flood the market.<br>
<br>
Fungi Tunic isn't a mudflation item, most people who own one are either twinks, or could reasonably have gotten the item by their level.  Things like Centi Short Sword are mudflation items (however, using the /testbuff command, I would assume that the CSS is considered appropriate for a level 25) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 881<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 12:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> They could also increase the prices for which vendors will by certain items, that are selling to cheaply in the bazaar.

<br>
The recommended level system allows them to dynamicly adjust stats on items based on character level.<br>
<br>
The flag system allows them to store individual data.<br>
<br>
Would have to wonder if a system similar to the recommended level one could be used to make an item possess increased stats and be impossible to trade based on flag data.<br>
<br>
Maybe work it out so all items turned in cease to be tradable but all stats are increased by 15%<br>
<br>
<br>
If flags are implimented as a list of all possible flags with a true or false value this would be ridiculous as your item flag list would have to be as large as the item database.<br>
<br>
If however flags are just a list of which flags you possess I would imagine it would only have to contain whatever items you possessed making it managable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etelka>Etelka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 575<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/03 3:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> I like this karmic value idea, some quest NPC somewhere where you can turn your old items into for exp or something would be very sweet.<br>

<br>
Step 3: Allow NPC's to return meaningful amounts of cash for items (they could have the servers record data about the bazaar for a few months, and calculate prices based on the lowest 5 servers' average (obviously it would be a fraction of that amount)<br>
<br>
Step 4: Every item should have a tag stating the 'best' current worth of the item if sold to an indifferent NPC with your current charisma.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the following circumstance:<br>
<br>
Stryven won a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but has recently won an upgrade (haha), he goes up to some cool looking White Efreeti mob in potimea, drops it in the trade window, slaps in 100,000 pp, and gets back <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A model of Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which is droppable, same stats and classes, but Race: None.<br>
<br>
Stryven runs into the bazaar, slaps it into his Traders satchel for 700,000 pp, then goes to sleep.<br>
<br>
Bindy is looking at the bazaar and notices <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A model of Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Being too poor, she liquidates her many alts, and then buys it, runs to potimea, hands it into the NPC, and gets his precious Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair in return.<br>
<br>
Sure, it probably means that guilds will end up farming a bit less, but I can guarantee that very shortly pp will be worth quite a bit.<br>
<br>
The PROBLEM with this approach is that it has to be 'intelligent' enough to police the server economies, and adjust the fraction given for items based on how much money is going back into the system.  It also has to note and record when a large number of any specific item is being sold to it, and drop the price accordingly.  But that is how the system always SHOULD have been.  'Cheese' would never have been a problem if the system modified the price of cheese based on the fact that it had purchased 60 billion pp worth of cheese in a single day, and cut the payback in half.  The server should also track &quot;stagnant&quot; money, and assume it has been removed from the money pool.  This eliminates people who quit, and people who have a huge horde of cash, but never buy anything.<br>
<br>
A lot of games talk about a &quot;zero sum&quot; economy, but I believe this is a fallacy.  &quot;Zero sum&quot; just means the rich end-game people who don't spend money get richer, and everyone else becomes more poor.<br>
<br>
Will this fix the economy? I'm not sure.  For one, it might be too late.  Second, it really depends on how many people in the end-game you can get to spend huge sums of money to transfer items they no longer need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=istari@graffeswizardcompilation>Istari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 12:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> It takes a rather lot to get to have a Vanazir. Most guilds consider droppables that are awarded to be guild property- ie BoCs. having all of that farmed to be sold is rather gimpy, not heard of on my server. if I had guild loot that was good, I wouln't sell it in the bazaar personally but rather pass it on- even w/ my own droppables. the raid end of the game really isn't economy, though, given the loot distribution. <br>
<br>
I never really looked into it, but do a lot of guilds let memebrs sell stuff like their awarded BOCs(for lack of a better alternative item)? Even with stuff like emp robe, one hasnt dropped on this server for 4 months and it would be really shitty to see one of our 5 robes wind up in the bazaar. The raid-end of EQ I think really isn't meant for economy since it really isn't individually earned for people's moneybags. Well, I think making a market of raid items is a bit ridiculous myself, just given how all of THAT works. Are you a member of a hardcore raiding guild? They won't be raiding less if they can help it. They all raid on their regular days with perhaps a few scheduled offdays, unless attend is sucking. Raiding isnt a complement to the EQ xp grind for me, it's the main thing keeping me even here.<br>
<br>
The money supply in a mmgorpg is strictly currency too. If I recall right, some 1/4 to 1/3 of a modern money supply is currency. We don't have banking systems, there's no loans, so much of the money supply becomes stagnant. It, too, grows uncontrollably. People print their own cash every time they loot a coin or vendor an item. There's really no problem with that, to consider the money supply you'll want to consider what the money is good for.<br>
<br>
Back WAY long ago I remember the vendor-sucking. People would work on tradeskills and sell stuff to other people and they'd go buy plate, this was before I saw this bronze armor stuff lying around. It was expensive, but the money going in was balanced by the money going out. More importantly, there was a meaning to the exchange of cash- it was actually needed for something and held an exchange value of its own. Old banking systems used to allow you to exchange your money for gold in order to back its currency, which gave much of it value. In EQ now, I find nothing to exchange my fat hoarde of cash for. Currently I buy some very trivial stuff for hero sandwiches and kaladim constitutionals. otherwise I can work on tradeskills(almost baking maxed now). no progress for my character power, however, is even based on cash. I can leave my bank alone and never worry.<br>
<br>
An active economy is neat and all but it's rather difficult to replicate an economy in a virtual world. After all, the study of econonomy is essentially how to allocate scare rescources. We don't have any such thing in a mmgorpg if it's infinite. Back when yaks were worth 10k, people would wait in line to gank SMRs and that like and the stuff could only enter the server as it dropped and there was no alternative for it. Now you can go and AE guk (usually faction) and get 5 yaks an SMR and 2 runed cowls in the time you get your stuff done. All that goes to just one person, and the way it entered the server remains the same. The difference is that lguk used to have 30+ people in there so that the items were divided far more. The prices naturally fell as stuff becomes more common. A more pertinent question perhaps is how this effects the gameplay aspect. Newbies can get a hold of higher end stuff more easily if it's less covetous: do devs want them to have this so much more easily? EQ is more about progressing/fun than about economy- which can be part of the fun itself.<br>
<br>
If raid stuff is sellable like that though I foresee a world of people gearing up, quitting, selling their whole set of armor for player auctions and chumping your guild's work to gear them. Then all of the high end raid loot that shouldn't flood an economy will wind up there, probably to the dislike of the raiding guilds and make the whole concept of raiding totally flipped. Right now I see a couple of people making out with raid stuff to sell on player auctions from another guild, and the other sold stuff unneeded droppables for a peridot fund. it may just be me, but I'd dislike seeing raids turn into just a cash cow action. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1313<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 2:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> I was assuming that most of the loot would be transferred to other characters upon leaving.

Only if you're on a Gold Standard.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is one of the reasons I personally feel that every server needs an involved Game Master (This is not the same as Customer Service).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, as I said, if you base the payback price essentially on their rarity, you can help circulate money.  That would be the goal of this system, taking money from the high end (those who produce more than they consume) and giving it to the low end (those who consume more than they produce). <br>

<br>
Which will happen anyway.  Hence the requirement of Flag restrictions.  By adding the flag restriction, you are making any possible market relatively small.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, playerauctions complete's the economy. If people are willing to pay cash for something, then you have proven the economy is working.<br>
The problem in EQ is this fluctuates madly. One month you will see $1 = 1kpp, the next you will see $3 = 1kpp.  I think it is a pretty good measure of how much the market in EQ is fluctuating.<br>
<br>
(please note that I have never, nor do I believe I ever will buy something from an online auction site for EQ)<br>
<br>
Either way, this is something that is probably too late for EQ, and would have to be investigated heavily before being added to any project.  Many game companies have chosen Player Made items to be the basic item that is purchased. The problem with this is, you have to assume that anything worth doing for money will be done by a large number of people, which means the market is flooded, which means that the item will sell for the very minimum amount, which means that those with the largest supply of money don't need to spend as much....<br>
<br>
EQ2 is going to attempt to make you want to buy trade-skiller stuff, and have items decay so that they fall out of the market on their own. In my opinion, this is a bad idea... It's not going to work like they think it will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 4683<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 2:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The only method I can legitimately think of to fix this is if you *HAD* to pay for some sort of lodging when you were logged off, and taxes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I would hate this like nothing else..

You could most likely get several hundred plat or more with some determined VL farming in any of the starting zones.

It would have to be a substantial xp reward to dump stuff on an npc or make an item no drop for me personally. Just musing but perhaps a plat for xp exchange npc would remove some of the mudflation and overcrowding in xp zones ?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
