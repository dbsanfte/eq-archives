Folding herself into her favorite comfortable chair by the guildhouse fire, she sighed contentedly.   She could hear happy voices in the kitchen.  The snoring coming from the floor assured her that the dwarves were settling in nicely.  An old bow hung once again on its peg by the door, and she could see the new paladin polishing bright armor in the corner.  <br>
<br>
The elven paladin in bright armor...Seyah thought back to a battlefield:<br>
------------------<br>
She came awake alert, and a sigh escaped her as she looked at the carnage around her.  Camping as her comrades fell, and praying to Tunare that she would remain unnoticed while the spells took her away, she knew she would return to this.  But still, so many dead...<br>
She nodded to Haffer,  already partnered with a bard and working his way among the fallen.  Her shoulders slumped, and she looked around at the crumpled corpses, deciding who she should bring back first.  Ah, an enchanter would be needed quickly.  She cast the necessary spells, and the enchanter returned to her corpse whole again.  Moving on, she continued to pull more and more of her friends and guildmates back into the foul hall of the god of Hate.  People sat around her, waiting for the sickness to pass, or crouched, collecting their belongings from their corpses.  As she worked, some of the raised began to walk around, examining the high-ceilinged hall where they had died.  A murmer of voices replaced the gastly silence she had been greeted with.  <br>
<br>
A sudden angry roar filled the hall, and brought all the people in the room to their feet.  Innoruk, the hideous god, had returned to the battlefield!  His pale skin gleamed as he waved his twisted arms above the rezzed and the still fallen.  Seyah saw bodies flung into the air, only to come crashing down again.  Frantically she looked around - how many were well enough to fight?   Innoruk was pounding on those around him, now, and again the bodies rose and fell through the air.  Dodging falling bodies, Seyah ran toward the evil god, thinking perhaps she could aid the battle, but as she got nearer she saw that the half-clothed handfuls of people she had just rezzed would never be able to sustain an assault.   Grimly she backed herself up to a wall and gritting her teeth began the camping ritual that would let her escape the battlefield once again.  It always felt like cowardice to her, though logically she recognized it as her duty to escape.  Two fighters coaxed Innoruk away from the middle of the room, and were fighting him in a corner.  Two valient fighters against the god of Hate.  Seyah prayed they would last until her spells were done.  One was a small dwarf in dull gold.  The other, a high elf in shining armor.  He was sure to die soon, but she knew it had to be one of her guildmates buying time for her with his life.  As her view dimmed, her escape assured, Seyah's heart thrilled to see him, swinging his massive two-handed sword in an arc above his head, the flames from the flickering sconces shining off its surface. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aryllyian>Aryllyian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer</span><br>  Posts: 629<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/8/02 11:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Elven Paladin in Bright Armor</span><hr size=1> Aryllyian awakes with a start and struggles to come to his feet frantically....he can hear every heartbeat in wicked slow motion.  His vision is blurred and he is unable to speak.<br>
<br>
His last visions.....were filled with terror.<br>
<br>
In a brief moment of panic he grasps for anything to help him to his feet.  He stumbles and manages to get to one knee.  He feels a small hand on his back.<br>
<br>
&quot;May Tunare comfort thee...&quot;, Says a female voice in the bell like tone of High Elvish.  Aryllyian feels the wave of healing come over him, his vision clears, and he is able to focus clearly on the divine being near him.<br>
<br>
It is the face of Seyah.  He coughs and tries to force a smile, but he is still very weak.  He wants to thank her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, Lord Aryllyian, shhhhh...now...save yer strength.&quot; says Seyah calmly.    <br>
