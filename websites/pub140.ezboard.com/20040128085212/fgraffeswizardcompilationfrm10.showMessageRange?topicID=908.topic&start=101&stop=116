(I still think giving the pet draught of fire and nothing else would create just that.  Draught of fire has a built in resist mod and is low aggro, really a perfect spell for this application imo.)  Now, mages solo with a melee pet, they need it to tank for them.  How exactly would mages use such a low hp pet to solo, given that they can't root or snare and even if the pet can, it does so randomly and is not reliable?<br>
<br>
Rhasin, i appreciate your attitude.  Keep in mind most of the irritation you are seeing displayed is fallout from the thread in general where a great many mages came and posted, proclaiming us whiners, and had obviously not even read our reasoning for our objections to the version on test, nor our alternate suggestions (which would result in a better pet imo, not a worse one) nor the general support most of us give to the idea of upgrading your fire pets and finding a way to do so that will not upset mage/wizard balance or relationships.<br>
<br>
Mages, have there been any further adjustments to the pet on test? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarbonius>Zarbonius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/4/03 5:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: After all this</span><hr size=1> ...so I figured I'd head over to the Mage board for a bit to discuss this whole &quot;fire pet&quot; thing with them.  I think a lot of the initial excitement over this has worn down, and the majority of the mages that posted were very reasonable and interested in making the pet balanced as well as useful.<br>
<br>
In any case, I came away from the discussion with the following model of a fire pet in my mind.  It looks to me as though it fulfills most of the requirements of both classes, but then, I'm a bit biased.  Take a gander, and poke a few holes in it where you see 'em:<br>
<br>
**Disclaimer**  -  All proposed characteristics are aimed at the level 63 spell pet, which is a level 60 NPC, and casts up to level 52 spells.  The same general standards would apply to the lesser pets, with modifications where appropriate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proposed Fire Pet characteristics:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet does not melee whatsoever<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet stands by the mage's side, and upon /pet attack, either chain-casts, or casts at fairly regular intervals<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet's nukes get an inherent resist modifier, similar to our post-60 draughts (somewhere in the range of -50) <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet casts wizard spells, but a limited selection of them<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet has an infinite mana pool <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  After each cast, the pet is stunned for a fixed amount of time (~3-5 seconds)<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, a couple of these might look controversial at first glance, so I'm going to discuss the reasoning behind them briefly.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1)  No melee </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- hey, it's a wizard.  It should have the melee skills of a cotton ball.  Give it a beer mug and a glowing ring or something to emphasize that this pet does damage exclusively through spells.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2)  Pet doesn't move (much)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - In order to make the pet act more like the wizard it claims to be, it should be standing back from the mob (much like the mage is) and nuking from afar.  It should follow the mage as other pets do, but upon /pet attack, it should plant itself firmly and start chaining spells at its target.  This should allow the mage to position the pet appropriately, yet still be able to move it out of AEs on raids when necessary (with a little bit of work).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3) Inherent Resist Modifier</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Mages are (understandably) concerned about the pet's spells simply being resisted left, right, and center, thereby dropping the pet's utility to near zero in some cases.  The pet is a level 60 caster, and will likely be used on targets ranging from level ~59 to 70+.  Resists are heavily dependent on relative level, so a resist modifier would likely be in order.  With an inherent -50 resist modifier (akin to our post-60 Draughts) on all of its nukes, the pet should be useful on high level (70+) raid mobs, as they will be heavily debuffed, and most of its spells should land fairly well.  In XP groups, the -50 modifier will allow the pet to land nukes fairly reliably (without requiring the mage to Malosinia each target) against mobs that XP groups will likely be fighting (in the ~59-65 range), but with occasional resists, as the pet is level 60, casting against mobs a few levels below it up to 5+ levels higher than it.  **Note** if SOE does follow through and make spell damage (including pet spell damage) viewable by everyone on live servers, then parsing the pet's DPS will be MUCH easier.  (at the very least, they should at least let the mage see the pet's spell damage)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4)  Limited selection of spells</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - the pet should not be casting spells like Markar's Clash (it won't stun mobs at that level anyway) or cancel magic, and probably not snare or root.  It is supposed to be a means of ranged DPS, and the pet AI is inadequate to make appropriate use of the &quot;utility&quot; spells, so it should be limited to straight nukes.  Rend, Conflag, Force Strike, and Draught of Fire should be a sufficient selection for the pet to clearly have a wizard &quot;flavour&quot; and accomplish its DPS goals without stepping too heavily on Wizard toes.   Self buffs can of course include Arch Shielding, and either Diamondskin or Steelskin and possibly the FR/CR &amp; DR/PR buffs.  Hopefully the Pet AI will be smart enough to only cast those buffs when not engaged in combat, and not re-cast them unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5)  Infinite Mana pool</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - If SOE attempts to limit the pet's DPS by tweaking the size of its mana pool, mages will find a way around the limitation - they're clever like we are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  From reclaiming/chaining to suspending/switching to alternate pet, a manapool-based DPS limit on the pet is extremely unlikely to accomplish its goal while still leaving the pet actually useful to the Mage.  The more complex the mana-system that SOE implements, the more likely it is that mages will find a way around it.  K.I.S.S. and avoid a whole lot of potential problems.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6)  Self-Stun Effect</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - An NPC casting wizard spells on an infinite manapool, and ignoring recast times completely (as NPCs and pets are wont to do) would be capable of some outlandish DPS, and a fire pet doing so would be unbalanced.  In order to limit the pet's chain-casting ability, I would propose that the pet be stunned after each cast for a period of ~3-5 seconds (exact time would depend on tuning/testing).  This is a method of both ensuring that the pet observes at least the mandatory recast time, and also artificially decreases the pet's DPS without touching the cast times of the spells themselves.  If you're in a roleplaying mood, one could also say that the pet casts a mini-Harvest spell after each nuke - explaining both the infinite manapool as well as the stun effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
The combined effect of these changes is a fire pet that should be manageable/useful on raids, useful but not overpowered in XP groups, has tuneable DPS (via the length of the stun component), doesn't intrude heavily on Wizard territory in terms of burst DPS, Lures, or certain unnamed &quot;signature spells&quot;, and provides fairly reliable, constant DPS that is comparable to but does not exceed that of the other mage pets.<br>
<br>
<br>
Potential problems I see so far include:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet (as outlined above) doesn't have to be buffed like other pets do, and can essentially run forever without being buffed.  Not a *major* issue, but could probably be solved by creating a specific buff for the fire pet that would have to be refreshed occasionally to keep it operating at max DPS.  (perhaps some sort of fire-pet-only spell haste buff, without which its casting time would be 50% greater than normal).<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>b)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet *is* a wizard-class pet, and mages have received abilities outside their class via their pets before.  As such, there *may* be sufficient precedent to allow it to cast a cold-based nuke.  IMHO Frozen Harpoon should be the nuke of choice, as it is of a comparable size to the other above-listed nukes, and as only 1 of 5 nukes in the pet's lineup, won't significantly add to the Mage class's ability to damage high FR mobs.  One caveat - Frozen Harpoon is quested, and the quest is a bit of a pain (but not extraordinarily difficult by any means), so some may object to it being given away freely to a pet.  Personally, if an ice nuke *had* to be given to the pet, I wouldn't have a problem if it were Frozen Harpoon.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>c)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The pet's level (60), along with the -50 resist modifier on its nukes, may allow it to land DDs on extremely resistant mobs (eg. reavers, etc.), which have traditionally only been DD-able by Wizards.  Then again, it is unlikely that the pet will be able to land its nukes very often or for full damage, so our titles as &quot;Lure-bearers&quot; should be secure.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>d)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  An infinite mana pool may be unacceptable to some - in that case, a very large, but finite pool could be implemented in place of the &quot;required&quot; spell-haste buff proposed above.  Either solution would require the mage to expend mana occasionally to keep the pet operating at its full potential.  Alternatively the pet could have a reasonably sized mana pool (~3k-ish), and it could actually cast a mini-Harvest after each nuke.  This mini-Harvest would leave it stunned, and would replace perhaps 60-70% of the average mana cost of the pet's nukes (perhaps ~170-180 mana as pets don't have spec savings AFAIK) .  As such, the pet would eventually run OOM, and either have to med or be reclaimed/recast, but it would be able to sustain its ~70 DPS for a reasonable length of time before running out of mana (reasonable when compared to the other mage pets, that is).<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, that's pretty much my concept of what could be an acceptable solution to the &quot;fire pet issue&quot;.  There's not a whole lot that's really new here - I just thought I'd assemble it into one relatively coherent post.  Let me know what you think, and also if you see anything here that could be abused/exploited, or strikes you as just plain wrong.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bodithegnome>Bodi The Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/4/03 5:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: After all this</span><hr size=1> It's an unorthodox pet thus far, because our new fire pet is chain stun or chain root.

Actually, I'd say the normal -10 modifier that Wizard spells should be adequate, not the -50 modifer. The reason for this is the one you mentioned in your post: Mages get Malosinia. I don't see why they shouldn't be required to cast this if there is a problem getting spells to land, as that is the reason they have the spell. Giving them the -50 Draughts would, in this case, make them better than a normal Wizard because they don't get the option to do Malosinia on top of the normal resist debuff built into the spells. Given that the pets do not have to worry about a mana pool, I feel it is a more than fair trade off to require the Mage to actually use his spells occasionally. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

And even after feeling pretty put out by many magicians, I still don't have a problem with them getting an improved fire pet. But there are some simple facts about this whole thing.<br>
<br>
Many magicians have called us whiney cry babies, here and on the magician site. (As you say, nice name calling, I was not calling magicians that, that is what magicians are calling us)<br>
Many magicians have told us to shut up least we ruin it for them. <br>
There are far more post by magicians on the wizard site then the other way around. <br>
Any wizard that called for nerfing magicians was told that was wrong. <br>
Wizards are all for better pets.<br>
When asked to support bigger nukes for wizards, some magicians said no.<br>
Many wizards offered solutions and lists of spells they don't have a problem with a fire pet having. <br>
Wizards know this isn't the doing of the magicians, it's the work of Sony. <br>
<br>
On other server message boards, magicians have made statements about how they are going to laugh at wizards once this goes live.<br>
<br>
Over all, there seems to be more magicians calling names, then there are defending us, or saying, lets not piss the wizards off. <br>
<br>
While the majority of wizards agree on better pets, we aren't happy with how Sony is testing a solution.<br>
<br>
I think the real thing here is that wizards were on called to send in feed back to Sony saying, sure a better pet is fine, but as a wizard I feel that giving it certain wizard spells steps on our feet. <br>
<br>
If we had just been upset at the idea, I'm sure magicians wouldn't care. But it seemed all many magicians saw was &quot;Tell Sony don't do this&quot; which to them meant, No pet fix. And when tried to explain that was not the case, it seemed that many of those same magicians still didn't want to listen to what was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> being said.<br>
<br>
And I never said ALL magicians, just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. You're assuming that when I say most that it means all. When I feel that most magicians are coming across like this, it's fair to post my feelings about how most magicians have responded.<br>

<br>
Your wording could imply something that I don't think you actually were saying, but just to clarify, I wasn't suggesting giving them the actual post-60 Draughts with the -50 modifier on them.  I only meant that they could cast the spells I listed, but receive a resist modifier on them that was about -50 or so.  Sort of an inherent &quot;pet-nuke modifier&quot;.<br>
<br>
To be honest, initially I wasn't terribly wild about the resist modifier idea either. The considerations that I took into account (as listed above) were:<br>
<br>
1)  The Fire pet really should be able to hit raid targets, and I'm not sure that what is effectively a level 60 caster would be able to land regular nukes against a level 70+ target, even after all debuffs have been landed.<br>
<br>
2)  The Fire pet should probably be able to do its DPS reasonably well against appropriately-leveled targets in an XP group without special debuffing, somewhat similarly to the other Mage pets.  Its DPS should be tuned via spell selection and the self-stun listed above, so factoring in resists as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>major</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> method of DPS control would probably be excessive.  Besides, for resistant mobs, the pet would probably get a fair number of resists even with the -50 modifier, especially if the mob was higher than level 60.<br>
<br>
Put those two together, and there is a bit of a problem.  The resist modifier was a solution that seemed to solve both problems<br>
<br>
I see your point, though - a -50 modifier, when paired with  Malosinia, does seem to give it a bit of an advantage over actual wizards.  Personally, I wouldn't be *too* upset about that, as I don't believe most Mages in XP groups would want to cast Malosinia on each target, so the advantage isn't as great as it might first appear.  Besides, it would only allow the pet to, at best, reach its target DPS, not exceed it, as DPS would already be tuned and limited by the other means I proposed.  This is also a bit of a compromise on the Lure issue, as my proposal does not give the pet any true Lure spells, or even Enticement of Flame.  (and yes, I know &quot;compromise&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;a solution that ultimately pleases nobody&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
<br>
Anyway, got any ideas on how to accomplish both 1) and 2) without resorting to a resist modifier?  I'm just spitballing some ideas here, so it's not like I'm married to the idea of a resist modifier.  That being said, I really think that case 1) is the most important one, and the one that warrants the resist modifer most, but I think 2) is also a reasonably justifiable case.<br>

<br>
I am not sure this is actually a problem though, as it is still an NPC. NPCs have slightly different rules for landing spells than PCs do. In addition, the other pets would presumably suffer from exactly the same problem with regards to melee and spell damage.<br>
<br>
&gt;Anyway, got any ideas on how to accomplish both 1) and 2) without resorting to a resist modifier?<br>
<br>
If it is actually a real problem, they could probably do something like adding an 'effective casting level' buff to Burnout. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I too think that a neg 50 is a bit much, my reasoning is that at lvl 53 guildie could land easely vs lvl 59 mobs that were tashed (65 chanter debuffing him using magic spell). We only start to get Neg 50 once we get pop droughts and the pet doesnt get to pop lvl spells. <br>
<br>
As for him hitting raid lvl stuff, he should be just as good at hitting them as a lvl 60 melee pet. If melee pet does a thenth dps as normal then the casting pet should do the same (but it is out of AE range so it lasts longer) In normal exp groups it would keep its dps as a neg 10 and lvl 60 are more then sufficient to nuke thru most mobs, and mind you npc casters can still get thru my 150 resit at 15 lvls below me with no resist agustment.......... (not that they dont live to talk about it but the fact remains they do it)<br>

That being said, I like the idea of an &quot;effective casting level&quot; effect on a pet buff.  That would solve the problem nicely, and SOE wouldn't have to make any actual changes to the nukes themselves or resort  to a resist modifier.  (actually, now that I think about it - with spell damage being visible on Test now - is pet spell damage visible too?)<br>
<br>
...anyway, other than that, can you see any other problems with the version of the pet I proposed?  <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and a quick derail while we're discussing effective casting level:  with our various Flappies, we get an increased casting level effect - I have heard that it only affects fizzle rate, but not spell resist rate (eg. versus higher level mobs).  Confirm/Deny?  Has anyone done any testing on this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=necridious>Necridious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 347<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 12:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *FACTS* on new mage pets</span><hr size=1> To Answer caster pet not needing to be buffed, at a IMP Damage effect to Burnout that excludes the spells of the other elements<br>

<br>
It is my thought that SoE's 'testing' was &quot;raising the effective casting level&quot; only, not clearly defining a new set of spells. What they hoped to accomplish by this, I haven't a clue, unless they had deemed the NPC made to be the fire pets garbage, scrapped them, and remade them under new tools. Also, the last I heard from our illustrious Magician Board leader, SoE devs were discussing quite heatedly over the specific spells to include or exclude from the spell lineup. SoE knows there's an issue with the spells.<br>
<br>
As with the name calling (mages doing it, the few wizards that were doing it), I wholeheartedly concur. Those mages that said they were going to laugh, well I'd be more than eager to laugh at them when the resulting changes to the fire pet does not make it a godpet, and even goes live sans root and snare (I do not believe those are going live. Snare for sure won't, and I pray root is not included). While I think the backlash from magicians at the wizards saying 'IC is too much' (which it is) is, as you said, fear of the pet being relegated to garbage once again, something no mage wants to happen. We also have our share of naysayers that chant how the fire pet will never be upgraded and how they were quitting when SoE's 'next update' page came out without a mention of the upgrades to the fire pet. Good riddance to him.<br>
<br>
Point that I was getting at, I guess, is that those few (many?) mages married to IC and/or Snare should be ignored (they're likely stubborn and won't accept reason). They're idiots and they deserve to be let down if they can't think about the bigger picture. What aught to happen is a discussion of what spells are good, and what (paired with a mage's own abilities) would be appropriate.<br>
<br>
Kinda like.. With a slight investment of mana, all Fire pet spells are effectively lure (Mala = -35 unresistable debuff to any spell the fire pet would cast). Fire pets may already have an innate ability to land spells, being NPC's (and therefor, may not need too much help). The fire pet is a level 60 caster, and with the top level being 65, mobs that a caster can land spells on can most likely be hit by a level 60 pet. Only when the difference in pet level to NPC level reaches 14 levels or more will the pet be completely incapable of landing spells (Magician epic pet is level 49. It unequivocably cannot proc or land it's stun on mobs that are level 63 and higher). Are there any mobs in game that are level 74 or higher?<br>
