The value of a pp continues to increase (meaning you can now buy more with pp than you used to be able to).  <br>
<br>
Now, there a a couple of ways to counteract that.  The first is to artificially inflate the prices of items (by increasing what vendors will pay for them).  Instead of being able to get a 5pp for a Velium Long Sword, increase that to 15pp or 20pp.  I mean, nobody, ever, buys weapons/armor off of vendors anymore, so why not increase their offering prices to incent players to sell those items directly to the vendors, thus reducing supply, and increasing prices.<br>
<br>
Second, make having pp meaningful, other than just being able to buy anything.  I'm not sure what, either having your own storefront, for a price, or having a &quot;second&quot; bank account, or something.  Make it so that being rich has some real, player meaning.<br>
<br>
Do something to control the flow of cash, and bring down the value of a plat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laeyakk>Laeyakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 5:52 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well if my evil plan were actually hatched you wouldn't have non-level restricted items impacting the lower level game anymore...because there wouldn't be any<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
However, there would be floods for level-restricted items.  Every 3 levels you'd upgrade your gear by buying the best stat item for your rec lvl in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But this time you could make sure loot only got into the hands of the right players of the right level and not cause massive balance problems.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The caster/melee sheer problem would go away to a certain degree.  But, the &quot;oh cool, I got a new item by killing this mob!&quot; would still be lacking.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Or maybe I'm missing your intent here, heh<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You will notice that items that drop in recently revamped zones kick the shit out of items that dropped back when the game was green.  Look at runneyeye for example.<br>
<br>
For the same difficulty, you get items with higher stats.  That is an example of anti-mudflation work -- they revamped runnyeye so new players who hunted there would have a chance to get gear that matched or exceeded what they could buy from other players.<br>
<br>
Still, mudflation eventually made even runnyeye gear worthless.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The problem with it is that casters cant skip spells. Can a shaman skip malo or torpor? not really. Can a wizard skip Sunstrike? with lots of trouble really, the time before AT will suck horribly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is one shaman in my guild who has quin but not topor.  Skipping Tranqility is common.  Skipping Gift of Brilliance, Fortitude, Ancient: * spells, etc is also common.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I find this mysterious, because as one of the best-known 200 Research people on my server (stupid stickied Graffe thread!), I've done a hell of a lot of research for WIS folks.

<br>
L 51 levitation has easy to get components.  And there are 3 recipies.<br>
<br>
L 60 shaman spells impact guilds ability to take down targets.  Malo in particular.  Everyone in a raiding guild with a non-malo shaman should be on the lookout for those components.<br>
<br>
A shaman with malo makes some mobs possible.<br>

<br>
Outdoor zones already drop crap.  Pilsain, you are forgetting the law of unintended consequences -- non-decaying items that are tradeable cause mudflation, and the consequential drop in item value.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Example : Fungi Tunic would be a Common drop until the game had 50 or more in the system. At that point it would be changed to a Rare drop till 75 were in the game, then ultra rare drop till 100. At 100 none would drop anymore.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And thus, those who came first, would own all.  Those who came after would have none.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>s newer, bigger, better things come out... the old becomes cheaper and eventually obsolete. Its not a problem. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is a problem.  Because of balance sheer between equipment and non-equipment dependant classes, and because of the destruction of &quot;ooo, shiny new item&quot; loot effect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Changing drops is going to do nothing. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Mudflation isn't a problem.  It is the consequences of mudflation that are a problem.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Right now there is one source of money in the entire game, and nothing really to take the money *OUT* of the game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Platflation is a subissue of mudflation, not the core problem.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They could also increase the prices for which vendors will by certain items, that are selling to cheaply in the bazaar. That would at least create a floor price, and be high enough to remove those items from the game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And cause massive platflation, resulting in the values that the merchant offers being extremely low again, causing them to ramp up the merchant prices. . .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Would have to wonder if a system similar to the recommended level one could be used to make an item possess increased stats and be impossible to trade based on flag data.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, you do one of two things:<br>
1&gt; You flag an item as &quot;customized&quot; on the character, and store within the database 2 sets of stats for the item.<br>
2&gt; You store both customized (NO DROP) and uncustomized versions of items in the database (seperate items), and just have the NPC trade uncustomized for customized.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'd love to learn a few more languages and so, but my patience for simply practicing them is even more limited than the amount of training points that I have available.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
It has a central organization -- SOE controls the amount of pp flowing in to the economy.<br>
<br>
The value of pp is far less than it used to be.<br>
The value of most items is far far less than it used to be.<br>
<br>
However, look at items whose value is not in their stats.  Silks, bone chips, etc.  These items cost more and more and more as time goes on.<br>

I'm not raiding to fill someone else's irl pockets- its not their paycheck. Part of it is because they earn it and the other part is because they make use of it for the guild. Taking the idea of guild progression to ebay imo would be sick, anyone who ninja sells a droppable in my guild that was awarded will not be wearing that tag any longer. Nobody's even tried, it's always been passed to another person and voluntarily so. Hell, a group that I farmed with logged all the stuff that was given away to guild members from us and it adds up to about 900k over time. Perhaps there's the mentality of putting your guild progression before your own pocketbook here? Setting your guild back for your personal gain, in my opinion, is bad greed. Not the kind that makes the wheels of capitalism turn, but rather the kind that makes you a betrayer to your friends and totally not concerned with where you're going.<br>
<br>
I knew someone like that long ago. Someone who actually quietly ninja'd droppables in kunark era and sold them. Then he was discovered. Perhaps it's hard to get across that the whole guild raid system isn't about the individual but rather about your guild. Hell, people I see who drop from guilds 95% of the time stop playing Everquest altogether, the tiny remainder making boring alts or being one of the 2 people on my server that's a farm crew. If you'd ebay loots from your guild, then consider just why you play the game. If it's to make a profit from stuff you sell that are guild loots, then chances are your guild will be disgusted with you. Every `greedy` ebay farmer I've ever known in my history of playing EQ since release has been regarded with a sense of disgust by most that knew them. Perhaps I should say that people should be more concerned with the team that is even the reason for their playing than their personal cash gain... and suggesting that guild loot becomes economy goes against that totally.(a BOC has NEVER been in bazaar/pa on kane bayle that I've seen)<br>
<br>
I don't like the notion of people putting their pocketbooks ahead of their guild, honestly. Part of it is that most presently aren't playing for cash, and the oddball greedmonger is a bit upsetting. Even if everything were droppable, people wouldn't (in my guild) be selling stuff in the bazaar that they upgrade. That's totally absurd here for any valuable raid loot. Instead they pass it to someone else who needs it. The same thing woudl occur for your idea of a model of a Dreamer's Despair. The only difference is that it opens the door a lot wider for ebay mega-whores who would rather rip your time off than progress the guild.<br>
<br>
If your example is referring to any valuable droppables(the vanazir), then I assure you it has never happened on this server... even if the quantity of valuable droppables is less. Should someone try it while tagged, I would be furious with that person and do everything I can to prevent it. Perhaps you recall the pre-kunark naggy/vox raids with Need Before Greed? Often it referred to the dr00d who wanted to turn a CoF into plat and the rogue who would, you know, use the haste. Raiding is not about PA wealth! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 4684<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 10:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cure for gear mudflation?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The problem with the EQ economy, is that it DOESN'T have a central bank/government to help control the price of money.

Depositing money into the EQ bank earns no interest, it is simply a 100% reliable convenience and encumberance tool.  EQ banks do not loan money and charge interest and I suspect most &quot;private&quot; loans are interest-free or as part of some special agreement.  (I loan you 30k to buy KEI, you pay it back as you are able with no interest but don't refuse to buff me if I ask).<br>
<br>
However what EQ DOES have is a margin of control over the rate at which plat and items enter the economy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Do something to control the flow of cash, and bring down the value of a plat. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is relatively simple.  Just increase the cash drops more than the cash sinks.<br>
<br>
Before Luclin, people complained about the opposite:  That plat was worthless.  You could make a lot of money farming Hill Giants and slaughtering greens but you didn't have much to spend it on other than dropped items, which meant that money stayed in the economy.  It kept getting worse and worse until it reached the point where you had to save a ridiculous amount of cash to afford anything halfway decent-- although a few rare drops from Sebilis and your net worth would skyrocket overnight.<br>
<br>
Now there were always money sinks, but Luclin added what I think is the most significant, and that is horses.  Horses gave people a reason to want large sums of money(rather than valuable items), and using plat to buy a horse took that money out of the economy at all levels of play.  The value of a platinum increased dramatically as Luclin took hold.<br>

Heck, I've been saving for about 10 levels now (am a casual player, who doesn't have a full time bazaar mule), and have finally saved enough for the cheapest horse (which I'm not getting).  If they reduced the pp drop rate, buying a mount would be out of the question until much later (maybe that is ok, don't really know).<br>
<br>
But, if players could sell the low end stuff to vendors for more than they are getting in the bazaar, it would remove vast amounts of gear from the game immediately.  Lowering the pp drop rate would take a while to actually effect the economy, because of the vast amounts of plat that is now in banks.  Maybe a combination of the two for a while, then lowering vendor prices again.<br>
<br>
I mean, how often are the vendor prices being adjusted?  If we have a bazaar, what are their real purposes now if not used as a way to control money/items in the game? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26800.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26800.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26800.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
