I've seen it done alot and I've even duo'd with a bard while doing this. Honestly, if you're in an open zone it's pretty fun.<br>
<br>
All things considered, it's not very often that you see this anymore especially under the circumstances described in the original post. The problem with it was nailed by Absolute Master in subsequent posts which is that if they do it manaless it really does take an insane amount of time. Bards getting their mana back takes FOREVER. If they use mana to do it and they charm swarm then it gets done pretty darn fast. However, they won't be doing that again for like 4 hours (or something equally ridiculous. I don't remember their mana recovery time exactly. It's for-freaking-ever though).<br>
<br>
Moreover, while on the odd occasion you see it there might be a pang of jealousy there is nothing to get worked up over here. In fact, bards can solo stuff WAY faster, more efficiently, and with less risk than swarm kiting. If you take a look at the most powerful and skilled bards around you'll find they aren't doing this that often. When they do I'll wager it's mainly for a laugh or done out of boredom.<br>
<br>
At first blush, this may seem very unfair and &quot;unbalanced&quot; but again I think it's rare. If this were happening with the frequency of quadding then you might have a point. Until then, this wizard won't worry about it.<br>

You were the one that came here to call the original poster an imbecile. Ok. You're a fucking moronic jackass then. If you believe even for a second that bards don't have an extremely valuable role in raids then you're off your nut. In fact, there are some mobs that you don't even want to consider without a bard (silencing mobs come to mind). The role of the bard is as versatile as it is essential to many raids, and a well played bard is absolutely invaluable. Thanks for dropping by, misreading the post anyhow (it was a fucking rant you dimwitted fucktard), and then further displaying your own ignorance in all it's splendor by attempting to backhandedly diminish the role bards play in raids.<br>

With a full set of toilers you start singing invis roughly 1-2 seconds after the mobs start squishing your pet.  <br>
<br>
Bards are an extremely versatile class but our abilities are fairly weak overall.  Sure, we can swarm-kite for maybe 40 minutes but our mana regen blows.  Pre-PoP we only have a 30% slow, plus it has a dot component and a long recast delay.  To provide effective CC we have to give up one song per mezzed mob and we really can't handle more than 4 although everyone has probably ghetto-mezzed 5 in a pinch.  I can't begin to describe how fucking annoying twisting 4 songs constantly is; those of you who've played a bard above 30 know what I'm talking about.  Bard melee is pure crap, bard AA is arguably the worst in the game, and druids and wizards hate us for swarm-kiting.  Yeah, we have decent manaless dots...with IM3 and a good instrument.  Bard AE songs are even nicer but they still aren't overpowering (have any bards out there with extended notes tried AE kiting?).  Get this through your head: BARDS ARE NOT OVERPOWERED.  Besides, we're all officially disabled thanks to carpal tunnel syndrome :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=haemonculusv3>Haemonculus v3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/29/02 12:12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sadf</span><hr size=1> Bards are a secondary support class in most cases.

Killing something comes down to two things. DPS and the healers not fucking up/running out of mana. Wizards, in a raid situation, output more DPS than any other class (Barring Rangers in all of three or so fights). Bards are very often shoved back into the Cleric group to play the 32 mana song mixed with Amplify. Is this all they can do?

<br>
To those that missed my general point..I said No Class should be able to handle 20+ mobs this includes Wizards druids Etc.<br>
<br>
Next..Quadding overpowered? hardly..Simple fact look at the EXP gain..a Wizard or Druid quadding has about 10 mins average..I say Average downtime between quads..Sure you get 2 to 4% exp per quad but once you factor in the downtime a Cleric/melee combo actually over a period of 1 hour gets 20% more experience..Because they can chain pull several times the number of mobs a druid or wizard can hope to quad in a given span of time. If bards were controlling 4 to 6 mobs at a time I wouldnt have a problem with it thats a reasonable number. What im pissed about is the ones running around in circles with 20+ and killing them in a 4 to 5 minute span of time..That my friend im sorry is Seriously overpowered..<br>
<br>
Does it bother me when a group is in my quad spot? not really..you are right they have every right to those mobs as me..<br>
<br>
Does it bother me when a druid is there...hardly<br>
<br>
Would it bother me if a bard was there &quot;quote&quot; Quadding.. If it was 4 controlled mobs and they were taking actual risk then not anymore then the previous two..<br>
<br>
I dont have problems with other classes being in Suppossed Quad areas its FFA on the mobs ultimately. What i have a problem with is when a skill is so blatentlly overpowered. As ive said ive played a bard..they are not a easy class to play..god know they are the leading cause of Carpal Tunnel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But for god sakes cant we get a little consistancy from VI here..I mean they nerf MB claiming its overpowered when reality its more Toy then anything else..ok fine i can accept that it was a fun toy while it lasted.<br>

I'll go on record as saying that there is far more to raiding then just putting out damage and soaking it up. I'll grant you that is a very important part of how most raids function, but there is a lot more to it. One thing that immediately comes to mind is tactics - with the proper tactics an encounter can be virtually trivial. There's such a wide array of tactics involving so many classes that it's not worth going into them all. However, there are several tactics which frequently involve bards in a variety of capacities. I'm not suggesting that you're saying that's the ONLY thing to raiding, but I think you've oversimplified in an effort to strengthen your point artifically. Just run through the list of bard songs and you'll see a crazy amount of versatility that sees all kinds of usage on raids - DA, Dispel, Resists, Mana, Amp, etc.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bards are very often shoved back into the Cleric group to play the 32 mana song mixed with Amplify.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think alot of guilds misuse their bards this way, but it's their loss for not exploring the capabilities of that class completely. I still maintain that a bard's role is as versatile as it is essential.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, but on many raids their other abilities are next to useless to the raid whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, I think this might be the way your guild does it but not everyone sees them as &quot;next to useless to the raid.&quot;<br>

All bard solo methods are &quot;one mob at a time.&quot; What's your point, considering the way we do this involves multiple mobs we're using as &quot;pets&quot; is why it's quick.<br>

       Mental clarity is one of our AA's, we can regenerate mana faster if we put points into it.<br>

<br>
Swarm-kiting entails as much risk as quadding.  You're right, some bards never die while swarming...but I've seen plenty of druids and wizards quad for hours without dying.  The claim that quadding is extremely dangerous is laughable at best.<br>
<br>
A cleric+melee combo will not get nearly as much XP as a quadding wizard unless you're talking about incredibly low hp mobs.  A full group in CT does, but that's something else entirely.  While we're on the topic, do you have any idea how much XP a wizard can get quadding in PoV? :P<br>
<br>
Bard swarm-kiting might be overpowered if our mana regen were able to keep up.  As it is, we go a max of 40 minutes then wait a looooooong time before we're FM.  Please take your class envy elsewhere, bards are no more overpowered than wizards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brokenfang>Brokenfang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/29/02 3:30:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Literary exaggeration </span><hr size=1> Bard swarm kiting as it is really isn't over powered at all.  For the reasons stated.  The problem really on comes when the bards doing it are dicks.  Pre-PoP when I'ld be quadding toilers between groups to get some AA I could be there anywhere from minutes to hours and there were regularly a couple bards that would show up and start swarming.  One in particular wouldn't give a rats ass about who was there.  Could be just me, me and some other kiters or a group.  He'ld just start taking anything and everything.  The other was a lot more respectable.  If the place was being worked, he'ld either move on, or be sure there was enough left standing so that people there before him weren't scraping for anything and everything.<br>
<br>
I actually still quad in ME now after PoP, doing traps for xp.  At least until PoN and PoD clear out a bit, whenever I zone in to either I see nothing but trains all over.  There's now a few new bards in the area doing toilers.  And both are even worse then the first guy.  Two nights ago I had one of the bards come out and deliberately try to pull from my kite, he got them all (I was still gathering them together, hadn't even snared them yet) he got them all.  He died.  Unfortunately a druid ran right through his swarm and they went to him and killed him.  But not before he dragged them to the other bard that had trained me just 20 minutes before.  Who then ran them to a nearby group before he died.  Half that group died while the others zoned.<br>
<br>
6 deaths and a zone full of pissed off people that could have been avoided if one bard would have just left me to my mobs.

How much do you think it needs to be nerfed?<br>
A few weeks or so ago, they raised the mana cost from 20 to 60, that was a huge nerf for the most specialized swarm kiters. You don't need to be a rocker scientist to understand that we can only charm kite 1/3 of the time we could. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
And for the ones that doesn't know, mana was a problem before the &quot;nerf&quot; too.<br>
And the charm cap is 51, so if you want to use it to level past 60 its' not very effective.<br>
<br>
Well they can nerf away all they want, IMO Bards are pretty weak already but I play them because they are the most fun class to play for me.<br>
<br>
It's not hard to &quot;twist 4 songs&quot;, and it's not harder to &quot;twist 4 songs and melee&quot;.<br>
<br>
To twist 4 songs, clicking off and on a song every 3 seconds, switching instruments at the same time, running backwrds, strafing right, perhaps target your self, stop songs and right click an invis item to break charm, perhaps push &quot;tab&quot; to target, start new song, all this in ten seconds, and remember you are not standing still, you are running with selos speed, is perhaps a little bit &quot;harder&quot; at least it takes some speed. <br>
<br>
Almost every Bard who do this, do it in a different way. Personally I both twist and move with my left hand normally, so I can use the mouse all the time doing the other things needed to be done.<br>
It's usually called the &quot;shot em' up setup&quot;, but I think the more common one is the &quot;both hands on keyboard&quot; setup. Some use both, I actually use the &quot;both hands on keyboard&quot; setup sometimes too.<br>
I'm not the one to say if it's hard enough to make people happy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the problem is, as I see it, if VI continues to &quot;nerf&quot; everything, all we Bards have to do is standing there meleeing and twisting, a Wizard will stand, push DD spell, sit, stand push DD and so on. <br>
<br>
You know, I'm not just standing there doing &quot;nothing&quot; when I group, that's not my idea of having fun really, I want to use the abilities we have.<br>
Some people may be happy playing Bards/Wizards like the example above, some is not. <br>
<br>
You can argue Bard kiting is overpowered, you can argue that Rogues and Wizards are overpowered when raiding, it will lead nowhere.<br>
<br>
Also every class that can charm &quot;can&quot; charm kite too, it's not about running speed, a lot of Bards use SoW potions or Jboots to kite.<br>
<br>
I guess VI new &quot;vision&quot; about Bards is we should be a second class Enchanetr, so some of them whine about that, and of course they have the right to do so if they feel hurt. Others complain we &quot;can&quot; charm kite for 10 minutes, others complain we have dots and so on. <br>
<br>
<br>
As long as we can cast while running, and are(now days) one of the fastest classes, I will probably continue to play, time will tell.<br>

<br>
The point is it's hard to abuse, I'll have to try to explain how it works I guess.<br>
<br>
Take this topics example of 20  mobs dead in 3 minutes or what ot was.<br>
<br>
Now if someone was skilled enough to actually do that, 20*60=1200 mana. Most Bards will be oom after that, many doesn't even have 1200 mana, it's almost useless to get more mana as a Bard because it's still the regan that is the problem.<br>
<br>
We regen 1 point mana per tick, a tick/server tick is 6 seconds. 1200*6=7200.<br>
One hour is 3600 seconds.<br>
<br>
Hehe, wow that actually made sense I think.<br>

DOES NOT EXIST. L60 Bard here, played for 1.5 year before my wizard. I know Bards inside and out, I can count the number Bards who know more then me on less then my 10 fingers, and those songs do not exist. You either using Single Target dots that kill 1 mob at a time, or you use Charm. If you use PBAE dots, which some do exist, you have to be in melee range and then you die horribly. Running around with a train of 15-20, and Single Target DoTing does work, very possible. Its also the slowest thing in the world, and regardless fo what you like to think, Selos or no, having 20 mobs after you is never ever safe. Esp! in a zone where some of them can be SKs and Clerics to HT and Nuke your bardly self all over the place. <p>&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;<br>

      This is one HECK of a skilled bard.  So skilled in fact, that I do not believe he exists.<br>
<br>
     Perhaps you should *try* this tactic before complaining about it.   We do have things like an AoE snare dot, so I can see that it MIGHT be possible, but I'm also are that the range on it is not that great.  Bards almost have to be toe-to-toe with a mob for their snare to land.      I am aware of a fear kiting EXPLOIT in Chardok that can result in something like this, but you'd have to be pretty stupid to try it.<br>

<br>
Please learn about a class before you play it.  The only dot songs we'd dare to use in situations with 25 mobs in tow are single targetonly, and still take a damn long time to kill the monster.<br>
<br>
As someone posted, we run out of mana, we might as well just go watch tv for 30 min to an hour depending on FT/MC.  you guys? 10 min with kei tops. <br>
You think we kill each of them at once? No.<br>
<br>
<br>
It may LOOK like quadding because a bard that knows what he's doing can kill each mob in 15 seconds or less, but we kill 1 at a time.  <br>
<br>
Overpowered? Not really. Come 61 we cant do it anymore on anything worthwhile till 64... and who knows what the cap on that charm is. <br>
<br>
Please become informed about something before posting about it.  I have a wizard, I know damn well what wizards can quad and not quad. I have a bard, and I damn well know what I can swarm and not swarm. <p>&lt;img src=http://storage.djbez.com/~bezerker/ralkora.jpg&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bladesinger Ralkora Doomsong&lt;br&gt;60th level DJ of Lost Boys on Bertoxx&lt;br&gt;Children of the Darkness: Follow me.

Bards take a tremondous amount of risk when swarm kiting.  It is MUCH more difficult than quad kiting with a druid (which I have also done) and has a much higher chance of things going wrong.  I just can't understand how you can possibly claim that swarm kiting entails virtually no risk.  I will agree that chant kiting is fairly risk free.  However, chant kiting is a very slow method of killing mobs and while a bard may chant kite with multiple mobs chasing her, she is only killing one at a time.  Chant kiting does not make for fast, quick xp and the increased xp from swarm kiting makes sense in a risk vs. reward calculation.<br>
