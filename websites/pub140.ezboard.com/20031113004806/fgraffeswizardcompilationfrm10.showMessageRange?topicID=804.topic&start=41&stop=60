Well there is some debate over this, some claim to have critted with it after the change, i don't have it so i can't tell.  If it truly doesn't crit anymore, it is probably a consequence of the dot-like effect it puts on the mob now.  I don't think damage focus effects it anymore either...<br>

Sunstrike has better availability than the other 2, no doubt, but on Veeshan i've never seen a copy drop (have gone to the single group spots, and occasionally kill the velious dragons that drop it) and i've only seen 2 copies for sale, 1 for 50K, and one for 100K.  The average casual player doesn't have that kind of plat.  EER...  atm, i don't think truly casual players can get it, it drops off a reasonable amount of mobs, but you need a decent mid tier guild to kill them, and i've never seem EER up for sale.  GSS...  lol.  I can't imagine that ever becoming commonplace.  If SS isn't common yet, i doubt any of the 3 ever will be.<br>

It is more than the ratio, it's also about the crit.  Crits are the only thing that reminds people of our damage.  Without GSS, a mage with FoT can outcrit a wizard of similiar level.  That has an effect on our general groupability and on people's perceptions.<br>

No one is intended to go solo trakanon, its still useful and every boss we hit we have people manaburning.&quot;<br>
<br>
solo trak? - the credentials in your sig do not reflect your knowledge of lower seb, trak, MB, wizards, or the word 'solo'<br>
<br>
still useful? - unless the mob is very resistant to spells or has to be dead insanely fast, there is no reason to press the manaburn button. if people are regularly using MB now, its because theyre pissed that they mistakening bought a horrible skill and it makes them feel better if they actually put it to use =p. MB takes away all your mana and you cant rod up... is 7k really worth it when we have a 3k nuke?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;2) Loss of crits on Manaburn<br>
Dunno why this was removed, I didn't/don't have a problem with manaburn crits&quot;<br>
<br>
no offence.. but why would it matter if a mage 'had a problem' with MB crits? on that same note, why the would a mage 'have a problem' with any aspect of MB at all? (unless of course youre on a PvP server =p)<br>
<br>
&quot;4) Inability to obtain Sunstrike, GSS, EER as well as other less desirable but useful high-end spells<br>
People get Sunstrike and EER, it may be hard for the very casual player but it is possible even if frustrating. GSS is the only one I dont see becoming commonplace for 6 months or more. THO drops EER and hes not all that anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
actually.. THO is harder now. SS hasnt been sold on lanys for over a month, and ive killed mobs that have a 'decent' chance of dropping it 20+ times in that time frame. no SS. is it obtainable? of course, im sure its in the. however its way too rare in comparison to other classes nukes.<br>
<br>
EER has never been sold on lanys and its immediately snatched up by one of the tons of wizards that are looking for it if it does drop. its a rarer than SS is (a kunark nuke) and i know many 60+ wizzys w/o SS. i have to say you have no idea what youre talking about.<br>
<br>
many wizards i know dont even consider GSS anything but a fairytale. they *never* expect to see it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;5) Relative availability of comparable Druid nukes (Moonfire) and Mage nukes (FoT)<br>
Its all about the ratio, 95%+ of mages are conj spec'd and the FoT is a bolt...miss one and your ratio/efficency goes right out the window. I can speak to the druid one.&quot;<br>
<br>
it takes a half a day to change and max your spec if you want to. bolts require skill to use.. and not much skill at that. i know very well how to use bolts, and 95% of the time, if they dont hit, its your fault.<br>
<br>
&quot;7) Decline in usefulness of Evacs in PoP due to graveyards<br>
How so...there is a zone in evac, Succor or something? (not a porting class sorry) I havent seen anyone picked for a group specifically to be an evac since kunark era.&quot;<br>
<br>
consequences of not having evac are much less with graveyards. before, you needed a necro/sk and coffins. now you need to wait 15 mins.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;9) Raid exp system eliminating extra Wizard exp on raids<br>
WTF lol. That is a pure 100% selfish whine right there. You think the other 50 people on that raid are there so you can get &quot;extra Wizard xp&quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
see my posts above about that. you want exp? do more damage. the group doing the most damage is rewarded the exp. however, now that the raid exp is fixed (supposedly) i really dont care with everyone getting decent exp.<br>
<br>
also, no one should attend a raid for exp. its a nice bonus that a class who cannot get exp groups regularly usually gets the benefit of exp at raids, however this is only due to the damage = exp rule.<br>

We wizard and other int casters except ench CANNOT even get in a GROUP! So I find it np just to get exp when they can GROUP and they have a CHANCE of getting some exp. (however I always fail to get exp since the bastage leader always tags with 2 rogue group with epic and insane weaps, + backstabbing 1200x 2 is not funny :/)<br>
<br>
Mana burn still crits. Innate I think... Did a whooping 7900 crit with 3900 mana... and 6700crit with same mana. Its so pathetic that its not even funny. MB is now a very situational nuke. I might find some use in the future in new contents of PoP but atm, its a nuke to show off the cool graphic that it has and can kill green con mob in 1 shot to receive a couple of OOHs from low lvl peeps /sigh. <br>

I have seen wizards crow about quad xp in guildsay,ooc and messageboards.I have never seen them offer to share it with classes that need a group but cant find one atm.You don't need them to quad but they dont need you either when a spot in a phat xp,loot camp opens up either.Its very easy to say raids are not for xp when you are the person getting it all. Wizards have formed up Ks groups on raids since my first trip to fear.If you can quad and ks raids and then whined for a group  far as most people are concerned you can gofuk.No one forced you to pick a wizard or to keep playing one not happy change classes. Wizards got a lot of goodies in a lot of the expansions to bad if they skipped you in POP deal with it. If you were not leveled enough to take advantage of things in SOV or SOL to bad. Most wizards that want a group in my experience want to afk XP and claim aggro issues.As a side note I think wizards should get approximately 30% more mana for int and concussion should remove 25% more hate than it does it now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jayteebushwacker>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/21/02 8:48 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Declining Enjoyment in Playing a Wizard (10 issues)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>solo trak? - the credentials in your sig do not reflect your knowledge of lower seb, trak, MB, wizards, or the word 'solo'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your right I shouldnt have said &quot;solo&quot;.  Half the reason they nerfed it to a reuse timer is a couple wizards could Manaburn Trak, Venril, and basically any 32K or less Mob.  The other half is it would have really hit PoP bosses hard, almost the the point of trivialty, in its old form.  Of course that second part wasnt really know at the time of the nerf.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>is 7k really worth it when we have a 3k nuke?<br>

<br>
Yes it is when there is a mob hitting you with a 3K ae.  Our wiz always have a MB cycle going.  The difference is they probably regen mana 4X better than most wiz so they can still nuke shortly after MBing.<br>

In an XP group your right, but on a raid thats not the case.  You cant anticipate that ranger's bowstring crossing in the path of your bolt 3/4 of the way to the Mob.  Bolts are hit and miss unless the thing is 90 feet tall and you back up five miles and even then if everyone is using lev you may still not hit.<br>

<br>
It is still effected by innate criticals, evidently...<br>
<br>
The ability is very costly to obtain, and when used it leaves the Wizard completely impotent.  If used when the Wizard is not at full mana, it's effect is laughable.<br>
<br>
This really needs attention.  I don't object at all to the imposed &quot;1 minute of Mana Burn immunity&quot; immediately after the ability has been used on a target, THIS was a necessary measure to insure that &quot;Burn Crews&quot; weren't trivializing content.  However, as it stands now, the ability is completely unjustifiable.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other points you made I don't agree 100% with, although I don't think the game would suffer if Wizard nukes were more readilly available.  Personally, I think we nuke fine with our vendor purchased nukes, the problem is our aggro mitigation sucks.  Concussion is inadequete, and isn't guaranteed to land, especially on high level mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=swipey>Swipey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/21/02 1:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Declining Enjoyment in Playing a Wizard (10 issues)</span><hr size=1> Velocir :<br>

The &quot;hitting concussion gem&quot; comment was, indeed asinine, and intentionally so.  The point, which you apparently missed, was to exemplify how foolish it is, IMO, to make comments on how easy it is to play some other class in a situation you have not played that class in yourself.<br>
<br>
What level IS your rogue, that gives you all this expertise on how easy they are to play well in raids?  I notice you didnt mention that, leading me to believe you don't have a rogue of such a level.<br>
<br>
How about you don't tell me how to stick people in the back, and I wont tell you how to wiggle your fingers, eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
PS : I have a 44 wizard, which may not quite be raiding level, but has given me some insight into the class.  So far he has been a heck of a lot easier to play than my rogue ever was, though I admit some (or possibly even most) of that is because he isnt my first character, and hasnt had to struggle for every bit of gear and learn every zone and game mechanic from scratch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzeendao>Tzeen Dao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/21/02 8:18 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Declining Enjoyment in Playing a Wizard (10 issues)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Several good reasons:<br>
* Mobs resist you less often<br>
* You resist AEs more often<br>
<br>
It's all about the resists. Oh, and Ice Spear of Solist is pretty easy to get. Not easy, easy, but pretty easy. And it's a better nuke than Sunstrike.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Raid XP needs to be less than normal group XP. Otherwise, people would form super groups and farm XP. Raid XP should be for raids.<br>

<br>
How much damage you do compared to others is not a measure of how skillful you are, sorry, it's mainly a measure of what class you are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It takes more skill to max your damage as a rogue than a wizard with all the straffing and moving required. I mean I'm not saying it's *hard* to maximise your backstab opportunities as a rogue but, damn, it's not hard to max your nuking as a wizard either .. The main limitation is the MT aggro - if he can hold good then you can do lots of damage quickly, if he is less good you have to concuss more. <br>
<br>
If xp were rewarded on the basis of skill or effort, I think the puller would get all the xp on most raids myself.<br>
<br>
But the ironic thing is that the wizard was probably the class that needed raid xp least, since, at 60, we are one of the classes that gets xp fastest, especially when you include our near zero setup time (gate grab kei in nexus or PoK, gate to bind, start quadding~)<br>
<br>
The most ironic thing of all about this whole thread is that PoP has greatly boosted the desire for wizards in xp groups anyway, which is what a lot of us most wanted. Evac is much more used now than before (or at least relied upon); and if there are 5 wiz lfg well umm group with them! Well, 2 of them anyway hehe. 3 wiz cle slower tank is an awesome setup (snag kei first, not usually hard).<br>
<br>
PoK portals have been a blessing since there is little excuse for anyone sitting /lfg any more, just /who all X, send a few tells and people can run join you in 10 mins anywhere in the world. Dont even have to go pick them up any more. If they are not flagged for PoV go crawling deep in a tier 1 zone, xp and loot is just as good.<br>
<br>
The only reason wiz have trouble lfg in PoV+ is that it's the easiest class to pass a trial with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bovinitydivinity>BovinityDivinity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/4/02 9:23 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Declining Enjoyment in Playing a Wizard (10 issues)</span><hr size=1> Er...why is Sunstrike so hard to get?<br>
<br>
Last time we camped Ragefire (Before the the changes) we had Sunstrike drop off a guardian wurm within 1 hour of being there. We only stayed 2 more hours, so can't speak for whatever rarity it may or may not have had there.<br>
<br>
So it may be very, very rare. Either way, if it can drop off Skyfire mobs, then it isn't anywhere near unattainable. <p>Bovinity Divinity<BR>

Option B is kinda bad one considering even weak guilds can clear hate and fear and lots of growth which is great plat and 2 maybe 3 raids and boom your guild can buy atleast 1 sunstrike.
