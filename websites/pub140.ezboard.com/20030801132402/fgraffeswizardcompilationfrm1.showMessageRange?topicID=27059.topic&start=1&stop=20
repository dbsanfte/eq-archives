<br>
1) Stuns: these are technically damage, but they shouldn't be overlooked.  Until you get Markar's Discord the damage is on the low end, but they are more useful than most give credit.  Stuns make the monsters stop attacking early in the fight (saving damage) make them stop casting any point in the fight, and stop gating at the end of the fight.  They can give people breathing room, such as enchanters and clerics.  They are a good mix to throw in to make sure you are helping your group as much as possible.<br>
<br>
2) Snares: yes, there's 5 other classes with snare (bard, sk, necromancer, ranger, and druid) but they aren't always handy.  Further the AE aspect of your snare actually works out nicely on multiple pulls.  Mezed monsters don't stay that way permanently, and a snared monster stalks the Enchanter slower than a full speed one.  Further, Snares not only stop runners, but they slow aggro from taking effect in a sense: monsters that are snared don't zip around the battlefield at full speed when they get aggro on someone other than the tank, they walk slowly over, giving the tank more time to regain aggro.<br>
<br>
3) Root: again, lots of other classes with root, but yours will tend to be slightly better most levels and further the other classes often have other needs for those 8 spell slots where its not as desparate a situation for you.  Root allows you to control aggro and movement on the battlefield, because rooted monsters will attack whoever is closest to them no matter WHO they hate.  Stopping a monster that the enchanter is being pasted by will allow them to back off and control it better.  Rooting that monster that's runnin amok hitting all the medding people is always appreciated.<br>
<br>
4) Ports and Evacs: the only reason you'll get into groups sometimes, and the reason groups will have to break up when you leave at times.  When you are the only porter deep inside Hate's Fury or Hate, people tend to see you in a better light.  This won't come up much until you are rather high level although the next expansion might make it more useful.  Evacuates have been more or less made useless because of lesser evac (there was never any need for more than one in any case).  Ports will let you get people out of the group or the entire group to safety or a hunting spot better than anyone else in the game when you get high enough level.  When you get Decession you can even fire sleeping group members to the zone.<br>
<br>
5) Skins: these get spendy, but when you are high enough level they'll let you get away with things normally you'd avoid.  The high level skins or epic skin let you take a pretty good hammering and keep going, where many casters would have folded up a while ago.  This means you can walk the aggro line closer (combined with concussion) to keep your damage up in an emergency, as well as take a few hits for the team until they can get things under control.  By the way does it annoy anyone else that they call our skin line &quot;RUNES&quot; in the spell picker?  Jerks.<br>
<br>
6) Stacking: Wizards, along with a handful of other classes in the game, stack more or less infinitely.  You can have 16 Wizards in a raid and none will be sitting around wondering why the hell they even are there (well unless too low level to hurt anything).  16 enchanters is just silly, for example.  <br>
<br>
SO any other thoughts?  Positive ones, that is?<br>

<br>
 We can chainstun mobs, albight not as well as a chanter but it can work (its rather manaintensive but works) helps keep a masty caster at bay.<br>
<br>
Snares, in a dungeon if a mob runs away it can atract friends...... not a good thing. <br>
<br>
Root, parking for aggro and parking them while the pull is still in effect so that you can avoid messy situations. <br>
<br>
These last 2 make us great ghetto mezz, along with a sow we can kite them all day long, and even kill them for group exp while the group takes down the regular nastys.<br>
<br>
Guess this falls under nuking but against a 400resist mobs that can only be hit by lures its nice to comment &quot;hey why arent the other casters nuking&quot;.....<br>
<br>
Thats all I have to add atm, im sure ill find more later but anyway...<br>

There are many occasions where my main jobs, besides nuking, include:<br>
<br>
1) snare running mobs<br>
2) root park multiple pulls<br>
3) kite the unsnarable adds<br>
4) protect the healer(s) by pulling mobs off<br>
5) protect the MT if you know the ch is late by stunning the mob<br>
<br>
Sure, they are not as elegant as mezz or charm.  But when done properly, they are nevertheless just as effective.  For those that are open and willing, I urge you to learn and perfect these skills.  Once you build a reputation by being versatile and skilled, finding groups and getting help will no longer be a problem. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naeanthesorcerer>NaeanTheSorcerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 5:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards when they don't Nuke 101</span><hr size=1> our snare i think is a waste in an experience group.  because it's AE, it costs a lot of mana, and more often than not, when you're in a group, it's only going to hit one mob.  because of the waste of mana, i don't snare in a group unless i am the only person there that can.  a druid or ranger can snare the mob just as well for 35 mana as i can for 125.<br>
<br>
root i think is a really good spell, except for the people that won't move out of the way when a mob is rooted.  this is especially bad in BoT and other zones where you fight mobs that have really large melee range.  i don't know if they really don't notice two different mobs hitting them or what it is, but a lot of tanks will back a few feet away and act as if the problem is taken care of, meanwhile they're still taking damage from the main mob and the rooted one.<br>
<br>
when your crowd control is just a root (whether done by a wizard or any other root-enabled class) everyone needs to pay attention to where they are standing and where all the mobs are in the camp.  sometimes this requires a little more thought than the ideal situation where a chanter mezzes and the problem is taken care of completely.  all too often, people are not willing (or maybe not able) to expend this little bit of extra effort. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=492380" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jomarti8/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1964<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 5:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards when they don't Nuke 101</span><hr size=1> the main problem really is, if I have to do support in a group alot instead of just pure DD, the exp in such a group is way slower than in a group were 9 of 10 spells I cast are DD <p>Sage Quineloe<br>

<br>
Using a mix of roots/stuns and nuking mobs to death insanly fast (ice comet did alot more relative damage to a mob back then, then SoS does to exp mobs now), wizards could really shine if they put the effort into doing so.<br>
<br>
Hell, landing a stun when the cleric announces &quot;CH&quot; and the tank is near dead can be that extra few seocndes needed before he hits the ground, or rooting the mob thats chasing down the enc and about to slap him silly.<br>
<br>
wizards can be alot of fun when we get tools beyond just nukes, and wish VI would toss us a bone now and then (more stuns that work on higher level mobs, better roots/snares/etc) that fit in line with the class and can just at the extra who-ha to make us diverse but not step on toes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yaleldar>Yaleldar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 5:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards when they don't Nuke 101</span><hr size=1> Don't forget your HOTKEYS !!!<br>
Lets the group KNOW what you are doing. <br>
<br>
Some of mine i have set up in GROUPING bank of hotkeys<br>
1. /g %t is ROOTED<br>
2. /g %t is SNARED<br>
3. /g %t is STUNNED  ( NOTE: can have multiples of this hotkey and maybe add,,,, FOR # here&gt; SECONDS ,,, since we have different stun times on our different level stuns.<br>
 MIGHT also want to point out to the melee that a stunned creature does NOT attack !!,,, BUT,, it will/ and can do the RIPOSTE ABILITY to ppl attacking from the front.<br>
4. /g EVAC INC ,,, GET CLOSE TO ME NOW !!<br>
<br>
Little reminder not to prematurely activate button insertion until you are sure spell has NOT been resisted,,,hehe.<br>
<br>
These serve to announce in group say what it is we are doing. Communication is key and allows other group members to know we are good at other things besides nuking . <br>

We can get away with snaring very early. (i snare on pull for example and dont get hit.)<br>
<br>
Pushback spells can be very usefull in some situations, Rooted mobs can be shunted about by us to more benifical places. (only problem is we do enogth damage to make them summon too, so take a chanter when your pushing puppets off the stage.)<br>
<br>
And the rune/skin thing dosent really annoy me, But naming concussion as a jolt spell when its 39 and jolt is 50 really winds me up.... <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95533"><b>Jadrax Darkfire</b></a><br>

Make SURE Your group is surprised when they suddenly evac, and the cleric happens to be DA (oops, guess maybe that should be hotkeyed too) and is left behind. <br>

Only problem it doesn't matter, because complete heal is a low lvl spell and is way too powerfull.<br>
Stuns are only usefull, when you don't have a cleric in the group and have to rely on slower and lower heal spells.<br>
It's more effective for the &quot;group mana&quot;, that the wizard just nukes and the cleric just heals. You prevent almost the identical damage, by just nuking anyway.<br>
<br>
It's sad, but the game is imbalanced on the healing part, too bad it can't be fixed, because all the mob damage and so is also based on the complete heal spells that are now in the game.<br>
<br>
Stuns are so far only usefull to disrupt casters, but prevent damage? Nah, maybe in 2 percent of the situation, where the cleric is not paying attention or fizzles his complete heal.<br>
<br>
I sure wish, they were more usefull. So far i only use stuns when solo or against complete heal mobs.<br>
<br>

Heheh exactly my talk.<br>
Grim your summary is a nice guide, but it only applies from level 1 to level 45ish imo.<br>
At least from tier 3 on in PoP things change that much, that most of our 'utility' is not that much of a utility anymore.<br>
Despite that, many classes are better in that area of 'utility' than we are and our possibilities are unreliable to a degree where it becomes even a danger of the group often, instead of helping.<br>
<br>
Rangers btw get a manafree snare <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>skill</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, so i was told. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fredre@graffeswizardcompilation>Fredre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 681<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 6:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> I for one would like to see Enrage put back on PoP yardtrash MOBs.  In PoV a well timed AT can cut enrage completely if not mitigate 90% of it.  This is also a great spot to use Telekin since Enrage lasts a set duration.<br>
<br>
Grimmy, you forgot about the PULLING wizard.  The Flux staff is the premier pulling item (low aggro, no damage, always hits, and unlimited clicks) and concussion is the next best thing to FD, especially when combined with a snared MOB who isn't quite at camp yet. <br>
 <br>
Let us not forget about stun pulling as well.  Nothing like a 3 to 8 second head start running back to camp.  I've used this one quite effictively in dungeons (hint: I don't even have run1)<br>
<br>
Then there is my favorite ... ROOT PULLING.  Yes, the perfect way split MOBs.  If your going to have to CC, may as well start by rooting the first and let social aggro pull your first target.  This works REALLY well when you also have an Enc in group who can mem wipe.  <br>
In an 8-person raid on the third floor of Ssra (me being the only INT caster), we used this method when a General had spawned near the entry door rather than having the monk take several minutes splitting them.  <br>
<br>
Outdoor zones are a blast to pull as well.  A good many levels of quadding is some pretty tough places makes you figure out how to get MOBs to avoid getting too close to other pathing things.<br>

<br>
My personal favorite is using Stun when I see a CH heall call. 6 extra seconds is alot, and has made a difference between life and death for groups I've been in.<br>
<br>
When we have our enchanter friend with us, he always AE mezzes, then remezzes single targets. I AE snare and then root the mobs he's mezzing. By this time, the tank had aggro nice and good, and I can nuke has much as I want. <br>
<br>
Sometimes we have a second wizard with us. Two wizards in a group completely change everything, let me tell you. Using alternating stuns and DD, the both of you can burn down a mob, and keep it doing very little, while the rest of the group beats the crap out of it. <br>
<br>
But don't expect much credit. People seldom focus on whats going on besides what they are doing. Many won't realize that your stun as the CH was called probably was what allowed it to land on time part of the time. That you stun stopped the mob from Healing it's self or gating. <br>
<br>
Yes, roots are great, and when they don't move away from a rooted mob, it's not effective. First, try and lessen this from happening by telling them what you are planning on doing before fighting. Second, either have it in your hotkey setup, or a social key made to tell them to back up.<br>
<br>
I've used the eye of zomm to see if the way ahead was clear in places I know there are wandering mobs. And your right, in new zones, or revamped zones, they rock. You can also use it to target a mob in an area with multiple mobs and have a cleric pacify one, if you can't get viusally close enough for the cleric to do it. There by making it easy for the puller to do his job. <br>
<br>
But at the same time, don't expect any congratulations from many people for what you do, since they won't see it or what realize at first how helpful you really are.<br>
<br>
I think that is the biggest challenge of playing a wizard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27059.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27059.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=27059.topic&start=61&stop=65>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=27059.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=27059.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=27059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=27059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27059.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
