She could see that her robe was soiled in the dim light. She knew she had been sleeping quite a while. With no idea how she got here or what had occurred, she was unsure what to do. She sat up and stretched her aching frame. She rubbed her eyes sleepily and looked for her shoes and dagger. Just then her faithful pet peeked out of the corner where he had been hiding. He bounced over to her, but even he looked terrible. She summoned a meal for them both and they ate with relish. <br>
<br>
Now she just had to figure out where she was. Eliani stood, bumping her head on the low ceiling. It appeared to be a cave of some sort. She felt around until she thought of summoning a light. There, now she could see. There was a crude door in the corner of the room. She tried the rusty handle. It appeared to be unlocked. She hid herself and her pet and opened the door cautiously. No one appeared to be about. She was in a dank hallway fashioned of dirt and rock. She moved quietly. In a corner she found a sleeping Goblin. She must be somewhere in the Lake of Ill Omen. The goblin did not wake. He appeared to be older than any other goblin she had ever seen. Somehow she was not afraid. She sat down to think. Walking the short distance she had, had almost been too much. She was still weak. <br>
<br>
The Goblin opened one eye and looked at her. Then his face lit up. Now this is a gastly thing to behold, when a goblin smiles, but Eliani was somehow pleased. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are back with us, I see.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, but what happened to me?&quot;<br>
&quot;I will tell you, but first come and have tea with me. I have been waiting for you to waken.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eliani wondered about having tea with a goblin, but went anyway. She followed him to a meager hut hidden from the lake by trees and bushes. Her pet followed close beside her.<br>
<br>
The goblin handed her a mug of tea and she sipped cautiously. He sat down by the fire and told her this story.<br>
&quot;I found you in a deadly fight with a Sarnak, Dear Girl. You were poisoned and your pet appeared to be dead. So I took you to the place where you woke up a bit ago. I would have brought you here, but there is no room. I had a healer friend look at you and he told me that sleep would be the only thing to cure you. He checked on you several times. Yesterday he told me you should wake soon. I had no idea your pet was even with you. I had not seen him arrive.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How can I repay you? You have been very kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just come and see me when you pass this way. I am a scholar. I have spent my life delving into the history of my people. I am trying to finish a great work before I die. What I miss is the company. Just come and see me whenever you pass this way.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That, kind Sir, I can easily do. For now I must go and find my sister and my family. They will all be worried about me. I appreciate all that you have done for me. More than I can ever say.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before she left, Eliani summoned him all sorts of treats to eat, some writing paper and pens. Eveything he could need that she could think of. She hugged him good bye and went out into the day. She would have to make her way to the boat and go find Slaini and tell her this tale. <br>
