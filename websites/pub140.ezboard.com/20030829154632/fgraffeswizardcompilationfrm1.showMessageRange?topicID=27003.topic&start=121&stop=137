<br>
invis is only really useful when the mage starts talking shit about how he is better dps than you becaue he has a pet and isn't completely mana dependent.  one cast and 'what pet?'<br>
<br>
as far as the group familiar idea, i really hate it.  one of the things that i like about being a wizard is the selfish nature of the class.  i consider it a trademark that none of our buffs will hit anybody but ourselves, and almost all of our aa are strictly from our benefit.  (don't start with the 'nuking benefits everbody' crap either, because i realize that.  our crits and scm though are nothing compared to stuff like MGB for benefiting other people).  i get groups well enough, and when i feel like it i have no trouble making them.  i work for myself, and my pet works for me and me alone.  no flappy of mine is gonna be some desprate group's crack dealer.<br>
<br>
one more thing: i think we would be much more powerful if it wasnt for the tanks that don't listen when you say that a mob has been rooted.  they should have sense enough to think...hmm, maybe i should get out of the way.  more and more often i find that when i announce that a mob is rooted, casters move out of the way, and tanks just stand right next to it.  i don't really know why, but they go right on doing it.  shamans seem to do the same thing with a rooted and slowed mob.  i saw one get beat to death 3 times in one group doing exactly that, as if root and slow was the same as mez.<br>
<br>
wizard crowd control is as much limited by the other people in the group not understanding how to work with wizard-controled mobs as it is by the wizard not being able to control them. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=492380" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jomarti8/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=targonis>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 795<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 12:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back to business.</span><hr size=1> I'd love to see a spell or ability that prevents us from being summoned.  If they don't want us to use it for soloing, make it work only if we are grouped.  I for one, HATE the idea that mobs will have an innate ability like summoning characters to them.  A spell might make sense, for a god it would make sense, or a very powerful creature.  Level 51+ isn't considered powerful anymore the way it was in the original EQ.  Without mobs summoning us, our root/snare abilities would be more desired.<br>
<br>
Another idea would be to give us an AA that lowers the rate that our spells get resisted.  Wizards USED to have being resisted less as a class feature, but it's been gone a while from what I've seen.<br>

<br>
Andrael, the point is that we already <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> group utility.  We have a surprising amount of it beyond &quot;nuke nuke nuke&quot;.  What people tend to be saying when they want group utility is &quot;I want buffs&quot;, or &quot;I want debuffs&quot;, occasionally an &quot;I want slow&quot; and then a Cedrich post with &quot;I want everything&quot;.  The way to becoming a better wizard and finding more groups isn't the addition of new abilities, it's mastery of the ones you already have- even the ones you overlook, as Natan and Quinloe do.<br>
<br>
I am deadly serious on the snare + root utility though.  If I hadn't used it, gotten good results from it, and noted it was very effective, I wouldn't stand behind it so strongly.  Judging from Natan's arguments, it doesn't seem he's ever tried this before- or at least tried it beyond any precursory attempt- and is thus knocking something he knows nothing about.<br>
<br>

Not sure if that would help soloing too though.<br>
<br>
I dont know how many classes get root+snare+stun. Obviously we do, and i think druids do. Clerics who worship one of the evil gods do and after that im not sure theres anymore.<br>
<br>
Jiva, (and now DoThunder,) where the only no-recast-delay stun-interupts in the game, dont know if thats still the case, but there definatly good for our class. Hell, if they added a 0.1 sec stun to Shockofmagic, removed its silly rest mod, made the stun effect level 65 mobs at least, it might even be a good spell.<br>
<br>
Only two classes get evac, evac is very powerfull ability. Graveyards take forever and in PoP most CR is painfully slow. Much better to evac and fight the way back to any dead member.<br>
<br>
I would like to see group versions of every buff we can cast on others added to our class. Just for convinence if nothing else. Cant see us ever wanting to MGB o'kell though.<br>
<br>
Personally i think we should get better vision spells. Plainsight should be castable on others to bring it in line with the LoY buff. Eye of Jadrax should be added which can fly. probably wont help get us groups, but it is suppost to be one of our stihcks.<br>
<br>
But all of this is pretty minor, right now im pretty happy with my class. Were not required no, and no class ever should be. We are usefull and anyone who passes us over because we are wizards is playing 3 expantions in the past.<br>

<br>
Claud, i mentioned it already... i have done exactly those things you are advertising, since a long time, because... Well beccause mainly for one reason: I couldn't keep up with the DPS and kill rate of Meleers and i wanted to contribute at least <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>something</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the group. That were the days in Kunark, at KC for example, or Dlands.<br>
<br>
I was chain stunning Mobs, snareing them, root parking them, just because my mana would not allow me (and i was a good decked out Wizard those days too) to keep up with the group.<br>
What else is left, if you have only breeze and c1 on you (because there was nothing else out back in those days) and you can't keep up with you rmana? You stun, yeah. Great. <br>
You had to save mana, and stuns were cheap and that was all that you contributed to a group (save the occasional throwed in nuke). A conflag took 0.00001% HP of the mob away and drained 10% of your mana <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You have to accept, Claud, that the game has changed, since long actually.<br>
Groups DO NOT look for a Wizard who stuns, and parks an add, that is anyway offtanked or mezzed or not even incomming.<br>
See invis/invis DOES NOT get us into groups.<br>
Telekin DOES NOT get us into groups.<br>
Powerexodus DOES NOT get us into groups.<br>
<br>
The typical exp group these days is still exp grinding, especially in the plances Quineloe mentioned in his post.<br>
<br>
Claud, not only the game has changed, but Wizards have changed too.<br>
The only thing that has not changed is player mentality. But they see now, that Wizards can do NOW, what they were designed for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>originally</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We can do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*now*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sustained GREAT DPS, that is not surpassed by anyone, but maybe Mages.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Our bonus is, that Mages are often too lazy to nuke and send in only their pets... many of them are like that.)<br>
<br>
Groups DON'T want a ghetto-mezzer when they look for a Wizard. CLaud, you ever read about the grouping problem of Druids? I tend to agree with them, that they have some issues because they are generalists.<br>
<br>
If a group feels like they need serious mezzing, then they take a mezzer into their groups and don't want/expect the Wizard do mezz something.<br>
<br>
They expect us to do damage and we do it better than any Meleer these days and THIS is what gets us in groups now and this is what groups expect from Wizards.<br>
<br>
I'll give you one more example. A couple of days ago i grouped in BoT (wanted to finish my key). It was a standard pickup group, nada uber. Some people were level 62, some level 63, some level 65. Average 08/15 gear. They ooced: Group looking for a damage dealer and i asked the OOCer in tells provocantly: 'If you want DPS, take me, i provide multiple times the DPS of ANY melee class (including rogues and rangers) and i can sustain that.' He didn't want to believe me, but got intrigued, so they asked me to come.<br>
Well when i arrived there the first thing i did on the next incomming... i casted Telekin (of course resisted, hehe) when the Mob beat on the BST, our slower. I ended up tanking that Mob and just chained SOS and a draught as a finisher. (Channeling focus is so nice, heh.)<br>
Bottom line of the story: I could have saved the 300ish mana for the Telekin and just opened up with SoS (which i did then afterwards for all of the next mobs) and invest the mana in pure efficient damage than into some form of ghetto-wannabe-MIGHT-WORK-MIGHT-NOT-WORK-utility.<br>
As usual i didn't even bothered about my aggro, i had the Mobs usually after 3 second on me, but they died within 20 seconds and i barely got hit (thanks ID 5 and LR 5).<br>
<br>
But you know what? I made the test... I announced a 3 min afk, intentionally. And they kept pulling another Mob , and i was NOT doing anything that time. Result: Instead of 20 sec <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>it took them 2 minutes without me nuking to take down the Mob</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ( it's no exaggeration, it took them really 112 second, i checked, it, hehe) and their tank was SERIOUSLY hurted.<br>
Boy, they were so glad when i came back from my afk and the mobs died again within 20 sec.<br>
<br>
See what i want to tell you here, Claud? IF a Mob is dead, then you don't need to snare it, to stun it or root it, and THIS is what groups expect these days from Wizards.<br>
Groups do not care, if you can train derail something, because there ARE not trains in these days anymore. And if there are two or three mobs in the camp, then you have it either mezzed or slowed and offtank.<br>
And high AA Wizards do make very good killer-offtankers nowadays <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(Balanz)Hmmm....very interesting. How much of this is AA, how much is runes, and how much is gear? How much is specific to <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Most comes from AA, bro. You need Quick casting, Channeling focus, ID5, LR 5 and, if possible, ND3 (to get the max out of your gear). The rest is gear of course. Heck, i never ever thought pre Pop, that int casters would be able to exceed the 6000 HP mark.<br>
Runes? No time to cast that and a waste if you cast Forceshield on yourself. (Better invest the mana in another AT or SoS.)<br>
On a standard BoT exp mob - for example,- i took (untill it was dead and boy, they die fast, perma-chaining SoS and draughts) around 200-300 damage, if things went bad i took 800 damage. (And 800 damage taken is still MUCH less then the average tank takes from them, if they have no Wiz and need 2 min untill the Mob is down instead of 20 sec.)<br>
The healer was a Druid that time, he started to gave up on the healing job and just nuked too, tossing me between the fights a small heal.<br>
<br>
The game has changed, the power of characters has changed and SOE finally got us there, where we should have been ALONG time ago:<br>
We are sufficient damage dealers and we can provide good sustained DPS. Finally. <br>
It's more fun than ever to be a Wizard and to be able to perform your role to burn stuff.<br>
<br>
The game has changed, no more pitty 50 points stuns beause you can't do anything else over the time in a chain pulling exp group. <br>
SOE got it once right, the first time, to balance Wizards properly in PoP. Thanks therefor.<br>

<br>
    Aye, but this varies for each individual. There are a LOT of different ways to play a wizard, as you yourself said, but taking that a step further, there are some groups, as Natan pointed out, that don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you to snare, root or stun. You talk about impressing your group with your CC abilities, but what if you're in a group that kills so fast that you never get adds? Or, in a group where none of the mobs gate, is a stun really a better idea than SOS?<br>
<br>
 With the re-introduction of the dungeon crawl in the next expansion, i think emphasis on our other abilities will come naturally. One missed snare, root or stun will probably have a good chance of ending the quest.<br>
<br>
Anyone that doesn't know how to use other options will be quickly reminded by his group the 1st time a gater isn't stunned and starts summoning them one by one. Or a runner isn't snared and brings back a train. <br>
<br>
Could we use an AE root? Doh, of course, and it would be very effective without being overpowering. Single target snare? Long overdue, also very valuable. <br>
<br>
But would this get us grouped more? No. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Claud... wow man. Its true that you have a brain, but its seems to be somewhat overshadowed at this point by attitude. Do you even HEAR yourself? Ok Ok.. You are the uberest bestest playing wizard who doesnt even really play anymore that there is or has ever been and you definately know MUCH MUCH more about wizards than we deluded n00bs who think maybe MAYBE our grouping situation could be just a tad bit improved. We are all su&gt;&lt;0rs and fools for having differing opinions than yours. I can see that now. You win. We lose. I'm sorry. You've made your point. What WERE we thinking?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Weak flame... but since it has little constructive content I'll consider it one.<br>
<br>
Now granted, this thread has plenty of flaming and whining (although some of the weakest I've seen in a long time). But when the author flames Claude who defends (with an unusual number of references to &quot;cocks&quot;) that roots/snares/stuns are useful to Wizards. As Andrael originally stated at the beginning of this topic, he's mainly interested in the groupability of pre-60 Wizards. Surely any pre-60 Wizard worth half a salt would agree that knowing how to use non-nuke spells is important to your ability to help a group. Non-traditional groups use roots/snares/stuns quite often.<br>
<br>
Grow up. Your flappy idea is not all that hot. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

ANYway... Did you by chance...<br>

Notice the little winking guy in my post to him?<br>

Notice Claud NOT getting mad at me?<br>

Reckon thats a hint?<br>

For the record, while I dearly love to give Claud a hard time, (SOMEbody has to keep him in check - LOL) he and I both keep our real flames in &quot;rants&quot; and trust me, you would KNOW if either of us flamed each other or you for that matter.  <br>

<br>
wizards are damage dealers. we do damage ! i only want to do damage. i dont want to buff people, i dont want to heal people, thats why i have druid, shaman, and cleric alts. i want to only do damage on my wizard and maybe a few ports. <br>
<br>
some think our damage is ok, some think its not. im in the middle. its ok, we do more damage than other classes sure (except for an upgraded ice nuke post 60), but we could also be better. since mostly what  we are about is damage we should be far better at nuking than any other caster ( and i dont mean better by a few hundred points of damage). and the better damage we have the more desirable we are in groups. <br>
<br>
and another thing, i am free to state my opinion, and you are free to state yours, but do it a nicer way or dont say anything. i know how to play my wizard, and i know what i want. ( and by the way i also know how to read very well, so i knew what this thread was all about when i posted.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yandidari>yandidari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/24/03 6:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aauminki>Aauminki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 7:02 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> Couple of pages back someone asked me why I would use Telekin on the Xegony encounter, and I just thought I'd respond.<br>
<br>
First off, of course you don't cast Telekin on Xegony - that's a given which I thought I put in my original post quite clearly, although I did refer to her as a hooker.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we don't usually have an overabundance of healing classes which is where stunning the trash wave (non-nameds) mobs comes in. When the assist tank calls a new target, it's often crucial that the CH has time to land - whilst other classes that can heal spots the only thing I can is to help prevent damage with Telekin which I do in those cases (Xegony and elsewhere) where the mobs have a rather high DPS even slowed and healing is scarce. Telekin is actually a nice DD as well, so DPS wise I don't lose much from using this instead of a draught - the aggro is concussionable anyway, just one concussion after a Telekin and I'm usually back and ready to nuke again. <br>
<br>
For the same reasons, Telekin comes in handy in those situations where you off-tank high level unmezzables. Since clerics are usually dealing with the MT and AEs offtankers are often left with druids/shamans as sole healing and here Telekin helps preserve their mana as well as spreading the wizard's aggro between both the main mob (decaying while you cast on add) as well as aggro on add decaying while Telekin refreshes. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370955
