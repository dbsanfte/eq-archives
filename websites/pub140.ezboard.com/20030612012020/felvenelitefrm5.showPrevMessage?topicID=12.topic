    The realm was new the sky where still forming the heavens.  The Gods of new were just starting to create the societies of good and evil.  One of the early Gods Tunare the great mother gave birth to the Elves and one such elve was born no more then the clothes on his back and a love for all his elven friends and Tunare's creatures. Tunare the great mother saw this in the little elve and came to him in a dream .. Dear elve I have made for this realm I come to you to offer you a gift since you are of this earth I imbue the power of summoning at your command.. Monolete fell to the ground thanking his mother.. The dawn appear and Monolete woke on a morning that he new he had a purpose the will to save the realm not for himself but for Tunare the great mother.  But how would Monolete please Tunare which could help him on his quest.  Then it came to Monolete I will use nature it self as a symbol of my love to do my bidding .  The power that great will need help Monolete set out on a quest of gathering, Monolete found himself in some dangerous but some stunning features of land of creation that the Gods could bring to the realm.  Monolete's ventures took him to the Great Mountains of Velious he pull out his hand a summon one of four gems and he raise it into the air, the winds howled spiraling around him as if heavens were touching the earth with a mighty force all started gathering into the palm of Monolete's hand which he held the gem.  That's one, Monolete thought now on to the other ones.  Monolete search on with the air gem in his pocket. His search bring the tired mag to the great waters of Timerous Deep he dive into the waters swimming his way to the deep cold reaches of the waters together the elements for his next gem of water.  Only two left together he found his way down in the depths of the Gnome great fortress of Ak'Anon after he had already collected the fire gem from the combine infernos of the old dragons that use to roam the land free of persecution.  Now found himself in the dark befriended by the Gnomes who worship the great Brell Serilis not his mother of nature so he was cautious in his ways he pass by the worshipers of the dark ways but Monolete watch at a far learning many things but he stay on his path finding his way threw the passages and tunnels to the earth bottom.  Monolete pulls out his final gem as he does so the earth starts to glow and shake causing the walls to crack and dust to fly when the shaking had settled he had gather what he needed and was off to his birth place where he has his greatest power was in Greater Faydark he said good bye to the Gnomes.  Monolete was very weak from all his journeys he place the for gems on the ground and with the powers the great mother Tunare gave to him.  He began to concentrate, his hands started to glow his powers  of his heart came out in a flow summoning the gems together.  Out came from the combination a monster, a monster of elements but with only one difference this beast of new had a heart.  I shall call you Scruffy you are little now but you shall go on to do great things.  The power that was used took much out of Monolete making him weaker.  Scruffy ask what should I do for you my new master.  For me pet you shall do me honor by going into the world and start setting things right things right for the realm.  *I will do you right master* Scruffy says. Before you leave the old mag using the last of his power summon his pet a mystic book of power a journal or testament of journeys. You shall write down in here for the generations that will come to show what you have done for them.  Will do master and Scruffy set out into the realm with a new purpose....<br>
