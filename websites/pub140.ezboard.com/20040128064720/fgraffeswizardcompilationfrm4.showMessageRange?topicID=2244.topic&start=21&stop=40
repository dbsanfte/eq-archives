Technically speaking, it's not entirely incorrect for them to say that they raped a mob.<br>
<br>
As for women who have been raped, take it on a case by case basis. I don't honestly know or associate with any guys who don't take sexual rape seriously, but I also know women who throw the term around as callously as anybody. At least one of those women has been raped herself, no less.<br>
<br>
It's not really a question of panicking over offending people. As I said, strictly speaking, it's a correct use of the word. So take it on a case by case basis. If somebody is offended by the use of the word, don't use the word. If it doesn't bother them, go nuts. Language is ever changing... The onus is on them to tell you that they're offended, not the other way around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grindel>Grindel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>High Priest of HLS</span><br>  Posts: 1845<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 2:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> That's a lot of words that still say 'if I want to use rape it's your fault for being upset by it'.

Rape is an act of violent domination, and the victims are left scarred for life. Some of these scars are physical, others are psychological. Use of this word, even in EQ, may bring back incredibly painful memories for some of the people who hear it. I'm all for a rape victim getting the counseling he or she needs to recover from the trauma, but even those who have put the event in the past may be hurt by this casual usage.<br>
<br>
It's easy to say they should get over it. Have you tried getting over it? People are going to say whatever they want, and others are going to be hurt by what they've said. I prefer to minimize my chances of inadvertently reminding someone of something so horrible. <p>Chesse Defenestratrix Shardic, <br>

All of this says in three different quotes that the responsibility does not lie in you it lies in others.  You're free to act how you want, its the OTHER person who is wrong for being offended.  You've said it in several posts now and I understood your point each time.<br>
<br>
As for me using the word fuck, if I'd posted this in OT I wouldn't have.  I use it in rants in this thread strategically, just like I used the dictionary-to-asshole statement strategically.  The fact that you caught the irony is only a half-win though, since it's still all about others and not about personal responsibility of the fucker using the word 'rape' like it's just another adjective. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ikeya>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Stamping Out Stupidity</span><br>  Posts: 3450<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 3:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> I know a girl who said she wanted to be raped.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Most people don't even understand that &quot;rape&quot; the word and &quot;rape&quot; the act are two different things.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So GG to you for not reading the whole thing or understanding the point I was trying to get across.  I never once said that the person reading the word should be responsible for not feeling offended, I simply said that they shouldn't be shocked to see it.  If they are, they should say something as well.  I am a firm believer that people should be careful of what they say and mindful of others (you should talk to me in RL sometime... I'm very tactful with what I say and how I say it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )... but I'm also a firm believer that in many situations people need to take what they see with a grain of salt.  As Auri said you need to look at the context the term is being used in.  If someone says &quot;We're gunna rape Xegony tonight!&quot; it's very different than someone saying &quot;AFK to rape my girlfriend.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pedidustyboots>Pedi Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 734<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 3:19 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're just not getting it.</span><hr size=1> Rombus, I absolutely agree -- there is definitely a way to express yourself without saying curse words.<br>
<br>
I don't know who wrote this in forum rules -- I always thought it was you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>... Besides.. a foul mouth doesn't make you look very impressive.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That statement applies 100% to words that aren't necessary. &quot;Retard,&quot; &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;rape,&quot;and so on. There are plenty of slang words that don't involve degrading someone or something in some fashion.<br>
<br>
Swear words + the above words have the enormous potential to offend. Not everyone is offended by those, but that doesn't make it any less significant. Any time we decide to swear or express ourselves in this manner, we take the risk of coming across as junivelle and thus appearing as unimpressive to other people.<br>
<br>
Whenever I decide to swear, I accept the responsibility of possibily offending someone and belittling my own position. I know that and I accept that. <br>
<br>
If someone calls me a cunt and I'm not offended by it, does that make it OK? No. That word is meant to be hurtful. &quot;Gay&quot; and &quot;rape&quot; is meant to be hurtful. You can use them in a manner that is not meant to be hurtful, sure, but there's always the chance that someone is going to be hurt by it anyway. Why bother?<br>
<br>
People have the right to go ahead and use these words, but in all honesty, they aren't going to look very impressive, are they? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7088<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 3:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're just not getting it.</span><hr size=1> You're right, and I agree with what you just said for the most part.  The problem here though is that in games like EverQuest you're dealing with a wide range of people of all ages.  A 12 y/o boy most likely does not understand what you're saying.  When he says &quot;wow, we raped Soandso&quot; or &quot;man, that was gay&quot; do you think he's using those terms literally?  Of course not.  When you go into &quot;worlds&quot; like this you have to enter them with an open mind and literally allow yourself to take more.  In a way you do have to take some responsibility for yourself not being offended.  Go ahead Girndel, jump all over me for that one but it is the truth.<br>
<br>
I for one would not tolerate someone using half the terms they do in game in real life.  I give my brother dirty looks when he swears around me.

First, I read every word you wrote.  I quoted the parts I deemed relevant.  I assure you, I did quite well in reading comprehension when I was a kid and I understand your entire position.  You're stating over and over again that people should get over it, you don't mean anything 'bad' when you callously use the term rape, even in the face of all the other people who have posted in this thread that the term used in-game does everything from puzzle them to send a shiver and reflexive physical impulse through their RL body.  Since you don't mean anything bad when you say it others should just accept it in the non-mean spirit you're saying it in.  <br>
<br>
Except that's not what happens, as the women with the courage to post above point out time after time.  So in light of the offense the term generates, and it's quite apparant that it generates offense, usage of the term becomes a puerile, selfish exercise in appealing to the lowest common denominator.  You can continue to argue for the behavior, but I prefer to toss my hat in the ring of enlightenment and good taste. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 1019<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 3:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're just not getting it.</span><hr size=1> Grindel, you won't see me use rape or gay to describe events in EQ.

<br>
People type tons of hurtful things and vivid stories of nasty acts without even realizing they're being hypocrite. If you think using rape is hurtful and shouldn't be used, why then are you using other methods to try to achieve same thing? Does it make it more OK?<br>
<br>
Grindel, is your rant about &quot;It is ok to hurt other people, as long as you don't use word rape?&quot;<br>

First of all, stop saying &quot;when you&quot; or &quot;because you...&quot; I don't use that word.  Secondly, that's not what I'm saying so you obviously don't understand.  Allow me to explain it  again... I'm saying that there is a difference in the way the words are used, and you shouldn't get over it but <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">you shouldn't let yourself be susceptible to it</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  There is a difference there.  What I'm saying you should get over being offended by words with multiple meanings as there are many terms like that which both men and women use that are equally as &quot;destructive&quot; in the setting you are in used in the way you have a problem with.  Read the post I made before yours and understand why some responsibility does fall on the one viewing the term, and why sometimes you need to actually take a deeper look.<br>
<br>
As far as the women in this thread (3, 4?) pointing it out time after time, there are also women who use the term themselves.  What of this, please?  It's been cited as happening twice in this thread so far between multiple women.  Ill bet there are more cases of this as well. *shrug*<br>

<br>
Anyway, so it boils down to the fact that people should raise their invisible force fields when other people (not you, the people you are defending and supporting) misuse the term rape.  Not that the person stating it should STFU and use a less charged word.  You're STILL passing the responsibility off from the spewer to the spewee.<br>

The group you're defending has co-opted the word to create the difference, then went off on its own to use it, and damn the consequences.  The usage did not just pop into our culture overnight, it was started.  It's my position that it should be stopped; the slippery-slope probabilities alone are enough justification. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7090<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 4:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misusing the term 'Rape'</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(not you, the people you are defending and supporting)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Man, do you even read what I'm saying?  A quote for you that you should really read...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;The problem here though is that in games like EverQuest you're dealing with a wide range of people of all ages. A 12 y/o boy most likely does not understand what you're saying.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Once again, while the person typing should be careful of what he / she types, the person reading should also be prepared to read the slang.  It's a mutual thing, the responsibility does not fall on one person.<br>
<br>
By the way, saying that you just &quot;raped&quot; a mob is NOT a misuse of the word... people appended rape to mean what it does today, the original meaning is different.  Oh well I guess, why do I even bother?  I'm just glad the rest of the people understood my stance on the situation and what I was saying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Couple of months ago we had this same discussion about word rape, own, fuck, fuq, etc. on one other board. And curious enough, the discussion looked pretty similar (although I wasn't one who got to dictionary, I was slow).<br>
<br>
Main conclusion was that EQ (and other MMOG's) seem to have developed a slang that has many words in use which people would not say aloud in RL. Nevertheless, in same discussion it became apparent that most people avoid using those loaded words when someone in party, group, guild, etc. objects to it. Since most people playing the game are polite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Old wiz, quite a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nmnh.si.edu/paleo/dino/">dino</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> :)<br>
