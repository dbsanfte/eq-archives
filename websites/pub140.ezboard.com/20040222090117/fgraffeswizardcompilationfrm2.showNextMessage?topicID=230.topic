<br>
The skeleton's spawn is incredibly close to the zone in from EJ.  The problem is it's up the wall and to the right of the zone.  The only way to get to the skel is either grav fluxing someone up the wall, or doing it the hard way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The hard way is fighting your way to Mist Castle.  Before you get to Mist Castle, you will definitely run into some reavers.<br>

If you use Grav flux to get to the skell black reavers are not a concern.  If you try to get there with out using grav flux you must go through two black reaver spawn points.  Which means an indeterminate number of black reavers and at least two Lords.  Unless you have at least 18 people about level 50+ I strongly advise against trying to get to him without grav flux. <p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>Aelina</td></tr>

Have a group hang out at the bridge.. pull the area clear of spawns.. the bridge, behind the gate and along the right side there on the ledge.  As soon as its clear, buff yourself all up, grav flux up to the upper ledge.. run around aggro the heck out of the skeleton.. Jump into the water near the bridge from where you came.. and get onto land near the bridge.  Soon enough the skeleton and some of his buddies will be on their way.  In general you might pull 3-4 mobs if you cleared the way pretty well.<br>
<br>
If the Skeleton is up, you will hear/see him casting buffs on himself.  If you don't hear it in the area of the bridge.. then his PH is up.  I suggest doing a Grav Flux pull of the PH and any crap thats up top.. kill all of the mobs that come.. and wait for him to spawn.  I forget now.. its either 20 minutes or 40 minutes for the respawn.<br>
<br>
This is something I found out the hard way..<br>
<br>
If the COM Human Skeleton is Mezzed and Charmed.. he will not accept the bottle from you!  He needs to be Charmed BUT NOT Mezzed.  I had the darn skeleton in front of me charmed and mezzed.. lo and behold some other wizard shows up and and stands right next to him.. my assumption was to try to steal the spawn from my group by giving the bottle in.  So.. I was going click crazy with the bottle and finished the quest the moment he unmezzed.  He nukes pretty hard too, so be careful (maybe 45th level wizard).<br>

In 6 hours the wizard never spawned. We pulled tons of goos, plaguebones, vapor golems, shadows but not one single human skeleton.<br>
on a side note, the golem needed for the Cannabalize II spell spawned, and he shammie got what he needed. Now I have to take my group back to CoM tommorrow, and hope he spawns.<br>
This is silly. I had figured that the skeletons shared spawns, but not getting one to spawn in 6 hours is kinda crazy. I hope he spawns tomorrow. <p>Jarnin Fisheermann

I think it's a random... Not too sure.  All I know is my group had to kill SEVERAL PHs to get him to spawn.  It took us 2 to 3 hours to get my jar handed in.<br>
<br>
To make sure you're killing the right mobs, I'll give you some directions.  If you face the main gates at CoM while standing on the bridge, look up.  On the top of the wall is a path where mobs roam.  Follow the top of the wall with your eyes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> to your right</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as far as you possible can.  Once you stop following the wall, you should be facing at a 90 degree angle too the gates, with the gates to your left.  Right at this point is a door (you can't see it from the ground.  Just inside the door, is 3 mobs.  The &quot;a human skeleton&quot; spawns in one of these places.  Sorry, I don't remember which spot he/she specifically spawns in.  It's been a long time since I did the quest.<br>
<br>
I used bind sight to learn the tops of the walls in CoM.  I bound sight to the wanderers up there.  It worked well.<br>
<br>
Last weekend, I did a raid to CoM with my guild.  While fighting the first reaver, our pullers were able to pull the skeleton.  If you can't do the grav flux method, bring 2 groups of 50ish people and start killing.  Fight your way to the &quot;camp point&quot; right before the Mist Castle and the &quot;a human skeleton&quot; should be more accessible. <p><BR>

But since they changed these spells recently, you cant recast over and over to hop around the zone.  You have to be able to see your target from YOUR eyes and not from the mob that you are currently sight bound to.  This makes things that much more fun when trying to do this quest.  I used Shifting Sight when I did the Karnors part to check for the roamers on the landing zone.  I tried it a few nights ago after the change and I was unable to bind sight on anything up there.  I also couldn't transfer the bind like you used to be able to do.<br>

<br>
Like Baedm said, gravity flux up to the path, turn right and you will see a tower or something with a door on your right.  If you go inside the door, the human skeleton spawns right behind the door.  You'll have to turn around and look for him since you won't see him right when you walk in because of where he stands.  I would assume that his placeholders stand in the same spot, but I won't swear to that. <br>

<br>
I have completed this quest already, I was simply pointing out that the old trick of using bind sight to check the path or verify that the skel is up will no longer work.  I did this quest when it was possible to bind sight and transfer your bind from mob to mob throughout the entire zone.  This made things extremely easy to verify if the human skeleton was up or if you were going to be in for some PH killing.<br>
<br>
OFF TOPIC: I also liked to use Bind sight in Kithicor Forest at night while waiting to go through the zone.  Just a time waster really, but I could get from one side of the zone to the other using bind sight.  After the changes, you can only bind to a mob if you can see it directly.  I think this drastically reduces the use of this spell.  Why would you want to bind sight to something you can see anyway?  The only reason I would do that was to rebind to something I couldn't see to extend my sight that much further.  This is no longer possible.  That is what I was attempting to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaarani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aarani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/8/01 3:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Human Skeleton in CoM for Brain Bite</span><hr size=1> Ah, ok.

<br>
I am one of those 40-ish Wizards who would like to get this spell now despite the fact that everyone says it's intended for higher-level play. I have a 50 Bard guildmate who can charm it for me, but we are a little low on enchanters and wizards who can Grav Flux (none in fact).<br>
<br>
After reading every post on this board(and others) about getting the CoM Skel, I have a theory for a new way to pull it - without Grav Flux - that I want to run by my fellow wizards.<br>
<br>
It has been said elsewhere that by standing on the bridge and furiously clicking the base of the tower, you can actually target the static spawn that stands opposite the human skel. <br>
<br>
What I would like to try is this: After clearing bridge/courtyard area with a full group, I target this mob, and my group moves to the ledge below the skel room. I would then stand as close to the wall as possible and cast a PBAE spell like Thunderclap. Group moves back to bridge, and we wait for mobs to come kill me<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If it did work, it would be almsot certain death for me, but that would be worth it to me to get this spell, and easier than finding a volunteer wiz or enc to grav flux another volunteer up to the wall.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on whether or not this would work? Could I Bind Sight to the mob first to make sure no other spawns wander by when I cast? The gods know I have hit both intended and unintended targets thru walls(hermit in SK) and above and below me(Najena, Aviak treehouse,&lt;insert dungeon name here&gt;  before...<br>
<br>
Anyway, if I am cracked tell me so<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But if any fellow wizards think this might even have a remote possibility of success, I am going to try it.  <p><FONT SIZE="-3">Invectus Stormborn<BR>

As far as bind sight goes, that has been nerfed so that you cannot bind sight to a target you cannot see.<br>

If you can find a way for this to work though, that would be great! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As such, if you are in range, thunderclap would work.... but it has a Z-axis problem where it only works in your plane.  I would suggest casting an Al'Kabor line spell on yourself (as in target yourself) for the larger radius and I think it will hit all Z-axis like a raid. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=6029">Azlinon Seflarian</a> of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony">Divine Symphony</a><br>

<br>
Cleared the courtyard with friends.<br>
<br>
Diamondskinned.<br>
<br>
I ran around to the ledge to the right of the zone exit..it hangs over the water.<br>
<br>
Lined up just in front of the door to the room, stood on the edge of the railing above the water staring at the wall.<br>
Gfluxed and landed right in front of the door.<br>
<br>
I pulled the room down, and we killed the placeholder (a phantom), then killed the rest.  (we did this several times, sometimes just killing the ph and zoning)<br>
<br>
I went back up and waited in the room for the human skeleton to pop.  Soon as he did, I jumped down, and my necro buddy charmed him, turned it in and was done. <p><img src="http://kazzap.homestead.com/files/bar105.gif"><br>

It was also super late, so I logged out very upset, and with a corpse sitting near the zone-in.<br>
<br>
Many more hours of placeholders later, Sunday morning at 5am, the human skeleton finally spawned.  I tried handing in my bottle while invisible to undead, and I became visible before a trade window appeared.  I think the last patch took away the possibility of trading while invis to undead.  So I died quickly because of course I wasn't buffed up or anything, I just assumed that I could give the bottle without becoming visible, just as I did with the human skeleton in Karnor's Castle when I did that part on Thursday night.<br>
<br>
So about 6 hours later I called my enchanter friend over, and with nearly a full group to take care of the train pulled with the skeleton, the chanter charmed the human skeleton with little difficulty.<br>
<br>
I got my brain bite!  The thing is, I went to KC to look for a group, and nobody wanted me so I still haven't tried the spell out.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the other parts of the quest PALE in comparison to this one.  I think I had terrible luck with the skeleton placeholders, has anybody else had to kill 13 or so placeholders to finally have the skeleton spawn? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=173.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=173.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=173.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=173.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=173.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=173.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=173.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
