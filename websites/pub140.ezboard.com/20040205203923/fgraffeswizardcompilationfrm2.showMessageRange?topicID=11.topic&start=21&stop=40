<br>
He will give you the 10-item chest when you spout the correct words.  You put your ten rods in the chest, hit combine (to my knowledge, you can't fail on this), and viola, you will have both the staff and eyes in your possession.<br>
<br>
To get the runes for Ice Comet, you must hand in both the staff and eyes.  That's the only thing you'd hand in either item for. <p><i><b><font face="ARIAL" size="2" color="#FF0000">

<br>
My experience with Erud's was the same as some others, in that there were NO sharks around when I got there. It was daylight, and I think the reason might have been that others may be pulling them ( or maybe just luck).<br>
<br>
If it was luck, I must have used it all, because getting the rod from LGuk is a nightmare. <br>
<br>
I notice that some posts reference Invis to Undead potions. I've looked for these but not found them. Would some kind soul post locations where these can be bought, or post which class(es) make them so I can buy them?<br>

Not to mention the 49 Cleric who came as well.<br>
<br>
This wand is funny like that.  I talked to 3 wizards on the server who said that they just slapped on invis and swam down with no problem.  I slapped on Camo, Sup Camo, Invis vs animals, invis vs undead, and wolf form.  Each time they not only saw me but agro'd me from varying distances.  The necro was able to swim and get the corpses without an agro, but then we agro'd the second time when we went to get the wand and he had to use harmshield.<br>
<br>
The sharks hover basically above it, but I've heard levi and invis ofver the rod, swim down and gate works, but it didnt for me.<br>
<br>
I died 2 times doing that.  I've died 2 times swimming below it.  Same with the druids, it got nasty.<br>

I did this 3 patches ago, so check it out, sharks may have been changed due to the FA implimentation.  /shrug<br>

I got this rod solo with no problems, and no sign of sharks.  I'm on the Rathe server, and it was late evening/early morning game time.  Just swam down with invis and enduring breath up, grabbed the rod, and swam back.<br>

<br>
Sometimes invis seems to work, and sometimes it doesnt.  Or, more likely, sometimes the sharks are super aggro, sometimes they're not.  <br>
<br>
My advice.  Go give it a try.  If it doesn't work, come back the next day, maybe there'll be no sharks or they won't be aggroing on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxaxia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaxia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/21/00 1:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: staff of the wheel, rod in eruds x-ing</span><hr size=1> Timing is everything getting this rod.

Took a guild brother and I less than 5 minutes to get the rod, and get out shortly before dawn ... I was a bit embarrased since I had warned him about the sharks and the potential for a quick death.<br>
<br>
Went back later on, again well after midnight Norrath time, and again - No sharks.<br>

May be worth further investigation.<br>

<br>
Well I finished the quest and I am only Level 21.... was 22 when I started so you know what happened <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway I would like to say that it is not as hard as it seems.  Only thing is a lot of travel and gate spells a plus.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Erud's Crossing I saw the undead ship and the rod was a ways away from it.  Invis OK here and I did not see any sharks at all.  Nobody was camping them but may have been recently killed.  That Rod was very easily obtained.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everfrost underwater river to caves to house was OK but once at the house I underestimated the power of iced bone skellies.  3 of them conned green at 21.  They are casters however and I died 2 times trying.  3rd time I had help from a 40 shaman and a 40 some magician.  I only needed one of them though.  In these caves beware of the Lich and his pet.  They wander around and didn't ever come up to the house but on your way there you may run into them.  And yes endure breath will be needed.  Grab waterstones from a mage.  When you touch the rod all 3 get pissed and attack.  Never tried invis vs undead.  May be the key.  Found &quot;dusty old jawbone&quot; no doubt some other quest.<br>
<br>
Lake Rathe underwater cave to goblin tower much like the one in Oasis except more water travel and yes endure breath will be needed.  Invisible DOES work.  They never saw me they conned red and look threateningly.  There was also an npc named &quot;Deep&quot; with 3 gobs where rod was.  While invis you grab the rod, equip it and move along.<br>
<br>
Dagnor's Cauldron/Kedge Keep, I felt that you should really express in your description for this one that it is underwater.  I was unfamiliar with this area and found out it was in middle of lake underwater.  Endure breath might be avoidable with high level swim but recommended since it is dark and you might have a hard time seeing.  Swim around up top to find loc and then go down to grab.  Nobody guarding it for me.<br>
<br>
Lower Guk Dead Side Reanimated Hand Room, by far the HARDEST rod to obtain.  Getting to this zone is bad enough but then once in you need to go down to 3rd level and then to the D area (kinda like the 4th level (look at eqatlas.com's map for this area)).  There is somewhat of a safe area between 3rd level and the D area which is a hallway where ppl rest up.  There are corpses along here though no doubt from trains.  I had the luck of some guy there who checked out the way to the hand room and said there was nobody in it.  So he escorted me and you get to a room where you climb up a ramp and then there is water above you (gravity has no place here for water I guess) then you swim up.  The room up there is hand room and the Rod was there with no mobs (I most likely got lucky).  But I died 3 times doing this one.  All 3 times on 1st level not knowing I had to go down that far.  Invis vs Undead a MUST!!.  There are bats and maybe a type of froglok here that can see you with invis vs undead but hopefully they will be dead from groups killing them.  They are only on 1st level from what I saw.<br>
<br>
Oasis area is another underwater watergoblin tower thing.  Invis should suffice and endure breath not needed.<br>
<br>
Highpass Hold, other than being KOS in this town I had no problems finding/obtaining it.<br>
<br>
Qeynos Aquaducts/Catacombs, No problems obtaining.  Sharks there are usually camped.  NPC there liked me but killing him will help you with faction of Qeynos merchants and guards but make corrupt guards hate you.  NPC conned blue at 21.  Easy way there is to go to North Qeynos and get in that hidden area (looks like vines growing up a stone wall rest of wall has no vines).<br>
<br>
I told you about Neriak, it is in 2nd zone in from 1st zone.  There was a leatherfoot deputy swimming around it, and beside rod was some old coin for some other quest.<br>
<br>
Unrest had me scared esp since the whole guk thing.  It was a breeze.  I had the extra luck of getting a druid to group me and turn me into a wolf.  Undead do not aggro on wolves.  Invis vs undead would have sufficed.  Like it says water to the right of mansion, swim down go in hole cross corner form the one to spelunker.<br>
<br>
Took 3 nights (3-4 hour sessions).<br>

The hardest rods to obtain (above mentioned aside) is the one in Lake Rathe.  I got lucky on that one and grabbed it while a group was camping whatever spawn it is that sees through invis.<br>
<br>
The DW Goblns in oasis don't see through invis...you can just go invis and drop in to grab the rod...works well.<br>

The other rod that may be hard to get is in Neriak...I had a friend lead me back when I was like level 12 or something to get that one...couldn't find it again if I wanted to I think.<br>
<br>
as for the Eurids Crossing rod, the only sharks I saw were so far away from the boat that you would have had to try real hard to agro them.  Just swim down a littl ways till the the seabed flattens out and look around a bit - can't miss it.  Also I think it was night time when I tried, and I've heard a rumor that the sharks DON'T swim the holding pattern at night....<br>
<br>
good luck <p><P></P>

<br>
Oasis : Piece of cake. None of the gobbies saw thru invis. However, some caster types can spawn and they will see thru invis. Always con before going in the tower to get rod.<br>
<br>
Everfrost : Get enduring breath, swim thru tunnel, waltz in and get the rod. Not a single icebone attacked. All I had on was regular invis.<br>
<br>
Rathe : Died once on this one. Get enduring breath and invis on. Tunnel is at approximately pos 2600, pos 1425. It's long and extremely dark. Just go straight in the middle of it and you'll run into a tower. First time, I was about to grab it and a dw gobbie saw thru invis and ripped me a new one. Second time, had a guildmate (55 bard) help me. We just swam in and grabbed it with reg invis on. Nothing attacked. I think I was unlucky the first time - caster gobbie must've spawned and has see invis on.<br>
<br>
Erud's Xing : As I've stated before, swim in and get it at night. Most likely won't be a shark there.<br>
<br>
Others are a piece of cake including Neriak. Invis, walk thru 1st gate and jump in water to the left.<br>
<br>
I'm praying that I don't die more than 3 times for the Lguk one...<br>

For the erud crossing one, i took the boat in qeynos and went down on the first stop. I got the good loc, was buffed with endure breath by a druid friend who was with me, see invi, invi and go.<br>
<br>
