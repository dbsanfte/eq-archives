<br>
I was discussing with the SK if he wanted me to snare the mob or if he was going to take care of it.  He asked me to take care of it because for some reason it liked resisting his &quot;snare&quot; (He was also 3 levels below me.. I'm 61 he was 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
That's all fine, cept then the cleric comes in (The group leader) instructing me when to snare, not to snare to early cause I'd agro the mob.. not to nuke to hard cause I'd agro the mob and die. (This isn't the first time I've heard this type of thing).<br>
<br>
What the?? Why does a cleric need to tell me how to do my job?  Last time I checked I was the wizard.. thing is, this isn't uncommon.  To many Wizards over nuke, don't know how to use a simple spell like Concussion (And any wizard who's above 51 that doesn't have it is crazy) and just don't know ANYthing about agro/crowd control.<br>
<br>
After that discussion, the SK pulled (good pull) but for some reason the second Guardian agro'd on us.  The second wizard in the group (He was 53) ran from the group.. I cast evac and boom we were at the zone in , and everyone cept for the other wizzy (Who decided to run as I said before) was alive and kicking.  I was getting tells from the whole group sayin &quot;Wow, what a wizard&quot; and stuff like that.  Again WTH?  Isn't that our job, shouldn't EVERYONE be doing that type of thing??<br>
<br>
On another note, I haven't played in over a year, and a lot of things are new to me, but still, our job hasn't changed at all in the 4 years that my characters have been around!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izlaaru>Izlaaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 11:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> Hrm, can't seem to find an Edit command, so here's my Edit:<br>

I have played for a long time and have seen it all. If someone posted on a major board that bards sucked then it was law. Within a few days bards everywhere were being kicked out of groups and made fun off.<br>
<br>
I play on stromm now and even there you have people at level7 FFS saying they won’t group rangers or wizards for X amount of reasons. I mean damn at level 7?!!!<br>
<br>
I can understand if the group needs to fill key spots first like tank, healer, crowd control,<br>
But after that really in 90% of EQ zones it doesn’t matter who your 5th and 6th man are.<br>
<br>
Some people just like to pick a class and bash it for not reason kind of like people who have ford cars hate chevy or Nissan vs Toyota stupid crap like that.<br>
<br>
As for people telling you how to play well everyone thinks they are good at what they do and if they have even seen a good player play they will compare you to him or her. I just stay quiet when this happens and let them chat away, unless it is imported info like zone info or traps or stuff.<br>
<br>
But people telling me what to nuke and when and how much they can kiss off I will do the best I can and not get myself or my group killed but besides that I do as I want within reason.<br>
<br>
There are exceptions to every rule but I don’t mind a leader running down what peoples rolls are but some gimp on a pick-up group telling you how to play is stupid.<br>

Not grouping with X class at level 7 because X class can't do whatever, is pretty funny, because basically everyone is a warrior at that level.

Not all wizards have concussion, are you going to discriminate against them because of it? (I lost my VS faction before i was able to quest it)<br>

The comments<br>

I completly disagree with.  What spells I cast are up to me, as long as I'm doing my job.  Personally I hate using rains because they are usually highly resisted (Unless the mob is Malo'd or something) or you have more than 1 mob and it breaks mez.  I personally preffer to use a combo of Ice Spear and Sunstrike (Not 62 so don't have the new draughts).  I do a hell of a lot of damage with them in a fight and know how to manage my agro.  (I constantly get comments about how much faster fights go when I'm in a group).<br>
<br>
As for concussion.  If your looking at what spells are cast and counting them, I sure wouldn't want to be in your group.. I especially wouldn't want the tank cause it shows how much attention your paying to them!! I know I said Wizards w/out Concussion are crazy.. but I didn't say they were stupid.<br>

Strike of Solusek is one of our most efficient spells. In fact, its more efficient than draughts and rains.  Euphrates, you have no idea how to play a wizard, and from what you say, you have no idea how to play a cleric either.<br>
<br>
I have played high end clerics, enchanters, paladins, wizards, and druids. I think I might know how to play my wizard better than you do. If I pull aggro, its because the tank isn't keeping up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erumaroneverbright>Erumaron Everbright</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 271<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 6:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> Euphrates knows cleric, he's 65 in an uber guild of xegony and what not...but yea, using pure draughts limits wizard dps to like 150-170 max in and exp group.  I've parsed SoS / Draught mix and with an SoS crit I can near 300dps on a single mob.  Without crits it's generally ~180-200dps overall (on all mobs for that night).  I even happen to use pure SoS from time to time if the group has a solid tank where I can drop one early in the mobs HP (like...start casting between 90-95%) the parser gives numbers close to 500dps if I were to crit multiple times (and yes..I know it's a bit lower since the nuke didn't hit until like 85% or so).  Where I use purely SoS I was doing roughly half the mobs HP in dmg...draughts is maybe 1/3rd dmg.  Also, the only time I took aggro was when scs3 dinged and I was testing it out.<br>

If you think SoS is an eye candy nuke perhaps you should step back and re-evaluate your knowledge of the class.  Also,  I really don't understand how you can have mana problems as a 65 cleric with even moderate gear.  I happen to play one in xp groups all the time and I don't think I've ever gone below 80m with a slower + CC, 50m without one or the other.  If you're in a group without both and the wizard pulls agro, feel free to let him die; I have no idea what your problem is otherwise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 10:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't just rip into people before they fuck up though.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You say this after you say that if a wizard gets aggro, if a wizard does this, if a wizard uses these spells.<br>
<br>
Um, that is ripping on someone. In fact, that's so rude to tell another class how to play. Guess, what, if a cleric can't handle keeping everyone alive in a group, they suck as a cleric. If a tank can't keep aggro, or pull aggro off somene, they suck. I don't care if you are your God's right-hand man, I wouldn't never group with some one like you. <br>
<br>
And I bet you tell every class how to play. You sound like one of those long time, standard formula, old world, one way thinking crotchy players. I bet the first thing out of your mouth when you give your 'advice' is, I played a level X Class on so and so server.<br>

This right here really pisses me off. A wizard who can play his/her class well doesent even need the spell as long as the tank is keeping good agro. I can efficently take down 1\4 to 1\2 of a planer mobs hp without getting agro and not taking all my mana. Anyone that says &quot;a wizard needs this spell to do his job right&quot; is a dumbass. All a wizard needs is a spell that can efficently do dmg to a mob at the certain lvl. And any wizard that doesent know when to evac shouldint be a wizard at all. Thats my 2 cp.<br>

If for some reason the tank sucks at taunting and cant get it off, I root it and back away.<br>
<br>
I have grped with people before who have told me how to play my class. Sorry, but I haven't invested my time in my chosen class for no reason at all, after 61 levels I do like to think that I'm a damn good wizard, and I don't need to be lectured as soon as I join the grp on how to nuke and snare and control aggro. I have also left grps that the people in it would dictate me how to play a wizard. <br>
<br>
I have put in my time on how to play my class. Grping and being a grp friendly wizard is something I'm proud of, I have hardly soloed. Before you start informing me on how to play your version of my class let me show you that I can play my class just fine without any advice from you.<br>
<br>
Wizards pay alot of cash for their spells. If they want to use a certain spell you have no right at all to say anything. Just because you think you may know a little about a class and their spells does not give you the right to dictate which spells to cast and how.<br>
<br>
If you start in on me, telling me what I should and should not do, what nukes I should be using and when to nuke and not, then you will find an empty slot. Sure, maybe I looked for a group for 3 hours, but I sure as hell don't have to grp with fuck nuts like you.<br>

Sure, there are bad wizards out there, but damn, give us good ones a chance before you start railing on us and immediatly telling us how to play our class. Really, I see no reason why to even comment unless the wizard gets aggro often and not going oom every 3 minutes.<br>

Heck I even seen a cleric that did NOT heal and used stuns and nukes instead of healing (I was using my druid in here and duh... healing with Sup heal the main tank was a pain in the arse.).<br>
<br>
In every class there are a bad player but I have never seen a person suggesting what they should do and specially when with what spell and how often. Unless that person is your friend teaching how to play EQ that is...<br>

I dump Telekin on BoT giants the moment the MT takes over aggro. With a little luck it lands when Tash lands, and sticks there for Slow to land. The moment I started doing that the cleric was wondering why he did not needed to CH so soon.<br>

The moment someone keeps on telling you how to play your class, you can start telling him how to play his. <p><center>

<br>
I don't think i have ever complained about any int class over nukeing because i know sometimes they'll get aggro for waht ever reason and its not like wizes are trying to get aggro or somthing so there no point moaning about it.<br>
<br>
The only classes i really HATE as a cleric ( not so much now have ft 15 and mana preservation)  are monks that don't feign death correctly  because for some reason they think they can tank but are just  mana sponges on legs, and shaman who cast cann 5 and expect me to heal them even if they have quisence.<br>
<br>
Ooop sthis isn't a cleric forum, but anyway when  grouping with my wiz i try and use appear to be as usfull as possible, i use ice comet rather than my draught series when grouped, i know this is a rediculous waste of mana but when people see a pre 60 wiz critting for 2k it helps to change their minds to that we really are a great damage class ( if not the ultimate lol)<br>
<br>
Anyway loads ofhugs and kisses<br>

That said, sometimes you really are playing with a clueless wizard, druid, etc... who will get the group killed if you don't mention their mistakes.<br>
<br>
I've had bad experiences with every class, but since this this is mostly about wizards and grouping I will stick with that. Wizards tend to be harder to measure since they really aren't put on the spot as much as clerics, enchanters or warriors, but it's the little things which get noticed and gets remembered.<br>
<br>
The comments from the cleric in Izlaaru's post aren't uncommon, many people do it. But the hard reality is that sometimes bad situations happen so often that it is a surprise when a wizard is actually playing to his potential in a group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>After that discussion, the SK pulled (good pull) but for some reason the second Guardian agro'd on us. The second wizard in the group (He was 53) ran from the group.. I cast evac and boom we were at the zone in , and everyone cept for the other wizzy (Who decided to run as I said before) was alive and kicking. I was getting tells from the whole group sayin &quot;Wow, what a wizard&quot; and stuff like that. Again WTH? Isn't that our job, shouldn't EVERYONE be doing that type of thing??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Like here with evac. I've seen far too many wizards who act like that 2nd wizard in that group who would simply run out of the group, and turn yellow at the first sign of trouble. A good wizard can sense when a situation is manageable or isn't, and will evac when it isn't. Sometimes it isn't always obvious at first, which is when an evac call from the enchanter or cleric if he is oom comes into play. Problem is, it seems that good evaccing wizards/druids are a dime a dozen. I must have had the following scenerio happen at least a dozen times: mass adds come in a dungeon, we know we can't make through it and evac is called, wizard/druid says 'ok memming evac', group dies and wizard/druid blames everyone but himself (how dare the group let the mob hit him while he was memming evac?). Others will simply evac just for the heck of it: puller calls 'add one', wizard evacs group without telling anyone or better yet, simply gates or runs. <br>
<br>
So no Izlaaru, the reality is that not everyone is doing that type of thing. After a bad run of wizards in groups, people can be inclined to say 'finally a wizard who actually knows how to evac' once they get a wizard that knows how to play within a group. I know that I take note of such things such as a wizard evaccing when it is needed, rooting and stunning as needed (big ++ on this one, so few wizards actually do it but when they do it is greatly appreciated here), snaring, playing an active role in the group where I know that I can depend on that wizard to be a great member of the group; it's not all about nuking. So be glad, you made a good impression on that group and chances are they will be calling you back for groups later on (if you want them hehe). That 2nd wizard who ran on his group probably won't be called back, and will probably be seen on a later date on Graffe whining about how wizards are always unwanted in groups even though he is supposedly a great wizard.<br>
