As someone <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">without</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> root, snare, fear, stun and so on, let me tell you iy is an especially valuable contribution to a caster group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Root</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is valued as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;ghetto mez.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Keeping the enemy in one place mostly keeps them out of trouble, and is especially handy in tight spaces where a wandering mob might bring more trouble.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Snare</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> essentially multiplies the distance between mobs and characters, keeps the foe from running, and allows melees to beat on a fleeing opponent with much greater ease.  It also allows the wizard to kite one or more adds if necessary while the group deals with one or two foes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Stun</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is very handy as well, for interrupting spell casting mobs and hard hitting mobs.<br>
<br>
These abilities are so powerful that they would unbalance mages if they had them.  Indeed, I find them so useful that I often partner with a wizard ten levels my junior just to have them available.  With the new grouping rules, such a partnership is even more attractive than ever.<br>
<br>
I welcome wizards to any pet/caster group, even if I already have one.<br>

Absolutely... they can take away all of my snares, stuns and roots... (well maybe not root, we have not pet) and give me instead MORE improved damage and i would be happy. Really happy.<br>
Seriously 99% of all grousp invite Wizards in the PoP era NOT for evacs or snares... but only for their damage output. And SOE knows that for sure.<br>
Someone talked about rangers... IF they want us to snare, then they should give us a single target snare that lasts 10 minutes and does not cost 130 mana.<br>

<br>
If you forget for a second that max exp gain per time makes the best solo class (unless the ONLY thing you do solo is exp, and if so that's kinda sad), you could argue that wizards and enchanters are the two best solo classes, and as far as the best it'd be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> arguable.  If you don't buy that, ask anyone who's not a wizard.<br>
<br>
As far as Natan... fuck it, you're not worth it.  I've done what you do, I've done more than that, I've wowed groups in ways you could never even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>concieve</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  <br>
<br>
As far as explaining the snare bit though, I do owe you that bit.  A snared mob does not move fast.  You root mobs on one side of a room.  Root breaks, mob moves slowly to you, you root again.  In this manner, for a relatively low amount of mana (often less than a chanter would use <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) you can control 5-6 mobs.  Pulling a mob from the pack is easy, you break root with a nuke then concuss off agro.  This is the essence of wizard crowd control, and if you have minor leadership capabilities you can organize a group to work quite well under these conditions.  <br>
<br>
If you like doing things other than strict grind groups, like holding a fast spawning camp just, you know, to take a chance and do things different, while having a great time and getting decent xp, then by all means, I recommend my method.  You can still do pretty nice damage while working as crowd control.  But if you like to do the same thing, over and over again, because it is the one thing you know and refuse to explore the very diverse options provided to our class, then I suppose your method of play is more appropriate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1394<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 5:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Btw I've seen this exact same banter play out on other class boards too. Some members of a class think utility is irrelevant and some think it's the most fun part of EQ. And most of us flit in between the two.<br>
<br>
For example, I read many bitter clerics saying their utility sucks and the game is boring and some saying it's great and the game is fun. Clerics have root, stun, mor, mok, atone, pacify, nukes, dots, cures, resists, fear, pet, proc hammer along with the obvious buffs, rez, fast heals, big heals, heal over times.<br>
<br>
And yet, those clerics of Natan's mindset that believe the only thing that counts in class balance is how good you are in the ultimate specialised ubergrind group get threatened if, say, druids start becoming a better choice in the *perfect* grind group. Whereas others point out how the utility makes the cleric a great choice in any dangerous - ie exciting crawl group.<br>
<br>
I happen to think wizards are a great choice in both the grind group and the fun xp group, but Natan clearly thinks we need more to fit that 'ultimate' dmg dealing position and would happily sacrifice all for that. Just remember that there are 14 classes is all. Rogues, for example also generally think they are sacrificing utility (including utility that would enable them to solo) for ultimate dmg. And, no, their 1-2k extra hp over us barely counts. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 6/21/03 5:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1057<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 5:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A snared mob does not move fast.

Ahh you mean the old Kunark-era-KC-wanna-try-to-control-it-and wanna-show-off-as-ghetto-enc-attempts...<br>
Well times have changed. Pulling techniques have changed. (Pacify, if no FDer is avaiable, and well in PoP there is anyway not much use for that in exp situations.) 3, 4, Mobs are easy doable if you reached a certain standard. Heck, i solo-tank most of PoP exp mobs, slowed or even unslowed, if it is nessecary.<br>
 <br>
Trust me, groups do not look for an old-fashioned KC-Wizard these days. Pickup groups today consist of a tank (Pallies and SKs most wanted, over Warrior), healer, slower and then they look for CCer and damage dealers. And not some 'stunners', let alone evacers, lol. Waste of mana. (It's just me, ya, it's only my opinion, get over it. But try it one time and you will see, what i am talking about.)<br>
<br>
And yes, Elsato interpretated me correctly. Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion and i respect of course those who say, they think stuns and snares and root are still usefull. But since this thread was started along the lines 'how to get a group and what to do to make sure they'll invite you again' and 'what does a group expect from you as a wizard', i have to say, that i am fully convinced that they look for a wizard primarly as damage dealer and not as a versatility (stun, root, ghetto mez, whatever) class.<br>
<br>
Go out... ask the average Joe-Dull-Meleer what he wants/expects from a Wizard in an exp group...<br>
<br>
One example: I joined for fun a group in BoT and chain casted SoS in one of the upper areas. (Mana was absolutely no issue for me, was freaking unable to go LOM even.) Mobs died within 25 sec, of course i pulled some aggro, but it was not too bad (we had a Pal as MT).<br>
I did NOT stun or even bothered to snare or root park... i just told the shaman to slow everything fast and even offtanked if we got 2 or 3... they barely were able to hit me and i soloed so actually even some, lol-. <br>
What do you think was the reaction of the group and the other groups close by, when they saw how fast we killed, because my group had a Wizard?<br>
Heh, for fun it have let them kill one Mob without me nuking, it took them over a minute... and they kept yelling at me to come back from my afk.<br>
THAT kind of stuff impresses people, THAT makes us wanted in groups, in my opinion - and nothing else.<br>
<br>
Oh ELasto, Rogues do have actually quite some versatility these days. Lol they took over the pulling part of monks these days with their SOS ability in raids... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A> at: 6/21/03 6:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 6:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Roots, rock, and reggae!

This is why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Firebolt of Tallon</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was important historically to mages.

Mages were already strong, as pets were already strong and post-60 pets largely strong enough, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Firebolt of Tallon</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> made mage's reputation.<br>
<br>
It is a shame that had to come, to some extent, at the expense of wizards.  While wizards are probably objectively pretty well off, their reputation in groups at least still suffers somewhat.  Something showy but not unbalancing would probably go a long way to advertising wizard strength.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mukaka:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Increasing healing agro will not hurt all healing classes.

How much is specific to wizards?<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natan:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Balanz that is all more or less true... but you don't get snare stun and root because of only one reason: It would overpower your soloing abbilities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Couple responses.<br>
<br>
First, it would take a lot to make mages better soloers than wizards, at least post-60.  Have to confess though, root and snare <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">would</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> do the job.  Add pets to reliable kiting, and mages would probably kill things twice as fast with have the mana of a wizard quad-kiting.  And it is true that excess soloability generally forms a hard upper-limit of class power.<br>
<br>
But second, the solo power of a mage is one direct measure of mage group desirability.  The ability to off-tank, slay, or otherwise neutralize an add without requiring group support is an important trait to bring to a group.  As long as there are minimal conflicts in group and solo tactics, a powerful soloer is also a powerful grouper.  Give me root and snare, and I could not only control adds, but slay them at my leisure or not, as required.<br>

That is why the central linchpin of mage balance is that we only attack the foe through elementals, damage spells, and the malaise line of spells.

Stop trying to prove how uber you are. Next thing you know somebody is going to be proud of the fact he knows 124 different uses for True North.  <br>
<br>
What's the bottom line on grouping? We're one of 11 classes fighting for the last 3 spots in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not all groups. Each classes wants something to give them a grouping edge over other classes, but the fact is, while all 11 classes may get a tide-you-over spell here or there, if <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> classes get something to make them more group friendly, it will actually keep everyone at square one-----still fighting over the last 3 spots. (unless you start your own group)<br>
<br>
Why can't we just agree that we need to concentrate on keeping our damage consistantly high? <p>Sage Flintnilf Ironori<br>

Both sides have truth to them.<br>
<br>
Wizards aren't crap in groups, they just aren't the first choice of most groups.  They are the class you get after you get everything else you really want.  &quot;OK we have one slot open, should we get the Wizard?&quot;<br>
<br>
My favorite bit is when someone asks &quot;how is mana&quot; and all they really care about is &quot;how is cleric mana&quot; or perhaps enchanter/shaman.  If you say &quot;I'm a bit low&quot; they say &quot;that's ok you sit a few fights out&quot; which is really saying &quot;your contribution won't be missed very much.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, mind you this all reverses in a real emergency, when you can burn monsters down faster to save mana or lives, when you can emergency root, etc.  But honestly it's a pretty rare emergency where a Wizard is really needed eh?  Wizards group so-so, solo well, and raid well.  That's just how it is.<br>
<br>
And yes, before level 51, Wizards need work, but won't get it - the thing that made the situation not matter (KEI) has been taken away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=claudshadowflare>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Has Eddie Murphy's<BR>taste in women</span><br>  Posts: 3781<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 3:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: grouping</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>lol.

That might be funny once to do, but it's nothing a group is looking for at all, no group starts with thinking &quot;We might have to derail trains near the zone line, so lets get a powerexodus snarewizard&quot;<br>
Especially since finding mobs to kill is not that much of a problem, and in most zones you dont even see trains anymore as fucking up = instant death past tier1.

So what do we have left, root crowd control is something a group would surely appreciate. If they don't already have a chanter / bard doing it. Exodus/Evac is not really demanded by groups that don't plan on moving past a point of no return. Usually groups don't start with &quot;stuff might go so bad we totally loose control, get evac&quot; anymore. <br>

<br>
That being said, one of the smaller places I've CC'd in was in the first room of the razorfiend cave in PoV back in the day, and there was MORE than enough room for that.  You don't need wide open spaces to do it, just a little space will do.<br>
<br>
If you stop a 12 mob train and kite it around while your group pulls and exps from it, they won't forget it.  There's some shit you don't need to advertise, that people see and go &quot;wow, that's a pretty talented player&quot;.  No one goes &quot;wow, that's a pretty talented nuker&quot;, because you can train a chimp to nuke well.  I used to have one of my non-EQ playing roommates nuke for me during some of the longer luclin fights if the pizza guy came to the door or I needed to run to the store.<br>
<br>
The difference here- I've walked the walk.  I'm not preaching the wizard as some kind of crowd control specialty class, but we're damned good at it.  I've no problem with you guys saying &quot;oh, people like you can't find groups&quot;, because I'm a person like me and I never had problems finding- or making- a group.  I tell you what I've done, and you come back saying &quot;nuh uh, that's not possible!&quot;  Fine.  It will continue to be another thing that seperates me from you and makes me a better player.  Just because you don't believe it doesn't make it not so.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather take a player because he listens to directions well, has a good grasp on the capabilities of his class and leaves himself open to variation from routine than take a player because his class averages 10 more dps than another one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 8239<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 10:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> stuff n nonsense</span><hr size=1> I would say &quot;damned good&quot; is a terrific exaggeration, Wizards can do some crowd control if its needed.
