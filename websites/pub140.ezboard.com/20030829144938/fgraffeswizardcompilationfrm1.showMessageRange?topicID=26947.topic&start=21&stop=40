I agree wholeheartably. I even mentioned in my initial post that the job so far was being done well. It is the future of the board that I was reffering to. I don't want this to become a place of random censorship because a mod does not like you, that is all I was saying. I cannot believe people are taking the first post for more then it is, a suggestion. I even said please! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

comparing your global posts to my posts on graffes is pretty l33t, I was refering to the 123 posts that you had starting this.  If you have used the board for a while like you have claimed, you would know why shit like this happens.  <br>

You think Rombus has a personal thing against Dmitry?  C'mon.  He gave the freaky gnome his own emoticon for crying out loud.  Don't attack Rombus for doing his job please.  If you disagree with his modding send him an email, he has always responded to me, and even when i've had my posts edited, it was certainly clear in retrospect that it was appropriate.  He isn't on some power trip and it really pisses a lot of us off to have such a thing said, when it is clearly not true.  Rombus does a great job at a thankless task as a volunteer and puts up with huge piles of steaming bullshit in the process.  Take your concerns to email and give a rest to the public calling-out crap. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sillyjanine.com/mybases.html"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.cestusdei.org/uploads/images/luxysig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmitrythewizzy>Dmitry the Wizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>The People's Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1894<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/03 8:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rombus</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>it was personal drama bullshit from that server, and that it discussed an exploit<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Happy birthday to me I guess.  I respect the initial post, but that jaded one from Dmitry really hurts... especially considering the crap he gets away with on this forum.  I'll tell you right now, if it was anyone else but you who was causing that drama yesterday they would have been slapped with a week suspension.  People even asked me in-game why I didn't suspend you. *shrug*<br>

Did you even see the original post?  Or the ones that followed it?  It was a blatant attempt to drag out an already very hot issue.  That's why it was edited.

ROFL this is the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in some time.  I almost NEVER shut a thread down, and I have NEVER shut one down because I don't agree with their opinions.  I only shut threads down that are not in the best interest of this board, ie. your little attempt to start an Asadd flame fest.  Your post was 100% irrelevant to this board, and it was only made in an attempt to drudge up drama.<br>

I don't have a single email from you, if I did I would have responded.  Don't resort to lying... that's just really, REALLY unneeded.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you guys have some serious concerns by all means address them, but if you're going to just outright slam me like Dmitry did because he's pissed about having his thread moderated, don't bother posting.  I think I'm very fair, I go by a policy of using my powers as little as possible.  I let a lot of things slide, things I could be a dick about very easily.  I won't have stupid guild-related / server-related drama on this board though, and that's ALWAYS been the stance of the moderators of this board.  <br>

Oh yes... Rom may not see any problems in the wiz class, and thats his privalege.  He may have his statements parroted by a vocal group of long time posters, many of whom dont even play anymore -- thats his dubious fortune.  He may in fact be verant's number one fanboi -- thats his gig.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

BUT, he is one hell of a respected wizard, and one hell of a moderator.  Even where I disagree with him, I'll at least listen to his point of view.  AND when I've had a problem I've sent it DIRECTLY to him via e-mail.  And he's been a man about it and dealt directly with me every single time.  Try being straight, try being respectful, try having a clue... you'll go farther with anyone, and that includes Rom... but damn sure dont make a passive aggresive slam post like this and not expect to be slammed right back.<br>
<br>
ANYway... while Rom has his faults, and lord knows I love to point them out to him, they do NOT include what you are throwing at him.  Nuff said.<br>

Oh... and mr l33t post counter.... while Mil can more than handle himself.... I thought Id bring up 2 things that those of us who REALLY ARE the &quot;long time board dwellers&quot; all know.<br>
<br>
1) Mil has had more than 1 account... added together his post count would be almost as frightening as his sense of irony.<br>
<br>
2) Its all a joke next to Whizbang anyway... and untill ANYONE gets even CLOSE to that little gnome's post count it is beyond foolish to even bring it up. Personally I wonder why EZ board doesnt give &quot;the origonal gnome&quot; a goldplated keyboard as thanks for the traffic. <br>

I swear to god I really don't care about Asadd as Asadd.  I care that he used some method to essentially cheat.  THis is what I posted about the whole thing:<br>

You follow the same pattern  You jump down someone's throat when you THINK they are after some issue or person you like.  The same damn thread got made anyway.  The issues I wanted to discuss got discussed.  I learned from that:<br>
<br>
Apparently Uber guilds in need of cross server transfers have found ways around the current rules.  <br>
<br>
Verant is once again complicit in this<br>
<br>
Can't say I was shocked.  <br>
<br>
Look at how oblique your &quot;hey there are ways of doing it...&quot; post is... you say there are ways but not what... you get vague and then reference other posts.

Actually no, I didn't receive a single tell from him.  It was mostly members of Redemption apologizing for it and asking why I didn't ban you, along with people who are in the chat channels I am.  Truthfully, it was actually a member of Redemption that pointed me to the thread originally and asked that it be removed.  He filled me in on the drama trying to explain why it should be.  I think the rest of your post pretty much sums up the reasons for me removing your original too.<br>

Heh, so the members of the elite guild asked the other member of the elite guild to remove the offending post because it exposed an embarrassing benefit they received from rule circumvention.  <br>
<br>
Yah that is fair.  <br>
<br>
I deliberately avoided &quot;Asadd is a poo&quot; type commentary.  One cause I don't think that (despite his avoidance of the rule) and two because it would have, as you seem to think it did, overshadowed the point.  <br>
<br>
The ONLY drama was you taking the word of this other guild &quot;Redemption&quot;  (is that even the guild he went to?)  that it was some big drama.  You panicked and chopped up legitimate threads.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmitrythewizzy>Dmitry the Wizzy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/14/03 10:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fazzaryaayrazzaf>Fazzarya Ayrazzaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/03 10:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rombus</span><hr size=1> I was reffering to the date the account was activated, not the number of posts. A post count doesn't mean didley squat. As demonstrated by many on this exact board who &quot;pad posts&quot; etc. Merely to demonstrate that I was utilizing this board before he/she came along, so no_name_wizard_01 or not, I have a relevant point of view when discussing this forum.<br>
<br>
I had a concern, I expressed that concern politely and clearly. Rombus did a bang-up job explaining his point of view and so I have my concerns for the most part put to rest. I am glad at least he saw I wasn't attacking him and responded accordingly. As I said before, I think the moderation on this board to this point is good. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=223084&amp;amp;resize=true" target="&quot;top&quot;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fazzarya Ayrazzaf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arcanist<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.solinvictus.org/eq/">Sol Invictus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmitrythewizzy>Dmitry the Wizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>The People's Gnome</span><br>  Posts: 1901<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/03 10:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rombus</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I was reffering to the date the account was activated,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Dmitry sometimes you are just dence, What you should have said wich would be correct is members of an eleit guild asking &quot;A MODERATOR&quot; of the site in question to remove the offending post.<br>
