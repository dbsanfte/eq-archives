Feature of the game = anything(aka Z-axis), be it a known bug or glitch in the game (aka warping mobs &amp; bad pathing), that makes it harder to kill/do anything or anymob<br>

Unfortunatly for the players there are so many exploits/features that SOE &amp; VI either refuse to fix, or nerf the mob into non-existance, the game can quickly become uninteresting. <p><div align="center">

Having buffs cast on you is completely natural.  Being able to receive group spells would also be natural. Since it allows you to buff people with group spells, and they continue to make group spells without the minor change it would require, I would assume that it is intended.<br>
<br>
For the same reason that Whizbang argues that quadding is not an exploit, neither is the casting/receiving of group buffs.<br>
<br>
Oh, and someone mentioned hiding under the bridge.  Sony ruled that that wasn't an exploit, unless it allowed them to do it without aggro.  If you understood how aggro worked on Velious you would understand why the GM felt there was a problem.<br>
<br>
If I didnt know better I would think some of you are jealous that others have powerleveled wizards that now compete with you, and you did it 'legit' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12261<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 1:23:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=47>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exploit</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For the same reason that Whizbang argues that quadding is not an exploit, neither is the casting/receiving of group buffs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hmmm.<br>
<br>
In the time since quadding began in EQ, they gave out two more AoE snares (one to us, one to druids). Pretty cut and dried.<br>
<br>
Since KEI came out, they've continued to make more buffs that you can't get below a certain level normally. The code still doesn't do the check if you're grouped, though.<br>
<br>
I think equating the two is making a presumption as to the logic (or lack thereof) on the part of the dev team. And given how similar presumptions turned out not to be on target with MB, monks tanking and using horses without Luclin graphics, I'd be careful about going too far down that path, myself.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd bet on the buffing check to start working when grouped within three months. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1196<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 1:47:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Under the bridge</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you understood how aggro worked on Velious you would understand why the GM felt there was a problem.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'd solve it the other way around myself. Give all spells a mininum level they will 'stick' on, make the default zero. If you aren't that level it doesn't stick on you. Solves a few problems, some classes get spells other classes get at a much later level. This would let them cast those spells on the same range of people after they get them. And it lets them tailor the levels to fit better with what the spells are. And instead of checking the target, the recipient does the checking so it would work even with MGB. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

But wouldnt stop us from quadding ... we would just <br>
bind em more often and resnare.<br>
<br>
And maybe use Akrapper Spells that have a larger AoE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
And don´t give Ideas to the enemy !!!<br>
What if Big A reads it and mentions it to Devs ?<br>
<br>
I certainly would not like dat :P<br>
Especially not because its really hard to find a Group as a Wiz.<br>
Really ... i have decent social Skillz , but sometimes i can´t find a Group and have to Quad for a bit Exp.<br>
(Or i lead an open Riad if im in the mood).<br>
<br>
Why don´t we get Groupinvis or Grouplevitation ?<br>
Would at least make us a tiny bit more desirable on certain Raids.<br>
But hell , i don´t wanna whine (on the other Hand someone mentioned Sony wants us to group ... i really don´t see<br>
why anyone should get an unKEIed Wizard)<br>
<br>
Regarding Exploits ... its such a swampy Area ... i wait for a GM to warn me for it , lol.<br>
No serious , pathing is bugged in so many Zones i can´t hardly see it exploiting if a Mob needs more time to reach me...<br>
If hes stuck ... well well ... this is certainly an exploit.<br>
But i bet he would warp to me in a sec or vanish !<br>
<br>
I had a few pathin &quot;irregularities&quot; in Guthak and /bugged em immediatly ...<br>
Its funny if Mobs turn away from you while you try to kite em ... maybe sometimes they even stick somewhere ...<br>
But then they warp to u and beat you to Death ...<br>
I always try to kite em correctly to avoid stickking (and the natural warping / death after) ...<br>
I hope the new Pathing on Test is good so i can single kite in Gunthak better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (Luggalds ther have nice rare drops).<br>

Why or why not? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->First, we'd need to know whether or not it is a design intention that being grouped should let you use buffs that you would otherwise not be able to.  Since players don't know the minds of the developer, this would not be an &quot;exploit&quot; in the mind of a player until he can reasonably know otherwise.  Because clearly arguments on both sides can be made:<br>
<br>
1.  Ignoring the level restriction in a group promotes grouping and increases interaction.<br>
2.  The above was not intended, that group buffs land on low level people is a bug, therefore it is an exploit.<br>
<br>
However, this gets less convincing as you consider levels that can not feasibly group together for experience, and only group temporarily to get the benefits of the buff.  KEI would be a good example of what is fairly clearly an unintended design consequence, that is, the extreme duration of the spell.  Even if the above #1 is true, the ability to have 99%+ buff effectiveness while ungrouped would clearly not fit into that argument.  Thus I would say that a level 15 getting KEI is exploiting the removal level restriction in a group.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Edit:  actually, I would generally give the benefit of the doubt to the recipient and blame the buff-caster.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I would also say that this exploit is a fairly mild concern.  It's an exploit, but it's hard to say how serious without seeing some low level data.  It's not something to ban people over but it's something that they should definitely try to fix if they could do so without breaking something else and if they have the opportunity.<br>

<br>
I also tend to head towards the 'reasonable man' definition.<br>
<br>
An exploit to me is a unintended aspect of gameplay that a reasonable man would see gives an unfair advantage.<br>
<br>
An exploit that 'breaks the game' is one which reduces the number of strategies for that aspect of the game so much that, ultimately, the exploit is the only worthwhile strategy.<br>
<br>
eg if duping were widespread, there would be no other worthwhile way of making money - indeed other sources would literally be worthless. Nuking from a safe spot or tracking named using SEQ would be less extreme but still serious examples.<br>
<br>
The more unfair the advantage, the more people feel forced to use it, and the more it 'breaks' the game. <br>
Exploits per say are tolerated by SoE; it's only when they approach game breaking that they become serious.<br>
<br>
A complication here is that buffs are *designed* to be an unfair advantage. Someone with a buff is *intended* to have a big advantage over someone without. However it's obvious to me that 3 years ago when Kunark opened, lvl 51+ buffs were not intended to be used on green con players, despite the fact that, objectively, it is a bit arbitrary to have a 49 buff ok on a lvl 1 but a 51 buff not ok on a 33.<br>
<br>
However, many aspects of the game including fd pulling, fear kiting and quad kiting were never intended. Instead of being removed they became 'tolerated exploits' that VI simply chose to make less and less viable as you levelled.<br>
<br>
Whiz, you say that quad kiting got a semi-official endorsement when classes got upgrades to ae snares. You could equally argue that buffing green players was given a semi-official endorsement when SoE added MGB - a full, what, 18 months after the group buff 'exploit' was first created? Not only did they not fix the old Kunark problem, in other words, they made it massively easier and more effective. Now whole zones of newbies could be buffed kei or aego at will. It's hard to believe this aspect went unnoticed especially a year on from luclin now.<br>
<br>
You also argue that quad kiting would be easy to fix simply by making mobs move at a random +/-5% of their snared speed, therefor, again, since no fix has been forthcoming this past 3 years quad kiting is semi-officially endorsed. I'd argue equally that it surely cant be that hard to move the buffing code from checking the target of the spell to checking the recipient. Or an uglier fix would be to allow the group buff to be cast, then simply to check the recipient's buff list once per tick and make any too powerful fade instantly *shrugs*. Again; 3 years of non-fixing is surely as much of an endorsement as quad kiting has ever had, and I assume you have quad kited without qualms.<br>
<br>
So .. why have SoE allowed it to stay with such an agreeably massive effect on low levels? I'd argue that though it was an unintended bug, it had unintended effects that met with new goals that occurred around DAoC (a shift in viewpoint that ultimately caused Brad to leave).<br>
<br>
Certain things were massively complained about about during the first 2 years of EQ's life (during the so called reign of the 'VI vision'). (Not mentioning my views of these complaints) these included:<br>
- overly harsh death penalty &amp; CR, especially for melee who had to run all the way from their town bind point<br>
- forced grouping, esp. indoors for the best loot and xp (though this was first unintentionally changed with the newbie bonus in loio)<br>
- overly slow mana regen<br>
- begging for player ports and binds<br>
- forced spellbook viewing<br>
- buffs not lasting long enough, not enough group buffs, buffs costing too much pp-wise<br>
<br>
Around this time there was also a big reaction to DAoC which promised to be more 'fun' based and eliminate all these alledged frustrating and unnescessary timesinks (again, the complainant's viewpoint not nescessarily my own). SoE feared they would lose a number of their casual minded players, didnt want to give up a single one and so decided to massively broaden their appeal. They wanted to keep their key hard core who they would go on to satisfy with an ever toughening end game, and yet keep happy the 'soft core' who would go on to have almost all gaming frustrations removed.<br>
<br>
- hence the death &amp; CR penalty were largely removed by extra resses, evac's and NPC ports and books (and no CR under 10)<br>
- soloing made increasingly easy for all classes with ever better weapons, armor and potions<br>
- outdoor grouping increasingly made as fast as indoor<br>
- fast mana regen for all (more on this later)<br>
- NPC binding, porting and books<br>
- forced spellbook viewing gone<br>
- buffs doubled or tripled in duration, many more group buffs, one shot raid buffing (MGB), reduced pp cost (eg group virtue half the pp of group aego; force shield, enc rune made componentless etc)<br>
<br>
Lowbies have had a massive boost in regen since kei but so have high levels. Take a look at the difference between a lvl 65 wiz now compared to a lvl 50 wiz pre-kunark (ignoring the manastone nerf):<br>
<br>
+8 - harvest+harvest 2<br>
+8 - druid buff<br>
+8 - flappy<br>
+3 - aa<br>
+10 - improved enc regen<br>
+10 - improved bard regen<br>
+15 - ft (if you're uber)<br>
+20 - horse (if you're outdoors)<br>
+?? - necro &amp; sk boosts<br>
---<br>
80+<br>
<br>
And, you cannot ignore the effect of SCM and MP, because it produces an *effective* mana regen increase of ~15% on top (if it costs less to cast each spell, you regen the mana back quicker so it 'appears' you've had a mana regen increase. With the above level of mana regen SCM3+MP4 produces the same effect as an additional KEI would).<br>
<br>
Now, high level mana increase was largely not done to remove frustrations, it was done much more in the name of balancing melee/caster damage output, and also to balance against casters doubled or tripled manapool.<br>
<br>
I believe it was entirely unintended that kei and aego would affect the low level game as they have - it was a combination of 3 things:<br>
- group buff bug<br>
- 3 hour duration<br>
- serverwide central meeting point (first nexus then pok)<br>
<br>
Lose any of these 3 factors and you'd lose the kei/aego 'effect' on the lower level game.<br>
<br>
But as a final point: SoE doesnt mind the lower level game being imbalanced as long as it is fun for all. In fact fun&gt;all now there, balance only being addressed if it seriously impacts fun. Once you get past 50 they want the game to be increasingly more balanced with much harsher RvR 'old school style' even if it has to come at the expense of fun - eg. allowing classes the 'fun' ability to solo is not in the least a consideration unlike for low levels (though it is still much less harsh than it ever used to be). Hence nearly all the nerfs you see are aimed at balancing the high level game (but occasionally unavoidably nerf the low level game too - eg horses, monk nerf). When was the last purely low level targetted nerf anyone can remember?<br>
<br>
In addition, psychologically people can happily deal with being imbalanced if they know that as they grow levels and gain aa they will become ever more balanced. It's much more frustrating as a gamer to go from a position of being relatively balanced to unbalanced. Hence why the relative importance of fun+balance in the game shift as you grow.<br>
<br>
Stuff us 'hard core' players see as valuable (such as mana management) simply get learnt later than they ever used to (though other stuff like aggro control still has to be learnt). It's a price SoE is prepared to pay to keep their fanbase as broad as it can be and I for one think the balance there pretty good atm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 3/31/03 6:29:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izelin>Izelin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 7:37:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> An exploit is something you didnt realize you did, then VI bans you for it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=absolutemaster>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 8:12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't call me a noob.

<br>
Did I call you a noob? If you believe that SOE intended for newbies to get KEI, then sure go ahead and put yourself in the noob category. They have a level limit on high level buffs for a reason. If SOE intended KEI to be used on low levels, then why would they force you to group with them as the only way to cast on them? You can cast on them due to a bug. Working around a limitation (level limit) by use of this bug is an exploit, it's simple logic. As for the thread, it's in a forum called the Newbie Zone, so a good portion of posters are in fact newbies.<br>

Link to the quest please. If it exists then it is a pretty bad design flaw which needs fixing. Muti-questing IS an exploit.

Yup sure sounds as if SOE approves of it. They aren't planning to change the issues (they tend to be rather lazy to fixing bugs which require re-coding of game mechanics), but they make sure to point out that they do not support it.<br>

I have to say that managing my mana and agro was an important lesson for me to learn.  So important that I commonly watch the &quot;2 days to 50&quot; wizards get slaughtered on the march to the arena in Kael.  I've had one wizard accuse me of not casting.  I told him I know when to cast, and when not to cast.  I also know how to effectively use concussion.<br>
<br>
When they argue with me I just tell them, &quot;hey, you've been a wizard all of 48 hours, of course you know much better than a wizard who is played for 3 years.&quot; and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Simply put, if KEI is not intended forplayers under 45, the spell should do a check of everyone in the group, not just the target.  That the spell does not do this, and that it's yet to be patched, tells me that Sony does not care to &quot;fix&quot; this oversight.  If you've ever been working on tradeskills in PoK and seen the same level 7 caster coming back every 5 minutes for KEI because he thinks he can hunt in LOIO with it, then you know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
Now players evidently feel that KEI is not a nice thing that happens now and then, they feel it's a necessity or even a right.  I've seen them get very exercised about it when no one is in PoK or Nexus casting it.  It's not an exploit, just poor design. <p><img src=http://24.26.194.142/sevepic.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1013<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 9:36:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nadiar.com/pics/sigico.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Define &quot;exploit&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If SOE intended KEI to be used on low levels, then why would they force you to group with them as the only way to cast on them?
