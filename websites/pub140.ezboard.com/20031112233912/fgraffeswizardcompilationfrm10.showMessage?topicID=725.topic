A lot of threads talk about how to upgrade DPS, and increase the Damage to Mana ratio on our nukes.  <br>
     My question/statement is simple.  Even if we get a huge increase to damage.  Lets keep it simple and put it at 10% increase.  Which in and of itself would be huge.  How is this going to transition the Wizard into being a better group participant?  This would definately be more conductive to a solo environment, but still would keep us low man on the totem pole for group play.  This is of course during your typical EQ day and not including raid situations.<br>
     I feel that when considering caster balance VI and the players need to look at inter caster balance and not just between casters and melee.  Druids, shamans both rock at soloing, and they both rock in a group.  Clerics and enchanters are the ultimate grouping class.  Mages and Necros are both supreme solo classes and can contribute significantly to group play by always providing damage even when out of mana and having some group friendly spells.  Then we have the wizard who is only as good as there mana.  We contribute nothing other than damage in short bursts which can be rivaled by a well equiped melee.  We provide nothing in group buffs or group friendly abilities other than being able to gate.  <br>

1) spell efficiency (damage/mana)<br>
2) mana regeneration rate<br>
3) combat uptime (itself a function of pull rate and kill time)<br>
4) right click damage (if applicable)<br>
<br>
Combat uptime is an important factor to consider because the lower the combat uptime, the better mana classes will do (because they can &quot;store up&quot; damage by recovering mana) and the worse melee classes do (because they can only do damage while there is something to hit). Regardless of what balancing chages are made, there will be some uptime at which wizard damage output will equal a melee class. Prior to focus items, wizards and monks at level 51 would have equal damage output with about 33% uptime. If the pull rate was higher, monks would do better, while if the pull rate was lower, wizards would do better.<br>
<br>
The point of all the above is that you can make balancing changes (probably increasing wizard damage output, probably through focus items) that put wizard and melee damage contribution in parity for uptime values commonly experienced by conventional groups. As long as our damage contribution potential is at approximately the same level as a melee class, there are good reasons to pick a wizard for a damage dealing group slot when one is available.<br>
<br>
... and if the changes targetted DDs instead of all spells, wizard solo efficiency would not change much. But given how many melee classes can now solo (or duo) very effectively with the right equipment, balancing grouping gains against soloing gains is really a non-issue.<br>
<br>
My bottom line recommentation after doing extensive analysis was the following:<br>
1) add/improve some right click wizard nukes<br>
2) reduce DD mana cost by 25%.<br>
Pretty simple changes, really, but would have given us much better balance in 40% uptime groups without increasing our max DPS (thus leaving our raid contribution about the same as it is now) and without increasing solo capability by much (because AoE spells would be left unchanged). <p>"Evacuate?

What limits a Wizard in an xp group now?<br>
<br>
1) Time, creatures die faster than ever and the Wizard's 'make em die fast' contribution is more meaningless.  Things die so fast at levels past 33 that the new blasts are too slow to come into play very much.<br>
2) Mana, to be a consistant contributer, the Wizard has to either not blast very much or blast a lot and sit even more doing nothing - neither is very helpful to a group.<br>
3) Aggro, nuke too much, get turned into a punching bag, we all know this one.<br>
4) Resistances, hit a monster and do almost nothing - but aggro and use just as much mana.<br>
<br>
Now, if you will note if you peek into the Huge thread Armok started when he did his discussion of what's wrong and how he thought things should be fixed, there is a familiar name posting early on: Gallenite.  Guess who that is?  Its Scott, our buddy in charge of casters right now.  Not too awful long after that came out focus items landed on mages, with exactly the effects I listed above being addressed.<br>
<br>
If you link this to the coming Everquest 2, you'll see a pattern: test things on this EQ to see how they work out in EQ 2.<br>
<br>
The only problem with how they did it is that ALL casters get the same benefits, a Cleric wearing a Naki's Bracer does more damage than a Wizard without one in some level ranges... something I'd find acceptible for a Magician or Druid, but not a Cleric (shouldn't have had nukes in the first place, but that's another discussion).  As such, Wizards aren't really helped all that much by the items specifically, just casters as a whole.  That means Wizards still have a problem, especially if there's no mage around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br>  Posts: 861<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/02 3:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the answers</span><hr size=1> Grim,<br>
<br>
I know that you are not a fan of right click nukes. I do understand your objections (a wizard's power should come from his nukes, not his tools, etc), but when I used figures in my spreadsheet that would balance us without right click nukes, level 60 Wizards got insanely powerful when the Rend Robe is taken into account (outstripping rogues by a fair margin in damage over time in most situations). This means that in order to maintain balance, Verant must aim low with their adjustments (this is what we are seeing so far, imo). This also has the effect of sharpening the power curve for wizards, perpetuating the current situation of very poor relative performance at lower levels, and finally catching up at the end-game.<br>
<br>
Since we won't be able to abolish right click nukes, I decided to embrace them as a part of the solution. Spreading access to these items to lower levels would help to soften the power curve, and would also allow for the problem of melee twinking to be countered with a bit of wizard twinking. They also have the characteristic of being most useful in conventional experience groups and extremely long boss mob fights (where we have tradtionally had problems).<br>
<br>
As for the issue of caster-vs-caster balance: I did not focus my research on this issue. There are most definitely balance problems here as well, but that is a whole 'nother ball o' wax. Interestingly enough, wizard issues are mostly in the pre-60 leveling game, while most of the other caster issues are in the 60+ raid game. As such, applying blanket solutions (such as mage summoned focus items) has the effect of boosting wizards in the raid game and other casters in the leveling game as well as a bit of help in areas where help is needed.<br>
<br>
This is probably a good point to blow my own horn a bit and note that my suggested changes (reducing mana cost for DDs and adding right click nukes at lower levels) would have done very little to boost wizard damage output on raids, which has been at the core of the &quot;nerf wizards&quot; cries of late. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 5229<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/02 6:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the answers</span><hr size=1> I'm fine with the idea of adding some right click nukes in, its a classic part of Wizard lore (wands to blast things with when your spells are too slow).  My problem isn't with the concept of the things, its Verant's track record on it.  They COULD do it well, with rechargable items that have a slow recast time and reasonably fast casting time - but their item system doesn't support that right now.  They won't be working on that, its not worth their time and effort.  Adding in a wand that takes 15 seconds to cast an 80 point blast at level 34 is just not going to do the trick, and you know damn well we wouldn't get better than that - and not unless it was a rare drop off a rare spawn in a dungeon well over level 34.<br>
<br>
Its not so much the items, its the likely implementation of them.  Wizards SHOULD have right click blast things, in addition to their normal abilities.  They just shouldn't be the ones Verant has in the game, nor what they'd add in.  Your work got us notice and they did use some ideas I had (the 'why wizards do well on raids' thread was of particular interest to the Verant guys).  The problem is, they did it wholesale, on all casters.  EACH CASTER needs work specific to them, and pretending that adding focus items to all casters helps Wizards is only vaguely right.<br>
<br>
The thing is, as I pointed out above, they are working on EQ2 now and any changes they make are to test that out entirely - so I hope they give us lots of clicky stuff to play with for what its worth now.  I just am opposed to your solutions on how they'll work out in the game, but it is entirely an intellectual exercise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 600<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/1/02 10:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the answers</span><hr size=1> There's still the issue of how we start weak and end balanced that I find rather stupid and in need of adjustment.  If we start as one of the weakest, and stay the weakest for the longest time, then why don't we get balanced at 50, and get VASTLY more powerful than all other classes by the time we hit 60?  There should be no time past 49 that we are weaker in any sense of the word than any other class because we were weak for so long compared to all other classes.  If people want us to be &quot;balanced&quot; at 60, then at every level, from 1 to 60, we should be dishing out as much damage as ANY other class, and leveling just as easily.  It shouldn't be a struggle for us at all if they don't want us to be more powerful than the other classes at the end game.<br>

Just some thoughts.<br>
And yes, we might achieve relative balance at L60, but it's a hell of a long slog to get there. And being balanced at the end is never a reason to be weak/imbalanced before then. <br>

I can't really speak on below 50, now, because I have no idea what its like with the recent changes. Here is what I know, there are three things that I feel have boosted my power immensly in my 50s.<br>
<br>
1.) Draughts: 688 max damage or so for 215 mana with a 3 sec cast time. This does more damage then Conflag--a lvl 44 wizzie favoritye--but costs less mana and is some 2.5 seconds faster. There is no spell, at any point before 51, that rivals the mana efficieny of Draughts. Furthermore, to find a spell that is as fast as a DoF, you have to go all the way back to lvl 16 for Ice Shock. That is a killer combo, that really represents a huge boost in wizard power.<br>
<br>
2.) KEI: This spell makes me feel like I am approaching where I need to be in a fast pulling group. But I need that along with...<br>
<br>
3.) A couple focus items: Naki's ring I believe, plus Gallenites bracer, lowers the DoF cast time to 2.5 secs and up your average damage per cast to around 700. Relatively speaking, that is sick damage, done very cheap, and very efficiently. The final touch however is....<br>
<br>
4.) Draught of Ice: At 59, casting DoI, with Gallenite's Bracer and the ring, I can easily hit for 800 or so, with a 2.5 sec cast time, and a mana cost of about 215. Truly amazing, compared to what i was doing only 10 levels ago.<br>
<br>
I feel--not know because I dont have the logs--that when I have all of these things clicking, I am about where I should be. I can only dream about what it would mean to have these MC3, SCM, Improved Flappy and crits (with KEI on we are talking about a mana regen at about 23per tick, if just manaskin is on. That is a mana regen number, that I can't even fathom). I would have to think, that at that point, I would be about balanced. <br>
<br>
How does this spike in power compare to other classes? I can't really say, as I have not done the research. But I know that at 59, I feel like I am about thrice the wizard I was at 49. <br>

Though I cannot offer proof, I can offer what I would hope is a convincing argument supporting the &quot;start weak&quot; end of the theory. It does not depend on twinking, but it does depend on mudflation. About a year ago I started a ranger on a newish server so I could play casually with some RL friends. By hunting (almost exclusively) bats and skeletons and selling stacks of wings for 1pp, and stacks of chips for 2-3pp. By level 5 I was able to accumulate about 25pp, which I could use to purchase a frozen longsword (MAGIC, 7/27), which is roughly twice as good as any weapon I could acquire by myself at that level, as well as a full set of patchwork armor from a tailor who was working up her skill. This translated directly into doing double the damage I did before, and when soloing that translates into taking half damage from foes. From there I had started harvesting and selling orc belts for sale, but I abandoned that character at level 7.<br>
<br>
The only wizard item which gives anything close to that level of power increase is the Solist Wand, which is quite rare and sells for about 5k (which makes it a twink item), and it's power band of use is 16-35 or so.<br>
<br>
I could try the same exercise today and I would undoubtedly find the situation at low levels even more heavily skewed toward melee (Centi weapons are evil).<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I get quoted spell numbers and such then have people telling me that their wizards are soloing mobs on 2 bubs of mana at level 25. /boggle when I was 25 as a mage I remember spending tons more than 2 bubs of mana soloing stuff in loio.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I can't really comment on this. When I was 25 I could not solo effectively at all. I pretty much required a group. Root/Nuke (the only viable strategy at that level) was painful because root took a fairly large portion of my spell points at that level and usually needed to be cast multiple times. If I had a solist wand at that level I could solo very well, but that's quite unusual. It may also be that these numbers are quoted against light blue cons, and I think you'll find this sort of thing to be more common now than it was when you were leveling up.<br>

Yellows were out of the question, even at level 1.  Melees, cruising through yellows no problem in the very early game.  At 15, you see wizards doing the quick damage, but with the trickle-down of melee weapons, not just twinking, do you see wizards really helping a lot?  At 20 we are still medding up from the constant uptime groups because we are out of mana while the melees are still hacking away at mobs.<br>
<br>
So, where is it that we finally catch up to do even a reasonable level of damage on mobs?  44 or so?<br>
<br>
<br>
Why don't you leave your filters off, and join a group in the level 20 to 25 range, watch the melees do so much damage, and then you will have your answer.  The 30 to 43 range, known for being difficult, well, has THAT been improved?<br>

<br>
OK 1st of i have been 60 for some time. And what i think the most unbalanced fact being a wiz was how HARD is to get my 60 spells. I do not own Sunstrike, Elricks, or garrisons. Sunstrike of course if u get the VP key its easy to get, but having my guild just interested in doing quests, melee gear and such its hard to get a group or raid in there ( also i dont get much reply when i ask them to camp juggs : / ). THe spell itself is rare too, my guild killed the 4 RoK dragons countless times and with no luck. Elrick, oh baby yes kill THO... lol and in the server i am in Thouluxe Paels only 3 guilds can raid in there, yes 3 and im not one of them. Lastly Garrisons... right kille emperor Ssra wotever ... even the STRONGEST guild in our server ( KUPO FLUX ) attempted in killing and failed. <br>
<br>
My point is, I can get exp from any member of my guild so my dps is not that bad... but I lack of spells really and i never saw them on sale ( oh yeah sunstrike 100k big finger to that guy ) and to have all top 3 nukes SO HARD to achieve its makes me sigh big time and just work on my aa skills ( yes i have CF3 CFM1 and mana burn ). Some improvement could be to make the spells droppable to more mobs ( i mean more mobs with 60+ lvl like Doomshade Rumble crush dropping Elrick could be nice ). Risk is indeed for greater achievement is true yes... but impossible is another thing. There goes my 2 cp ... any reply is welcome ( even negative ones can make me change my mind : ) )<br>
