<br>
alot of hate passed around so i want to be as cordial as i can (especially since im a visitor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
first on MB not being over powered....well as it was before it was a tad. I meen 4 wizards (i've personally seen it done) walk right up to gore in DL.../wave...all 4 begin casting...BOOM! Gore goes bye bye.<br>
<br>
epic scale for bards (maybe others dont know)gets looted...gets put on market for anything from 25k -100k. Bard that wants (needs in high end game to be anywhere near effective without having his hands explode) epic either has to dish out the cash or go 100% aa exp at 51 and beg and hope and pray that she/he can get a decent bunch of people together to take out vox. and vox has the worse drop rate on scales in existence.<br>
<br>
same bunch of wizards with kei and their flappy chill for a bit to get mana back then port off to another kunark dragon..../wave to dragon...BOOM!!! another dead dragon. <br>
<br>
ok now for the argument. 1 person being able to take out 20+ mobs in a few minutes at no risk.../buzz wrong. Even good bards (go to www.eqdiva.com and read through the boards) who have done it for a WHILE are still at great risk. You see we are small and frail and bashes hurt...let me ask you how long you think any class (besides big ubah ogre warrior) will survive stunned (repitively) and chewed on by 20+ blue mobs?? and it is not a rare thing...you see our speed song has a horrable bug since day one that has never been addressed that in the middle of a twist (stop current song start next song stop current song start next song) even if it has just been refreshed will suddenly DROP!<br>
<br>
that meens that said bard running away with big 20+ uglies behind him has now slowed down to normal speed with about 4 seconds until he can get his speed back assuming said bard isnt using aa run 3 or jboots or sow...wich most bards under 50 DO NOT have. and another thing...unless i have a wiz/druid/ranger partner with snare them mobs are running at their top speed. and we all know that alot of mobs have sick melee range. that meens most times mob opening attack once im in range is...you guessed it BASH! me stunned..me die..or me extremely lucky and i got selos off because i was jumping like i had ants in my pants!<br>
<br>
swarming takes skill....maybe not a whole lot but it does take skill. and yes mobs do resist charm...a whole lot sometimes. and every resist hurts very badly...and when we do get charm to stick and send pet in...if its more than 3 mobs on pet the rest come after us. and you try keeping your current pet close enough that you can watch its life drop and know when to break charm and dodge the onslaught aswel.<br>
<br>
anyway my $0.02<br>

With their PbAE nukes, they can solo 20+ mobs at a time by just staying just ahead of a train of mobs and nuking. I watched a wizard having a ton of mobs behind him and he was clearly using ae nukes. I thought quad kiting was bad but then I saw this and I must call for a nerf to wizards, no one should be allowed to be their own ae group. All for little risk too. I should know, I played a wizard to level 10 so I know a lot about the class. You stop for a sec, ae nuke, then run away, rinse and repeat. They should eliminate ae nukes altogether.<br>
<br>
Do wizards have to have 24 damn AA points to have this ability? no..any rare spells or weapons? no..just their default songs. I dont normally jump on another class but this was simply too much for me to take..Ive sat back and been nice and understanding as far as other classes are concerned..and i dont hold it against the people behind wizards..If i played a wizard as a main i would take advantage of it..But at VI i am fucking pissed...this is Taking Class unbalancing to a whole new level..They claim they are trying to Balance the classes...They say this is ok? Sorry i fail to see the logic here.<br>

If you see any fallacies in the above statement, then you just might well be able to see what is wrong with the original poster's comments, which I might add sound more and more trollish as I read them. Bards do not solo multiple mobs with pbAE dots the same way wizards don't solo multiple mobs with pbAE nukes.<br>

Obviously you have no clue what swarm kiting is... it includes the death of the mobs in the swarm...<br>
<br>
You describe nothing but a TRAIN, which has nothinf in common with swarm kiting.<br>
<br>
Every class can train tons of mobs around, so lets nerf all but wizzies, huh?<br>
<br>
IMO youre just pissed that some skilled bards indeed can &quot;quad&quot; nearly effective as a wizzard, i formyself saw some of your species getting pissed just because ME wasnt all for their own.<br>
... and there are nice wizzards posts too, all whining about not to be the only ones kiting in CS ME TD.. and so on.<br>

So, no need to come up with manaburn and bard scales, Simply put: If you want a scale, buff up your fighting force and wait for dragon to pop, then pull it and kill it. Besides, your group can move to the next dragon in far less time then it takes a wizard to med to full.<br>
<br>
Swarmkiting bards are fun to watch, but be invisible to the warm. Do not even attempt to kite close to them because the swarm will always prefer you over the bard. A good bard is recognised by a Low Lag connection. At least Bards are great in groups and on Raids. Haste song, debuff song, buff song, regen song. along with some serious dmg, They can fill every niche there is in both groups and on raids, and you can never have a Bard to many. And for Bards applies the same rule as for wizards: Do not get Hit. <p><center>

A good bard can kill a toiler in 15 seconds. Its rare, especially post the second to last patch since aggro on pets was drastically reduced. (shield made them seem to hate me more.. bastards).  The reason for this is... we charm 1 monster.. send it against his friends.. charmed pet beats one monster to a pulp and his friends kill the charmed monster to almost nothing.. break charm.. dot... charm the one it was hitting.. lookie that.. low health frm the pet hitting it.. rinse repeat...<br>
<br>
First off.. its alot of work to be able to kill every 15 seconds. It's not as easy as it appears to be.  Second off, A wizard will STILL outkill a bard in terms of mobs per xp since they have to take downtime when low on mana.  <br>
<br>
I too used to be annoyed at seeing bards kite in my areas when I played my wizard. I too as my bard, hear all the time various rants against bards from wizards in my own guild! (&quot;I hate you bards... &quot;).. Primarily this is because some sorry fool trains the wizard by accident. (Ok.. you dont camp on a known kiting path... thats simple logic but sometimes people forget that).  I try to keep my trains away from other people, and other bards.  However, there are people out there that see the mobs running in circles and decide to go run to see what it is. You should know better. IF your a kiting class and your in ME.. its rather obvious what that is.  <br>
<br>
Then theres the people that loot while im swarming.  And they wonder why they die. &quot;Oh you trained me&quot; .. No you know or should know that i have no hard aggro on any of these mobs so proximity and sitting/kneeling to loot makes a big difference.  But no... they dont.  Fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
The biggest concern people have .. most wizards especially since they lack tracking, is that they cannot find a mob.  If this is the case, many times I will say &quot;Take from my swarm&quot; and if they get any extras besides 4, i go get them. (A quick occlude gets it chasing me instead again).   I will also cease picking up any mob I can find and I will try to share..... example.. you take near the hill, ill take south of the lake.  &quot;Why do I get the hill&quot; Because you have a much better chance of surviving against a xi or a centien than a bard.  Dreaded words a bard can see &quot;You are engulfed in darkness.&quot; .. we dead.<br>
<br>
I do understand how it may APPEAR bards outdo wizards. We don't however I assure you.  In normal kiting... wizards are far superior over time.  Granted we kill fast but... I've played a wizard at 57 and my bard is 60.  I xp'd faster with my wizard than my bard. I'm also not limited to mobs of lvl 51 or less as a wizard... <br>
<br>
If you are going to point out something bards CAN do thats superior to wizards... mayhaps point out that we can solo mobs like Tantor and WW dragons, and even Ragefire etc.  But so can a group of wizards. I mean look. You guys are STILL killing Gore.. <br>
<br>
For every thing you throw at us bards we can throw right back.  Only difference is bard kiting is a bit more dangerous to other people. Any smart bard accomodates for this and unless we die, most people should be safe.  I personally would rather die than run my swarm through a group.  Problem is when i do die.. said toilers scatter in 23948203948293029 different directions :P<br>
<br>
So while I understand your concerns, I must state that your feelings are a bit too harsh.  <br>
<br>
As for the whole wizards concept of &quot;Damn bards in my way for quadding.&quot; Us bards think &quot;Damn wizards/druids in the way of my swarming.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps you understand swarm kiting a bit more, and by all means, please if you feel the need, come to the bard forums on eqdiva.com and post regarding this. However in a calm and clear manner like I have been trying to come across as.  The biggest problem that occurs from these incidents and posts is that theres random_twink00 that shouts &quot;F you! You guys suck wtf are you talking about&quot; etc.  Intellectual debates that are calm and clear and not flame wars are always welcome to my knowledge on the bard boards. And frankly, I like explaining to people about swarm kiting.  <br>

<br>
Is it possible to swarm kite for 7 hours straight?  Technically yes.  Is it risk free, by no means.  Are you going to be in serious pain after you do it? My god yes.  How many bards can do it for that long of a stretch?  Maybe 4 throughout all of EQ.<br>
<br>
Truth about swarm kiting, we are NOT using PBAE dots, we're using charm to get mob's to attach our pets then doting said pet after we release it.  Truth - our charm takes 60 mana for a one minute duration (used to be 20 for a shorter duration which was much preferable for swarm kiting as it allowed us to not need to rely on invis yadda yadda).  Truth - average bard mana pool is somewhere about 1200 - 1800.  Fiction - we don't kill 20 mobs at once, we kill one at a time we just use a ton of 'friends' to do it.<br>
<br>
Now I know all the bards that are coming over are going to say - he's lying we can't.  They're partially right, for the 99.9999999999% of the EQ bard population we can't.  There are ways however to obtain this.  And here goes:<br>
<br>
Join uber_guild_01<br>
1.  Acquire 23points of bard wearable -FT (that is the cap now right?)<br>
2.  Be level 60 with MC3<br>
3.  Have all exp going to AA<br>
4.  Wear every piece of int gear you can without sacrificing your FT items.<br>
5.  Equip a VT-stylish drum or at worst drums of the beast.<br>
6.  Begin Swarm<br>
<br>
Now the problems with this situation<br>
<br>
1.  I can probably count on one hand the number of bards that can reach over 10FT.<br>
2.  Once you remove your normal gear and put on all that int gear you're waiting a while for mana to come up.<br>
3.  New mob-agro makes swarm kiting 10000% more dangerous as they are a ton more likely to come after you then be social on your pet.<br>
<br>
So in answer to all this debate, yes it is possible, it's more rare then a lvl 55 zoning into VT but it is possible.  And just to set the record straight we are NOT killing 20 mobs at once, we're killing 1 while running away from 19.<br>
<br>
- Last note :  I don't swarm kite, I've tried it many many times and honestly I can't get the technique down, my guilds 'main' bard swarm kites constantly which is why he has three more levels and about 50 more AA then me.  Then again I'm a 'raid' bard, not a 'grinding' bard.  Our skills shine in the group not in solo-ing.  To say we're over-powered, twist a day in my shoes then come speak with me again. - <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vokalkhords>Vokal Khords</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/02 11:32:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1670.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Swarming info</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
The Type of Swarm kiting im Talking about is the Use of the Unlimited target Aoe Dots and running around keeping within range yet still out of mobs melee range.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Not possible...the range of our PBAoE dots is barely longer than melee range and even one packet hiccup would cause the bard in question to be instantly mulched.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if the people here really understand the dynamics of The Swarm. Super brief explanation: Charm a mob and have it attack another mob. Two other mobs will assist the mob your pet is beating on. So a swarm doesn't get any more efficient with any more mobs than 4. 1 pet and 3 mobs. If you get more adds than that they will chase the bard while the 4 mobs duke it out. When your pet gets low on health you break charm and recharm another mob which you then order to attack any mob except your ex-pet. Then while 3 mobs beat down your new pet you finish off your old pet with DoTs. It is kind of like inverting the pet/mob relationship. You create a pet but only with the intent of killing the pet for xp so in essence the three mobs engaging your pet are doing all your work for you (more like having 3 pets instead of one and - yes - 250+dps is good).<br>
<br>
The important point to remember is that any number of mobs beyond 4 do not add to the efficiency. When you see 15 mobs or so, all the bard is doing is training them around while the real swarm of 4 mobs does its work. Anyone with SoW can run around with a bunch of mobs chasing them.<br>
<br>
Personally I try to keep my swarms small - like 4 to 5 mobs just to be polite to my fellow players but there are times when I get a lot of adds real fast (toiler hill) so I do end up with 10 or so. <br>
<br>
The problem with bigger swarms IMO:<br>
<br>
1. They take up more real estate. A bard with selos up who is giving 12 mobs chasing him a wide berth (because to mess up is to die) will take up A LOT of space. Which means even MORE adds and more conflicts with other players in the area. This leads directly to problem #2...<br>
<br>
2. Aggro. Aggro. Aggro. Quad'rs don't understand this about bard swarms - THEY ONLY WORK BECAUSE THE BARD ALMOST HAS ZERO AGGRO. That means if you get close or if the bard gets close to you everything will go haywire. You'll feel like you've been trained. Some bards will feel like you are stealing their mobs. They might try to reclaim aggro by snaring the mob but in doing so they might pull even more mobs into the area. In short - it can get ugly very fast.<br>
<br>
It pays for quad'rs (and other players) to understand how swarms work. I recently had a druid tell me to control my pulls because she was repeatedly getting too close to the area I was using and getting trained. She thought the swarm would have the same kind of aggro that other quad'rs would generate. After telling her that the mobs were low aggro and that she couldn't come that close and telling her that I would try to confine my activity to a certain area we got it worked out and didn't have any problems after that.<br>
<br>
How efficient is swarming? Incredibly efficient. If I'm on toiler hill I always outkill quad'rs by a pretty hefty margin. Like others have pointed out we have serious mana regen issues so it isn't unusual to see a bard go &quot;LFG&quot; even when there are a ton of mobs chasing them around. However, with some AAs and with a couple of FT items a bard could probably keep it up indefinitely - but at this point they wouldn't want to because charmable mobs green out very fast at 61+.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry, but, this is completely false.  While we can kite those 15 mobs, only four of them are actually hitting the charmed mob, not only that, it takes a lot of skill and practice to do, and not all bards can do it (or do it well).  Also, one lag spike, or an add that stuns you could mean instant death for the bard - just because bards are plate classes doesn't mean we take hits very well.  <br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Hell even quadding was never that powerful&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, by the time it takes to kill all the mobs you could have that almost as many quads done.  Perhaps you should research it a little more, also, we have to worry about timing the charm break so the mobs don't &quot;poof&quot; with rewards us with nothing but lost time. <br>
<br>
Swarm kiting really isn't all that efficient, i'd much rather get into a good group and get some constant EXP flowing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;The swarm kiting im pissed about is the Manaless run with bard speed while twising dot songs that have unlimited targets type.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Unlimited target's type?  Do you think our DoT's are lull spells?  They get resisted like your nukes do.  Try chant kiting with a bard sometime, see if you have fun twisting 5 songs and staying ahead of the mob at all times - only to have it warp on you all the time.<br>
<br>
And if your talking about this...<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Use of the Unlimited target Aoe Dots and running around keeping within range yet&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Our AoE dots SUCK.  Limited range, crappy damage - they are fairly useless.  There is no way a bard was kiting in ME for 7 hours doing this.  Do some research.<br>
<br>
And, even if you still think it's to overpowering.  Take a look at bards in general, we're the work horses of classes.  I'm not saying Wizards are easy to play.  I am friends with a lot of Wizards and it can be a pain in the ass.  Once you try twisting four songs for a raid after raid and then exp'ing, constant requests for mana song (yes, you do get requests for TL's all the time) and being broken every patch I don't see how Bard's are all that imbalancing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Bards..What i started this post about...Everything virtually manaless..a ton of songs that have a huge variety of effects..Being able to kite 20+ mobs..I dont need to say more then that to show how unbalanced they are&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, but, there is a reason our songs are mana free.  They only last 3-4 ticks.  Bards have no Mana Regen besides Flowing Thought / Mental Clarity.  Mana would run out extremely fast if our songs cost mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Having played a Shaman I can comment on this...<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Shaman....Tribal healer...They are a far cry from that in this game is all ill say..Shaman solos a dragon...brags about it...VI says Cool...5 Wizards MB a dragon...VI say oh fuck thats way overpowered...uh huh..whatever&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Show me when a Shaman has solo'd anything but weak dragons in West Wastes?  A shaman has never solo'd Gore/Talendor/Sev/Trak/Sont.  Do some research, only the best geared Shaman's can solo the hard dragons in West Wastes.<br>

Now that is inside of 1 minute you said he was killing them in 15 seconds.. Sorry pal but the only mob a Bard can kill in 15 seconds is a L1 Rat outside of Freeport.. We aren't known for our killing speed just the non-stop relentless picking of hps..<br>

I think you have a little class envoy after watching what this Bard can do..<br>

You seem very bitter about the nerf to MB.. Sorry I didn't completely like how VI handle MB I think if they made it so a Wizard couldn't MB a mob till it was 75% of it's HPS left would have been better. But don't bitch about another class cause of it..  <p>Talabus Songweaver<br>

   Now for /rant. That was a bull shit post that started this thing. I like the saying a few posts up, we're kiting 1 and running from 19. And yes it has its hazards. My selos was about to drop the other day and after my 7 missed note it dropped, after 20 mobs bash and stun you, your kinda screwed. We can't take 20 mobs at 1 every 15 seconds for 7 hours. 15 seconds is a very good bard using charm method. A) mobs don't spawn that fast. B) Bard is outta mana after the 1st or second group like that. Don't flame a class because you don't understand them. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/rhsanborn/bardsig2.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
