No, I believe we've more or less ridiculed Sam since the beginning.  I think we talked shit about the SZ board because it seemed as if 98% of the members of said boards seemed to enjoy some mindless jihad-shit or something like that.  They're pretty much the reason why SZ is hated - because they seem to enjoy acting like a racist 13 year old.<br>

As well you would be able to get a life finally, milaru and others, and maybe... just maybe we could discuss and adress more some ofthe real wizard's concerns, that you don't even know of. (When did you stop playing?)<br>

Yeah... clearly the rant board is the sole reason why these boards are trash.

3442 posts or so made... Of that were for sure 3400 here on the rant section or - even worse - in the general section bashing, flaming, insulting and slapping people. (Might be you need that, i am sure quite some on this board need it for their ego... /shrug.)<br>
<br>
I have 950ish (?) posts here and you won't find from me more than 50 post in this section. (Might change though.... it's fun to show you the reality of your miserable life... if there is nothing else left for you than to post here and vent...)<br>
Ohh, and that was loooong before you showed up here, Mylady and ruined the taste of this board.<br>
<br>
There was a better tune on this board back in those days when Fastasia was still acting here. <br>

Ooooook. Right.<br>
<br>
Let's see:<br>
<br>
People like me asked (way pre SoL) for an upgraded Rent spell. <br>
Who came and biatched here? You and your fanclub.<br>
<br>
We got them now with SoL.<br>
<br>
We asked as well for lesser manacost on the draughts (the pre 60 draughts) and higher damage on them. (10% less mna cost, 15% more damage).<br>
Who came and biatched here? You.. and your fanclub. You got an orgasm by biatching about people who asked for that. (might have an orgasm problem IRL, what do i know...)<br>
We got those draughts pre PoP. Via focus items.<br>
<br>
We asked for higher Lures, for an upgraded Sunstrike. Same story.. you came and biatched...<br>
<br>
We asked for some possibility to reduce spell casting times, and to save mana overall. You came... and biatched.<br>
<br>
Etc, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Where were you when we had the Wizard IRC session and that long document asking for some reasonable upgrades that was made long time before SoL, in the SoV era?<br>
You were not there.<br>
<br>
You know what? Get laid, hun.

Did you go back and count every post I've made on the rant board?  Have you been keeping a running tally of the posts I've made on the rant board?  Really, I've probably made more posts in Discussion of Inter-Species forum than here, probably.<br>

Oh, my poor fool.  You're telling me you're revealing my &quot;miserable life.&quot;  That's pretty amusing.  Considerng my outlook on life has been pretty negative for the past decade, you're hardly revealing anything.  I know I'm pathetic.  Fuck, I've known that since about the age of 10.  I also know that anytime either of us replies to a thread like this, we're only declaring to the rest of the world just how pathetic we really are.  I'm perfectly fine that.  Fits with my outlook on humanity pretty well.  The question is - can you live with that?  Can you live with knowing everytime you post a reply to this thread you are making a fool of yourself?  Oh, BTW you have ~910 posts on this board if you want an exact count.<br>

<br>
I wish I had a fanclub. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But, regardless, I didn't actually bitch about it.  I was pretty much for upgrades during the age o balancing talks.  Hell, I even took part in the wizard chat that was held in #graffe or someother channel on IRC until I had to go do something (Study? Forget.  Been a long time).  When I read the chat logs, it appears as if a lot of the ideas that got discussed was built on a concern that a lot of us, even me, were voicing about (mana supply and regeneration rates).  I was there.  Hell, I was even a major influence in getting organized once it started.<br>
<br>
You see, what you're getting confused is &quot;content&quot; and &quot;whine.&quot;  What a lot of you were doing was whining. &quot;Oh, melees outdamage me,&quot; &quot;Oh, I'm not wanted in groups,&quot; &quot;Oh, soandso outnukes me,&quot; &quot;Oh, wizards are so underpowered.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was content.  I was fine with the wizard class how it was.  It didn't bother me at all.  Was I against upgrades? No.  Did I want them? Would have been nice.  But I really didn't let it nag me.  The wizard class was fine.  The problem was all the class envy that was getting thrown around.<br>
<br>
Do you really want to know what I was doing during the balance discussions?  I was playing and having fun with my wizard, not envying melee_01 for their damage output.  I was talking with younger wizards about what they could do better, what they could expect in terms of difficultly, helping them with quests.<br>
<br>
What ruined the boards is all the class envy that got thrown around during balance discussions, not the actions of people like Claud, Milaru, and me.  Hell, once the bandwagon started, we just kept pushing it.  Hell, we've stopped pushing it for a long time.  The reason why the boards are in such a shape is because no one, not even you it appears, wants to make the commitment to shape them up.<br>
<br>
And for the love of god, stop refering me to me as a woman.  Only Froz is entitled to do that because he's an asshole.<br>
<br>
Sue me plz, kthxs.<br>
