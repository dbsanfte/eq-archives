<br>
I think it bears mentioning that shortly after Luclin, the vast majority of the original developers (Bard McQuaid, Jeff Buttler, etc.) left Sony and formed their own company, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sigilgames.com">Sigil Games</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. Though they made some unpopular design decisions, they stuck to their guns and made some of the most importantly addictive and realistically immersive concepts for implementation in EverQuest. EQ's success, on the whole, is largely attributed by its lack of same-scale competition and marketting (Asheron's Call was no match and Dark Age of Camelot arrived far too late on the scene to compete). Now that competition is emerging over the horizon, SOE has to make the game appeal to the common denominator of its active subscriber base - which means lowering the level of difficulty and reducing the degree of time-sink that the game has. It's an unfortunate choice that will benefit only those who stick with EverQuest as the months continue to turn into years, but the open competition is sure to inspire the folks at Sigil Games to, hopefully, come out with a product that will rival World of Warcraft.<br>

The game is fixed now? They listen to customers more now?<br>
<br>
I'd argue that there are as many problems now as there ever were really, they are just different ones, and some were caused by the changed they made from both those things you mentioned. And listening to your customers too much can lead to some of the worst things you can do. The old Bread and Circuses approach isn't really the best one by any means. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Focus effects, PoP nukes, % heals for Shaman/Druids, renegging on nerfing Slay Undead, Monk nerf, Monk semi-unnerf, Epic Faction Fix, Faster PoP fights, nerfing CHeal, Clerical soloing, Cleric dependancy being lessened, better availability of Flowing Thought, Lesser learning curve for new players, higher availability of spells (no Sunstrike/Avatar-like rarity), modified time sinks (in a way better, in a way worse), better encounters (Vex Thall is far worse than what we had now), I can't think of any more, but be assured there are MANY things that Brad would NEVER have done.<br>
<br>
I'm pessemistic and even I think the game is a much better place now than it was during Luclin.  Are there problems? Yes, re-flagging is lame. Doing the HoH trials a dozen times just because you have new members is horribly stupid.  That doesn't mean the game is broken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3486<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 7:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ</span><hr size=1> I don't really consider most of those fixes myself.

I have 5 RL friends that started EQ within the last 3 months and trust me they think it is absolutly fantastic. They are still experiencing the awe of seeing new locations and trying new encounters. This are different for them then the game I grew up in, but they are having a grand time in EQ!! Have to look at things out of the box I guess. I just get a kick out of going to as many new zones and places I can think of in our group of low levels and know we will see solid progress and also have a great time showing off some great EQ content to these guys. <br>

<br>
Yes.  Just because they don't act on every single customer's idea doesn't mean they aren't listening.  You visit these boards.  You should know by now that some ideas the players come up with would destroy anything worthwhile in EQ.  (example: multi-classing.  I've seen in on several boards, and it's a horrid idea in reality).  Hell, I think I can recall a few of your posts claiming how dumb other peoples ideas are.<br>
<br>
The developers sincerely would like to implement alot of the great ideas players come up with.  More often then not it's a limitation of time or computer resources to do so however.  How do I know this?  Because I've heard them speak in person at an EQ fan fair.  They are not the demons many players make them out to be.  Most players make suggestions with out really thinking about &quot;the big picture&quot;.<br>
<br>
Look at this next patch coming out.  I can't wait.  So many great things.  &quot;Favorite List&quot; for spells?  Wonderful idea.  New zone?  Great idea.  Group exp changes?  sweeet.  I have no doubt in my brain that there are plenty of other things they have in the works... it just takes TIME.  Would you really rather they spent the last couple weeks working on &quot;lame player idea_000679806 that effects .01% of the player base&quot; then what they have been working on?  Things that positively affect us all? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3497<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/7/03 10:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> &gt;Yes.

I said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>more</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. They have always listened, most people just didn't like the response they gave. I don't really see them listening any more now. I see them more trying to dumb the game down to get the profit margins up. That isn't really listening to the customer, its more listening to the marketing department. And for the record, I have spoken to a lot of them as well. Their are still many of the same areas where they could make improvements but haven't, because while those improvements are things the customer would like and has asked for, and wouldn't change anything in the game as far as balance goes, they are in areas that affect the bottom line. A lot of the things being put in now are driven more by the new competition they are facing. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I could care less where they find their motivation.  Besides, they still don't have any real competition at this point in time.  SWG and EQ2 are their own titles, so can't count them as competition.  CoH and WoW aren't coming out for a long time.  WoW just has alot of hype going for it even though it's like a year and half from release.  So exactly what competition are you refering to?  Shadowsbane?  DAoC?  AC2?  FF XI? Don't make me laugh.<br>

I was there for those ancient patch changes. I don't really see much of a difference overall other than the continual dumbing down of the game. Your interpretation is they are listening to current customers, mine is they are trying to get the new ones who can barely tie their own shoes. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

See, this is actually where we differ.  I was playing this game when it was first released as well.  What you refer to as &quot;dumbing down&quot;, I like to think of as enhancing.  EQ has a very steep learning curve compared to the majority of computer games out there.  Things like no corpse runs below lvl 10, larger quantities of food/water to begin with,  pop up learning tips, newbie quest armors, PoK books etc don't &quot;dumb down&quot; the game.  They just lower some of the downtime learning the basics, travel time, corpse run time etc.  Lowering down time for beginers to EQ is a good thing.  I remember how traumatic it was for me when I was a lowly lvl 6 mage (a character long since deleted) and I lost my corpse in lesser faydark.  It took me (and I'm not exagerating) about 6 hours to find my damn corpse.  Now bear in mind that my PC was subpar back then, and the majority of the time I played it was necessary for me to use the top down view due to lag especially in cities.  I could actually navigate the majority of pre-kunark zones looking at my feet.  But I loved the concept of the game so much that I would play it anyway.  I can say with some confidence that most sane people wouldn't put themselves through that.  Is SoE trying to make this game more enjoyable to people new to the game? Absolutely.  But it's from feedback from players like me that found many aspects of old-school EQ as Bs.  So yes.  They are trying to get new customers by listening to their older ones.  They are also making changes that affect me as a lvl 65 char as well.<br>

<br>
Only because you think there is an actual argument I guess. There isn't, only your opinion and mine, and they differ. And for someone talking about post count stuffing, you sure added a lot. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

That arguement doesn't make any sense at all. DAoC has 225,000 players which is EASILY the critical mass necessary to continue producing expansions and so on. <br>
<br>
As for WoW: I agree that Blizzard makes cool games and that they are relatively bug free. Their biggest problem is and always has been hacking / cheating on Battlenet servers. They really must address that issue if they want to be successful. Another thing is class balance and overall game playability. They have never done a MORG, so it's illogical to assume that their MORG will be better then all others, just because. Further, they must address caster vrs. melee balance, sense of accomplishment vrs. privately generated dungeons, mudflation, balance between early, mid and high end game, and a host of other factors that don't particulary matter in Warcraft 3 (for example).<br>
<br>
I ain't knocking them, but put the pipe down and think about what a daunting task doing all of that right enough to &quot;work&quot; is gonna be. Now imagine how hard it will be to do it better then EQ, which has the benefit of YEARS of practice, tweaking, etc. I hope WoW is amazing, because I like the setting, but assuming that it will totally bury EQ is hilariously naive, to say the least.<br>

This is simply not true.  Mob camping, steep exp trails with exp penalties for death being steep (you noobs still don't realize that you get half the penalty for dying us old timers got in the beginning),  a game focussed on items to gain power,  Interdependent classes - ALL OF THIS IS DIKU!!!!<br>
<br>
the vision = DIKU!!!!!!   Brad McQuaid was a genious because he saw how Diku could be made to be played by 2000 people in 3d.  That was true vision.  Try not to give him too much credit for the design itself.  <br>
