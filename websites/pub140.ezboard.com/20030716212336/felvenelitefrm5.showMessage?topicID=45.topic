The founding fathers of Elven Elite were probably turning in their graves even at this moment.  <br>
<br>
A chill runs down Nalilya's spine even at that thought and as she steps closer to the fire an unpleasant odor drifts past her nostrils and she thinks  &quot;Those darn ogres have been wrestling on the hearth rug again, they really ought to at least be made to bathe before being allowed in our great hall.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nalilya again looks around the once pristine guild hall and takes in the dented walls, the splashed ale on the much used chair next to the fireplace, and the scattering of herbs and leaves around the floor that always seem to trail after Lucman from the overflowing pouches of his alchemy components.  <br>
<br>
Stepping forward into the light that is coming from the window fashioned in the great room's mighty walls, Nalilya looks upon the forest of Greater Faydark, created by the Mother of Tunare.  A soft breeze caresses her cheek as Nalilya breathes deeply of the wonderful fresh scent of leaves and earth.  Without a backward glance Nalilya leaves the guildhall and enters the forest, determined to come to grips with the heaviness in her heart.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh Great Mother, please aide me in the difficult decision that lay before me.  I have fought beside many in the Elven Elite for most of my life.  We have fought for the good of our people and have protected your beautiful forest against those who would wish it destroyed. My allies and my enemies have always been clearly outlined, darkness against light. Sadly, in the distance I see a crossroads, and our people cannot seem to turn back and avoid it.  To the right lay the path we have always traveled, filled with those faces that bear the likeness of our ancestors.  Their arms bring familiar comfort and a sense of returning to our roots.  To the left lay the path of evil, eyes that stare back at me with hate and malice, and yet they call to me with promises of new riches and power.  Ahead lay a path with no distinct outline, it seems to shift and reform in a gray mist right before my very eyes.  Of all the paths this one scares me the most, for it carries both those familiar faces and the faces of my enemies. How can I walk upon that path never knowing who the true enemy is?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nalilya looked about herself and realized that night had fallen in the great forest.  Remembering the condition of the guildhall and not looking forward to returning to it, she decided to make her bed in the forest's comforting arms that eve.  <br>
<br>
As the night claimed her Nalilya could hear the Great Mother's voice as it was carried as a whisper in the rustling leaves, &quot;Sleep my child, I will aide you in finding the path you seek, but beware, you may not like all the answers.....&quot;<br>

As I remembered what had happened, a smile found its way to my lips as I thought of my friends, now haphazardly snoring soundly near the fireplace.<br>
<br>
&quot;Big fat oafs&quot; I said, quietly to ensure no one would be disturbed. &quot;I showed them a thing or too about everything ... I'm more nimble than they would ever be, how they hoped to ever catch me I do not know&quot;. As he said this a grunt came from their direction, signifying their domineering presence.<br>
<br>
Ogres or not, they mean well and are there at my side in battle should any harm come to me. All the people around me, no matter who they are, are my friends, my comrades, and that is all that matters. Now, and forever more.<br>

<br>
As Nalilya slept, images began to form in her mind and she dreamt. The pictures came quickly and there did not seem to be any order to them at all.  <br>
<br>
….she saw herself walking into a town where two ogres stood guard at a doorway.  They glanced up and saw her, they eyes filling with glee as their innocent victim approached, starting to drool in anticipation of the snack walking toward them… a picture of herself laying on the ground with bloody clubs raised before her…<br>
<br>
…the scene changed and Nalilya found herself on a battle field where a fierce battle raged around her, with her beloved Elven Elite at her side…the battle was not looking good for her as the enemy started beating on her from all sides.  Just when defeat was imminent and the final blow coming, a large ogre warrior pushed his way through the crowd and absorbed the blow with a grin… &quot;lemmee do dar barshing from now on Nalilyaaa, yar bones bwake ways to fast, Kahchop likes to barsh, Kahchop was made to be barshing…&quot;<br>
<br>
…another battle field, the mighty Elven Elite victorious, the bodies of their enemies strewn around them…twas the end of the marauding dark elf camp that had plagued the High Elves and Wood Elves, causing them to join forces to eradicate this evil…<br>
<br>
...the founding fathers were arguing, at their feet a screaming child, the only survivor of the dark elf camp…a child of Innoruuk, of evil…it must be killed, a raised blade swinging downward only to be stopped at the last moment by the grip of a strong hand on the sword arm…&quot;are we not a race of pure goodness, of light? How can we cold bloodedly kill this child, for a child it is and as such knows no evil…&quot;<br>
<br>
… a cloaked figure scurrying off into the darkness, a squirming bundle hidden under the cloak…<br>
<br>
… and the same scene repeated at another battle, the only thing visible a scalely tail poking out of the cloak…and another scene, and another, with the same cloaked figure stealing away into the night…<br>
<br>
Many more little scenes flashed through Nalilya's dreams that night.  There were eyes of darkness and hate, eyes of goodness and light, wondering and calculating eyes waiting for the right moment, the pictures all blurred together into a kaleidoscope of confusion and Nalilya awoke, more confused than before.<br>

Sitting up in her bed with a look of utter confusion, Nalilya is pondering the nights dreams. &quot;Nal, what is this look i see upon your face?&quot;Debba says to her, forgeting why she came in search of the seamstress. <br>
As Debba listened to the many disturbing and shadowed highlights, she too was confused. &quot;What may this dream be trying to tell you Nal? You think the founding fathers would ask us to save the children of hate and evil, the children of our enemies and teach them good?&quot; Not waiting for  Nal's response, &quot;I remember a cloaked figure my father used to talk of, one who's only purpose in life was to make good. Could this be the same as the one in your dream?&quot; <br>

All that was seen was the blueish crystalinne cloak that wraped around this unknown figure.<br>
With a raised hand and a green aura that formed, the floor boards began to creak and slowly peel apart as a skeletal figure took form. <br>
&quot;Lay down your weapons i am not here for combat&quot; as the words were spoken it was aparent the cloaked figure was not the one talking and he didnt not move, he stood without as sound as a statue would. He seemed to be grafting his voice with his undead minion. &quot; I am Tyrashel D'Mortis Necromancer of the 16th skull, I have come to prove my worth to those that banished my admission from this guild, perhaps you do not remember me but I am the bastard son of Dysantes Elvenlore. I am now within ranks among The Order of The White Hand and my power grows with no bounds&quot;. <br>
After the words echoed through the hall, the cackling laughter of the skeleton minion followed.<br>
 <br>
With a few movements of his lips the minion dispersed, Tyrashel then raised his hand and drew back his cowl to show his darkened face, though light surrounded him he remained as though always engulfed in shadows, &quot;You have forsaken yourselves by your ways and rules, you will never truley grow to be powerful. And when you ranks weaken you will be slaughtered like a weakened animal taken down by a predator. Only then will you realize the saviors may be of my darkened skin and white hair. I am not an animal to be hunted or a monster to be slain, and if you seek me in those ways, then I will welcome it for I lust for the agonizing screams of my enemies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyrashel turned around and faced the guildhall doors and with few muttered words shadows began forming around him. <br>
&quot;I am offering my help, if you need it on your journeys, But do not expect this always for i am only still alowing your people to live because my father had a deep care for you&quot; <br>
<br>
With an unexpected single tear that formed upon Tyrashel's face he spoke his lasts words while  becoming unseen to all <br>
&quot;Though my father was hated by my people for his race he was a great man of honor and wisdom, i guess i wish to reclaim his spirit and with that i wish to help his friends&quot;  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/utyrashel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyrashel</A> at: 12/4/01 3:01:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udarkthunder82.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darkthunder82</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(12/5/01 11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dilema</span><hr size=1> Callmed appears from behind a tree after listening to Tyrashel D'Mortis's speech. He feels an evil presence around him, yet it sends a warm rush through his elven blood. He feels connected to Tyrashel somehow, yet it plagues his mind why he should feel connected to one of evil...<br>
<br>
Callmed picks up a bottle of Elven wine that stood alone on the table. He quickly chugged it down trying to ease his mind. Was it possible Tyrashel had somehow corrupted this territory? Or perhaps he truly did want to follow in his fathers footsteps. Callmed turned to the great Shaman Lucman, asking what he thought it all meant. He figured Lucman had the answers somewhere buried deep within his scrolls. <br>
<br>
As Callmed began to take care of Lucman's pet, he noticed an obscure in his mouth. He pondered where he had got this bone from being outside with only a few bats and wasps about. It was then he saw this was no ordinary object, but a bone left behind by Tyrashel. There were foreign words enscribed in it he could make no sense of. He handed the bone off to Aryllian, hoping the master of many languages could decipher this evil tongue.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/utyrashel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyrashel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(12/22/01 2:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dilema</span><hr size=1> &quot;Let the hatred of my sould seep, deep with your wound&quot;<br>

Tyrashel spoke the words as he healed a woodelf which had been harmed by a giant Scarab in the Eastern Commons. <br>
<br>
&quot;thank you dark one&quot;  said the young woodelf, as she ran off into the distance. Tyrashel pondered the emotions he showed when in the Elven town, as the darkelf reached within the shroud of his cloak he realized one of his scriptures was missing. &quot;damned fool I am, I must have dropped it&quot;.<br>
Tyrashel knew if that bone scroll fell into the wrong hands within the elven village, terror could be unleashed on them all. &quot;I must return to Kelethin with haste&quot;, Tyrashel tightened the clasp of his cloak and began to travel towards freeport. <br>
