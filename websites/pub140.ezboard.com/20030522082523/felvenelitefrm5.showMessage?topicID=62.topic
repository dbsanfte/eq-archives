<br>
<br>
It would take a few seconds for Ary's eyes to adjust to the darkness of Innoruks Realm.  It was starkly different then the desert of Southern Ro.  <br>
<br>
Krushh moved past Ary barking orders....<br>
<br>
&quot;Shield wall...here..,&quot; Krushh whispered in a guttural attempt at High Elvish.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Casters....here...,&quot; he pointed to the ground.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Ary sniffed the air, and caught the familiar stench of decay that filled the air in Innoruks plane.  He checked his place in the shield wall and planted his feet.  He was holding the To'eryr D' Yvierse- the Banner of the Elite.  He was to be the center of the Elven Host.  He was very proud to earn this right.  <br>
<br>
Looking down for a moment, he saw the blue and white favor tucked neatly into his belt.  Inside the small silk sash was a golden lock of hair.  For one quiet moment, His thoughts drifted to the lady who asked him to bear it.  The thought of her honor inspired him.  He was to fight for her honor, for the Honor of the Elite and for the Knights of the Koada Vie.    <br>
<br>
&quot;ALL PRAISE INNORUK, OUR LORD AND CREATOR!!&quot;, the noise echo'd from the harsh blackend stonework.  The sudden noise startled Ary from his day dream.  He set his jaw to the grim task at hand.  <br>
<br>
Wilwen ran into the room in a low crouch and stood before Krushh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three Golems of Spite, M'lord.....I say again....Three dread Golems are headed our way...&quot; reported Wilwen.  Wilwen winked at Ary and dove into the lingering shadows. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tis time, you earned your Keep!!!&quot; Shouted Krushh<br>
<br>
&quot;Ainea Elthe Klitne,&quot; (Hate breeds Contempt) shouted Aryllyian......<br>
<br>
<br>

In their dark and addled minds, one thought.......the purpose of thier being echo'd repeatedly:.....&quot;kill them...kill them...kill them&quot;<br>
<br>
Among the Elven Host, bright swords flashed from scabbards and as the faithful made themselves ready for attack.  In the center, a tall Elven paladin raised the Banner of the Elite into the air and shouted a warcry.<br>
<br>
The Golems, however, cared not.  They were created to be immune to the dread of battle moved foreward with awe inspiring speed and weight and crashed into the Elven line.<br>
<br>
<br>
The wave of Golems broke over the Elven host like an angry wave against the shore.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udebbaduilia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Debba Duilia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Leader</span><br>  Posts: 507<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/23/02 10:59:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rally the Elven Host</span><hr size=1> Strong like the Sea Wall the Elven stood and held there ground, casting the golems back to the ocean from where they came. Many Blades flung and arrows shot, many wounds and scars came of this battle. Many sat and cleaned their blood stained weapons, and poured water from their canteens on each others wounds. The Clerics and the enchanters sat and meditated restore their mana in hopes to help them all succeed. The Mighty Elven host now awaits the scouts return with word of what else may be in store.  <p>Debba Duilia <BR>

As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she heard no sounds of battle, just the soft rustlings of robes and the gentle clank of armor.  Seyah moved to the familiar “clerics’ wall” to wait for the rest of the raid force to arrive. <br>
<br>
She heard the sound of steel ringing, and the roar of an angry resident as it discovered the raiders.  She sought the health signs of Aryllyian, who would take the brunt of the attacks this day.   Concentrating on that, and the people in her group, she never noticed how many creatures were pouring into the house where the raid force was gathering.   Through the din, she heard Laenyel’s voice in her head.<br>
“You have three spite golems.  Are clerics camping?”<br>
<br>
Seyah frowned.   The health of her group looked good.  She’d only cast a couple of healing spells, and she had plenty of mana for more.  But she and Laenyel were veterans of many break-ins,  and Laenyel was right, spite golems were trouble.  She focused her eyes on the battle in front of her, trying to find the three spite golems in the gloom and confusion to determine who they might be killing.  At the same time she asked Krushh, just to be sure, “3 spites.  Should I camp?”<br>
<br>
Aryllyian had one well under control in front of her.   To her side, she could see Krushh battling a second,  which surprised her.  Krushh hadn’t needed a heal at all.   But where was the third?   Krushh’s laconic reply came back to her.  “Nah, we’re fine”<br>
 <br>
Curious now, Seyah continued to scan the crowd, wondering how the third spite had been subdued.  No one had fallen, so someone must have distracted it from killing the casters.  Finally, her eyes found the spite, and opposite him, a large northman.  Egads, she thought, frantically searching for the barbarian’s health signs among the crowd, is Lucman tanking AGAIN??   But no, Lucman was healthy.   And the barbarian she was looking at had no spear.  Seyah smiled as she finally realized that it was Cutulu who had engaged the third spite.  A third tank for the third golem.    We are indeed FINE, she thought with satisfaction, and she resumed her seat on the clerics wall to meditate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/useyahmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeyahMT</A> at: 4/23/02 1:30:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ublahg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blahg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scribe</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/24/02 11:11:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rally the Elven Host</span><hr size=1> As the golems crashed into the front lines, Blahg sat back for a moment.  A rush of familiar strength flowed through him, and he was filled with the knowledge of the Kuhn'Tcha Moreia.  The talisman in his beard burned with an intensity unlike anything he previously imagined possible.  He engaged the enemy, standing at Aryllyian's side, blades and body entered into a flowing dance of destruction.  Brell's full fury ripped through the enemy, ever seeking an unguarded flank, an unarmored side.<br>
<br>
Blahg saw a few of the Elite fall to the ground, healers rushing to soothe their wounds and return them to the battle.  This was no place to rely on a bodies natural healing.  The pure evil of this land could taint even the smallest wound, forever changing its victim.  As the healers held solace over the wounded, the battle continued.<br>
<br>
Hours later, Blahg wondered how he managed to keep swinging.  Having fought uncountable minions of Innoruk, the strength given to him by Brell had sustained him through it all.  Looking up to find a roof over his head, Blahg knew something different must be coming.  Suddenly, a giant blue beast flew around a corner, chasing poor Rokken.  Seeing the group did not concern this foul Maestro.  It had fought larger groups before and prevailed.<br>
<br>
The Elite swiftly attacked the Maestro, and much to his surprise, overpowered him rather quickly.  All those present had been preparing for this battle, and their collective strength could have challenged the foul god of this plane of hatred itself.<br>
<br>
The battles ended, for this night at least, and the Elven Elite returned to their homes.  Weary though they may have been, Tunare and her allies surely appreciated their toils. <p><html>
