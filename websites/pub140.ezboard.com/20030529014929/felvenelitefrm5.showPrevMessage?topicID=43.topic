<br>
Eliani heated the water for morning tea. More study in the library was ahead this day. Every step of learning she took just seemed to make the road longer and longer. It seemed like she now had more to learn than when she had first started. She threw on an old comfortable robe, picked up her pack and staff and headed out the door. <br>
<br>
Erudin was a beautiful, wondrous place. It was full of intelligent, quick-witted people. Eliani had moved to Erudin for study and learning. Felwithe just wasn’t home without Slaini around. Slaini had left months ago to continue her work in the world. So, Eliani had closed up their small apartment and moved their belongings to Erudin to further study the magical arts. She missed the Faydark Forest and the wonderful fairies. Everytime she wandered the Toxxula Forest the kobolds attacked. Her companion made quick work of them, but they were still obnoxious. The Orcs were smart enough to leave her alone it seemed. <br>
<br>
But the Erudites had built themselves quite a city. Eliani stopped at a street vendor for bread on her way to the library. She collected her tomes for the day’s readying and went quietly to a small nook in the wall she had found. No one ever sat there. She piled her books beside her and began to read. She could not concentrate, however. <br>
<br>
She tried for several hours to read and then finally gave up. She put the books back and sighed, not sure what to do now. Winter had turned into spring during her time in Erudin. Yet this day felt different. She was no longer content to study. She went to the kind mage who had been guiding her studied and told him, she was leaving for a journey. His eyes twinkled and he laughed out loud. <br>
“I have been hoping you would do this for several moons now, my child. I predict you will find yourself much more able to conquer the beasts that roam our world.”<br>
 She went back home, found her best robe, the beautiful purple one. She took two others, her tomes she couldn’t be without and stuffed them all in a pack. Still not sure of her exact plans, she locked the door and left. She made her way to the dock to catch the boat to Qeynos.. She summoned a companion at the dock, because the world seemed a more menacing place now for some reason. <br>
<br>
Several boats and barges later, Eliani was in Freeport and evening had come. No more travel that day. She found a small inn and paid for a room for the night. She went to the tavern next door for some dinner. There was a nice fire in the hearth and the tables were low and the chairs, comfortable. Three men, two in robes and one wearing warrior armor were having a raucous discussion their various skills at the next table. <br>
“I can control an entire crowd of monsters, if I am lucky,” said a tall man in a blue and green robe. <br>
The other man, in a purple robe chimed in, “Bah, I prefer to do them insurmountable damage with one cast.“<br>
“I appreciate your mezzing, Zher. You have saved my life more often than I would like to recount.”<br>
She couldn’t help listening to them as the debate hurried along. They left before she finished, still talking as they went out the door.<br>
<br>
Eliani hated boatrides. They left her seasick and a little tired. When she went back to the inn, she didn’t even light a lamp to read. She was too tired. The morning would come soon, and she thought she might as well head home since she was this close. Home meant one more boat ride. <br>
<br>
Early the next morning she set off for the Freeport docks. She laughed aloud, thinking of Slaini. Slaini thought Freeport was a cesspool. A place where any form of fun could be found for the right price. She bought some bait and fished at the pier while she waited for the boat. Standing at the end of the docks was one of the men from the tavern. <br>
“You don’t know me, but you and your friends brought a smile to my face last night. I enjoyed your banter and conversation. I didn’t meant to overhear, but you were just too close”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am Zher, and I saw you sitting next to us, but didn’t get a chance to introduce myself.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am Eliani, a humble magician in the service of Tunare. I also know that you are an enchanter.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That I am. May I ask where you are going?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am going home. I haven’t been there for almost a year. I went to Erudin to study and stayed a bit longer than I had intended.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am meeting some friends in the Ocean of Tears if you would like to stop with us for a while. We are trying to rid Norrath of the Ancient Cyclops, who has terrorized this ocean for so long.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am honored that you would invite me. One more delay will not matter.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boat arrived and they made their way to the island where the Cyclops  was purported to roam. They found a relatively safe spot on the barren isle. Eliani’s companion energetically guarded the little band. Eliani was introduced to Caeorn, the warrior and Coladiel, the wizard with whom Zher had shared a meal the evening before. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There are many dangerous Cyclops wandering here,” said Coladiel.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I wonder if the venerable Slaini will make it to us this day. She said she would come,” said Zher.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You know Slaini,” Eliani said, amazed, “And she is headed here?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, we are in her guild,” said Caoern, “I have sworn to defend the Elven Elite and the good of Norrath.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eliani laughed, “I too am a member of that guild. And what is more, Slaini is my sister whom I have not seen for over a year.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eliani heard her companion attack and turned around. A huge Cyclops had appeared on their beach. Coladiel was shouting and casting. Zher’s hands sent forth beams of aid for the fighters and damage to the Cyclops. Caoern attacked and was swinging wildly. Eliani cast torrents of fire upon the Cyclops. In a blur of smoke and lights, Caeorn fought along side Eliani’s pet. The Cyclops turned and lunged at Caeorn, knocking him to the ground. Coladiel cast once more, clearly exhausted, and a blue mist stunned the Cyclops. Caeorn managed to roll away. Zher cast a spell and the Cyclops stared dumbly at them, unaware that they had been attacking him. <br>
“I always think its better to wait for the clerics to arrive before you attack innocent Cyclops,” said a familiar voice. Slaini healed Caeorn who stood up to fight once again. Just as the Cyclops appeared to weaken., a great wind whirled around it. Then the Cyclops disappeared.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amidst the confusion, it took them a minute to realize their foe had vanished. Elaini knew for sure when her pet came to her for healing. He never stopped until the monster was dead or gone. She healed her pet then looked around at her sister. She had found her at last. <br>
 <br>
/OOC Zher, Coladiel and Caeorn, this is for you all. I am glad that you joined us. <br>
