At this point I think watching paint peel is more compelling than playing EQ.<br>
<br>
I've been at 56 for months and month with no real desire to level.  Why?  Well, the spells certainly aren't going to do it for me.  Same song sung in the key of Draught or Pillar as far as I'm concerned.  Why bother?  They don't do any more damage than their predecessors.  &quot;Oh!  But, this one is Ice based!&quot;  BFD, Skippy, it's still the same damned thing.<br>
<br>
Add into that that I was told a few months ago that as a wizard with nearly 200 FR unbuffed and all of the spells required for my level, I am not good enough for a trials group... well, it sent me into a tailspin.  Especially when my 52 cleric was recently asked into a trials group.<br>
<br>
I've got my epic, I've got some pretty darned good equipment, and yet... I'm not good enough.  Usually, my arrogance chews through BS of this sort, but my boredom and apathy won't let it.  I mean, I get flagged... then what?  I get to stand and cast the same spells killing bigger mobs.  Well, isn't that exciting.  Hold on, I think there is some paint beginning to peel, right over there!<br>
<br>
Seriously, haven't you guys come to a point when you begin to wonder why the hell you bother to log in?  Don't tell me to go play alts.  I have a cleric that can't even get fully into the game before she's pelted with tells for groups.  I have a rogue that just recently hit planes level that has a blast being a melee.  However, this is not enough to keep me from wondering about my wizard quickly becoming someone I log on for ports to EJ and SF.<br>
<br>
If you've been here, what did you do to overcome it, because, as it stands now, I could pretty much strip her down and leave her around for the two evacs listed above.  I've done the tradeskill thing... tradeskills are the cure for insomnia. <p><img src=http://24.26.194.142/sevsig.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 10:55 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> join a raiding guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1261<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 11:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> Yeah...

I would seriously do AE groups in HS, (cleric should pull with DA) Chardok, and end up in Fungus Grove (pull mutants, bandits, shrooms near the lake)... This should take you to 60 easily when your not in regular XP groups.<br>

<br>
As part of a mid size guild, with proper begging I was flagged at 57... <br>
<br>
In PoS/PoV the lowest level there non anon are usually 61... and no one I have ever seen even attempting to /lfg under that level.<br>
<br>
I got the flag mainly so that I could raid with the guild, which I did, unfortunately if you aren't in a guild raiding in tier 2-3... the flag would be useless.<br>
<br>
Sorry, just the facts, not being rude or anything, you just simply wont find a group, and you can't solo... unless you med kite a frog for 30 minutes, Maybe.<br>
<br>
As for the 52 cleric getting an invite... that is just a desparate PU group, which fail at trials 95% of the time.  You'll get level agro and heal agro, and if you don't have a horse you'll be OOM on the second wave, or get Sit agro to boot.  <br>
<br>
At 61 I get unsolicited invites to PU trial groups all the time, and coincidentially I can solo there and get groups now... so just be patient, things come when they should for most people.<br>
<br>
This is a moot point anyhow, probably next patch you'll be in tier 2 just for dinging 55. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hibashira>Hibashira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 11:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> As a level 56 damage dealer, you really have no business in tier 2.  You don't have the spells, you don't have the level, and I'm assuming you don't have the AAs either.  What hurt you the most is your level.  Almost all tier 2 mobs are blood red to you.  Your chance of landing spells is that much smaller.  You simply cannot contribute your share of damage in a group, period.   And when you can't contribute enough, then it is the same thing as asking to be PLed.<br>
<br>
You think that's harsh?  Wait till you really pass the trial.  You have 2 more zones that you can go but you will NEVER find a group there.  Why?  Because there are always other 60+ damage dealers (both melees and casters) LFG and they will ALWAYS be chosen over any level 56s.  Hell, I'm sure people here can tell you the problems they have LFG in tier 2 even in their low 60s.<br>
<br>
Bored? You think PoP is any different?  Puller pulls, tank tanks, mezzer mezzs, healer heals, slower slows, nuker nukes.  It is the same thing.  If you dread that, doing it in PoP won't make you feel any better.<br>
<br>
In late game, the only reason to log in is to raid and to be with friends.  You can do quests and tradeskills too if you enjoy that sort of things, which I get the feeling that you don't.<br>
<br>
If you don't raid and have no friends ... well, go read a book. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izelin>Izelin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 11:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Slowly slice your hand off with a spoon, similar to EQ but without the monthly fee.  /nod <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=legolos>Legolos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 11:38 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> I see that you are your guilds leader.  Make alliances with raiding guilds and start trying to raid content in your range.  Raiding and such can change your outloot on EQ alot.  But if you find that you don't even enjoy raiding as your wizard, then maybe you have lost the heart for the wizard in EQ and it's time to turn her into a port mule.  If you have the resources, atleast level to 60 before you give up.  A big power change occurs there, more so if you can get sun strike.  And from then up it's just more and more power.  Set your self smaller weekly goals and just get them done, don't worry about the &quot;big picture&quot; as it will just all fall into place as you raid and level up. <p><br><center><b>Sage <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21704">Legolos</a> Spellbynder |  <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21727">Uggliey</a> Bugger<br>LvL 65 Arcanist | LvL 56 Revenant<br>

They are not kidding. <br>
<br>
I was flagged at 57 by some fluke. Guild group, of course. It only took 5 or 6 tries. Flagging is actually pretty easy if ya have a good strat. I think the highest level person there was 61. The lowest was 53 (chanter). So yeah, it can be done - but for what?<br>
<br>
I am 59 now and have only been in two pick up groups in PoV / PoS. My root didn't work for shit until 59, and I got a lot of resists. At 59 I can contribute just fine, thank ye very much, but so can the other 10 DPS LFG's that are 61 +.<br>
<br>
Now, listen up: PoV / PoS are pretty good XP - even in 59. But they are just as mind numbingly boring as every other outdoor zone you have been unlucky enough to play in since LOIO. Frankly - this is EQ for the lowest common denomenator. You *camp* a spot and chain pull until you would rather watch TV, which outta tell ya something right there. The only real danger is either your cleric or your slower go LD, or both. Even then it's a short trip to the GY for a 96% rez.<br>
<br>
I am not big on alts myself, though I have a bunch. I don't like tradeskills either, but mostly because of what they do to my wrists in the name of skilling up. I raid, and when I am raiding - I have fun. In between I grind some XP when I can, or simply log off and do something that is actually fun.<br>
<br>
Better games are coming along shortly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sardonus>Sardonus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> Least I'm not the only one thinking you don't need to be in Tier2 this early. I hear all the time about below 60's whining cuz exp in Tier1 is crappy and it just makes me laugh. Some of us remember when exp didn't flow like water. That having been said....<br>
<br>
<br>
I know what you mean. Late 50's are really horrible for wizards imo. Even pre-PoP, it was all about being level 60. If you weren't, then you could expect to be left out of most everything. Add to this, quadding got so dull to me that if it was a choice between that or just logging, I'd choose logging most every time. What finally worked for me was finding a guild that did stuff besides exping. If you're not raiding in PoP, then you can help out a raid significantly imo. And PoP is only less of value because everything raid worthy has ae with ridiculous resists on it. I'd suggest looking at raiding with a guild in Luclin or Velious or, hell, even Kunark. Most of those raids are likely to be easier and certainly not drop &quot;uber&quot; stuff but it's something to do and brought the fun back for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerlatikflaimweaver>Zerlatik Flaimweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 2:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What To Do???</span><hr size=1> Well, I can empathize with your situation.  When I hit this problem, I ended up retiring completely.  Retirement's not so bad, I guess, I've just gotta come up with something else to fill the time.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, you can check out my magelo on my sig to see how well I managed to squeak by post 56, mostly solo.  It's doable to get to post 60, just really, really boring.  Guild groups help, but you've gotta have a play time that fits the rest of the guild and leaves you free time to actually meet up and level.  I ended in a raid guild on TP, which was great as far as seeing new places and getting stuff I never figured I'd have a shot at, but since most of the TP raiders are East Coast, and I'm MST, I pretty much was raiding from the second I logged on.  Raid exp sucks for levelling or AA.  Ironically, I ended in the same guild that was trying to recruit me when I first became guildless at 56.  They were way more fun than I expected, just took too much out of me.  If your play time is such that you can meet people to exp up with when you log on, and you still have time for other things, by all means go raid guild.  If not, maybe it's not your cup of tea.<br>
<br>
That said, getting flagged for the planes is rediculously easy.  I kinda think most of the people screaming at you that you have to be a certain level to get to PoV/S are just unneccesarily comfortable with doing it poorly.  Yes, if you suck at trials, you probably need people at or above a certain level.  Your mobs in the trial top out at about 57, which is the level of the Fierce Nemesis.  You won't see many of those.  <br>
Basically, if you can handle 4 mobs of 51st to 57th level at once, you're golden.  <br>
<br>
*WARNING! Trial of Execution strategy, skip down if you're not into long posts*<br>
<br>
You don't mez squat, you stun the crap out of them with a chanter.  From there, just AE them until the first two drop, switching to a fast single target when the executioner hits the platform.  (He will hit the platform before the first two drop, you just have to plan for it and switch to the hard, fast single target nuke assisting off your MA.  Once he goes down, you go back to an assist AE until the next falls and single target the last two).  <br>
<br>
Ideally, your going to start each wave at around 70m, get rods if you aren't, make sure you have C3 or better regen.  Final mob of 4th wave is melee'd to death by MA and or the soon to be unsummoned pets if you have some, and the odd single target nukes from everyone else.  The only possible reason people might think that you need higher than 56 for this would probably be that you all typically run out of mana on the 4th wave, which is BY DESIGN.  <br>
<br>
Take whoever is your MA or designated target, make sure they have a SoW going in, have them run to the top of the platform as soon as the last mob falls and gain aggro on PEV using a debuff or something that doesn't damage him enough to trigger summoning.  Then they kite him around the platform, while the rest of you regen or med up in the corner next to the Agent.  As long as you remember that buffs/rods/heals/etc cause aggro, and avoid doing that, your designated target will hold aggro while you get to FM/FH.  Rangers are fantastic at this, since their spell lines don't do much damage, cast pretty fast, and really piss PEV off even on resists.  <br>
<br>
As long as your group has even an inkling of how aggro and pathing works, you'll be fine in this trial.  Hardest part of Trial of Execution is training AE newbies like grind group clerics.  Some of the other trials are supposed to be even easier than this one.<br>
<br>
*End Strat*<br>
<br>
Tier 2 is hard to get groups in, and that's no joke.  People like to get groups that are around or above 60.  Lower than this and you'll probably have to import a group.  Wizards are also more common at this stage in Tier 2.  It's kinda odd when you have to advertise your AAs in your LFG messages.  <br>
<br>
Sev, it comes down to a question of whether or not you still want to do this after however much time you've put in.  At 135 days played, I wasn't willing to keep playing the same song and dance each day.  Ask yourself if you're happy.  Not just happy right now, but when was the last time you were happy in EQ?  What makes you happy?  If you're happy chatting with your old friends, do you need EQ to do that, or could you get an Instant Messenger or use a message board to keep that going?  If you don't need EQ, and it's just making you angry, quit.  Don't change your play habits, don't join a new guild, just stop.  If you aren't enjoying the game aspect of EQ, find a new game.  Let's face it, this is not the world's greatest game, you aren't giving up a timeless treasure by chucking it all and playing Shadowbane, Planetside, or starting the long wait for Final Fantasy XI, (as I'm doing).  <br>
<br>
Let's look at the negatives of EQ:<br>
1. They keep redoing balance to fit new content, rather than adjusting new content to keep balance.<br>
2. End game is kinda like a carrot on an ever lengthening stick.  Just when you think you've hit the big time, they come out with AA or more levels and you have to get back on the wagon.  When do you get to enjoy being at the top of your game?<br>
3. New content keeps making old content obsolete.  Quick, name your favorite old world dungeon or zone.  Would you still exp there with all the other options now?<br>
<br>
The list could probably go on and on, but I'll stop there.  One of the things you need to realize is that this game is designed specifically to keep you playing.  No matter what crap they throw at you, you slog through it and log on over and over.  There is no end to this game, so the entire point of it has to be to enjoy playing it.  If you're not doing even that, why are you suffering through it?<br>
<br>
Here's my final bit of advice.  Stop playing for one week.  That's it, just stop cold.  IM and message your friends and all, just don't log on.  At the end of the week, see if you feel like you're missing anything, and is this something you can't live without?  If not, cancel the account and tell your friends you'll hook up with them again in some other game.  (Note, stick it out the full week, you will feel like you're missing out on the first two days.  The point of the week is to get at whether the missing out feeling is something you need, or simply the feeling that your usual habit has been interrupted).<br>
