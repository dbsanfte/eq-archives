News to me!</span><hr size=1> Um, I just created an Erudite Wizard on Xev (Vendricus) and I don't know what all this talk is about the wizard class being broken is about, but I'm having a BLAST (hehe in more ways than one).  I've Played, to at least 20, A rogue, A paladin, and a druid, and with the druid I crapped myself when I got my lvl 19 DD that does over 90.  Then, all proud of my destructive capability, I grouped with a wizard and was put to shame by the pure earth-shatterring damage power that that class was capable of.  I have always been addicted to seeing a BIG number come from a nuke (or a BS in the case of the rogue) and what better class to get that fix?  Yes, while grouping with a mage I realized that at lvl 4 my Nuke was only a couple points greater than his, but mr. mage has to think of monetary loss before he zones: he has a pet.  He gets his ass handed to him every level before a new spell circle... he has a pet.  He can get stuck in the middle of nowhere with not a single component to render him useful... he has a pet.  If he goes LD he loses money... we know why.  However, you guys know better than me, if there's some reason I shouldn't bother chasing the dream of being a living GOD (what I view a high lvl wizard as) please let me know and I'll put my stuff on a chanter or a mage... actually, I can never be a pet caster again, to heck with it, I'm gonna follow through on this one... oh to be the guy PULLED TO instead of the guy running amongst the mobs, possibly getting lost/gakked on his way back to the group.<br>
<br>
I am interested in knowing why I should regret getting excited as my future as a wizard, please respond.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours:<br>
<br>

News to me! (long)</span><hr size=1> You havn't played into the level 40+ range yet, so havn't even scratched the surface of the wizard class.  With that said, here's my own thoughts on the class(I'm currently a level 56 wizard):<br>
<br>
First, The class only starts to run into balance issues once we hit level 34 or so, and goes until level 44.  For those ten levels, you can't do enough damage to most Kunark mobs to satisfy the design of the class.  This means we can't do the damage we need to do to do &quot;massive damage&quot; to mobs, and actually do less than many classes.<br>
<br>
Second, from 44 through 50, we are only average for damage output compared with the melees that are running around with items that drop in Old Sebilis and Howling Stones.  We CAN do well in this range, but it's from knowing how to play the class and use the abilities we are given in ways not planned by Verant, not based on the strength of the class itself.  In other words, quad kiting, using rains on single mobs even though they are an AoE type of spell, etc.<br>
<br>
From 51 through 54, this is where most start to get the +mana items we need in order to do well with our class.  The +5 damage/level/cast going from 51 upward is too weak to stand on it's own, and you feel like you just can't keep up with the damage done by the melees with that good equipment.   The way to test this is take a corpse(any corpse), and with a full bar of mana, begin casting draught spells.  How many casts do you get on a full bar of mana.  With fizzles pulling mana, you will get an idea how much damage you will be able to do if resists arn't counted.<br>
<br>
At 55 and going up, the new items you have managed to pick up will finally start to be felt.  At 56 I am able to do 13 casts(without resists) of our draught spells.  This doesn't count resists, but it's a decent number of casts, and this doesn't include mana regen since it was chaincast with no flowing thought items, and no clarity or mana song.  This really isn't bad for damage output since we almost never should cast off a full bar of mana in that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, do we suck as a class?  Hell no.  But can our class abilities keep us powerful without a lot of learning?  No, and that's the problem.  Almost all classes out there can take an unskilled player, and still make the class workable.  An ebayed warrior may not be as good as having a skilled player behind the character, but can still be considered a strong asset.  The same with clerics, and to a smaller degree enchanters, and most of the other classes.  Wizards are the ONLY class that can't do our job based on the power of the class itself, and we feel it.  Doing snares, stuns, nukes, knowing when to overburn to pull a mob off the enchanter or cleric, knowing how to nuke without getting TOO badly agroed so the tanks can't get the mob off you.<br>
<br>
  Those are the skills that make a wizard a very useful addition to groups, but since it IS a learned skill, we need to prove ourselves to be skilled to everyone who doesn't know us.  Knowing the abilities of others in the group is also key to playing our class well, which is why we have difficulties in pickup groups.  If you play with guild members a lot, you get to know how much damage they can do in a given period of time, so you time your casts around the damage of others.  In a pickup group, you don't know, so it's easy to make mistakes while you start to remember that not every rogue has their epic, and not every warrior has a decent damage output(many melees out there DO have really bad equipment).  Because of this, even the best wizard will have bad days when dealing with pickup groups, which hurts the reputation of the wizard class even more.<br>
<br>
So, that's my interpretation of the problems with the wizard class.  It's not that the class sucks, the problem is that the class doesn't stand on it's own strength the way all the others do.<br>

News to me!</span><hr size=1> I recently had an idea,about the classes,This has probably been said many times before.Some classes are simply easier then others,i think the druid class in particular, was designed to be easy,so that less hardcore gamers could play eq and have fun.                                                                 Dont get me wrong i love my wizard,but out of all the other classes ive played,he was in many cases, a hell of alot tougher to play.My wizzy is currently level 52,and im not gonna lie to ya Deverin,there is a reason for all the complaints.                                                                 Im not going to get into specifics about our weakness as a class,thats been done to death.I guess my point is this,to play a wizard you will need to be more resilent then others,because it is a hard road.
