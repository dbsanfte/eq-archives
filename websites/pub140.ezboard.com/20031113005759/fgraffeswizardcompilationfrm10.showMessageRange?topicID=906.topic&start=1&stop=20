However I don't really like the direction EQ has taken the idea of the familiar.  As it stands, it is an animated buff.  Familiars according to fantasy and lore were often animals or beings which were bound to the mage to spy, be an external source, or even to attack, steal etc.  Here is my proposal both for fun and utility to take the familiar more in this direction:<br>
<br>
Make a spell/AA ability to enable you to control your flappy.  We are talking a modified bind sight utility.  This would make your flappy into something similar to Eye of Tallon.  However I propose that you should not only be able to control movement, but also use it to attack etc. (the flappy already has abilities to riposte dodge etc...and since you are controlling the flappy and not your wizard...no increase in wizzie DPS etc because you cannot cast spells as the familiar...)  Now people are going..wait a minute..you want to give wizards a real pet here....hold on...<br>
What I am proposing that unlike a pet, you would completely control the familiar...losing control of yourself till:<br>
<br>
1: Ability wears off<br>
2: You click off the ability<br>
3: Flappy is killed<br>
<br>
Now according to fantasy... when a Wizard was severed from their familiar, or were done with the familiar, it would leave them drained and weak..having severed a bond.<br>
<br>
What I propose for the penalties:<br>
<br>
1: Ability wears off- Sta is completely drained-stun for 10 secs<br>
2: You click off the ability-Sta is completely drained-stun for 10 secs<br>
3: Flappy is killed-You should have sta completely drained, lost all mana and partial HP-agro transferred to the wizard.<br>
<br>
Now as for the attack abilities of the flappy..just have them have the ability of a typical pet/npc of the level the flappy cons..warrior class would be fine.  Keep it's HP the way it is..and allow it to be buffed before (with firetree's etc) before you take control.<br>
Anyone have any other thoughts?<br>
<br>

Also...would wizards retain the ability to tell the pet to get lost (lose the animation) without losing the buff?

Control the familiar-eye of tallon has small duration, useful in many cases only if you &quot;bug&quot; it by casting into a wall to get to remote areas of dungeon.  Since familiar is a persistant entity, would make it much more useful for scouting.<br>
<br>
Hope this is enough of an explanation for your Qaman.  Perhaps now YOU can suggest some interesting &quot;Alternatives&quot; rather than just knocking ideas down.  I have no problem with criticism, just a problem with negativity.  Do a search on your previous posts, you may notice a slightly negative trend. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FLAPJACK</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ...Tell em the 'Teateyz' sent you...<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Nope, but you haven't explained why we need this ability. Or should any class be given any ability just because they find it fun? That seems to be your suggestion.<br>
<br>
&gt;Control the familiar-eye of tallon has small duration, useful in many cases only if you &quot;bug&quot; it by casting into a wall to get to remote areas of dungeon. Since familiar is a persistant entity, would make it much more useful for scouting.<br>
<br>
So because you can bug it, it is more useful than the eye spells we already have? I am still not seeing any need for it. The very persistence thing is something that actually speaks against the suggestion.<br>
<br>

<br>
Given how bad the normal suggestions are here, they are going to tend to be negative.Familiars are already some of the best spells in the game, I don't see why it really needs this to make it better.  And exactly what are 'Alternatives'? This isn't one by any stretch of the imagination. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If you were talking about Mez, Charm, Healing, Slow or something, I'd agree with this statement.<br>

We are talking about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Voice Graft</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, right up there with Bristlbane's Bundle in usefulness.  It is a spell with the entire purpose of being fun.<br>
<br>
In this case, the answer to &quot;Why?&quot; is &quot;Because it would be fun&quot;, and that should be sufficient.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So because you can bug it, it is more useful than the eye spells we already have? I am still not seeing any need for it.

He's talking about the Eye spells we already have being buggable.<br>

However, depending on what the developers consider unbalancing in the respect of scouting abilities, this could bear some looking into.

<br>
Gotta watch the little flamey there, but even if Qaman does not have any suggestions, I do.<br>
<br>
1. Simply make Eye of Zomm, or god forbid it's upgrade, Eye of Tallon, last for 30 minutes. Give it Voice Graft if you just wanna wig out newbies with the talking eyeball-- was great fun with my skeleton back when I lurked in newbie zones with my Necro...<br>
<br>
2. Enhance, Nerf, or leave as is the familiar line.  Making it anything like what a familiar is in most fantasy is giving us a pet, and most don't want that.<br>
<br>
3. I can come up with tons of usefull ideas to add to the group desireablilty of wizards without increasing our solo skills.  Most require a rework of the rather poor spell engine that EQ seems to be saddled with, but a few are very doable:<br>
<br>
---3a.  Damage Enhanceing Debuff. Spell cast on the mob that does extra damage per swing or spell to the mob.  Ups the DPS of the group without significantly hitting the wizard's solo ability-- melee hit alot more often and would benefit from this more than any caster.<br>
<br>
---3b.  Fire Within.  1 min duration, 10 min recast, 15pt mana regen that stacks with everything else.<br>
<br>
---3c.  Fire/Ice/Magic DD proc buffs.  Again, helping melee far more than any caster, and upping group DPS without significantly altering solo DPS.<br>
<br>
That's just 3 ideas off the top of my head.  Not all would agree with them either, but there they are, enjoy. <p><br>

<br>
And I disagree. Just because it would be fun is not a sufficient reason to do anything.<br>
<br>
&gt;He's talking about the Eye spells we already have being buggable.<br>
<br>
Except, they are only buggable in some zones. And these are not zones in the last few expansions. <br>
<br>
&gt;However, depending on what the developers consider unbalancing in the respect of scouting abilities, this could bear some looking into. If us being able to bind with our familiar and see into the far reaches of the zone is in some way exploitable, you have a point that we should not have this. If it's not exploitable, and frankly I can't see what the harm would be, then the reason we should get an ability like this is the same as above: Because it would be fun.<br>
<br>
Of course, if they thought all that, you would think that Eye of Zomm would last 6 hours too. Just because you can't see any harm that could come from it doesn't actually mean any ability should be granted merely because it is fun. <br>
<br>
&gt;1. Simply make Eye of Zomm, or god forbid it's upgrade, Eye of Tallon, last for 30 minutes. Give it Voice Graft if you just wanna wig out newbies with the talking eyeball-- was great fun with my skeleton back when I lurked in newbie zones with my Necro...<br>
<br>
There are actually reasons why these only last as long as they do, and not long at that. And no, I'd rather not explain them, but a long lasting one would be pretty useful in some places.<br>
<br>
Anyways, some of your suggestions are good, but they are really fit better with other classes, Enchanters in particular. Make sure the suggestion really fits the class and isn't just an ability another class has with a new name. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
As far as being able to see far into a zone without risking death and dismemberment being useful-- I don't see a problem with this.  So long as your not using it to pull a boss to zone-in without adds or something similarly screwy, I don't have a problem with its being <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>useful</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I'm just shooting for Non-exploitable here.<br>
<br>
To that, I have to ask what's the big deal if a wizard gets to see some content that is further back into an area than he can reach?  Didn't you ever get the urge to look around a zone, especially a dangerous and cool looking one?<br>
<br>
Because it's fun is why I played the game.  It's the only reason I ever considered for doing anything in game, and so long as the content is not exploited or unfair/unballancing abilities granted, because it's fun is good enough reason to do nearly anything they can stick lore to within game.<br>
<br>
As to my 3 suggestions above--<br>
<br>
Clerics get a Reverse-damage sheild.  I've always thought this to be a very odd class to have such a thing, and anything that damages a mob is fair game to an offensive class like wizards in my book.<br>
<br>
Enchanters might grumble about a spell like inner fire going to anyone but them, but I don't recall anyone electing them as all-powerful gods of mana regen either.  One of the biggest problems the game has is the huge amounts of downtime involved, and the miniscule number of classes that can alleivate it.<br>
<br>
Some Hybrids get proc buffs-- The bard's is pretty much useless, and everyone elses I believe are self only.  An actual damaging proc buff that was castable on others is certainly within the perview all the offensive casters, and depending on the lore you stick to it, enchanters too.  There is no reason why a wizard could not put 'an aura of fire' around someone that lashed out with their attacks to damage the mob.<br>
<br>
None of the suggestions are, In my opinion, outside the perview of the wizard class.  In the light that Wizards need something, in more peoples than just myself's opinion, to make the class group friendly that does not enhance their solo ability, I believe these fit the bill. <p><br>

<br>
No. It begs the question of why have different classes if you are just going to assign all spells to everyone, even just the fun ones. That is why 'because it is fun' is not a good enough answer to do it.<br>
<br>
&gt;As far as being able to see far into a zone without risking death and dismemberment being useful-- I don't see a problem with this. So long as your not using it to pull a boss to zone-in without adds or something similarly screwy, I don't have a problem with its being useful. I'm just shooting for Non-exploitable here.<br>
<br>
I know you don't. But there are uses for it that help with making some things a lot easier in various places.<br>
<br>
&gt;To that, I have to ask what's the big deal if a wizard gets to see some content that is further back into an area than he can reach? Didn't you ever get the urge to look around a zone, especially a dangerous and cool looking one?<br>
<br>
See my previous answer. Also, the intent is for you to fight to see those cool and dangerous places really, not experience them vicariously. Getting there the hard way is a lot more fun to most people.<br>
<br>
&gt;Because it's fun is why I played the game. It's the only reason I ever considered for doing anything in game, and so long as the content is not exploited or unfair/unballancing abilities granted, because it's fun is good enough reason to do nearly anything they can stick lore to within game.<br>
<br>
So only your idea of what is fun and balanced counts? There are many different views.<br>
<br>
&gt;Clerics get a Reverse-damage sheild. I've always thought this to be a very odd class to have such a thing, and anything that damages a mob is fair game to an offensive class like wizards in my book.<br>
<br>
Not really. We have our set of limitations, and that descriptions is much too broad of one. For instance, we have zero DoT spells, we have no Poison/Disease based damage, we don't get strong pets, we don't have strong DS.<br>
<br>
&gt;Enchanters might grumble about a spell like inner fire going to anyone but them, but I don't recall anyone electing them as all-powerful gods of mana regen either. One of the biggest problems the game has is the huge amounts of downtime involved, and the miniscule number of classes that can alleivate it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, but giving mana to others is really the niche of Enchanters and Bards. Your ideas tend to blur class lines, something that really goes back to the 'Why have different classes?' if you are going to give pretty much everyone the same abilities. Classes really should be more defined, not less.<br>
<br>
&gt;Some Hybrids get proc buffs-- The bard's is pretty much useless, and everyone elses I believe are self only. An actual damaging proc buff that was castable on others is certainly within the perview all the offensive casters, and depending on the lore you stick to it, enchanters too. There is no reason why a wizard could not put 'an aura of fire' around someone that lashed out with their attacks to damage the mob.<br>
<br>
Actually, that describes something Enchanters were actually supposed to have.<br>
<br>
&gt;None of the suggestions are, In my opinion, outside the perview of the wizard class. In the light that Wizards need something, in more peoples than just myself's opinion, to make the class group friendly that does not enhance their solo ability, I believe these fit the bill. <br>
<br>
Rather see something new, rather than just a variation of something already in the game really. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I would not assign all the spells to all the classes.  However, there's only 6 slots in a group, and there is going to be overlap no matter what if grouping is to be balanced instead of catering to a few.<br>
<br>
Every class should have a focus, but that does not mean that a given class can't do something as a secondary function that another class does Primarily--and probably better.<br>
<br>

Please forgive me, I'm not as Uber as you.  If you could give an example of just a single situation where being able to see far into a zone is actually overpowered, as opposed to useful, we could put this point to rest.<br>

Where did I say, or even imply, that only my view counts?  I happen to believe that stuff thats in game strictly for the purpose to being cool should be available for all to enjoy.  Voicegraft never killed a mob, ever.  It's just a little addition that's fun for those that have access to it, and no harm to anyone.  I'm beginning to believe you actually do just like being negative and confrontational.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not really. We have our set of limitations, and that descriptions is much too broad of one.

<br>
We have no DoT spells, but they could be justified if we did get them--we could set things on fire easy enough, and especially appropriate if they work like disease dots with a large initial hit and then dot damage thereafter to simulate a blast of fire.  Necromancers, Shaman, Druids, and Enchanters all get decent dots, and yet have fair DD to go with it, to one degree or another.<br>
<br>
Lore says we manipulate energy- Fire, Magic, Ice.  Giving us disease and poison would be outside of current lore for wizards.  However, I could see justification for a wizard Disease based as a quest for Bertoxxulous wizards, or poison for Inny/Cazic worshiping ones.  I doubt it would happen as giving just some wizards extra resists would cause a revolt and endless infighting, but it could be justified.<br>
<br>
We don't have strong pets, but we do have them.  They are very secondary to our main line-DDs, but they are there.  That's the kind of thing I suggest, Xuzl nor the familiar so much as scratch the pride of a Beastlord, Necro or Mage.  You call this making all classes one apparently.<br>
<br>
Strong DS is another thing I lump into the weird design decision from VI.  Why they decided to give the guys with the Floating rock a really good DS too I'll never understand.  From a balance perspective, they get their own personal tanks, and a good DS too--seems a little off.  From a concept perspective, Wizards should be manipulating energy this way at least as well as a mage, at least in my opinion.  This is neither here nor there however, except that a good DS could easily be given to wizards within the lore of the game-- and that they don't get it was a class balance decision, which means the process I outlined seems to be working fine here.  They thought about it--see Okiels Radiation.  They decided it would be to powerful later on combined with our other abilities, and decided to remove them--notice the lack of additional DS's till the expansions.  It was stated by Abishai back in the day that they left O'Keils to help younger wizards, but that they would not continue the spell line due to balance reasons.  Since then, they have made the line kinda like a little sideline of Wizards.  Sad, considering it takes up valuble spellbook space on 2 different expansions, but there it is.<br>
<br>

<br>
True, Enchanters, Bards, and Beastlords currently have the manaspells, but none of these except KEI at &lt;30 allievates the problem of downtime in game.  They do enhance what you can do in combat since its a persistant regen effect, and they would still have that distiction and still be greatly desired for it.  <br>
<br>
My suggestion is an effect that is currently not in game.  A spell that would refill 50%+ of your manabar within 30 seconds so long as you were sitting, and nothing attacks you in that period of time-- a True downtime reliever, and not useful in combat.  It could be combined with a hate increasing effect to insure that sitting near a hostile mob will get you attacked and therefore end the spell for further balance.  The current closest effect to it in game is Mod Rod and the Necro Subversion line-- you may notice that neither of those classes is a Bard or Enchanter.  <br>
<br>
It would make wizards desired in groups (good thing), allieviate downtime (good thing), not help with soloing except to do it more often (good thing).  Seems to me it fits in a needed area pretty well on a class that's not underpowered but does need some group friendly utility.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Actually, that describes something Enchanters were actually supposed to have.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree, it would work well to simulate enchanting weapons as well.  In fact, they do have it with 'Boon of the Garou', which allows a lifetap proc--slapping Necromancers squarly in the face.  Game Lore states that Werewolves were creations of Necromancy, and Lifetap is surly the signiture spell of the class. But I digress.<br>
<br>
There is no reason the line could not be shared, and even made stackable, as wizards would do so through 'auras' and enchanters would do it through 'enchanting weapons', and for that matter, the existing line for Necromancers and Shadowknights could be extended to include targetable buffs.  But you would see this a blurring class distinction as well.<br>

<br>
I've seen them. The spell engine really has pretty much zero to do with this though. They are different games, they way they handle classes is different, which is what this issue boils down to. This being EQ, you should apply your answer to this game, what others do is somewhat irrelevant. Your view is basically, anything can be justified, and therefore should be done if someone, somewhere, might find it fun, regardless of any class differentiation issues. Mine is, even fun spells should actually fit the class and even fun spells should be balanced appropriately. And both of those apply even more to spells that have more functions inside the game. You view this as a negative stance, but it isn't. It just doesn't match your idea of fun, but you don't seem to like much difference in classes either. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
It's not just the spell enging, but the entire gameplay that is superior in both games, your right on that score.  They don't really handle classes differently though, with the exception of point based character development.  This is an entirely different topic though, I was just pointing out that anything you'd accept as 'new' apparently must not exist anywhere in any form in eq to begin with, and therefore new is going to be in a different game, as it does not appear to be possible to suggest something new using eq's current set up.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping I'm wrong though, and I'm still looking foword to your suggestions of something new and balanced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your view is basically, anything can be justified, and therefore should be done if someone, somewhere, might find it fun, regardless of any class differentiation issues.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wrong, and no where did I say this.<br>
<br>
What I have said is that so long as an ability can fit the classes role, makes sense in game, and is balanced with the other classes.<br>
<br>
For instance, Wizards are an offensive casting class that manipulates Fire, Magical Energy, Ice and Lightning (basically energy) to achieve their effects.  They are also masters of translocational magic.  Other sidelines include very minor damage sheilds, instant mana, stuns, and informational spells.<br>
<br>
To this end, Wizard spells should be:<br>
1: Damaging to the Enemy<br>
2: If not damaging, does it match a sideline?<br>
3: Based on the manipulation of Fire, Ice, Force or Lighting<br>
4: Should exist in game lore as reasonable spells that a wizard would develop--this is the easiest part.<br>
5: Be balanced for the game and against the abilities of the other classes.--This is the hard one.<br>
<br>
As a further point, any highly useful or core grouping ability should be spread out among no less than 3 classes as the game stands right now.  This is due to the number of classes in game as opposed to the number of group slots available.  The lack of this foresight on sony's part is what creates the phenomenom of the 'Holy Trininy'.  <br>
<br>
So, let's take for example a Poison based Nuke, one of your suggestions that you'd thought I'd find reasonable.<br>
<br>
1. Damaging to the enemy- Yep<br>
2. Based on Fire/ice/magic- no<br>
3. Explained?- yes, it's only for those who worship cazic.<br>
4. Balanced?- I'd say no, and don't do it, unless as a design decision similar quest spells were given to all classes.  This would then erupt in a huge war over who has better quest spells ect... and be too much bother to actually do.  Balance is the real deciding factor here.<br>
<br>
Now my ideas-<br>
Damage Adding Debuff<br>
1. Damaging- Yep<br>
2. should be based on Ice imho<br>
3. effect is ice shards being driven further into the victim<br>
4. Balanced?-- I'd say yes.  It meets a need in the game, the issue of wizard group utility.  It's a damaging utility, so wizards are in their primary role. It does not help wizards solo overmuch, as the efficency of such a spell goes down with the fewer participants in the battle.  Does it infringe on other class's role?  Clerics do get a similar spell, but it's hardly their primary focus.<br>
<br>
Inner Fire<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(just realized this is a level 1 shaman buff, it needs a name change)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
1. Not damaging<br>
2. Does match a sideline- that of instant mana<br>
3. Based on the manipulation of magic.<br>
4. Sets up a much larger harvest effect, but easily interupted.<br>
5. Balanced? I'd say so.  Again, it meets a need in the game, that of alleviating extreme enforced downtime- Melee do not suffer this same lack as instant healing spells are found on several classes. Wizards already get a similar effect that is self only, and extremly limited- as such this line should be shared as it's a sideline, and mana regen lies as a specialty of other classes--those classes do not have the need for group utility however, nor do they specialize in instant effects.  No one else recieves an effect like this, closest spells are the subversion line of Necromancers, Mod Rods, Cannibalize, and Harvest-- all of which differ not only by the magnitude of the mana gain, but also in the respect that they are usefull in combat.  It also would probably be necessary to disable this effect in raid areas, as getting out of combat in a 60 player vs. 1 mob fight is pretty easy.  If it's not disabled, it needs an effect to attract an aggroed mobs attention--disabling would be better due to aggro list size.<br>
<br>
Proc Buff<br>
1. Damages enemy<br>
2. Fire/Ice/Magic of course<br>
3. Firey aura that occasionally burns the creature-basically an offensively used damage sheild<br>
4.Balanced?  For Wizards, perhaps not.  A line like this rightfully belongs to Necromancers, who get the first proc buff in the game, and Enchanters, as the effect lends itself more to enchanting weapons-- enchanters do not need more group utility however.  The reverse damage sheild effect is probably better suited for the same purpose this spell would serve in a wizards arsenal.  Also, buffs are not a wizards area.  In short, it would not hurt, but alternatives are better.<br>

<br>
I agree that spells should fit the class, and that even fun spells should be appropriatly balanced.<br>
<br>
Where we seem to disagree is on what constitues balance for a purely fun spell.  Under what circumstances is a spell like Voice Graft balanced?  Given the effect, I'd say its appropriate to anyone that controls a humanoid type NPC.  Thus, Enchanters could make charm victims say anything they wanted too, Necromancers can speak through the dead, and Wizards could use their familiar as a messenger.  Pre-Luclin, mage pets were only very remotely humanoid, and I'd rule it out-- with the new graphics however, I'd say they are fair recipents too.  Shadowknights get the effect through a weapon, which is appropriate given their far lesser mastery of the dead.<br>
<br>
On long lasting eye type scouting spells, there may actually be a balance issue.  It has uses with Eye of Zomm, It could be used to check on spawns, it can be used to remotely aggro creatures with pets which if they don't have social aggro will be single pulled.  However, do these issues make it Overpowered, or just useful.  I vote useful, as the existing eye spells can be used for these too, and thoughtful zone design can cancel the one factor that would make it dangerous--that of remote aggroing.  It would actually enhance the usefulness of COH without increasing the current problems with the spell.  You can check spawns with a ranger, camped non aggro toon, or just bugging the current eyes if your bored, depending on zone.  You can just make any mob that should not be coming alone have guards that aggro with it.  <br>
<br>
If there's another issue with Eye spells, I can't think of it.  I see a long lasting version as useful, fun utility.  If being able to look around has a more serious issue associated with it-- for instance content that gives you limited time to solve a puzzle in an area or else mobs aggro-- then perhaps it should be downchecked, but otherwise it seems fine, balanced and reasonable to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And both of those apply even more to spells that have more functions inside the game. You view this as a negative stance, but it isn't. It just doesn't match your idea of fun, but you don't seem to like much difference in classes either.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I agree, balance on spells that actually do effect the core gameplay need very close scrutiny.  What I found negative was the apparent attitude that if the class did not currently have the ability, then it does not belong on the class.  How any new effects can be given out with that viewpoint I don't know, and explains why every suggestion is met with condecending scorn.<br>
<br>
What ideas you may have that don't match my idea of fun I wouldn't know.  So far you have shown no positive input on the thread whatsoever, only came in to shoot down and deride those who did have suggestions.  Negative is as Negative does, if it looks like a duck, where there's smoke...   I just call it like I see it.  That's why I have repeated asked for reasons things are unbalanced, and suggestions from you on what you feel would be.  I'll take the bad with the good, but getting some good would be...fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I believe I have amply demonstrated that I do like distinct classes.  That distiction is not found in the game mechanics however, but in the focus of the class.  <br>
<br>
One class can nuke with the elements, another the power of their god--and that's fine.  The supporting elements will come in with resist rates/types, reletive size of the nukes, and secondary abilities of the class. Both nuke, and the effect is mechanicly the same, but the flavor is different.<br>
<br>
This is born out better with the examples of the games 3 main tank classes. Warriors survive by sheer hitpoints, Shadowknights augment their hitpoints with taps, Paladins augment their hitpoints by stuning and healing.  In xp situations, the classes are for the most part interchangeable, with an edge going to the hybrids due to spell aggro.  On those that do large amounts of damage quickly, warriors are superior, as the augmentation abilities of the other 2 are not as useful against burst damage.  Each has a niche which in theory makes them optimum in different circumstances-- though poor game design in many cases reduces the usefulness of the differences, as mobs, especially common mobs, are not that different from eachother. <p><br>
