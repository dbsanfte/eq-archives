<br>
Anyway, does anyone have any leads concerning the new step? I know Tanik has been spotted in EW, but he always seems to despawn/move before I can get there. Actually, since hes a rogue he is probably just sneak/hiding to &quot;scout&quot;. I was wondering if anyone had successfully approached Tanik though, and what was the result?<br>
<br>
On a side note, any clue to the Kromrif Death Squad? Two of these guys have been jumping people coming out of Kael, triggered when you pass the outer gate (&quot;You have been ambushed by Frost Giants!&quot;). They can hit for at least 125 and run faster than boots. In fact, I was levitate/boots on/strafe running and I still couldn't stay ahead of them for long (levitate + hills saved my ass for a lil while). A level 54 with SoW was apparantly able to stay ahead of them though, and zone into GD. They might have also been using the hills to make there (I stupidly ran straight, and there weren't that many or big of hills). They don't spawn for everyone. My level 34 Wiz friend who had never taken a giant faction hit, but should be kos as a high elf, could pass in and out undisturbed. Whether this is because he has not killed giants or because of something else I do not know.<br>
<br>
They are blue to a 54. I didn't have the opportunity to test it but my guess is they are between 45-50.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulordbug.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordBug</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/15/01 6:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duties of the Crown Quest</span><hr size=1> I built up enough nerve to make the Kael run to WL last night (I wanted my damn key <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I saw that message.  Didn't think anything of it cause nothing hit me.  I switched to an outside view, and sure enough, there they were.  Blue to me at 51, just as fast as SOW (cast on me by a 56 ranger).  They never caught me, but I think they caught a dwarf running into EW from Kael (oops). <p><BR><BR>

As I was visiting in a lowly secondary and there were only a few of us standing around, none of us got the nerve to ask him about the help he wanted (in fact, I'd just finished helping another friend with Tain and the 4th? ring). Shortly after arriving, Tanik said it was too dangerous for him to stay in one place and depopped, stating to search for him when we can provide assistance (sorry, I don't have the logs available at the moment).<br>
<br>
Anyway, the two Seekers said that he appeared beneath one of them and when they moved, they got a humorous message along the lines that you've discovered something beneath you.<br>
<br>
Just tossing some more info, I expect we'll have a complete story soon. Oh. A couple minutes later the death squad appeared and immediately took out a wiz and was hot on the tail of a friend's 36level druid. He was in wolf-form and barely out-ran them (took a few hits initially). I, being a bard at the time, had no problem outrunning them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uiueelyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iueelyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/15/01 11:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duties of the Crown Quest</span><hr size=1> Someone posted this to my Guild List this morning.  No idea who wrote it but &quot;THANKS&quot; who ever you are.<br>
<br>
Tanik is a triggered spawn<br>
<br>
head to eastern wastes and the kael ramp. the way to trigger him is to run up and down the kael ramp. (worked best for me when i ran zig zag). he spawns down towards the bottom of the ramp and is laying on the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;hail Tanik Greskil&quot;<br>
Tanik Greskil says &quot;Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last<br>
surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody<br>
Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was<br>
barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly<br>
hurt and need your help.&quot;<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;i will help&quot;<br>
Tanik Greskil says &quot;Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return<br>
home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.&quot;<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;what velium vapors&quot;<br>
Tanik Greskil says &quot;Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you?<br>
Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one.<br>
I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep<br>
from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
so now you have to run back to thurgadin. Frundle can be found in one of the three buildings across from the paladin guild (near the library).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;what velium vapors?&quot;<br>
Frundle Frenkler says &quot;Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all<br>
you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a<br>
velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this<br>
jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;what velium vial?&quot;<br>
Frundle Frenkler says &quot;I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly<br>
it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards.<br>
Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality<br>
firing sheet.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
she will give you a 4 slot purifier. it is a container, so you will need an open inventory slot.<br>
<br>
now you need to collect your ingedients. go to CC. everything you need is there. hunt the miners up top for the small pieces and small bricks of velium. then drop (make sure you have lev!) down to the bottom, run through the dorf town, and into the hall with the velium crawlers, spiderlings, and webmasters. the spiderlings die in one nuke (68<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . the crawlers die in one nuke and one ES dot (688+300=around 1k HP). webmasters are tougher and i avoided them. in about an hour, i had a stack of these and gated out.<br>
<br>
head back to thurgadin. go in the bank. the vendor on the very left sells crystal shards and HQ firing sheets. buy 2 crystal shards and 1 HQ firing sheet.<br>
<br>
go click on the pottery wheel in the bank. put the items in like this:<br>
<br>
crystalline silk<br>
crystalline silk<br>
crystalline silk<br>
glass shard<br>
glass shard<br>
small brick of velium<br>
<br>
do not stack the silks. also, even though all other pottery i've done always requires a water flask, do not use one. i tried and it didn't combine. so NO WATER FLASK! i'm around 100 in pottery and it was not trivial.<br>
<br>
you will get an unfired velious vial.<br>
<br>
right next to the pottery wheel is the kiln. combine the vial you just made with a high quality firing sheet. this will produce a velious vial. it was trivial at 100.<br>
<br>
<br>
now, open that purifier box that you got and put in the vial, and 2 small pieces of velium. make sure they are not stacked.<br>
<br>
small piece of velium<br>
small piece of velium<br>
velious vial<br>
<br>
hit combine and you will have a vial of velium vapors. this looks like it can be used by characters as well. it has one charge of &quot;thurgadin gate&quot; and apparently will gate you to thurgadin, although i didnt try.<br>
<br>
<br>
now run back to eastern wastes and find tanik again. give him the vial of velium vapors and he will thank you and then poof, leaving you a note to deliver to loremaster borannin. go back to thurgadin and turn your woven shawl along with the note to loremaster borannin and you will get faction and your shawl will be updated.<br>
<br>
******Need a pict with stats please***********<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  good luck<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. WORDS OF WARNING! when trying to make tanik pop, there is a chance that instead of tanik, you will trigger the kromriff death squad. this is a group of very nasty giants that have high MR (even after my group debuffed him, i couldn't land a snare). they also run at nearly sow speed. if anyone has ever fought warden bruke in EW, it's like having a handful of him all spawning on you at once, except they have more HP and see through invis. our group (ranging from mid 40s to 50s) had trouble killing one. we finally succeeded and got a nice large class only woven vest (18 ac, 10 str and some other attributes). my friend had between 8-10 spawn on her at once. she got a message of &quot;you have been giant ambushed&quot; and they killed her in seconds. i took a screenshot of the dead one we killed if you need proof...but i don't lie. so be careful<br>

<br>
As far as combining the items in the Pottery Wheel, this appears to go trivial right around 120. It was trivial at 122, but not at 115, so the trivial point is between those 2.<br>

I was just doing the quest for fun, but it isn't worth dying for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udiomedes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diomedes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/21/01 9:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shawl and Note</span><hr size=1> I agree - thats serious BS. I was working on this quest last night and finally got the patience to assemble all the required pieces to make a vial.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I got the deathsquad spawned on me and barely made it out using jboots. Yeah, I guess I was lucky. You can run as fast as the giants IF you strafe run - this kinda makes nagivating impossible though as its hard to see where youre going and next to impossible to steer.<br>
<br>
Anyway, while strafe running I had the external camera on and was was holding the forward and left arrows - I ended up making a huge arc towards the orc fort, minor course adjustment not to run into the walls then I directed myself into the hills there. For any who dont know, hills work to your advantage - mobs seem to move slower over them - well the arc ended up getting me close to GD zone and the quantity of hills there allowed me to put some distance from the deathsquad - so I made it to zone (much to my surprize).<br>
<br>
I basically made a choice - try and run or try and gate - seems I was lucky to chose run and have some fortune with my strafing - my channeling is pretty good, but I was 99% sure that 6 giants beating on me would be too much to channel through.<br>
<br>
My advice is to get a sow - jboots saved me, but without substantial luck I would have been toast <p><font face="verdana" size="2">[60 Sorcerer] <b>Diomedes</b> (High Elf) -The Vagrants- ZONE:ezboard<br>

<br>
Have a buddy make an Ogre that worships Rallos and get him to Kael and bind him there. Then, have this expendable character run around trying to spawn the dwarf while you wait nearby with your vial at the ready. If the Giants pop, would they even attack him since he has good Giant faction, or are they more like a trap in that they'll attack whoever sets them off? If they DO attack him, then no real loss. <p>Zwobu &lt;Trade Foundation&gt; Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udaeanorendarion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daeanor Endarion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/22/01 11:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duties of the Crown Quest</span><hr size=1> I was there the other night and someone triggered the death squad - I think they insta-killed him, since they all seemed to stay at the bottom of the ramp. There was a 60 warior hanging out near the top of the ramp, and I'm not sure what he did, but they came up to where he was without attacking him. Then the silly wizard got too close and had a nie death squad train to GD <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

First there is no risk to die if you have SoW form 50+ person so get it all other is in my eyes suicide.<br>
And another thing i had to trigger altogether 4 times and i noticed a difference between first three times and last time when i trigered the Dwarf.<br>
First 3 time i was invisible all times Death Squad spawned<br>
Last time i was visible Dwarf spawned. That might be coincidence (hope thats right word) but maybe thats the trick can anyone confirm that or can say it was really only coincidence?<br>

P.S. That was in my Eyes up to now the easiest part of the Quest. Took me inclusiv learning Pottery less than 4 hours.<br>
