However, over time, the number of non-twink melees effectively disappears as melee items flood the economy and stay there, barring someone destroying them or having them on their character when they close their account. Both are uncommon occurances.<br>
<br>
I agree that a large portion of the solution is items. Unfortunately, the bounty of such items in SoL hasn't shown up yet, unless there are level 40 critters dropping Evocation +5 percent DAMAGE items, which I haven't heard of at this time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 4105<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 8:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> gear and balance.</span><hr size=1> I dislike the idea of equipment being used to balance Wizards and fill the gap in.  I dislike it a lot for several reasons.  You see, melee is doing the damage they do by using their innate skills, disciplines, and items they would be using in any case.  Adding new items requiring an equipment/inventory slot used up for the Wizard would have to be some sort of really nice INT and ac/resist item or they will be supplanting something we would otherwise wear (this opposed to simply a weapon which the melee would use anyway).  In addition, equipment requires drops, and Verant's history on caster drops hasn't been truly sparkling (particularly for Wizards) so I am not inclined to trust them to do this.<br>
<br>
The fact is, lowering the mana cost as you suggest, lowering the casting cost and aggro as I've said over and over and over again would accomplish the same thing without requiring gear.  Casters use spells to do their duty, adding in a new line of wands and such (stock in trade of ANY rpg but EQ's attempt at being one) would require not only additional work and addition to the game with drops and such, but change the entire paradigm the game is designed around.<br>
<br>
What paradigm is this?  Casters use spells and abilities, melee uses equipment.  The game is basically structured around this.  Yes, melee now shares our abilities and spells in items and has free disciplines, and we have to have certain gear to survive and compete so its been muddied (mostly in melee side) but the situation still stands.<br>
<br>
Fix our spells and we'll do what we should.  Require gear and SOME of us will have a shot at maybe doing what we should - at a price the melee doesn't have to pay.  Remember there's three reasons we can't just rip out the damage already and that's mana, time, and aggro.  Fix THOSE problems, and you have wizards functioning better.<br>
<br>
That was the whole point of my &quot;why do Wizards do well on raids&quot; thread - to show that what makes Wizards liked and powerful on raids is what could be done to make them better in normal hunting.  What was proved and demonstrated over and over in that thread was just what I said above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uetnu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>etnu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1087<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 8:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: gear and balance.</span><hr size=1> Grimm, if caster items were upgraded AS A WHOLE (i.e. every commonly used main hand item has a useful effect / mana regen bonus on it) it would effectively work the same way as melee items do.<br>

At the time Eelyen and I wrote the &quot;The Document&quot; the changes you proposed were proposed back then and got no love. Now that you have done the mathmatical research and shown others, they are getting more respect.<br>
<br>
So maybe all your hardwork will pay off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like Whizbang said, peoples views change. I remember when Whiz and a few others did not want Eelyen and I discussing twinks in &quot;The Document&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am praying your logs and letter will get more attention than our previous document. Just want to comment on a few things...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;I've long thought that sit agro is stupid...&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
*Cough* Take out the word 'stupid'. It might offend them, causing them not to read the rest of the letter and just eye glance the rest of it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;As for reduction on the cast times on the Velious Quest robes... this is sort of a &quot;well, duh!&quot; kind of suggestion.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Not as bad as 'stupid' but pretty close ...the &quot;well, duh!&quot; part.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not that I don't agree with you (b/c I do), but wording like that just might offend them. Might want to proof read it.<br>
<br>
Also, if you want an example of what a level 30 something Monk can earn with a tad bit of ambition can have, go to this profile :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45681">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...?num=45681</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Link didn't work for me a min ago, so I will list out the important items...<br>
<br>
Mudman Enforcer - 1hb 8dmg / 20dly (primary)<br>
Cane of Harmony - 1hb 11 dmg / 25dly (secondary)<br>
Silvir Chitin Hand Wraps - 22% haste ...paid 4k for them<br>
<br>
Owned these by level 34.<br>
<br>
Most of the money was earned while XP hunting with groups and soloing in Crystal Caverns. He probably has around 10k worth of items on him and the important thing is... he is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not a twink</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
The profile shows him at level 35 I believe, but he is really a fresh level 39. All of his melee skills are at 195. If you want me to, I can parse his damage or send you the logs. I can do both soloing and grouping if you want. <p><p align="center">

However, I have one observation.  None of this actually takes into account how much damage is being absorbed by the Tanks.  Tanks have an outrageously useful ability at taking damage without flinching.  Most of the time their extremely high AC evades and absorbs the hits.  If they get low on health they can get their wounds bound up to half health very cheap (something we cannot do with our mana.)  This ability to absorb damage should not be given to them for free.  If you keep the average damage per second equal among all classes and allow tanks to have this ability to absorb damage for free, then everything becomes unbalanced in favor of melees.<br>
<br>
In constrast to what many think, melees are not supposed to have the best damage over time figures.  They are supposed to have the best damage-evade-and-absorb figures.  Their main use is not to deal out damage, but to protect others in the group while these others do the damage.  Imagine how much more useful Wizards would be in an xp grind group if tanks could stand their all day getting pounded on, but only did tiny amounts of damage.  They could kill most anything alone but it would take a couple years to do it.  This is how the game should be balanced.  Tanks should be absorbing damage and should rely on others to inflict 90% of it.  Wizards should be inflicting damage and should rely on others to absorb 90% of it.<br>

Replace &quot;melee&quot; with &quot;Tank&quot; and that statement becomes true.<br>
<br>
Rogues, Monks, and Rangers are not TANKS. by any stretch of the imagination. They are there for long term damage output.<br>

A wizard and warrior should do similiar damage over time if you ask me, since warriors can tank, and wizards have other utility + the ability to do quick burn downs. <p>Etnu Phyresoul, serving Solusek Ro since March 2000.

A couple problems I see though:<br>
<br>
1) They will NEVER allow medding while standing unless there is a special condition, such as you cannot be moving or you have to be grouped with 3 or more people. <br>
<br>
2) They would need to find a new way to implement the items you suggested, the existing quest/drop system would be obsolete. <br>
<br>
The Velious robe statement I completely agree with, the casting time is entirely too long. As for the Vermillion Orb of Torrefecation, it would be nice if they moved it to Karnor's and/or Sebillis. The Drolvarg Captain would be a good place for it, or the basement. <br>
<br>
Otherwise it looks very good. <p><P align=center>

Can your spreadsheet account for new servers as well?<br>
<br>
Remember, on new servers lammies and fungi's do not exist but our spells are just the same. It takes a great deal of time for even yaks to filter down the chain. I would think, then, your model would retain wiz dmg line but have rogues\monks\warriors a some lesser value: similar to wizfix.htm?<br>
<br>
I also think verant will take issues with the wiz+item graph as well. If you could describe how often this item would be used it would be clearer, but I dont think they want wizards to be standing up right clicking a robe all day long. <br>
<br>
Personally, I like the idea, wizards were never really gear dependent and thus, boring for raid encounters imho. All in all, thanks for doing the math work  <br>

Unfortunately, utility spells are nowhere near as useful as being able to stand there and take a beating without flinching and running away.  Utility skills/spells should not be used to balance battle skills/spells.  Each group should be balanced separately.  You can give warrior classes utility skills to balance ours.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Rogues, Monks, and Rangers are not TANKS. by any stretch of the imagination. They are there for long term damage output.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I agree here.  Rogues and monks should be able to do a great deal of damage to non-magical creatures.  Magical creatures should be the realm of casters however.  Rangers should get special bonuses that allow them to do extra damage, hide, sneak, move quickly, etc. when in outdoor zones.  They should be weak warriors when fighting in indoor zones.  They are rangers after all.  Their specialty is the wilderness.<br>

First, I should note that even if Verant does the unthinkable and implements all of my suggestions verbatim, and 400 wizards sign off on it, it will prevent some wizards from being unsatisfied with their lot in life. Some believe that mana should outdamage melee in all circumstances. I should make it clear that my goal is not to make wizards happy, but to provide a more level playing field (ie: balance) which will encourage wizard grouping.  Note that this point is not directed at any particular individual. Honest!<br>

Thanks for the encouragement and the comments. Perhaps &quot;stupid&quot; is too strong a word. Perhaps I should substitute &quot;gay!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The &quot;well, duh&quot; comment makes a bit more sense if you run the robe through the spreadsheet, where you'll find that it *reduces* wizard damage output. A wizard will do better meditating and nuking than trying to use this POS. Every wizard knows this, whether they have the robe or not. Even so, I'll take your comments under advisement, and will likely make a change <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also... for the twink issue.  It is trivial for saavy melee characters to acquire decent gear without any foreign cash infusion. I started a new ranger on another server to play with some newbie friends. By level 6, by harvesting and selling bat wings and bone chips, I had earned enough to by a Frozen Longsword (7/27) from another player. This is not godlike, by any stretch, but for a level 6, it roughly doubled my damage output from rusty. There simply is *no* wizard equivalent to this.<br>
<br>

Actually, in the FAQ I did touch on the value of melee tanking ability. My contention is that melee tanking ability is roughly as valuable as the wizard's utility spells (snare, evac, stun). Some will say more, some will say less, but calling it a wash sure makes the comparisons easier. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uetnu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>etnu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1104<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 9:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> No, utility vs. tankage is a fine balance. If you give warriors our utility then you break down class differences even further.<br>
<br>
By utility, I was referring specifically to:<br>
<br>
Snare<br>
Stun<br>
Root<br>
any other combat &quot;utility&quot;<br>
<br>
Not ports, not translocates, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for new servers: While Lammy's and fungi tunics won't be in the game on twinks for several months, NEITHER WOULD THE NEW ITEMS!<br>
<br>
The vermillion orb wouldn't be held by a level 20 wizard, nor would the lammy be held by a level 20 warrior.<br>
<br>
As the server matures, and that level 20 wizard got to level 60 and had himself a VP robe or whatever, that warrior would be level 60 with primal and whatnot.<br>
<br>
Then the level 20 warriors would have lammy's while level 20 wizards had vermillion orbs.<br>
<br>
Seems perfectly reasonable to me.... <p>Etnu Phyresoul, serving Solusek Ro since March 2000.

<br>
My first suggestion would be to make clear somewhere the point that this is wizards as a damage dealer.  Perhaps at the start you could say something like:<br>
<br>
Assuming that the pure defensive needs of a group are covered; such as, but not limited to, the common foundation of cleric, warrior, and enchanter; we can compare the overall damage dealing ability of a wizard to the overall damage dealing ability of a melee without worrying about secondary abilities.<br>
<br>
{Edit: Utility can be included here, but I think the FAQ adequetely addressed the direct comparison of utility to tankage}<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Note that full burn damage could use some adjustment as well, given that full burn rate for a wizard at 60 is 150 dps,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  h) Ah that reminds me. Wizards are the best at *fast damage*. Does your model account for that?<br>
Well, no. I do have two point to make on this however: First, melee weapons have advanced to the point where they are able to achieve 50% or better of the damage rate of a wizard on full burn, which means 2 tanks will &quot;burn down&quot; a mob as well or better than a wizard. Second, the value of this skill is really reduced by the mezmerize skill. Burning down adds with fast damage or AE would seem to be the obvious case where variable damage is needed, but when you are engaging mobs one at a time, the difference in the damage rate becomes a much less useful skill. Make this skill more useful in more circumstances, then we can talk.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am curious how you came up with the full burn numbers listed above, and whether aggro was taken into consideration.  The number appears accurate to me, but ask because as a 55 mage completely ignoring aggro, I've managed to get as high as 180dps in 9 seconds with rains+nukes+pet on a level 40 mob.  In normal situations, the number is considerably lower because 180dps start to finish on an xp group mob is almost always going to draw aggro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  l) Won't this make wizards even better in raids, where they don't need any help?<br>
Well, yes. I haven't done a full analysis on this, but preliminary analysis has seemed to indicate that while wizards do very well against boss mobs currently, the performance gap is not as great as most believe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I also might mention that the right click nukes would have little effect on boss mob encounters except for absurdly long fights.  This would also make wizards feel a little less useless when they empty their mana into a mob that manages to channel complete heal anyway.  Also, I would note that already, the primary limiting factor on raids is aggro, not mana.<br>
<br>
Also, sorry if this isn't considered &quot;constructive&quot; criticism, but I would run this through a spell checker before sending it anywhere.  There aren't too many mistakes, but I think there were enough to be a little distracting.<br>

<br>
Yes, but that wasn't my point. The melee dmg curves changes depending on prices on the server. If better weapon devalue, it is easy to increase their dmg with gear intended for the high end game, on the other hand, Force Shock always does 179 no matter what. I was inferring what the curves look like in the absense of high lvl people /shrug<br>
<br>
Adding right click nukes to the game doesn't affect the low lvl game too much, either. Why you ask? Because of level limits. Jbb, for example, doesn't work till 46 and likewise, i would gather the orb wouldn't either till some more appropriate level.<br>
