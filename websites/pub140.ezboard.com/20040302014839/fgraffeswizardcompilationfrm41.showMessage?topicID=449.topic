<br>
Last night I tried to fix up everything after the patch, and I logged in and everything was working fine, but it kept saying some of my UI files were outdated and I should try to use the default skin instead. I didn't notice anything wrong, so I kept playing with my UI and ignored the error message.<br>
<br>
I checked UIErrors.txt just now to see what the problem was...<br>
<br>
The file was 105 MB. <br>
<br>
Several times (about 10) every second, I got the report:<br>
<br>
UIFiles\Dynamite file could not be found in UIFiles\Dynamite\.<br>
<br>
What could be causing that? I couldn't even begin to read through the file (I've never had a document lag my computer before). I'd really appreciate some help if anyone has any ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxum>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Dark Elf Admirer<BR>Juju Incantatrix</span><br>  Posts: 1750<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/11/03 4:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UIErrors.txt</span><hr size=1> That file is remade every time you log in, and probably appended every time you zone, so log completely out of EQ, then log back in, sit down and camp, then go check the file.  It should be a reasonable size.

<br>
That's the only error in there. It came after a slew of warnings that xyzfile.xml couldn't be found in directory UIFiles\Dynamite and it would use the one from the default directory.<br>
<br>
Following the error:<br>

I've just realised that the loot window I'm using - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=46.topic">Remelio's Loot Window</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - has been updated for yesterday's patch.

Going to compare the default animations file to the one I have in there now to see what's different... though it shouldn't be anything other than the mod changes, really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteshortfuze>Dynamite Shortfuze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/11/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UIErrors.txt</span><hr size=1> Alright, my animations file is EXACTLY the same as the one from the default folder with TWO exceptions:<br>

2) I am using <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=262.topic">Yaxa's Compass</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and with this last patch, window_pieces04 (which was the compass file) has become the song buff window, so I renamed the compass file (window_pieces04) to window_pieces041 and made these changes to the animations file:<br>

That seemed like it belonged to the song window, so I left it alone.<br>
<br>
Sooooo my animations file should be just fine. So what's causing the UIErrors file to keep generating 10-20 warnings every second? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxum>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Dark Elf Admirer<BR>Juju Incantatrix</span><br>  Posts: 1757<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/11/03 9:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UIErrors.txt</span><hr size=1> You said you have a modded loot window... did you add the following info?

For the 30ish seconds I was in EQ, the file got to be 221KB large.<br>
<br>
It won't let me post the whole thing here (too much text), so I cut off most of it. Pretend the same thing keeps happening over and over for a few hundred more lines of text.<br>

See, that last period after the Dynamite directory has something to do with this, i've never seen it append a period like that.  Did you check your character's ui ini file to make sure the skin name is named correctly?  Did you try issuing the /loadskin command?  Do you have any other skins installed that do work correctly?<br>
<br>
At this point, i'm really not sure what's going on, so take this with a grain of salt, but this is what i'd do.  I would save my custom files into a backup directory, and i would set my character's ini to load default, and i would delete the skin directory Dynamite, and load EQ.  Make sure the default loads correctly and check that error file.  If that skin works correctly, then i'd attempt to rebuild the Dynamite directory, of course adding only modified files, and then load the skin with the command line version of the /loadskin command.  Maybe even rebuild that directory one file at a time to see if i could narrrow down the problem.  If the default causes this same weird error string, i'd delete the default skin as well and redownload those files from the patcher.<br>
<br>
I'd also see if this problem occurs if you don't use the modified animations file you made, perhaps there is a syntax error in it?  I dunno really, just trying to give you ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteshortfuze>Dynamite Shortfuze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 435<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/13/03 3:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UIErrors.txt</span><hr size=1> Well, I rebuilt the whole UI and narrowed it down to the compass that was causing the problem (which I should have figured to begin with since that's what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tried to fix on my own...).

I opened the new .tga, selected the new buttons for the song bar for the window selector, and copied that info into my custom .tga.  Had to clear a space out of the alpha channel for it.  It really isn't neccessary to do at all if you don't use the window selector, but i like to keep up with my mods.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteshortfuze>Dynamite Shortfuze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/13/03 3:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: UIErrors.txt</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=246eb53af46006136a508e57402b84a3&amp;threadid=5345">Found one</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->... kind of.
