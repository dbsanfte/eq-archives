Glorious purple swirled with the orange clouds of sunset, reflecting in periwinkle and soft blue and coral on the snowy expanses of the Easter Wastes.  The gold-armored elf smiled, relishing the space and the solitude.   &quot;Too bad I'm not a druid,&quot; she thought wryly to herself, &quot;or I could hunt here by myself.&quot;  She glanced at the column of white smoke which marked the fort's location, and resumed her trot toward it.  A cleric needed a group for a successful hunt, and she hoped to join one there.<br>
<br>
She saw motion off to her right, and gazed at the dark spot on the snow intently.  Even traveling in the wastes was dangerous for her.  The spot resolved itself into a speedy halfling, no doubt a druid, and Seyah relaxed.  Then she paused again, for the druid was coming toward her, and she could sense the cheery burbling laughter before she could hear it.   A smile of welcome lit her face.<br>
&quot;Merwyn!&quot; she cried.<br>
&quot;Hail, Seyah,&quot; Merwyn said, the formality of the greeting incongruous with the enthusiastic hug that accompanied it. <br>
&quot;What brings you here, Mer?&quot; asked Seyah, returning the hug.   Merwyn was easily 10 seasons her senior, so she doubted the druid had been hunting in the area.<br>
&quot;I am headed for the Crystal Caverns,&quot; said Merwyn.  &quot;I need a crystalline belt, worn by the ry'gorr inspector.  I'm hoping to hunt him and capture it this evening, if I can.  Want to come help?  Krushh is meeting me inside, and he is always happier with a *real* healer.&quot;  Merwyn winked at Seyah, then her merry features went thoughtful.   She brightened. <br>
&quot;Hey!  Didn't I hear you had learned a new level of spells?&quot; <br>
Seyah's face fell, thinking of the disaster of the night before. Uthorks chasing her as she ran to the safety of the ice bridge, killing her mage friend, the monk yelling at her.  But, she had turned a season, and by the grace of the new spell Resuscitate that she had learned, she'd been able to restore the mage.  The monk, well, she intended to avoid him.  Soberly she looked at Merwyn, and said &quot;Aye, I have learned many new and powerful magics, no doubt to botch up with.  Can't Jiori come to heal Krushh?&quot;<br>
Merwyn cocked her head at Seyah, puzzled by her reticence.  &quot;Nay, Jiori can't come.  Besides, who better to botch up on than guildmates?&quot;  Merwyn grinned winningly.<br>
Seyah started to grin back, then had another thought.  &quot;And Krushh?  Has he bathed?&quot;<br>
Merwyn had obviously decided that Seyah was coming, even as she put forth objections, because the halfling was wiggling her fingers and pulling the shrouds of spells down over Seyah's head.  Spirit of Wolf.  Some kind of invisibility.  Skin like something-hard.<br>
&quot;Bathed?&quot;  Merwyn laughed.  &quot;Ogres don't bathe.  But don't worry, Crystal Caverns is mostly too cold for smells&quot;  <br>
She set off across the snow and Seyah followed her reluctantly.  She'd learned Complete Heal with her other new spells, and her trainer has said it was mostly for warriors, but had given her not details on when to use it.   As she and Merwyn skipped past the orcs and into the cavern entrance, she shivered.   It was her responsibility to keep the warrior alive, and she was nervous.<br>
They pattered quietly around a bend in the tunnel, and found Krushh waiting.  Seyah began to cast the multi-colored buff spells she always used on warriors.<br>
&quot;Hail, Jiori,&quot; Krushh greeted her, and Seyah glared at him.  Behind her, Merwyn laughed, still invisible.  <br>
&quot;Nay, Krushh,&quot; she said, &quot;Seyah.  SAY-UH.  Look at her armor.&quot;<br>
Seyah gritted her teeth as the ogre bent over to look at her closely.  He didn't look at her armor, however, he peered into her face.  Seyah was surprised by the spark of recognition she saw in Krushh's eyes.  He straightened up.<br>
&quot;Baff,&quot;  he said.<br>
Seyah coughed, suppressing a grin, but she couldn't keep the twinkle from her eyes.  He remembered that, did he?<br>
Krushh looked around inquiringly.  &quot;Boom-wizzie?&quot; he asked.<br>
Merwyn laughed her merry halfling laugh again.  &quot;No Laenyel today, Krushh.  Shall we get started?&quot;<br>
The three of them began to move down the rocky passages and Seyah fretted to herself about complete heal.  It was a complicated spell and took a long time to cast.  It also soaked up a lot of mana.  Krushh must know about it, since Jiori undoubtedly used it, she thought.  Her nose turned up at the thought of consulting with an ogre, one of Norrath's stupidest races.  A little voice nagged at her.  If you wanted to be the aristocrat and sneer at the low lifes, it said, you could have stayed in Felwithe.   Look at your guild tag.  Seyah looked at the badge of the Adepts.  She had sworn to be a good cleric.  Resolutely she lowered her chin, and composed her words so she could keep the conversation short.  In the plainest common she could muster, she said<br>
&quot;Krushh, I have just learned the complete heal spell.  When is best to cast it, on you?&quot;<br>
They paused to kill an orc, and Krushh glanced sidelong at Seyah as he quickly dispatched it.  She ducked her head to hide her blush.<br>
&quot;Two bubs.  Before berserk,&quot; he replied.<br>
Merwyn had been leading them along rocky passages, and now they came out into a massive icy cavern, opening below them with ice bridges going across and the openings of other tunnels visible.  Seyah gaped as she looked up and around.  The ice hung in beautiful cascades, bluish white in the diffuse light.  Merwyn paused, tracking, and exclaimed, &quot;He's here, somewhere!  All we have to do is find him.&quot;  <br>
She scampered across the bridge in front of them and disappeared into the tunnel on the other side, coming out on a ledge below.  Krushh lumbered after her, and Seyah came cautiously behind.   The ice bridge was slick.  Sliding into the tunnel, she hurried to catch up.  Merwyn was working her way slowly across the ledge, and checking her direction.  An orc came out of a side passage and headed straight for Merwyn, its pick raised.  Krushh unceremoniously bonked it on the head, and as the dazed orc turned, he finished it with a couple more blows.<br>
&quot;They'll get slightly more challenging as we get lower,&quot; said Merwyn.  She disappeared into another passageway, and Seyah again struggled to keep up.  Emerging onto another ledge, she clambered over a rock, missed her footing, and began to tumble down the side of the cavern.  She landed, amazingly, on her feet at the bottom, and froze in place.  <br>
&quot;What does a ry'gorr inspector look like?&quot; she asked softly.<br>
&quot;He's carrying a pick and wearing a wide belt,&quot; said Merwyn, &quot;why?&quot;<br>
Afraid to move even her lips too much, Seyah murmured &quot;He's standing here with me&quot;<br>
&quot;Where are you?&quot; Merwyn queried anxiously.<br>
&quot;I'm at the bottom.   I fell.  He doesn't see me.  Yet.&quot;<br>
Immediately she saw Krushh come out to one of the openings above and across from her, and jump without hesitation to the floor across from her.  The belted orc began to attack him, and Seyah breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
&quot;You two don't know how to travel,&quot; said Merwyn, and Seyah heard the dim sound of a spell being cast above her.   She was concentrating on Krushh's health signs now, waiting for two bubs.  the red line crept slowly down, and as it reached the second demarcation, Seyah began the spell, weaving the blue strands as she had been taught.  As she raised her hands and eyes skyward, waiting for the spell to land, she saw Merwyn floating down to them.  <br>
She smiled at the clever Merwyn, but her smile faded as orcs began to boil out of tunnels and jump from bridges, trying to catch the descending halfling.  Soon a half dozen or more orcs crowded the floor of the cavern and several more could be seen running down.  Seyah didn't even notice the success of her new spell, as Krushh continued to pound on the belted orc.  Merwyn landed and was set upon by several, and Seyah could see only the glow of spells and smell the singed hair of the orcs.  <br>
Merwyn's health looked good, so Seyah returned her attention to Krushh.  The belted orc was down, and a cluster of orcs was now keeping the ogre busy.  He would need another heal soon.   Again she started at two bubs as instructed, but was horrified to see that now Merwyn was losing health fast as well.  Seyah gritted her teeth, hoping Merwyn could heal herself until the spell landed on Krushh.  With growing horror she saw Merwyn start the blue healing spell twice, only to be interrupted.  Her friend collapsed just before her own spell was complete.   Merwyn had killed two and had probably damaged others, but as she fell, the orcs she had been fighting ran to Krushh.   <br>
As Seyah's spell landed and the battered ogre was returned to full heath, the orcs furiously looked around for his healer.  Spying Seyah, still standing where she had landed across the room, they ran to finish her off.<br>
Seyah barely felt the blows as the desperately tried to think of how to survive.  Their only evac'er lay dead at her feet.  The exit was high above her, and she would never find it.  She became aware that now she was losing health too, and Mother Tunare knew she wasn't going to be able to kill many orcs with her pitiful weapon skills.  Mother Tunare!  Seyah raised her arms heavenward. <br>
&quot;Mother Tunare, grant me your Divine Aura!&quot; she exclaimed, and instantly she was surrounded by a white-gold light the orcs could not penetrate.  They turned to resume their attack on Krushh.  Seyah ran to hide behind the ogre's large back, knowing their only chance for survival lay in Krushh's two hands and her ability to keep him standing.  <br>
He was turning now, frowning with concentration, hitting each of the 7 or so remaining orcs in turn, until they were all roaring with anger and furiously focused on him.  Seyah realized suddenly he was taunting them off her.  All of them.  As the divine light faded from around her, the orcs were too angry with Krushh to notice her.  Another orc fell, and another, and Krushh turned his semi-circle again, baring his teeth at the orcs.  She kept her back to the rock wall, making her hand motions in miniature, and restored the warrior to full health.  It looked like they might defeat all the orcs after all.  Cautiously Seyah dropped to her knees and sat back on her heals to meditate.  For several more minutes they continued, Krushh taunting and hacking, Seyah crouched medding and healing between.  Then the last orc fell, and the only sound was the heaving of their own breath. <br>
With an effort, Seyah defocused her eyes from Krushh's health signs, and looked at the pile of corpses around her.  Orcs lay sprawled all over the floor.  <br>
Krushh wiped his sweaty brow on the back of his leather gauntlet, and turned to look at her in inquiry.  Looking up to meet his gaze, relief washed over her.  They had lost Merwyn, but restoring her would be easy since they were still alive.  And what a huge pile of orcs they had slain, together!  Aristocratic prejudices forgotten, Seyah grinned at the ogre in triumph.<br>
Krushh's eyes lit with a return smile, then he glanced upward and looked back at Seyah, his expression serious.  <br>
&quot;Guud fun.  But next time, let Krushh jump first.&quot;  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/useyahmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeyahMT</A> at: 8/1/02 12:50:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/urokkenmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RokkenMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/30/02 5:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tales of the BHE:  Let the Ogre Go First</span><hr size=1> your stories of the BHE make me smile , and laugh so hard , it brings tears to my eyes , I anxiously await the next installment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>[60 Grandmaster] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=927" target="new">Rokken</a>
