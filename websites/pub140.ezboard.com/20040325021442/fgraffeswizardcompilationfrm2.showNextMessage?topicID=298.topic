Here is a Few Facts about the 5th Shawl and the 6th Shawl I learned and will be able to help you and maybe shave some time off of this long quests. At the bottom I'll post the text from the NPC's for these quests.<br>
<br>
First go to Rexx Frostweaver and say 'what prayer shawl?' he will hand you a Bile Extractor to assist you with this quest.<br>
<br>
For the 5th Shawl you need 5 Glowing Wurm Bile, and 75 Threads. I recomend u get the Bile before you get the Threads first so as u collect the threads u can combine them. <br>
<br>
The Bile is a Random Drop off Shardwurms. I got 3 of mine from Young Shardwurms, and 2 off elders. My char is a level 60 Ench and it helped to offer Buffs in exchange for looting rights on the bile. BUT the good thing is that Young Shardwurms droped them and they was relatively Easy kills. So fast Turn around cause of it<br>
<br>
The Thread is Droped off of Cystal ONLY Spiders in Vek's Lab. There is 2 places I found where they spawn at alot. On the Bottom Floor there is a spot in the back that has 3 spawn points. EVERYTIME when they respawn they are Cystal Spiders. So with those 3 spawn points you ALWAYS will have a chance of getting a thread. The Second place is WAY UP TOP, and I mean ALL THE WAY up top there is a spot where like 7 spiders spawn. 100% of the time it was Cyrstal spiders. You can camp just under where they spawn and pull the top 4 floors easy with a range spell. Can't really pull with bow's or throwning objects. Also 2 rare spawns spawn around there &quot;Crystal eyes&quot; and &quot;Something Fang&quot; we got gloves  a face mask 2 +25 mana +25 hit points&gt; off the 2 rares. For me PRE PATCH I camped there for 112 hours over a period of 8 day's to complete the 5th step. Yes I knew that they was upping the drop rate on the 30th, BUT I also learned how EASY it is to clear out the spider area. Just my team on the first floor could keep the first 5 floors cleared without a prob. So when EVERYONE goes there after the patch that place is gunna be KS city. So I personaly wanted out of there before that accured. <br>
<br>
To Combine this stuff here is how it happens. In a codian Tailor kit combine 5 spider threads to make a crystalline silk fiber. You then place 3 Crystalline silk fibers into the bile extractor that Rexx Frostweaver gave to you when u started this quest with the Shardwurm Bile this will make glowing crystalline silk. 5 glowing crystalline silk's + your 4th shawl will create the 5th Shawl. Also, if u fail you WILL get your 4th shawl back . I completed this step with the Skill of (12<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Tailoring. The 5th Shawl was Trivial at (12<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Now for the 6th Shawl. You need 1 Woven Giants Beard, 2 Siren Hairs, 2 Manticore Manes, and 2 Drakel Dire Wolf Whiskers.<br>
<br>
First go to Betti Frostreaver and say 'What embroidered prayer shawl' she will hand you a pattern that is used for the 6th step.<br>
<br>
Next go to GD near the Wizard Spires near Eastern Wastes zone and kill the Wolfs that pat around there. Most of the time you'll find someone killing them for faction with the Codian. It's a simi common drop but is No Drop. While your killing those Wolfs /Auc your buying a Woven Giants Beard. It is Lore so most of the time someone will let you loot one off a giant or will give you one if they sell it to you the common price is about 50 plat for one. I got both whiskers in about 20 mins and the beard during that 20 mins. Also you can sometimes find a beard on a merchant they sell for about 130 plat.<br>
<br>
Next zone over to Eastern Wastes this is where a Tracker is helpfull. You need to hunt down 2 Manticores and hope they drop there Manes. The Manticore Mane is dropable so you can purchase one if your lucky. Or find a merchant selling one, I had to hunt for mine. Manticores roam the entire zone but are most common near the Great Devide zone area but are still simi uncommon to find normally only 2-3 are up in the whole zone. Out of the 6 I killed I got 4 manes. Took about an hour to kill 4. BTW these are blue to a level 49. And, was a hard Fight for my Ranger that is really twinked up. Easy if your planing on kiting it since most of the people that are doing this quest are casters.<br>
<br>
Lastly, killing Sirens. Head or Gate to Colbolt Scar. There is 2 main areas these are at that I know of behind the Skyshrine ramp down at the waters edge you can see 3 from above + 2 in the water a little bit deeper. And near the Sirens Grotto Cave underwater there is 4 guarding the cave. These are NOT Fun. Bring a group with you if you can. But always remember your friends will turn on you FAST. These things are Enchanters and will Charm your friends and turn them on you as well as nuke you hard. So it makes pulling hard for them. Charmed my level 60 War friend and 57 cleric friend and both railed me in about 0.23 sec's haha. They killed it but still OUCH. I camped them in both of their locals and found the spot near the Skyshine ramp to be easier to pull/kill. Killed about 18 of them and got 8 Hairs off them. They also drop a Necklace that has 5 charges of enduring Breath. Also got a bard horn off another.<br>
<br>
Now that you've collected everything you need place the beard 2 manes 2 whiskers and 2 hairs into the kit. Will make Thread. Now place your thread 5th Shawl and pattern your got eariler and combine. Will make your 6th Shawl. If you fail you WILL get your 5th shawl BACK . I failed on the First attempt but Made it on the 2nd attempt. Succeded on BOTH thread attempts. The First time I only collected enough items for one attempt not planing on failing. Took me about 3 hours. Failed then went around and recollected the items and got them back in less then 2 hours. The BESTEST thing that happened is I skill improved when I made the 6th Shawl so im now at (129) but my skill was (12<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  making them.<br>
<br>
I hope this post will help you guys out doing this quest. Understand I type about 35 words a min so this took awhile for me to post to help you guys out. But I learned alot doing this quest and wanted to share my info. I do recommend that you start doing Vek lab Now before the 30th cause that place is going to be a mad house after the 30th. While camping in Vek I never saw anyone in there Hard Core camping the spiders like I was and all the people I spoke to was &quot;Waiting till the patch&quot;. Im scared to think what that place is gunna be like. Enjoy and have Fun with these Quests.<br>

[Tue May 08 16:28:58 2001] You say, 'how can i further advance my reputation with the coldain?'<br>
[Tue May 08 16:28:59 2001] Loremaster Borannin says 'Noggwin ! Thank Brell you're here. I was <br>
about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik <br>
acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and<br>
I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must<br>
advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to<br>
fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow <br>
his direction carefully. <br>
[Tue May 08 16:31:06 2001] You say, 'what prayer shawl?'<br>
[Tue May 08 16:31:07 2001] Rexx Frostweaver says 'Gather five strands of crystalline silk thread<br>
and combine them in a sewing kit to make a crystalline silk fiber. Take this container and<br>
combine a glowing shardworm bile with three of the fibers to form a piece of glowing crystalline<br>
silk. Five pieces of glowing crystalline silk sewn to your fur-lined shawl will yield a <br>
beautiful silk shawl. Become a master in the art of tailoring before risking all you've worked<br>
for and be sure to let me inspect your work when it's complete. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
You say, 'am i worthy?'<br>
Rexx Frostreaver says 'To ensure your worthiness you must continue to refine your prayer shawl. Speak with my wife Betti regarding the embroidered shawl ad listen carefully to her words. Hurry now, there seems to be a sense of urgency about.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What embroidered prayer shawl'<br>
<br>
<br>
Betti Frostreaver says 'It will be an honor to assist you in fashioning an embroidered shawl. It is a very demanding product and i can see from the look in your eyes that you desire to burn your sewing kit in our furnace, but if you persevere, your effors will be richly rewarded. When you are ready you must carefully weave a spool of sacred Coldain thread. Take the thread, this pattern, and the silk shawl and carefully embroider the pattern. The result will be most exquisite. Please show me if you manage to create one'<br>
<br>
You say, 'What sacred coldain thread'<br>
<br>
Betti Frostreaver says 'Take a woven frost giant beard, two sire's hairs, two manticore manes and two drakel dire wolf whiskers, and combine them in a sewing kit. The resulting thread will enhance your shawl's power when embroidered in a special pattern.'<br>

I helped fasia doing this in velks and some in other zones (she let me help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I can say that it was very tedious, but the upside is that if you do it near your lvl, it can also be great xp camping the various things you need to camp (spiders were great xp till 51).<br>
<br>
just wanted to say grats fasia on completing a very difficult quest!<br>
