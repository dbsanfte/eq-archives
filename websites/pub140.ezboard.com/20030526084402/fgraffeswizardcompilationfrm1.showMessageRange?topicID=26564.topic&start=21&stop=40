Oops, too late. Double over.<br>
<br>
I would like to see some Dev-player talks. Every company has them before a game goes live, but never afterwards.  Pick Mods from around the player boards, and have the Mods ask questions that were worked on on each of the class boards.  This lets you VISIBLY talk to the players.  I think this would be an excellent first step.<br>
<br>
Second, I think that RIGHT NOW you need to have a better dialog with end-game players. Perhaps a dialog with the Leaders(or whoever the leader chooses) of guilds that have gained access to Plane of Time.  I think its fairly obvious to the Dev's that many people are not having fun at the end game of PoP, I think this needs to be addressed immediately.<br>
<br>
As someone who uses /feedback constantly, it would be nice to get some sort of feedback sometimes. I often wonder if doing a /feedback actually does anything, or if it just gets ground filed.<br>
<br>
Also, if you want to make a new expansion/zone/feature, HYPE IT!<br>
You want people to be going &quot;wow, the ___ is really going to be cool&quot; But make sure you follow through on stuff. EQ players are becoming jaded, if you tell them &quot;this expansion is going to have the most bestest storyline ever!&quot; they're going to laugh.  Finish some of the other storylines, and maybe they will be interested.  Heck, a lot of them could probably be slapped into some in-game books, and then run a scripted event.  <br>
<br>
You don't need to advertise something for players to be excited.<br>
<br>
So basically: <br>
* More &quot;thank you for your contrabution&quot;<br>
* More *VISIBLE* talking with players<br>
* Hyping<br>
* Following through with promises (like storyline)<br>
* Fix the End Game. It's currently not very fun, and only a few encounters have been fun since Velious.<br>
<br>
Now, I know many people may ask why Sony should take care of the 1% end-gamers (althought I think the number is closer to 15%). It's simple, at least to me.<br>
<br>
The End Game represents the Mythic Quests of the great Hero's that many of us hope to follow.  They provide inspiration for everyone else.  When these people start saying the game sucks, a lot of people are going to take it seriously, whether it's true or not.<br>
<br>
Raph Koster has a large article he wrote with some very good sources to back him up. If you want your game to be successful, make the Hardest of the Hardcore Gamers leave the other games, and play yours instead.  I don't think I need to point out what is happening to the Hardcore gamers in EQ.  They are looking for anything to play except EQ.  This means that the competition only has to come up with a game as good as EQ. It doesn't have to be better.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daeanorendarion>Daeanor Endarion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.monmouth.com/~dhawthorne/everqst/picon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 991<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 7:03:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26564.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.monmouth.com/~dhawthorne/everqst/ppic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> I agree in part with some of the burnout comments - but I don't think it's that simple. My wizard is 62, and is flagged for PoV, PoS, and the Factory. Yet I hardly play him anymore. Why not? There is no reasonable xp outside of the flag zones I just mentioned. I doubt increasing the mob range you can get xp with is going to help, because it will almost certainly still be a miniscule amount of xp compared to those places. Yet, all those mentioned have room for, at the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a half dozen xp groups. I can play 2-3 hours a session, maybe 4-5 days in a week, I think that classifies as a casual player. I can't sit for 2 hours in those flagged zones waiting for a group opening except on weekends, and often there is a guild raid or event that requires my presence then. A wizard is good to have in a group most now recognize, but not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>required</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. A heavy tank, healer, and slower, however, are. Most groups will jump for an enchanter as well even if they have the other areas covered. That leaves 2-3 &quot;extra&quot; slots for whoever can get filled in. So the LFG wait with limited demand and limited opportunity can be very long. I have not been so frustrated since when my wizard was 20, and my only options were HK and SK. Then I learned to solo. Now, I just don't care for soloing, it's boring. I'm burned out on it, and I can sit in an IRC chat just as easily as sit LFG and get the same out of it. What exactly is my motivation to play the wizard a lot?<br>
<br>
I started a Frogluk paladin. I got him to about level 12 before that got dull. I leveled my Vah Shir Beastlord to 48, and I have a lot of fun with him still. So the burnout is mostly related to my main character - and frankly, if I have to give up on the character I spent more than 3 years delevoping, it takes a lot of the joy out of getting anywhere with another class. And I anticipate the BL will burn out too once he hits 60 or so. It's the high end where the burnout comes.<br>
<br>
Too much is geared towards raid forces and those who can play 6-8 hours a day. It has made it inordinately difficult for the rest of us to advance. No reward, no motivation = burnout.<br>
<br>
A perfect example of this is a thread in the Spells Discussion area where someone complained there was no level 60 &quot;skin&quot; spell. He was told his epic effect filled that gap. Well, the guy doesn't have his epic, because he has not been able to get a VS kill. For people who are on 6 hours a day, and have Elemental Planes capable guilds, VS is no problem. It took me a year and a half from the time I got my Gabstik staff to the time I finished my epic for the sheer dumb luck of having enough friends on at the time VS popped to go in there and get him. Killing VS is not by any means trivial for a guild that has only 3 clerics over 50, and none over 60. It can be done, but it can't be done at the drop of a hat at any given time - with 6 other groups racing to get the same mob who have more resources to draw from. Yet, people are all over this poor guy for not having his epic and telling him he has no excuse not to have it at level 60. That's the mentality, IMO, that is killing EQ right now - &quot;if you can't play 40 hours a week, you are a loser.&quot; Few actually say that, but it's the message that comes across. And we are burning out beating our heads against the wall because essentially, we like the game - but we can't progress anymore without giving up our lives to EQ. <p><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">function stat_on(){self.status="Click for Magelo profile"}</script><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">function stat_off(){self.status=""}</script><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">function show_url(url_txt){newWindow = window.open("http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=" + url_txt)}</script><table><tr><td colspan = 2 align="center" style="filter:glow(color=#cc0000); cursor:hand" onClick=show_url("23437") onMouseover=stat_on() OnMouseOut=stat_off()  strength="1"><font size=2 color=#ffff00 face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Daeanor Endarion of the Rathe</font></td></tr>

<br>
     I don't think Everquest was on the &quot;back burner&quot; when Luclin was released. Luclin was released months too early, because there was unfinished content. That means customer satisfaction is on the back burner, because you want to make Christmas release money, and that's inexcusable.<br>
<br>
    Timesinks are deliberately put in this game to cover yourselves for early release dates, Luclin in the form of the VT/Acrylia key quests, POP in the form of the Rathe encounter which was unbeatable until recently. <br>
<br>
     Just releasing a future product with finished content, even if a little later than the release date planned would show people that you not only care more about them than your pockets, but would also be a huge step towards proving you respect the playerbase.  <p>Sage Flintnilf Ironori<br>

To respond to Absor, im gonna have to agree with alot of people out there, even though im spending $40 bucks a month for it, GM service and people who respond that can actually help you is a huge boost in confidence.

The players think that they have set EQ on the back burner.  No amount of &quot;we added more developers!&quot; or &quot;we swear, we really care!&quot; is going to matter, unless the players believe it is true.

You were around when Luclin was released, and there were no horses, no bazaar feature, no new interface, a lot of things that were supposed to roll out with release that were hyped but in fact, didn't make it.  Nevermind the nasty time sinks to keep players from reaching content that wasn't finished yet.  Nevermind that you took nearly two years to put in Inner Acrylia after some poor bastard guild keyed up for it and then you decided it wasn't tuned and took it away with more promises you didn't keep.  <br>
<br>
When Pop was in the works I clearly remember the lack of info about it in the press releases, and this was apparently deliberate because you didn't want to make the same mistakes with Luclin, ie. put out unfinished goods.  Well, look at the Rathe encounter and PoT.  This is 6+ months after release.  You learned nothing from Luclin. Fool us once, shame on us.  Fool us twice, shame on you.<br>

<br>
1)Bring back full time GM support for every server<br>
2)Don't release an expansion until it's done.  <br>
3)Compare the quality level of any of your unfinished projects to other games on the market, regardless of genre.  The bar needs to be raised as high as possible.<br>
4)Quit kowtowing to powergamers.  If you guys bend over backward for FoH it'll send a message to everybody who doesn't play their style of game.  We all have complaints about the game design we'd like to see addressed but most of us don't have a big guild and website to use as leverage.<br>

Wanna tickle me though?  <br>
<br>
1) Makes Combines possible by stacks. <br>
2) Skill ups in tradeskills at the high end require FAR too many combines and expense... its getting old. <br>
3) Increase research rune and spec/rune drops.<br>
<br>
and because LFG is now becoming a very very very real problem ...<br>
<br>
4) Make the new solo possibilities actually give decent XP.  Extending range means jack if I still have to go to the few overcrowded place in POP to EXP because the others arent worth the effort. <br>
5) A new pillar spell and a longer lasting atols.  Level 62ish.<br>

However, it is fast becoming a realm of the wait and see mentality. <br>
<br>
Some things that could and should be fixed are tradeskills. My god, in order to level up you need find some very rare, seldome dropped items in the hope you don't fail the combine? For some people, doing tradeskills are fun, or were, but are now becoming so mind-numbingly boring as to say screw it. <br>
I like the idea of stackable combines. Not to mention that very few zones have all the store-bought items, going from one zone to another to obtain store-bought items is dumb. <br>
<br>
But all in all I think what is slowly happening is that people are just getting bored with sitting for ever, doing the same thing with virtually no movement forward. Solo exp zones getting fewer and fewer. Ridiculous timesink quests that take weeks or months to finish, can anyone say Phinny's staff? Having to battle that fish dozens of times just to get that drop is very poor planning. <br>
<br>
I have enjoyed this game for 3 years, but the last few months have pretty much sapped my want to play. Groups are few and far between, soloing is the same. I hope you guys win out and surprise us, but frankly the history pretty much speaks for itself. <br>
Band-aid fixes to apppease the masses. <br>

Epics are timesinks and 'hard' by design. In original ads they were said to be for those few who want to put time in. They weren't meant to be the standard issue gear.

<br>
One of the biggest flaws in EQ design is that &quot;time&quot; somehow equates to &quot;hard&quot;.<br>
<br>
This is not the case.  I would gain MUCH more satisfaction out of having an appropriately levelled challenge for my group or raid or whatever and getting my epic over the course of two or three days without impacting anyone else's ability to do so, than I did out of killing phinigel and venril several million times, all the while denying other wizards shots at their epic because the spawn was dead.<br>
<br>
Vspacing actually permits the content designer to design something that is &quot;hard&quot; for X people, and to give a reward based on that fact, instead of assuming that people will bring X-squared people to the encounter to trivialize it.<br>
<br>
I look forward to a game that actually helps the designers enforce a challenge level, because players, in general, are cowards.  How do you think EQ even evolved into the raidfest it is today instead of the end-to-end single group game it was originally designed to be?  <br>
