Just because something is in game didn't mean it is useful for everything.<br>
<br>
Something else not in the game at the beginning: Cleric epic. Think about how different things would be without that one.<br>
<br>
For the person who was blithering about Plane of Time. I said some encounters may indeed be harder but overall the game is much easier now. Even the encounters being harder is an open question in some ways, because how do you determine it. Is killing Fennin Ro with all 65s and current equipment harder than doing Vox with all 50s with only the stuff available back then? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Do you actually read these threads before you reply or do you just wing it?<br>
<br>
In answer to your question though, while in some ways it is good, it is also bad in some ways. There is no real fear of failure now at any level. You can try anything and pretty much be ready to go about your business again in 20-30 minutes with little loss other than a bit of time. For the good parts, it would be hard to explain unless you have experienced it. That experience is something they have taken away from the newer players, to those players detriment in my opinion. I don't say most zones should be like that, but there should definitely still be a few. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

CRing naked in Chardok because we had no necro was fun. Getting repeatedly zerged and Death touched by fugged up pathing and aggro at the Fear zone-in was not so fun. <br>
<br>
Long naked CRs build character Goladus! .. heh<br>
<br>
Fear CR were pretty much the longest back then, but it was a risk you knew about when you went in. Part of the problem now is that gear progression has made it next to impossible to even attempt a CR naked anyways, and with coffins/graveyards you don't need to do it anyways. Heck, even if they add a little toughness to one these days people whine about it (the HoHb graveyard is a good example of this).<br>
<br>
The worst part about the DTing going away though is fewer dead Bards and Gnomes :/ <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Thats not harder, thats just having to not play the game for a week.<br>
<br>
edit because im not sure if Q is agreeing or dissagreeing with my point. ;o)<br>
<br>
Timesinks != difficulty.<br>
<br>
The fact you had to play an alt on a second account for a week, dident make fear hard. Although it did I suppose add risk. CR there was a matter of waiting a week and zoning in, theres no skill involved in that. It is i suppose possable to play your main, but you would be nekked and lose your res timer. So you probably wouldn't do it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadrax>Jadrax</A> at: 2/10/03 4:30:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2241<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/10/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> &gt;Mobs in fear diden't pop on server up until a GM did it, There was a server down each week, CR was a doddle.<br>

And yes, we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>will</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> disagree whether EQ is harder or easier now.<br>
<br>
There are 2 ways to view content:<br>
1) How hard is the content to solve power-wise<br>
an easy mob for a lvl 60 char is still much harder than a hard mob for a lvl 2 char. That's absolute view, and it is a legitimate view. For some mobs, you need huge forces of high-level people, so yes, compared to Sebilis, for example, PoP tier 1 is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">crap</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> hard, and that doesn't change even if lvl 45 people attempt Seb and lvl 65 do Tier 1 PoP...<br>
<br>
2) How hard is it to overcome the current content<br>
at level 65, Sebilis Myco is trivial compared to level 51 chef. That's subjective view, equally legitimate to the other view, but generally makes you feel EQ has gotten way easier. &quot;Convenience&quot;, for example, makes a huge difference in this view, whether in view 1, its mainly the mobs which make the difference, and the amount of people needed for it. Here, things as &quot;how many&quot; is very relative to the mob (Trakanon with 50 people is not harder than a Krup Warrior with 3), but things as &quot;how hard to manage&quot; play important roles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Or easier said: 10 deaths a 12 minutes downtime in 4 hours is hard in view 1, 1 death with 2 hours CR in 4 hours is hard in view 2...it's the same, but different things you feel as &quot;hard&quot;...<br>
<br>
And yes, i do count myself to number 2 - i miss those naked CRs, those feeling that you knew &quot;If i make <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">one</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> fault, we will be doing nothing except trying to get back here for the next 2 1/2 hours&quot;. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55795">Carighan Maconar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Enchantress of the 59th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Member of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nebelwelt.de/eq/index.htm">Namenlose Bruderschaft</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on Solusek Ro<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/qz4.htm&quot;" target="&quot;new&quot;"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mutedfaith.com/images/time.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/qz4.htm&quot;" target="&quot;new&quot;">find your element</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://www.mutedfaith.com&quot;" target="&quot;new&quot;">mutedfaith.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elyia>Elyia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/10/03 2:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> PoP bosses are trivial compared to say VP, NToV or Tormax and Ssra was for their time.

<br>
However i do see your point, although much of what the old school deems &quot;difficult&quot; i consider merely time consuming.  Lack of public transportation, lack of bind bots, presence of 8 hour nekkid CRs all fall into this category for me, i.e. things which aren't difficult or challenging, but time consuming and frustrating.  These are the things that make SOE's most valued customers, the low bandwidth using &quot;casual gameing&quot; cash cows, quit.<br>
<br>
As far as trivialization goes, EQ was doomed from the start by lack of item decay and hard level limits, as someone already pointed out.  Stuff gets handed down but only extremely rarely is it removed from a server.  Currency is devalued, items are devalued, and we end up with level 10 newbies who can afford to buy items which were once the best the game had to offer, and only rarely is there an item flag preventing them from equipping it.  At the same time, SOE has to keep a fresh carrot in front of the end game guilds, and so end game gear has to keep getting better.  There really is no solution for the gear problem in EQ, since they can't add item decay at this point or the general uproar would deafen us all.<br>
<br>
Encounter difficulty is effected by AA abilities more than anything i think.  Think about how trivial it is to buff a raid now, just MGB it, think about mana savings AAs and damage enhancing AAs, and characters are stronger than they have ever been.  Those skills trivialize content a thousand times worse than bind bots or teleport stones or researchable spells do, and the presence of such a large population of &quot;heroes&quot; in the world really does point to the end of EQ.  <br>
<br>
But gah it has to end sometime, they can't just keep tacking on a few levels and zones, can't just continue to append to its old ass code.  At some point, they have to say, &quot;enough is enough,&quot; and start a clean slate where certain deep errors in the structure of this game can be corrected.

<br>
If someone who plays 8 hours a day can do something, this does not mean the player who only plays 2 hours a day can do it in 4 days.<br>
<br>
The PoP books are there to make life as a non-porting, non-bind-anywhere class better.  For years, I refused to pay people for ports.  I'd take the boat if I needed to get anywhere.  Now that I am playing a wizard, I wonder how I ever managed to get buy without ports...even the pop books are too slow for me.<br>
<br>
Yes, EQ is easier these days.  Some of it stems from mud-wimping while other bits come from them fixing some things that were just bad in the initial design.  Yes, this means that people who are less than skilled at the game reach the high end content.  Yes, this means Dreadlands type OOC banal chatter in PoD.<br>
<br>
I bet half the people reading this thread still play, though, and most of them have 2 or more accounts.  EQ is not dying quite yet.  It is just adjusting to a more casual playstyle. <p><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/fgrubb/images/Misc/tel_flame.gif><br><SELECT NAME=D1<br><OPTION SELECTED>Telurinon Aelvenborne, 55th Rake of Black Isle<br><OPTION>Mangore Orcsplitter, 41st Warrior of Black Isle<OPTION>Dewin gan'Bran, 48th Wizard of Black Isle<br></SELECT><br><font color=#80FFFF><I>Skating away on the thin ice of a new day.</I></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2248<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/10/03 4:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> &gt;The fact you had to play an alt on a second account for a week, dident make fear hard.

Actually, servers were not always booted once a week and you did stand a chance of losing all your gear. I know a few people who did. I am still trying to get my mind around how this is supposed to be easier than zoning in 20 seconds after you died, looting your corpse 20 minutes later, and getting a res. Waiting a week is a fairly large penalty for failing. And breaking Fear was kinda hard back then. No other zone really comes close to it now. 8 hour CR missions are not fun, sure, but they only come if you fail the break badly. And it only takes one or two of em to make people pay better attention to what they are doing.<br>
<br>
&gt;It is i suppose possable to play your main, but you would be nekked and lose your res timer. So you probably wouldn't do it. <br>

You would probably be surprised at the number of people who would do it though. I would. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

What does it matter what other guild(s) do and how they do it? Play how you want to play and ignore how others do. I'm sure alot of servers have it... a guild of 30-50 people who do content with limited numbers performing tactics over numbers... Torv had one, did Vyemm with 29 people but wiped at 1%. Could do Dain with the low 20s with 1 tank and have no deaths. If you don't like zerging mobs then start or join a guild like this. Will you see PoP? Maybe, maybe not but if that is your idea of fun then do it.<br>
<br>
That is why EQ is so good. The guild who enjoys throwing themselves at mobs can play the same game as the precise, small numbered guild plays at the same time as the parent who can barely squeeze 2 hours in a day plays too. EQ1 will not die soon... <p>[63 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 691<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/10/03 8:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> Because there is only limited content in case you haven't noticed, and spawn times are very long. I am one of those people who hate to log in and notice that everything worth raiding is dead. Zergling force clears places faster (especially in PoP) than ever before. In Luclin you could throw bodies at the mobs, but with their insane HP that didn't work as well. Thus making PoP awesome expansion to those who like to throw masses of bodies at mob and just grind it down. I guess the Quake analogy earlier wasn't that far off... just blast things and don't mind the finesse.<br>
<br>
Then again, we have about 40 very active people and biggest raid we had so far was 65 I think. We just have the uber advantage of being an euro guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

With you creeping up on the end of an expansion you think well why should you play this game when I've beaten every mob possible and there is no more loot out there that will upgrade you... <br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say if challenges mean anything to you then old content can be just as good as the new in terms of content as long as you don't have too many people there making it trivial. Having 50 people wacking at Aary is boring. Having 30 is something entirely different. Maybe 30 is still too much for you.... do it with less next time. My guild was in NToV and we did Gore once with 13 with a level 57 warrior tanking. We owned him hard and at the same time half of us were like omg we just killed a mob with 2 groups we thought we'd never kill when we were 40 xping in DL. If DL is too gimp then do something a bit bigger... alot bigger, whatever bursts your bubble. Of course you may not get 1 piece of loot you would ever consider using but its fun isn't it? <p>[63 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 3307<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/10/03 9:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PoP bosses are trivial compared to say VP, NToV or Tormax and Ssra was for their time. Our guild along with many others are beating nearly every PoP encounter the first or second time without any idea what bosses have in the ways of abilities. That was nearly unheard of in any previous expansion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I would not say this.  Now I didn't get to NToV before they permarooted mobs, but there were many Dragons in there that we did kill on our first try.  I also ask what level-ish is your guild.  Did you do Vex Thall before doing PoP?  If so then level 65+VT gear is quite overpowered for most of the early bosses, and it's not fair to judge the encounters from that standpoint.<br>
<br>
Granted, though ToV had that nice gathering place at the zone-in, there's still a certian amount of &quot;breaking&quot; that goes into doing NToV.  A lot of the wipes in ToV come from learning the zone in general, not from the bosses.  I remember wiping to Flurry drakes, to adds at the intersection up by Vulak, and various other places.  But I also remember killing Feshlak, Mirenella, Koi`Doken, and Eashen all on the first try.  We got Kreizenn to 10% on our first try during that week where aggro was totally broken.  Vyemm took a couple tries, Zlexak took a bunch of tries (after we'd figured out how to split the triplets), Sontalak took a bunch of wipes..<br>
<br>
It hasn't been much different in PoP.  We've put off VT at the moment, and another guild has Ssra prioritized so we don't get there too often.  The first week PoP came out we went 0-4 or 0-5 against Terris Thule, and didn't get the chance to beat her for a month after that (competition).<br>
<br>
ADar and Grummus we killed on second tries I think.  Those mobs weren't really too hard for us we just needed to figure strategy.  Behemoth took 1-2 tries but we haven't perfected that fight yet, he's still really difficult.  Agnarr is rough for us too, he's taking a lot more practice than many ToV mobs did, but I'm quite positive we can kill him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 693<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/11/03 3:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> Not for loot, for exploration. Once you've seen and done them enough times, they just don't have any lure to get you back. Sure we did Dozekar the Cursed with one group, but what's the point, specially since we did it with 3 groups before we set foot to ST or NToV. Or to borrow Gorenaire example, when your friends show how 2 people kill her, it's kind of a downer. With coming the end of expansion comes the end of exploration. There is still plenty of loot to go around and upgrade (aka. farm) but the thrill of new things and new places is gone.<br>
<br>
So, even though you had a good attempt of trying to bind this to loot, you fail to see that the easier the content is, the easier it is to farm 150 mana/hp items and &quot;improve&quot; your character. To what end? PoP seemed like an great expansion, but now with hours of trash clearing and buggy content... it is same old, but in easier and faster-to-consume package. Maybe if you were in ele planes you'd know this already.<br>

Yes there are some features that reduce some of the penalties and risks for losing.. click sticks, graveyards, and easy travel(the need for travel being reduced to almost nil.)<br>
<br>
But the PoP zones and Bosses are not all easy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just hate the fact that people yelling wolf are getting EQ gimped down to some simple mindless single-player-game-like (Diablo2 comes to mind) where you don't even need social interaction (remember the &quot;class interdependance&quot; where did it go?). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Class interdependance is not gone, though with the gimp luclin xp mobs they came close to killing it, they're just trying to focus it on combat now instead of the overall immersive experience.  <br>
<br>
Honestly after 60 levels of running through the Karanas, Ocean of Tears, Dreadlands, Burning Woods, IceClad, Great Divide, Wakening Lands, and Maidens Eye I'm glad that the tedium of travel is gone.  I don't think that level 1s should have access to the plane of knowledge, but I don't think something like Travel-interdependancy is something sacred that needs to hold true for the entire length of the game.<br>
<br>
Things lose their novelty..  I can honestly believe that if they had <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">boats</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> in Planes of Power that most people would not enjoy them one tiny bit.  When you first ride a boat it's actually pretty cool.  Soon it gets to be a mildly boring chore but helps keep people separated on the world.  Eventually it becomes a maddening time sink.  If you've ever played Final Fantasy you'll notice that your ability to travel increases as you progress through the game.  Early on, exploration is emphasized, while the end game focuses on combat and story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eelyen>Eelyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Jesus?

There is tons more available to the casual gamer and the hardcore gamer alike. <br>
<br>
Planes of Power was designed to seperate the top guilds somewhat.<br>
<br>
With Planes of Power and the current state of the game, getting to level 65 is not all that hard for a determined person.  And with the added levels and AA's of the game.  Even the more casual guilds are getting there piece of the higher end game.  While, I admit, there are no casual guilds killing Emperor, farming Vex Thal, or doing Rallos Zek.  They are getting more NToV runs, Tormax's, etc.  <br>
<br>
It's true they aren't getting the best loot in the game.  But there really is no way to provide the best loot in the game to the casual gamer, and still keep the hardcore gaming aspect valid.  And if they did provide small encounters that provided the best loot, the hardcore gamers would just monopolize it and then the casual gamers would complain about it. <br>
<br>
The casual can't expect the most out of the game with the way it's designed.  The hardcore gamers play for the very reason of beating the most challenging encounters and getting rewarded with the loot that is equal of that encounter. <p><HR Width="25%" Align="Left">
