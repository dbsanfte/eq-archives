<br>
Riverdane puts the cigarette up to his lips distractedly. He is peering ahead into the gloom. One hand removes a box of matches from his pocket. The other hand digs out a match. He absentmindedly strikes it against the pad. Lifts the match to the tip of the cigarette. Inhales...nothing.<br>
<br>
Bah.<br>
<br>
He lets go of the match, and watches it float to the &quot;ceiling&quot; of Kedge Keep. Dumbass. Trying to light up underwater.<br>
<br>
He is totally alone in the upside down lobby of doomed Kedge....the keep that slipped off the edge of the cliff of Dagnor's Cauldron and tumbled half intact into the waters below. The wizards and mages were clamouring for their pieces for their epics that were hidden in these submerged passages, and with the geometry of Kedge reversed, he thought it a good idea to do a little exploring before leading the Alliance here. Before heading into the waters, he had mustered his magic together to cast a spell that let him breathe the water as if air. How odd the feeling of water filling his lungs, processed out, like a water pump within him. He would never get used to that feeling.<br>
<br>
It is deathly quiet in the murky depths...a flicker of his fingers and his eyes begin to glow, violet light. The room illuminates with no light, his ultravision picking out shapes lit with eerie purple hues.<br>
<br>
He is alone.<br>
<br>
A secret pleasure, and a twinge of guilt. Silence cradled him like a babe. No one but Camille knew where he was....she had passed on his invitation to come, instead heading to the cleric guilds of Freeport to attend the teaching in how to raise the dead back to life. But nothing else was there to distract him. No reports from the guild. No requests from the Alliance. Not another voice, human or otherwise. Not even the sound of his breathing. Wrapped back in the womb, water invading his every pore.<br>
<br>
With his left hand, he passes it in front of his face....his image shivers, and then, shimmers away....nothing to mark his presense...he is invisible.<br>
<br>
And -BLINK- he reappears.<br>
<br>
God I hate this spell.<br>
<br>
Unlike his waterbreathing, which had a nice set duration, invisibility is the bane of casters everywhere. Unpredictable, tending to drop at the most inopportune times, it was almost not worth casting. But River was clueless to what lay before him, and this mission was for information best glimpsed from behind a sheild of anonimity. Tales of thinking, manevolent creatures living within Kedge had surfaced, and the bodies of adventures who went to investigate did not.<br>
<br>
Again he passes his hand in front of his face, legs kicking slightly to keep him from sinking to the floor. And once again he disappears from view.<br>
<br>
Swimming in and down into a hole in the floor, into a long descending tube, the interior of a broken column. He passes by swordfish, their snouts wicked sharp, and checks again to see if his invisibility is holding. Swinging a sword and sheild underwater requires twice the strength to get half the speed, and those fish would quickly slice him to ribbons. He swam silently past their glassy, unblinking eyes, down into the deep.<br>
<br>
Another room, filled with rainbow colored fish, swimming in small schools. They dart past his face, oblivious to his presence.<br>
<br>
Now a long hallway, silent, void of all sound. River kicks with his feet and propels forward.<br>
<br>
Ah, now this is interesting....the stories were correct.<br>
<br>
Swimming in the corner of the next room, he sees two....women....swimming around a huge shark. The shark made no move to attack the women, who are rabbing shells across the sharks dorsal area, scraping its skin down, cleaning it. The womens' hair is not hair at all, but flowing green seaweed, and from the waist down, the likeness to humanity ends and the body of a fish begins. Two mermaids, cleaning the scales of a shark. River gapes, treading water. He sees his hands absentmindedly reaching for his cigarettes.<br>
<br>
Sees his hands.<br>
<br>
He is visible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shi....&quot; he thinks, as the womens heads snap in his direction.<br>
<br>
Immediately there is movement. The mermaid to the left swims straight at him, the shark and other mermaid breaking left and right. The mermaid rushing him is moving like an arrow, eyes lighting white. River yanks Reaver free of its scabbard.<br>
<br>
Eyes pulse light.<br>
<br>
River curses as white lighting shoots through his senses. The mermaid has sent a shock of power through him that would have knocked a lesser man unconscious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bitch!&quot; River gasps, swinging his sword in a wide arc. Reaver slices through her neck like a knife through butter. Red clouds billow from her neck as her head floats to the floor.<br>
<br>
Blinded by the bloody clouds, River quickly loses his sense of direction....his legs kick wildly, head turning back and forth, trying to see through the blood......where are they dammit?<br>
<br>
His answer is in two forms....he hears through the water a light female humming....the mermaid. And then another sound....a muffled buzzing. Growing louder, louder.<br>
<br>
Suddenly tiny gnats are crawling into him, his mouth, his ears nostrils.....biting, stinging, invading him. The swarm settles into him.<br>
<br>
And at the same time, from his left, the shark strikes.<br>
<br>
Powerful jaws clamp his torso. River is hanging out of the shark's mouth like a ragdoll in the jaws of a dog. Only the god-forged strength of the Umbral armor he wears keeps that bite from chomping him into three pieces. Meanwhile, body screaming pain from the swarm within him, River waits for the pressure of the shark's jaws to split him open like a walnut.<br>
<br>
Not today, fish.<br>
<br>
River's hands begin to light with an unearthly glow.<br>
<br>
River slaps both of his hands over the shark's eyes.<br>
<br>
PULSE.<br>
<br>
The shark's head explodes with a muzzled pop. Fish entrails, teeth, cartilidge float in every direction, as River, stinging, silently screaming floats to the floor....above him, somewhere in the blood, was the other mermaid.<br>
<br>
And then, just like that, the swarm departs. River's interior is ravaged by tiny bites, but for now he is still whole. So the mermaid's spell had its limitations as well. <br>
<br>
Kicking to propell himself from the wall, River realized how badly he was hurt. His grip on Reaver had gone when the shark had clamped him, and was impossible to find with the blood clouding the water. The swarm had ravaged his insides, and he barely had strength to tread water. <br>
<br>
And then the mermaid was on his back, hands clawing at his eyes.<br>
<br>
With reflexes battle trained, and the inhuman power of a shadowknight, River's hands fly over his head to lock around the throat of the mermaid. <br>
<br>
And then River.....drinks.<br>
<br>
The mermaid's eyes bulge as Riverdane draws her life force into his hands. His destroyed inside begins to mend, bruises fading, as he vampirically draws the life from the mermaid now clinging weakly to his back. She floats away from him as he lets go, tail spasming, as he takes the last her of her life into him.<br>
<br>
Hmmmp, he thinks, who needs groups. Groups are for...<br>
<br>
And then, time elapsed, River gasps as his water breathing spell ceases functioning, his eyes open in surprise as his body floats to the bottom of the room.<br>
<br>
Alone.<br>
<br>
Riverdane Wyldechylde dies in a watery grave.<br>
<br>
There is only silence. <br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkness....<br>
<br>
Silence...<br>
<br>
BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ<br>
<br>
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ<br>
<br>
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br>
<br>
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br>
<br>
Noise...<br>
<br>
Laughing...<br>
<br>
Howls...jeers...<br>
<br>
....Screams....<br>
<br>
LIGHT.<br>
<br>
Riverdane's eyes snap open....last thought...I'm dead....last memory....drowning, pressure in lungs, explosive pain....<br>
<br>
And now....laughter....<br>
<br>
He stares upward at the ceiling....breathing slowly, effortlessly...the room is lit by torchlight, and something screams far off to his left, to end in a choked cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where the hell am I?&quot; River murmurs to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not quite...&quot; comes a voice from his left, deeply resonant, a voice of male beauty, &quot;But close.&quot;<br>
<br>
River turns toward the voice. Though the voice may be beautiful, its owner was not. A bulbous, warty puss ridden elven face sat upon a thin, almost snakelike neck, attached to a bloated and misshapened humanoid form. The lips on this creature made a mockery of a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome home, son.&quot; it said, opening its arms graciously.<br>
<br>
Riverdane blinked. &quot;Innoruuk?&quot; he whispered, not moving.<br>
<br>
&quot;Call me Dad.&quot; Innoruuk smiled, motioning for an embrace. River swung up to sit on the edge of the bed he had been laying on, but made no move to approach the God of Hate. Innoruuk's lips twisted down into a frown at the rebuke. He peered at River through caked lids.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have your mother's eyes.&quot; he commented.<br>
<br>
With a reflexive howl, River lept off the bed, hands glowing with blacklight. Hands landing splayed across Innoruuk's chest.<br>
<br>
PULSE.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Resisted.&quot; he said admonishingly, the grin back on his face. He wagged a fat black finger at Riverdane. &quot;You should know better than to try that.&quot;<br>
<br>
River stood very, very still, adreneline draining away from him, the shock that his harmtouch did not land registering on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;But since you seem to enjoy pain so much...&quot; Innoruuk shrugged and waved his hand absently. Riverdane's body flew up in the air, and slammed down into the bed, spread eagle, air knocked out of him. Face up, he could not even turn his head an inch. He stared at the ceiling with wild eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOW!&quot; Innoruuk shouted, face suddenly inches from River's. &quot;Let's talk about pain, shall we?....All the pain you've caused ME...in my heart.&quot; Innoruuk's breath in his face smelled of rotted fruit. River's eyes watered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, HEART.&quot; Innoruuk spat, &quot;I loved your mother...for a moment...in my own way. And when you were born, I loved you too. Watched you. Taught you in your sleep. Yet all you want to do is cause me pain.&quot; Innoruuks mottled fist suddenly swings up and down, hard, across River's left knee. Pain expodes as his kneecap shatters. River's scream blends with the howls from outside the bedchambers.<br>
<br>
&quot;PAIN! When I sent you the dreams to cut your stepfather's throat when you were twelve, and instead you curled yourself into a ball and cried yourself through the night.&quot;<br>
With a quick twist on River's arm, he dislocates the shoulder. River biting down hard, biting his tongue, drawing blood in a salty rush. The world around him swims.<br>
Innoruuk picks up the hand on River's good arm, rigid, frozen, and takes hold of the forefinger.<br>
<br>
&quot;PAIN!&quot; Snap, he breaks River's forefinger. Spots before River's eyes. Innoruuk moves to the middle finger. &quot;When given your choices of mates, you choose that bitch paladin Camille.&quot; SNAP, and he moves to the ring finger. &quot;I present a world of eagar women to you, and you choose that which is opposite to all I tried to teach?&quot; SNAP! and River grits his teeth, a low howl rising, animal-like from the back of his throat. Innoruuk moves to his pinky. &quot;I gave you the world, and you gave me nothing but pain!&quot; SNAP.<br>
<br>
&quot;I reject everything you stand for.&quot; River replied, spitting out blood, voice a hoarse croak. &quot;Everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Innoruuk's laughter fills the room. &quot;Everything?&quot; he repeats, in amused disbelief. &quot;My dear boy, how do you think you have the powers you have? Who do you think you got them from, Tunare? You have served me since you were born.&quot; Slow realization came across River's face, blood running in a trickle out of the corner of his mouth, pooling on the bed under his ear. A look of horror in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Every life tap you used, every harmtouch you delivered, every pet you summoned, every bit of power you ever leeched like a vampire from someone....all that power....you derived from me. And you asking for it, and recieving it....was your homage to me. You controlled the world with the powers I gave you.....and in return, my vampire son, you gave me what you had to barter with....&quot;<br>
Innoruuk took a brassbacked mirror from beside the bed and held it up in front of River's face<br>
<br>
((Hair completely white))<br>
<br>
while chuckling at the prone figure<br>
<br>
((two sharp fangs over bloodless lips))<br>
<br>
sprawled across the bed.<br>
<br>
((completely red eyes)) <br>
<br>
&quot;You gave me the only thing you could trade for your power....&quot;<br>
<br>
((blood dripping from the side of his mouth...drip...drip...drip...))<br>
<br>
&quot;....your soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
The creature that was once Riverdane's Wyldechylde howls in horror from the bed, the sound making even the asylum-like screams from outside give pause.<br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear dear boy...&quot; Innoruuk said softly, running his finger along Riverdane's cheek, smearing blood in a red streak, &quot;Don't be upset....you're home now. And until I break you of your rather unpleasant desire to kill me, you will need to retain this form. Much easier to control you this way. Besides, I need to change your....perspective.&quot;<br>
<br>
River's blood red eyes dart from the mirror to lock on Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; he croaked hoarsely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have made you a forsaken revenant, a vampire, a true representation of the powers you took willingly from me. It is a powerful form....your broken knee, your hand, shoulder, what I have done to you would break a normal man....but in this form, you will be able to bear the pain. I show you what the power of Hate can do for your stamina.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Innoruuk backed away from the bed, attention that had been riveted on Riverdane dissipated. &quot;And now I fear I will be off.&quot; he said absently. &quot;I will come check on you later, my boy, but right now Maestro and I have a little meeting with Mayong, your damned Alliance plans on hitting his castle this weekend and I have been requested to send backup. They won't even know what hit them when I am through with them.&quot; And then, in the blink of an eye, Innoruuk was gone.<br>
<br>
River pulled himself painstakingly from the bed. Aye, it may add stamina to allow him to support his weight on his shattered knee, but the pain that shot up his leg made his eyes water. He limped to the door to his bed chambers and out into the hall, each step hell. Down through the gothic passageways he limped, passing the giggling and screaming vampire, spectres, skeletons and ghouls that inhabited the Plane of Hate. Passed the two spite golems guarding the entrance to Innoruuk's domain. Into the darkened streets, with the gambling halls, bars, and other buildings that made up the city that housed the God of Hate. Limping on a dead leg, pulling himself painfully, as he wandered aimlessly through the damned alleys.<br>
<br>
Reaching for cigarettes, he found one, in a pocket of the clothing he wore. Matches as well......at least Innoruuk wasn't so cruel as to leave him without his habit. River leaned up against a wooden lamppost and struck the match. lifting it to the cigarette between his lips.<br>
<br>
And suddenly, the flame winked out.<br>
<br>
THUMP.<br>
<br>
Having neatly sliced his match in two, a throwing star quivered in the wooden lamppole next to his face. Missed taking off his nose by an inch. River's head snapped to the side, making his dislocated shoulder scream.<br>
<br>
There, in the alley, was a familiar face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rocsalt!&quot; River whispered, recognizing the monk.<br>
<br>
Roc's face gauged no recognition, just turned down the alley and bolted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Roc!&quot; River cried, limping after him. One of my people, here! River thought, maybe Roc can get me out of here...He began pulling himself down the alley, down the twisting turns....Roc was always one step ahead of him.<br>
<br>
Around one corner, and suddenly a huge, diseased rat burst from the refuge on the street, and adds to the chase on Rocsalt's fleeting form. River desperately trying to follow, now following the rat following Rocsalt, further and further from the center of Hate.<br>
<br>
Up a blind alley, and down...body tired from the chase, calling Roc's name and not recognizing the sounds coming from his own throat....Roc slowing down at corners, looking back nervously, almost waiting for them to catch up before turning and sprinting off again, always out of reach......River running, desperate for recognition, broken hand extended, as Roc leads him around another corner...<br>
<br>
Suddenly...<br>
<br>
BRIGHT torch light...<br>
<br>
...a mass of people, faces he knows...<br>
<br>
.....murmurs, chatting, comraderie....<br>
<br>
&quot;Incoming!&quot; Roc calls out, as their heads turn toward him. &quot;A foresaken revenant and add!&quot;<br>
<br>
Immediately weapons are drawn, as Riverdane stops in his tracks, looking at the faces, all friends....but there is no recognition in their eyes. Only bloodlust.<br>
<br>
A booming female voice, military in tone, breaks through the sudden silence, as the rat continues after Rocsalt into their midst.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright mates, the game is ON!&quot; Kaguera commands. &quot;Dene, ice that rat. The rest of you, assist Aaryn on the vamp! REMEMBER TO ASSIST!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aaryn, hulking barbarian warrior, long time friend, steps out of the crowd, bow raised. River's hands come up protectively, a bloody tear running down from one eye unchecked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaryn, no...&quot; he whispers.<br>
<br>
TWANG! and the arrow flies, plunging into River's hurt shoulder. He screams in pain as his senses overload and he smells his own blood....rich...thirsty...somewhere he hears Denellrona chanting in a language he did not understand, and hears the squeals of the rat halt. And then he sensed nothing, except the scent of blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;PLEASE ASSIST ME ON A FORSAKEN REVENANT.&quot; Aaryn calls, drawing his sword.<br>
<br>
The crowd surges as one.<br>
<br>
And a blood-frenzied Riverdane Wyldechylde steps forward to meet them.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 8:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> A red haze settles across Riverdane's vision...his senses raging for blood....in touch with all his knowledge, aware that he is who is is, and yet it something else....the beast within emerges, but with the cunning of Man...<br>
<br>
His bloody eyes take in the scenario in front of him, Aaryn advancing, the others coming in behind in a wedge....Denellrona watching the rat, which stands mesmerized behind the crowd, on ice until they have finished with him. They would take him down easily, as he himself had led them to do many times before. But, those creatures whom they fought were predictable...if everyone did their job success was guarunteed....not this time tho. This time their prey knew their tricks.<br>
<br>
River halted, a sharp tongue licking out over bloodless lips. This non-agressiveness stopped the crowd dead in their tracks.....never before had a being from Hate just stopped moving on its own.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lassie...&quot; Kaguera said out of the corner of her mouth, near Denellrona's ear. &quot;You mezz this one too?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Dene said, eyes never leaving the rat. &quot;The vamp's not mezzed.&quot;<br>
<br>
River smiled at the crowd, and pointed his finger in a sudden movement behind them. A sickly green smoke waft from his finger, toward Kaguera, toward Dene...and passed them. To curl around the head of the rat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm....&quot; Dene said. &quot;Is that what I think it...&quot;<br>
<br>
She was cut off explosive movement. <br>
<br>
Aaryn's barbarian warcry as he leaps, swords swinging, in a flurry at Riverdane. The green cloud settling around the rat, and the rat's squeal of pain as the disease cloud begins eating off its patchy fur. Then the rat is all over Dene, sinking its teeth into her arm as it throws itself against her. She goes down in pain with the weight of the giant rat upon her. Bwael and Nizzre running to flank the vampire from the sides. Thadar focusing on Aaryn, Jemia watching Kaguera, the two clerics, he in a pale blue robe, she in battle plate, murmuring prayers to their gods to assist them in the battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;This rat is dotted!&quot; Dene cries out, dodging her head to the side as the rat scrambles at her face. &quot;The revenant dotted the rat!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell??&quot; Kaguera, exploded, yanking the rat off Dene and thowing it to the side. The rat hunches its muscles, and springs back at Kaguera.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mates!&quot; she booms, &quot;Aaryn, tank mez that revenant! The rest of you assist me on this rat!&quot;<br>
<br>
As a well oiled machine, the raiding party turned away from Aaryn and River, and began to butcher the rat in earnest. Aaryn continued to advance on Riverdane.<br>
<br>
Hmm, now the warrior keeps me busy while the cleric lays minor heals until the rest of the group can assist, River thinks to himself. A useful ploy. Too bad tonight it's not going to work.<br>
<br>
Aaryn has the look of the zealot in his eyes as he approaches Riverdane, a smile on his lips. He enjoys what he does. A barbarian warrior is almost as blood crazed as a forsaken revenant in the midst of battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, come on...&quot; the warrior is murmuring, swords flashing in a figure eight pattern, one step at a time moving in towards River. River spots Thadar standing to Aaryn's left behind him. Registers it, stores it. And waits for the kick he knows Aaryn is going to start with.<br>
<br>
Aaryn kicks on cue.<br>
<br>
River is already waiting for it, and with his good arm catches the foot and shoves upward. Aaryn, completely unprepared, fall unceremoniously onto his rear end, and Riverdane leaps over him toward Thadar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Next time, priest,&quot; River spit out in a gutteral voice. &quot;Wear a helm.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that River's fist smacks down onto Thadar's skull. Powered with the strength of the bloodlust and the power of Hate, Thadar crumples unconscious like a dropped rag doll.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now where were we?&quot; River says, spinning toward Aaryn. Aaryn is pushing himself up in his heavy armor from the floor, one hand down on the ground, the other using the sword in it to propel himself to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, yes, tank mezzing.&quot; River hissed, &quot;Now I'll show you how to mezz a tank.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lightning fast River's hands grip Aaryn's wrist, lock, and yanks UP.<br>
<br>
A horrible rending noise, of steel, bone and ripping flesh.<br>
<br>
Aaryn stumbles to his feet, eyes crazed. Blood is bubbling on his lips...the rat is dying somewhere in the back ground, but Aaryn can only stare at the revenant, stumbling back a few feet as shock settles in, blinking absently.<br>
<br>
In Riverdane's hands five feet away is Aaryn's arm.<br>
<br>
Somewhere near him a rat squeals its death shrieks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaryn?&quot; Brieah, barbarian shamaness of the warrior's clan calls from somewhere in the now hushed crowd. Aaryn is stumbling around like a drunk man, blood pumping from his arm, still swinging his other sword weakly toward River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please....assist me...in the...&quot; labored breath, sway to left, world going black. &quot;taking down of..a...forsaken... forsaken...&quot; spinnnnnnn.<br>
<br>
Aaryn sinks to his knees and pitches forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brieah, get a regeneration on him NOW!&quot; Kaguera yells, yanking her sword out of the dead rat. Brieah runs without a word to the fallen warrior, now twitching on the ground in a pool of his own blood. Under Hate's blue light he looked dead already.<br>
<br>
&quot;The rest of you, &quot; Kaguera commands, rushing at Riverdane, &quot;Assist me NOW.!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Crippling a forsaken revenant!&quot; Dene calls, beginning a gesture with her hand, beginning to chant.<br>
<br>
Kaguera swings at the vampire, who is already diving toward Dene before her chanting is even done. Two of Bwael's arows fly by, barely missing the revenant as it lurches toward the enchantress. What the hell, she thinks, cursing as her swords miss the vampire by an inch, since when do the mobs ANTICIPATE the spells?<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't cripple me....&quot; River murmurs, closing in on Dene. &quot;Someone beat you to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dene back pedals, the proper movement of the spell lost.<br>
<br>
More noise, from behind Kaguera. A patrolling lich seems to have found them, and was currently swinging its scythe at Nizzre's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Down brother!&quot; Bwael called, yanking Nizzre to the left. The scythe missed him by, close enough for Nizzre to hear its passing.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have adds in the back!&quot; Kaguera called, eyes darting between Riverdane and the lich now swinging in the main midst of her raid. Dene was beginning to chant again. Kaguera made her decision.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take the lich,mates! Dene, ice the vamp. Zullie, watch her health!&quot; And Kag turned from them to rush the lich.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mezzing a fors...&quot; Dene began, and STARS! as the vampire swung Aaryn's armored arm into her face. Pain, instant through her as she fought consciousness, her nose shattered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Zullie darting in from behind to get close enough to heal Dene. River's hands darting out for the iksar shaman as she runs by, hands gripping her tail. And swings with all the strength of the unholy, he pitches her into a stone wall of the alley. Bones crack, and Zullie slides unconscious to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't get off a mezz!&quot; Dene cries out, scrambling backward, as River advances.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nizzre!&quot; Kaguera calls out, sword locked with the lich's scythe. &quot;Keep the vamp busy, remember to TAUNT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nizzre peels off towards Riverdane.<br>
<br>
Dene, in a whisper....<br>
<br>
&quot;We can't taunt this thing.&quot; she realizes as the pain of the broken nose shoots through her brain...<br>
<br>
&quot;It's taunting US.&quot;<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
...STUN...<br>
<br>
The paladin opens with a stun, eyes preternaturally blue, and a wave of force pushes from Nizzre's sheild arm, an invisible barrier, knocking River senseless for a moment...the battle with the lich rages on, and River stands motionless looking at his old friend advancing toward him, sheild in a position to be used as a weapon, sword poised. More ground to cover for Nizzre to reach him, but he is momentarily dazed, as Nizzre begins to move forward, sword moving like a snake from side to side.<br>
<br>
River's head clears, a low snarl rising in his throat... he coils to spring...<br>
<br>
....STUN....<br>
<br>
Again the blue light in Nizzre's eyes, again the crippling invisible force slams into Riverdane....the revenant blinks impotently, as the paladin comes closer....<br>
<br>
&quot;Haste, please, Dene.&quot; Nizzre asks cooly, sword arm swinging the sword in small circles. Denellrona nods wiping blood from her nose, murmuring her spell. Nizzre's swing speed triples, the sword now only a blur of motion. <br>
<br>
River comes out of the stun, Nizzre a foot away...<br>
<br>
.....STUN....<br>
<br>
And again, River is motionless, helpless, unable to move, wracked by the force of the paladin's stun...<br>
<br>
Nizzre close, close, arm cocked back to swing....<br>
<br>
&quot;Do it to it....&quot; River whispers.<br>
<br>
Hesitation. <br>
<br>
Like an uncoiled cobra, River comes out of his stun. One hand snakes behind Nizzre's head. The other grips his sheild arm. With a flex of muscle, River smacks Nizzre's face into his sheild again....and again....and again....<br>
<br>
&quot;Stun ....stun.....STUN.....&quot; River laughs, bashing NIzzre's sheild into his own face over and over. Nizzre's hand releases the sword senselessly, and slumps to the ground against a building... River looms over him, bending down to pick up the paladin's holy blade...Denellrona is screaming something behind him, but he pays no attention, carried away in the murder he wishes to commit. With his good arm, he swings the sword up over his head.<br>
<br>
THWUMP.<br>
<br>
An arrow catches River mid palm, pinning it to the wall over his head. He turns away from Nizzre, sword clattering to the ground, stuck to the wall.<br>
<br>
THWUMP.<br>
<br>
Another arrow flies, catching the other hand, crucifying River, arms outstretched, prone, pinned to the wall like a butterfly. Bwael notches another arrow, as River howls.<br>
<br>
THWUMP.<br>
<br>
Arrow shatters bone as it pierces River's left ankle, fastening the leg to the building...<br>
<br>
THWUMP.<br>
<br>
The job is done, as another arrow catches River in the right knee, piercing it, holding the leg tight to the wall, as River screams like a wounded cat.....the pain...the blood spraying.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't mess with my brother.&quot; Bwael says flatly, nocking another arrow, raising the bow to throat height.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk's voice in River's ear ...<br>
<br>
....&quot;I'm not done with you yet, son....&quot;...<br>
<br>
Arrow flies....<br>
<br>
River's body shimmers, and disappears....the arrow strikes wood...<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in darkness, River senses he is moving, but sees nothing, as the sound of the battle begins to grow fainter to his ears....till only the sound of Kaguera's voice...<br>
<br>
&quot;It GATED...&quot; he hears the warrior woman boom....<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;...Wanna beer?...&quot; says a voice to his left and behind him.<br>
<br>
River's bones feel stiff and strange. He turns his head to see who addressed him. His head turns to the left...<br>
<br>
...and turns....<br>
<br>
...and turns...<br>
<br>
River is now looking quite literally over his left shoulder, backwards, at an old friend, Coall. Coall isn't even looking at him, rather, staring off over the moat with that look that all pullers have, searching for movement, preparing to attack at any moment if the circumstance is right.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was kidding about the beer.&quot; Coall says absently. &quot;What good would it do you? Not like you have a liver to ruin.&quot;<br>
<br>
River opens his mouth to speak, and no sound comes out.<br>
<br>
&quot;You start that laughing you always do, I'll bury you a second time.&quot; Coall says, tilting his beer up to his lips.<br>
<br>
Agitation sets in, River begins pacing, trying to speak, nothing but silence.<br>
<br>
Coall looks at him with disgust. &quot;Pet sit down. You're driving me nuts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now River can speak, but he does not recognize his own voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sitting down, Master.&quot; And with a rattle of bones, River sits cross legged on the floor.<br>
<br>
And stares, if he had eyes, at the pure white skeletal hands resting on pure white skeletal knees in abject horror.<br>
<br>
Coall rambles on, having spent so much time in Karnors, talking to his summoned pet almost seems normal. Who says dog is man's best friend? Coall was here to kill dogs, and his best friend was the reanimated skeleton of a long dead human. He guessed everything was open to interpretation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know why I even waste the bone chips on you sometimes...&quot; Coall intones. &quot;I mean, it's not like you're a necro pet...&quot;<br>
<br>
River is only half hearing him....all those years as a shadowknight, River knows the one use for a shadowknight's underpowered pet. With all his will he tries to unlock his stiffened joints, but he knows Coall's will is greater than his own. Will?....WHAT will?.....he was Coall's puppet.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you were a mage pet, hell, I'd just kick back with another beer and let you do all the work...&quot;<br>
<br>
Have to get OUT of here....River thinks...any moment, a named may pop within sight but not reach of Coall, and then, as they say, my goose is cooked. Still he sat there with an idiot grin on his skeletal face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shaman pet, good too....beastmaster, hell, now THOSE have to be fun, a pet that melees as good as its master.....now THAT'S a pet...a little give, a little take, equal....hell, that's no pet, THAT'S a companion....&quot;<br>
<br>
With terror River sees the Drolvarg captain step into position on the upper turrent. Coall has tipped back the beer, is not looking up. Perhaps someone else will pull it before Coall notices. Keep rambling on brother, keep rambling on.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, hell, even a chanter pet can dish out the damage when needed, protects its master.... but me...?...my pet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Coall puts down the mug, and spots the captain standing amongst the other dogs. Coall no longer is looking at River. His eyes narrow down.<br>
<br>
&quot;My pet has one use only, thanks to something Riverdane showed me a while ago...&quot;<br>
<br>
Willwillwillwill....impotence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet kill....&quot; Coall whispers. &quot;Go fetch.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Taunting A Drolvarg Captain&quot; River says, springing mechanically to his feet. He marches into the castle.<br>
<br>
pleasebadpathing, pleasebadpathing. A mantra in River's empty skull.<br>
<br>
Not today.<br>
<br>
Riverdane throws himself cackling onto the Drolvarg captain. With one swing of a powerful arm, the Captain disintigrates River's breastcage. As his head falls off and rolls into the corner, the world tips crazily as if watching from inside a spinning barrel. He sees the Captain peel off looking for the sender of the &quot;pet missile&quot;.....the animated slave to the shadowknight...the pet with only one purpose, to suicide against its masters foes. And in one dizzying moment, River put all of the raids he ever lead into perspective...and all the friends he had ever marched like a puppet into the jaws of death. And all of them, the living, the wounded, the dead....followed him. Did they feel as he did, laying in pieces in some dank castle? <br>
<br>
Alone.<br>
<br>
Discarded.<br>
<br>
Used.<br>
<br>
Coall was busy, fighting, arms immersed in the guts of the Captain, locked in combat, but still he heard Coall's subconscious, disinterested thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet get lost.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, oh great one.&quot; River cackles dutifully...<br>
<br>
...and all is black...<br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
<br>
....LIGHT....<br>
<br>
Riverdane finds himself back in the bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed. Innoruuk is sitting close by in a comfortable looking chair, stroking his chin thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo....&quot; Innoruuk purred softly. &quot;Have you learned about pain yet, my son?&quot;<br>
<br>
River almost flinched at the sound of the word.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...?&quot; Innoruuk asks again, smiling at River's unease.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; River whispers.<br>
<br>
&quot;And have I taught you about hate?&quot;<br>
<br>
This time River's answer is quicker, more pointed. &quot;Oh yes, that you have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good!&quot; Innoruuk smiles, clapping his hands together. &quot;ONE more lesson! Now we will teach you about LOSS.&quot;<br>
<br>
No more, please no more, River thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Behold...&quot; Innoruuk said, waving his hand through the air. Smoke billowed forth and solidified, and images started to form on it. Images River recognized.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely, isn't she...?&quot; Innoruuk murmured, eyes fixed on the solid sphere of smoke.<br>
<br>
There, in the smoke, was the room in Kedge where River had drowned. There was his body, there the pieces of shark and mermaid, there was his sword, Reaver, at the bottom of the room. And there, in the middle of it all, treading water, was his wife Camille.<br>
<br>
&quot;Noooooo....&quot; escaped from River, his eyes locked on the image, the sound feral.<br>
<br>
Camille looked angelic, legs kicking back and forth slowly, arm spread out to keep herself in place, blonde hair flowing out behind her in a golden tangle. And those eyes, gods those eyes, blue naturally but now, fixed upon River's body, beginning to light preternaturally blue. She looked like a vision from Marr himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, poor girl...&quot; Innoruuk sighed, shaking his head. &quot;The minute she heard you were missing, without a word she came here. Just had Grelin cast enduring breath on her and without a word came here. He was afraid to even follow her. She feels guilty you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille's eyes are two stars now, blinding with their light, her mouth begins to move silently and she begins to chant.<br>
<br>
&quot;There she was, sitting in a boring class on how to resurrect the dead, while you were drowning to death in Kedge. Only she knew where you were. And now, she's here. You would have been proud of how she tore apart the guardian swordfish. Hate hath no fury like that of a woman deprived of her man...&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille's chant reached its apex, and with a sharp motion locked both hands on either side of his corpse's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Poor girl, she will wonder if she didn't pay attention when she cannot resurrect your corpse. Maybe she missed something in the teachings....but no...it's simply...your corpse is too old...&quot;<br>
<br>
The light flashes in Camille's eyes, growing larger, infusing her head like a halo, and passing down her arms to her hands and out her fingertips, to surround River's head then body.<br>
<br>
&quot;She will be destroyed this doesn't work...thinking it her fault you are gone...and without you, her reason for living will be gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tears roll down River's face, as he sees the light surrounding his corpse wink out, and the corpse remain motionless. Tears rolling as he sees the stricken look on Camille's face. Her grasp weakens and River's body sinks to the floor. Slowly she begins to chant again, eyes lighting blue, but empty.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is she doing?&quot; River whispers, her vacant look and silent moving lips frightening him in some primal way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Killing herself.&quot; Innoruuk says flatly. &quot;She is chanting Annul Magic. She is going to strip the water breathing spell from herself and drown next to you. How romantic.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP her!&quot; River cried, turning to his father, panic invading every pore. &quot;You can stop her, please, stop this!&quot;<br>
<br>
Camille's eyes begin to flash blue, building, brightening...<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot, my poor son, but you can....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How?? Tell me how?&quot; River cried, grasping at Innoruuk's silken tunic.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can send you there, with a short term enduring breath, to talk some sense to her.&quot; Innoruuk said quickly. &quot;I can give you your life back.&quot;<br>
<br>
The light growing brighter, escaping under blonde eyelashes....<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes do it, do it now!&quot; River excalims, tears flowing freely. Time time running out of time<br>
<br>
&quot;BUT...&quot; Innoruuk interjected. &quot;BUT, you must give me something you own that I want.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brighter....<br>
<br>
&quot;YES! Whatever I own you may HAVE!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So be it.&quot; Innoruuk said with a bright smile, and waved his hand in the air.<br>
<br>
BLACK---RUSHING-----<br>
FLYINGTHROUGHSPACEDIZZYWHIRLHURLINGTHROUGHTIME<br>
<br>
PRESSURE--<br>
<br>
River can feel the water pressing in on him from all sides. Hears the muffled chanting, turns.<br>
<br>
Tries to turn.<br>
<br>
Too weak.<br>
<br>
Too weak, no power.<br>
<br>
Opening his mouth to shout over Camille's muffled chanting.<br>
<br>
And the chanting stops.<br>
<br>
Slow roll, rolling his body sluggishly over onto its side.<br>
<br>
To stare into the dead eyes of his wife....no longer blue....only grey.<br>
<br>
&quot;No....&quot; with what strength he has left, curling his arms around Camille, pulling her limp form to him. toolatetoolatetoolate<br>
<br>
&quot;You were close, son.&quot; Innoruuks voice invades his mind. What is left of his mind at least.<br>
<br>
&quot;She is with Marr now...&quot; River whispers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no, my dear boy, &quot; Innoruuk says, snapping River out of his mourning. &quot;She's with ME now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You said anything you own I could have.&quot; Innoruuk's voice tsktsked. &quot;Silly boy, Camille gave you her soul when she fell in love with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nomorenomorenomore<br>
<br>
&quot;And now that soul is mine.&quot; Innoruuk finished. &quot;Thank you for the new student.&quot;<br>
<br>
nononononono<br>
<br>
And then Innoruuk voice, slowly growing fainter and fainter, talking to someone else. &quot;...and now, my dear daughter-in-law, what do you know about pain....?&quot;<br>
<br>
nonono<br>
<br>
And then, there is only silence... <br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
<br>
LIGHT<br>
<br>
Air.<br>
<br>
Inhale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grelin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grelin looks up from his foraging among the rocks in the Cauldron. His eyes first register confusion as he see a dripping wet Riverdane waist deep in water, and then shock as he sees the form cradled in his arms. <br>
<br>
&quot;I....I cast Enduring Breath on her...&quot; he managed.<br>
<br>
River steps out of the water, Camille limp in his arms, and hands her to Grelin. His eyes are blank.<br>
<br>
&quot;To Emerald Jungle, please.&quot; he says, voice flat. Grelin is stumbling under the weight of the full armored woman, but begins to chant the evacuation spell anyway. He has only seen River like this a few times in their long history together, and knows when isn't a time to question River. When River is dead calm, he is often murderous. Best port and be out.<br>
<br>
They shimmer and are gone.<br>
<br>
Lush foliage, dense, dense enough to limit visability. Grelin stands there, Camille's body in his arms, waiting for leave, a word anything. River looks at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring her back to the guildhouse&quot; he says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too late for a rez?&quot; Grelin asks, already knowing the answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too late for a rez yes, but she is not to be buried. Get a caster to stasis the body, I want it kept exactly the way it is now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River, what are you going to do?&quot; Grelin asks.<br>
<br>
There is no reply, River is gone.<br>
<br>
Through the jungle along a wall of rock River travels, his sword Reaver, retrieved from the murky depths of Kedge, cutting a path before him. His eyes narrowed to slits, his steps strong, a replaired and whole Riverdane stalks through the jungle, to the broken gates of Trakanon's Tooth.<br>
<br>
Through the gates, following paths many have walked before, so much so that the way is almost visible through the broken grass and trodden earth. Into the ruined city that marks the entrance to Old Sebilis.<br>
<br>
Before him a huge glowing red half sphere. River reaches into his armor, to pockets sewn and attacked to the inside. Pulls out an ancient idol, and touches it to the sphere. His image shimmers, and is gone.<br>
<br>
A long ramp down.<br>
<br>
An a lone woman and a lone man, her in a yellow robe, he in the purple and steel armor of a cleric, both with eyes intent. Both glance quickly to him, then eyes back to opening in the wall ahead of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, River.&quot; Jazzymusik smiles, fingers moving in anticipation at whatever she was waiting for through the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;River.&quot; Darkun acknowledges, preoccupied with whatever it was they were doing prior to River's entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Verdad here with his crew?&quot; River asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yup.&quot; Darkun said, eyes starting to light with that blue light of a healer. &quot;Here they come now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then the sound of laughter.<br>
<br>
Growing louder, louder, male laughter, female laughter, a mix of elven and human, no words, just the pure sound of enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Verdad, Fermaga, and Mezo pour into the room, running at breathtaking speed, chuckling and laughing like children in a park. Mezo's eye patch is askew, verdad's arm is bloody, and Fermaga's hair is a mess.<br>
<br>
And then another sound.<br>
<br>
Frogs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Louder.<br>
<br>
Louder.<br>
<br>
LOUDER.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi River!&quot; Fermaga laughs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Riv.&quot; Mezo adds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get DOWN River.&quot; Verdad suggests.<br>
<br>
And River dives to the ground with his arms over his head.<br>
<br>
L O U D E R.<br>
<br>
FROGLOKS....everywhere, pour into the room. Stepping onto River, swinging swords, clubs, staffs....<br>
<br>
Dozens of them almost mindlessly defending their home, they pack the hall and keep coming.<br>
<br>
Jazzy's chanting rises to a screech and<br>
<br>
PULSE.<br>
<br>
The frogs are hit by a pulse of air that knocks them senseless, all of them, standing there, stupidly blinking their huge froglok eyes. Blue light is shooting out of Darkun's hands eyes, infusing the battered wizards that brought this froglok parade. And the wizards begin to heals.<br>
<br>
&quot;One!&quot; Fermaga cries out with glee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two!&quot; Mezo adds, hands begining to glow with red energy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three!&quot; Verdad shouts, hands up in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;BOOM!&quot; they cry together, laughing hysterically. River crawls into a ball in the corner, knowing what's next.<br>
<br>
B O O M.<br>
<br>
The entire room lights with crackling energy, as the three wizards send their lightning out in a wild spray of pulses and hellfire. Pieces of froglok splatter the walls, the ceiling, the floor....and River. Not one lived through it. The combined area blasts of the three wizards all but disintigrated them.<br>
<br>
Jazzy adds to the laughter of the three wizards, all of them covered with frog guts. Even Darkun manages a smile as he wipes frog goo off his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finished?&quot; River asks, straightening up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah yeah.&quot; Verdad says. &quot;For a little bit at least. What's up, Riv, wanna pull for us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A minute, Verd.&quot; River says, motioning him away from the others. They talk for a moment in hushed tones, while the ladies are picking frog guts out of their hair. Verdad's face goes from one of puzzled wonderment, to one of sorrow, and finally, of simple shock. He backs away from River slowly. River just stares at him, unblinking.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're serious?&quot; Verdad asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dead serious.&quot; River replies.<br>
<br>
A slow smile broke on Verdad's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;WOOOOOOOT!&quot; Verdad laughed, spinning to his companions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, pack it up!&quot; he exclaimed, laughter dancing in his eyes. &quot;We are going to area THE PLANE OF HATE!&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/03 1:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> Shimmer....<br>
<br>
Flash...<br>
<br>
A gloomy room....<br>
<br>
&quot;North wall to southwest camp?&quot; Verdad asked in hushed tones, eyes darting around the port in area of Hate. So far no sign of wanderers, a good thing.<br>
<br>
River's match throws sparks as it touches the cigarette in his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm marching through the center.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oooook...&quot; Verdad sighs, turning to his companions. &quot;Darkun, Jazzy, set up in the South east corner. It's going to be tight but we'll pull them south along the east wall. Make sure you area on the ground, or we'll aggro the top floor...&quot;<br>
<br>
There was more but River filters it out, eyes narrowing to slits as they adjust to the gloom. Last time he had been here in Hate he was ghost, a spirit owned by Innoruuk. This time he was mortal. Weaker in form, yet stronger at the same time. His soul was his own.<br>
<br>
The laughter begins, as Mezo begins to float on a gust of air. Fermaga has already levitated herself, and a bright flash of flame licks out from her feet, as her journeymen boots activate. Verdad passes his staff over his head, and his skin begins to shimmer with runes. He looks at River expectantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do it to it...&quot; River murmurs.<br>
<br>
&quot;You heard the man...!&quot; Verdad exclaims, &quot;ROUND EM UP!&quot; And with a grin, the three begin to whoop, disappearing around the corner into the streets of Hate.<br>
<br>
River's blood begins to pound in his ears. Camille's soul was in here, somewhere. He would find her. Thump THUMP in his eardrums. A quick inhale....hold it, savor the rush. Exhale, and MARCH.<br>
<br>
Through the streets, empty from the area group sweeping through...<br>
<br>
Thump THUMP<br>
<br>
Explosions from south east.....loud, continous...and the sprinkling of laughter throughout...<br>
<br>
Thump THUMP<br>
<br>
Into Hate Proper, near Maestro's organ, where that unholy conductor writes his concerts for the damned.....empty of movement...this eerie solitude making his heart beat yet faster..<br>
<br>
Thump THUMP<br>
<br>
Up the twisting staircase to the second floor of Hate...through the twisted architecture....past where that insane propoganda spewing Evangelist normally preaches.....nothing, no sign of life or unlife....<br>
<br>
Thump THUMP<br>
<br>
To Innoruuk's mansion.<br>
<br>
Inhale<br>
<br>
Ahhh, now he could hear it, sense it in his bones....this place was filled. He could hear the creak of armor on Innoruuk's elite, even through the door. He stubs out his cigarette, and with one armored foot, kicks open the door. Inside are 6 of Innoruuk's chosen, dark elven damned, the best of the worse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not lay a hand to sword, wretched creatures!&quot; Riverdane bellowed in a voice full of ice. &quot;I am Riverdane Wyldechylde, bastard son of Innooruuk, God of Hate. By the royalty of my tainted blood I command you to STAY your hand!&quot;<br>
<br>
All six just stared at him blankly, not moving a muscle. River blinked in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, good...&quot; he said warily. &quot;You know who your dark prince is. You are wise to heed my command.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice try, hero.&quot; Denellrona says dryly from his right, &quot;They're mezzed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew that.&quot; River mumbles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice of you to join us, River,&quot; Kaguera states, pushing open the door with a crash. &quot;Better late than never! Alright, mates, inside and set up along the walls. Aaryn sit this one out with that arm, Nizzre you're tanking. Clear this room!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have business first.&quot; River says over his shoulder, pushing deeper into the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Kaguera asked, motioning more of the raid into the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;To kill Innoruuk.&quot; River replies, about to disappear through a door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember to consent.&quot; Rocsalt laughs, feigning in the middle of the room.<br>
<br>
And with that River is gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***    ***<br>
<br>
<br>
...noise, as the battle commences behind him...<br>
<br>
...a dark corridor...a stairway up....<br>
<br>
....LIGHT....<br>
<br>
&quot;...Welcome back, son.&quot; Innoruuk drawled from his chair, misshapen head cocked to the side. &quot;I've been waiting for you&quot;<br>
<br>
River's eyes take in the room around him, the lavishly furnished bedroom that Innoruuk had tortured him in. And there, on the bed, eyes closed, lay Camille, hair spread out on the pillow like a golden cloud. His heart ached, and he turned to face his father.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do to her?&quot; he spat.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk sighed. &quot;Nothing.&quot; he said flatly. &quot;Not for lack of trying, mind you. But she is...inaccessible. Marr has his hold on this one, the bastard. Touching her is like grasping hold of a lightning bolt. So, I fear, the lessons I taught you I can't quite share with her. Although, she does make a lovely porcelin doll, doesn't she?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is she....&quot; River began, blood draining out of his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleeping.&quot; Innoruuk murmured. &quot;So, my son, have you come to kill me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; River said plainly, drawing Reaver from its scabbard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then let us begin.&quot; Innoruuk intoned.<br>
<br>
...a FLURRY of movement....<br>
<br>
And Innoruuk is behind him, foot raised. A kick to River's rear and River flies across the room to smash against the wall. His head spins.<br>
<br>
&quot;AH HAH!&quot; Innoruuk chortled. &quot;Thought you were going to get one over on your old man, huh?&quot; As quick as lightning, Innoruuk was in front of River, delivering a chop across the face with his fist. River spun to face the wall, pain exploding in his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;While your people play with my minions outside, you have the GAUL to come in here and face me, unslowed, not tashed, with nothing but you and your sword? Have I not taught you ANYTHING?&quot; With a flash of light from Innoruuk's hand, River flies out of control across the room to demolish a wooden rocking chair. Slowly he crawls to his feet. But Innoruuk is over him, hands a blur, pummelling River like a punching bag, connecting in his face, his chest, his sides.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were a POOR student!&quot; Innoruuk cried, flailing at River with a malicious glee set in his eyes.<br>
<br>
--CONNECT--<br>
<br>
&quot;You learned NOTHING!&quot; A fist to his ribs...<br>
<br>
--CONNECT--<br>
<br>
&quot;And on top of that....!&quot; A swing to River's jaw...<br>
<br>
--CONNECT--<br>
<br>
&quot;You were a LOUSY SON!&quot; A flicker of his hand, and River sails across the room into the mirror, as it shatters around him, glass breaking.<br>
<br>
River, bleeding from a hundred cuts, drenched in sweat, wracked with pain, climbs slowly to his feet. The world spun. Breathing labored. Clinging to the bedpost for support.<br>
<br>
&quot;You did....teach me one thing....father....&quot; River gasped, almost inaudibly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really now.&quot; Innoruuk said. &quot;And what would that be?&quot;<br>
<br>
River slid to his feet, spent, a bleeding broken mass. He could hardly speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;You...taught me...&quot; Inaudible whispers were all that followed, as River's breathing hitched.<br>
<br>
&quot;Taught you what? Louder, you worthless piece of flesh.&quot; Innoruuk asked, stepping in closer to hear River's whispers.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, like an uncoiled spring, River leapt to his feet, hands burning with a black fire that threatened to suck the very light from the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;You taught me to HATE.&quot; River said, slapping both hands to either side of Innoruuk's head. Innoruuk's eyes flew open wide in surprise.<br>
<br>
---------PULSE-------------<br>
<br>
<br>
     ***     ***     ***<br>
<br>
<br>
DARKNESS<br>
<br>
--A muffled explosion--<br>
<br>
--Kaguera's booming voice &quot;They're following River! Innoruuk is summoning them, AFTER THEM!&quot;--<br>
<br>
--flashes of light before River's eyes...<br>
<br>
...a young blonde paladin steps over a sand dune in Ro...<br>
<br>
...a druid chewing quietly, nodding when asked to group in Lower Guk...<br>
<br>
...two brothers chuckling quietly to each other as they look upon the blood red armored knight before them in City of Mist...<br>
<br>
...looking down into a crib once occupied by beautiful twin boys, to find two baby ogres instead...<br>
<br>
...sitting on a cloud in the Plane of Sky, before a council of the leaders of five guild, at the birth of the Alliance...<br>
<br>
LIGHT<br>
<br>
&quot;By Rallos' bloody sword...&quot; Kaguera murmured.<br>
<br>
River stood motionless, splattered with blood, smoke wisping up from his fingers.<br>
<br>
In front of him in a gory, crumpled pile, lay the headless body of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk's elite, as one, knelt before River, head bowed. River blinked in a daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Permission to slay the land dwellers, milord!&quot; one said, refusing to look up. River just stared at him.<br>
<br>
The dark elf tilted his head up slightly. No one else moved.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Prince, permission to slay the land dwellers!&quot; he repeated anxiously.<br>
<br>
River looked at his friends, and then back to the dark elf.<br>
<br>
&quot;Permission denied.&quot; he said slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, milord.&quot; The dark elf went back to studying the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not your lord.&quot; River said softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;With all apologies, sire, you have killed your father and by blood rite, you are the new ascendant of Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I refuse.&quot; River replied, turning to Camille's body on the bed. He reached out to touch her cheek.<br>
<br>
-------SHOCK--------<br>
<br>
Pain flaired instantly through his hand, his arm, threatening to make his very eyes explode. A blue flash, and River withdrew his hand in screaming pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may not refuse.&quot; the Elite told him. &quot;You cannot deny your blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
River looked down at his burned hand, then back at Camille.<br>
<br>
&quot;How may I free her?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;That would be beyond me, milord. You would have to ask the other gods.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Kaguera muttered behind him. &quot;My worst nightmare. River is a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
This brought River out of his daze, attention on the living in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nizzre...&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't even think I'm calling you 'milord'.&quot; Nizzre replied warningly.<br>
<br>
&quot;No no...&quot; River said. &quot;Razor's Edge....is yours to lead now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will hold it while you sort this out.&quot; Nizzre said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, &quot; River said distractedly, glancing back at Camille's sleeping body. &quot;That may be a long time. I just...don't know. In the meantime, stay away from Hate, or we may find each other looking at each other from across a battlefeild.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Haven't we already?&quot; Nizzre said quietly. Their eyes locked, and for a moment River saw himself in Nizzre's pupils, holding NIzzre's sword aloft, prepared to cut his friend in two. His shoulders sagged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, so we have.&quot; River drew himself up straight, his voice strange. &quot;Leave this place, all of you. Leave me to my thoughts, and my wife. I have a quest of epic proportions ahead of me. And before I start, I need to be...alone....with Camille.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Porters, prepare to leave!&quot; Nizzre exclaimed loudly. Verdad, Mezo, and Fermaga had joined them at some point, and they began gesturing in the midst of the crowd, and the room began to hum.<br>
<br>
&quot;Farewell my friend...&quot; Nizzre said softly, looking at River as he knelt next to Camille's bed. Then the room lit with light, as groups began to port out.<br>
<br>
River looked at Camille's body, the memory of that jolting shock the fresh in his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;I learned all my lessons well, father.&quot; he whispered to himself. &quot;I learned hate. I learned loss...&quot;<br>
<br>
He drew closer to Camille.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I learned pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
The last thing Nizzre saw was Riverdane Wyldechylde, Prince of Hate, lean forward to kiss his wife's bright pink lips.<br>

<br>
<br>
...A match to a cigarette...<br>
<br>
...a sleeping soul...<br>
<br>
...inhale...<br>
<br>
For three days, Riverdane Wyldechylde sat, unmoving, staring at the ghost of his wife, Camille, laying in the oversized bed of Innoruuk, a soul without a living body, perpetually locked in unnatural slumber...for three days he had received no audience, eaten no food, sipped from no cup....nor did he need to. After the defeat of his father Innoruuk, River had achieved godhood. He, by bastard bloodrite, was the new Prince of Hate.<br>
<br>
Outside the chamber doors, what passed as life in Hate went on. Often there was a quiet knock on his door, but River ignored these. Until today. This knocking was more like pounding, with a frantic urgency to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in.&quot; River said, eyes not leaving Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and the voice of one of Hate's Elite, the damned dark elven souls who had served Innoruuk, cut through the once silent chamber.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your wickedness, Hate is under siege.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who has come?&quot; River asked. Hate was ALWAYS under siege.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Walkers, sire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahhh, Walkers. Must be Elyohim again. He was always coming up here in search of his last piece of his epic. Or maybe Mildane. Both rangers had been haunted by that rare gem since they had begun their epics. Both were friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find me the Master of Spite and the Mistress of Scorn please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Elite stood there blinking in surprise at him. It truly looked lost.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter?&quot; River asked, when it became apparent the Elite didn't know how to proceed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sire,&quot; the Elite stammered. &quot;The Master and Mistress are both in, but I didn't understand 'please'.&quot; He took a cautionary step forward. &quot;Are you ill, my Lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane sighed. &quot;Get them now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that the Elite was gone.<br>
<br>
Several moments later, another knock, to be ushered in by River. The Elite opened the door and stepped to the side. Through the door first came a woman with a body that would make a grown man cry, and a face that would make a grown man scream. Maggots wriggled in and out of the decomposing skin on the zombie woman's face. Her breath was a hiss of leaking gassing. The Mistress of Scorn.<br>
<br>
Behind her, pushing his bulk through the doorway, came the Master of Spite. A huge black obsidian juggurnaut, his features seemed cut into the black living stone he was created from. With two thunderous footsteps he took his place in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two.&quot; River addressed them, trying to look at Spite rather than become ill looking at the Mistress. &quot;Do you have your Shattered Emeralds of Corruption?&quot;<br>
<br>
Spite nodded silently at him. &quot;Yesssss, my Lord.&quot; Scorn hissed quietly.<br>
<br>
River turned his attention to the Elite. &quot;Where are Walkers now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are travelling across the north wall, sire. I believe they are headed to our southwest corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; He turned his attention back to the two he summoned. &quot;That gives you two time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What would you have us do, my Lord?&quot; Spite asked, his voice a deep echoing bass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I want you both to get to southwest corner as quickly as you can, cutting through the city and....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesssssss.&quot; Scorn said happily, eyesockets lighting with fire dancing in empty holes.<br>
<br>
&quot;....and take your emeralds and leave them in a neat little pile and then return to me.&quot; River finished.<br>
<br>
If the Mistress could blink with no eyes, she would have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you mean surprise them and rip them apart, sire?&quot; Spite asked, nodding his head as if to encourage River to agree.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I mean as I said.&quot; River replied, shooing them away. &quot;Now go, and if you disobey a word I've said, I'll put you in a small locked room with the Evangelist for three days until you lose what passes for your mind with his chatter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, yes sire.&quot; Spite said, pulling a dumbfounded Mistress out of the room with him.<br>
<br>
River turned back to Camille, the problem with how to wake her replacing the thoughts of Walkers in his new home. <br>
<br>
The Elite stood staring at River's back. &quot;You know,&quot; the Elite said. &quot;You're supposed to be one of the BAD guys.&quot; And with that, the Elite turned rather indignantly and left the room.<br>
<br>
River stubbed out the cigarette, eyes on his sleeping wife. He had to find a way to wake her, and to escape his new job.<br>
<br>
Eternity could be a long long time. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
....a voice, in common dark elven, outside his chamber door....days had passed, without a move from Riverdane, staring at Camille on the bed....the elite had stopped interrupting him from his thoughts....his thoughts had stopped making sense.....just hopelessness, tossing round and round in his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will not deny me passage!&quot; the new voice said, raising in pitch. &quot;Do you know what I went through to get here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; the elite replied. &quot;I have tried to tell you over and over, the Dark Prince is seeing no visitors....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am no mere visitor!&quot; the stranger said in indignation. &quot; I have served Innoruuk faithfully for 22 years! I was his champion in life, striving to bring the word and will of Hate to all corners of Norrath! NO one could hate better than me, no one!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, you don't seem to under...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Hells I don't! I was this close, THIS close to being pulled back by a resurrection! I saw the light, I was lifting up into it. And i FOUGHT it! I fought my way back down into death, just to sit at the right hand of my Father. And now, after permanently succumbing my soul to this accursed place, you are telling me he is BUSY?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; the elite responded, resignedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then enough...of YOU!&quot; the stranger cried, and the sound of magical energy building filled the room. The sound of something being mesmerized. And then another sound.<br>
<br>
The sound of River's door being flung open.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Dark Prince, I have served you humbly for 22 years, and have delivered my soul to you across the boundary of death! Use me to serve your dark purpose, oh Lord!&quot;<br>
<br>
River turned in his chair to find a robed dark elf kneeling before him, head low to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up Vven.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
The dark elf looked up and blinked.<br>
<br>
&quot;River?? What the hells are you doing here?&quot; Vven got up and brushed dust off his robes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no.....nonono.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;Don't tell me Razor's Edge came up here and booted Inny for a few days, not after all I went through to get here and...&quot; The enchanter was obviously distraught.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, no....&quot; River interjected.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, cause, well, I refused to be resurrected after a bad turn in The Deep, and am sort of committed to Innoruuk now. How long ago did you lay siege?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord, this enchanter mesmerized me outside.&quot; the elite said, coming in, still blinking off the fog of his magical daze. &quot;Shall I have the invader's skin flayed off?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, no.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord.&quot; Vven repeated slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;MILORD???&quot; Vven cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, milord.&quot; the elite said, shooting Vven a dirty look and exiting the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;After all this, my body permanently down there, my soul permanently up here, you mean to tell me somehow you not only defeated Innoruuk, but are now the new God of Hate? You? A......HUMAN?&quot; If Vven could foam at the mouth, he would be at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been a long week.&quot; River said softly, sinking back into his chair. It was at this point Vven saw Camille on the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and...oh.&quot; For once Vven looked speechless. &quot;What happened here? Why isn't she...breathing or anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk trapped me into trading Camille's soul for my own life, Vven. I came back here to get her back, but all I have done is trapped myself as the new prince of Hate and locked camille in stasis. I need to discover what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let this all sink in. &quot;So you killed Innoruuk, for good, no coming back after a little while?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Innoruuk is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven let out a long sigh. &quot;Then I have sacrificed myself for nothing. I'm sorry River, but I wouldn't follow you on Norrath, I'm CERTAINLY not going to follow you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We need to find out where to begin. I need to find how to wake Camille. Who knows, if I can find a way to wake her from her slumber, maybe I can find a way to return you to your body. I am supposedly a god now. That must count for something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, then let's move. The longer I am up here the longer my body rots down there.&quot; Vven hitched up his robe from dragging on the ground and started to march out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on, I don't have a clue where to begin.&quot; River said, grabbing hold of the enchanter's sleeve.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was never into lore, or mythology, other than Innoruuk's teachings.&quot; Vven replied. &quot;You need someone with a little more history under his belt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone very smart...&quot; River said, stroking his chin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone with all the answers...&quot; Vven chimed in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone that knows Norrathian history backwards and forward...&quot; River added.<br>
<br>
Vven nodded. &quot;Someone short.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang.&quot; they said together. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 8:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> ...tick...<br>

&quot;I hate Ak'Anon.&quot; Vven murmured in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;So do I, brother, so do I.&quot; Riverdane agreed, squatting on his haunches in front of the small house, knocking hard on the door.<br>
<br>
Ak'Anon. Steamfront Mountains. Home of the gnomes, gnarled men, cute petite women, eternal tinkerers, gadget makers, masters of the lever and spring, creaters of clocks and modern tools. And all through the land, that persistant, maddening noise. Tick TOCK.<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Must be all this noise.&quot; River remarked. &quot;It's amazing gnomes can hear anything at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's because you are human!&quot; Vven snorted, rolling up his sleeve. &quot;Learn to knock with authority!&quot;. He rapped his knuckle against the door with a hrumph.<br>
<br>
And through it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Vven remarked, a little out of sorts. &quot;I passed my hand through, as if discorpreal.&quot; River just looked at him, and where his arm ended with the wrist flush against the door, hand passing through it as if the door didn't exist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I imagine, you being dead has something to do with that.&quot; River commented, watching Vven draw his hand from the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely. I am a ghost.&quot; Vven said with disgust. &quot;That should prove cumbersome.&quot;<br>
<br>
River knocked again. &quot;Whizbang, you old goat, let me in!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whether it be his shout or the occupants finally hearing the knock, the small door opened without a creak. Good old fashion Gnome Oil made sure of that.<br>
<br>
There in the framework of the miniature door, stood a tiny gnome woman with a rolling pin in one hand. Her eyes smiled when she saw River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well well, Riverdane Wyldechylde, I haven't seen you in ages!&quot; she exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Ms. Dustyboots.&quot; River said with a smile. The smell of some confection permeated the air. River may not need to eat, but the smell of good cooking still gave his senses a turn for the better.<br>
<br>
&quot;Call me Pedi, boy, or don't come calling at all!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You know better than that! And who is this with you? Oh..&quot; Now taking a close look at Vven. &quot;A dark elf. How...lovely. Well well come in, come in. I imagine the smell of my cooking isn't what brought you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven looked at the tiny door with an eyebrow raised. &quot;And how, madam, do you expect us to fit into this quaint little....doll house?&quot;<br>
<br>
But Pedi was already anticipating the question. She handed them both small vials. &quot;Just drink up and come in.&quot; she said. River took the small vial from her. Vven tried to, but it passed through his hand and shattered on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...my.&quot; she said, staring at the puddle on the ground. &quot;Perfectly good waste of a shrink potion. You do have a little problem, don't you, young man? Well, I'm afraid then you'll have to crawl in....&quot;<br>
<br>
River had already partaken in the contents of the vial, and was slowly changing form, shrinking down to Pedi's small stature.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hells I will crawl through the home of a gnome!&quot; Vven snorted. &quot;May Innoruuk forgive me.&quot; he murmured, reciting an incantation. And with a shimmer, his image changed to a small gnome, white beard and all. But he kept his bright blue skin. The effect was....disquieting.<br>
<br>
&quot;My, you look just like a...&quot; Pedi began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we proceed?&quot; Vven interrupted, pushing into the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend needs to learn to be polite!&quot; Pedi commented to River as he looked at her apologetically.<br>
<br>
&quot;That WAS him polite.&quot; River said, entering the house and closing the door behind him. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***    ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;WHIZBANG YOU HAVE VISITORS!&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane shook his head in a daze as the echoes of Pedi's shout reverberated through the house. For such a petite woman she certainly could give the bards a run for volume.<br>
<br>
A voice came from the doorway leading into the basement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Visitors? So soon? Blast them, they're early! I didn't expect the new guild applicants till noon!&quot; A crash of a chest being closed, then some more noise, something falling to the floor, followed by a lot of somethings falling to the floor, a string of colorful gnomish curses, and small feet pounding up wooden stairs.<br>
<br>
And that was just the beginning of his entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the third rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills and wielder of the Staff of the Four! I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to the Kromzek and ...&quot; Whizbang stopped mid-sentence, scratching his white goatee and looking at River and Vven.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; River smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't, go on.&quot; Vven interjected. &quot;Specially the scum of the Teir'Dal...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Scourge, my blue tainted cousin, scourge.&quot; Whizbang replied, peering at Vven. &quot;I must say, your pigmentation I have never seen before on a gnome. Although, I must have record of it somewhere in this house. No matter, I will find it after our business here is conducted. But yes, many a Teir'Dal has tasted the wrathe of my fire. If I had my way, I would enter Neriak itself and lay wast...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang...&quot; Pedi tried to cut in, but he shushed her with a wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;...lay waste to the twisted children of Innoruuk. Their sole purposes seem to be...&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi seemed more urgent. &quot;Whizbang, our guest is....&quot; she tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman, WHAT?&quot; Whizbang cried in frustration.<br>
<br>
She glared at him. &quot;Our guest is...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An inky.&quot; Vven supplied, with a crooked grin. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, meet Vven. An old aquaintance of mine.&quot; River offered. &quot;He was a Teir'Dal enchanter in life, thus this little illusion to enter your house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrummph.&quot; Whizbang hrummphed, &quot;Blue skin. A mockery of gnomes in my house. Well, River, you've got my attention.&quot; Then something dawned on him. &quot;You say '...was a Teir'Dal enchanter in life' Was. What is the meaning of that, does he not live now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorta dead, gnome.&quot; Vven answered. &quot;I'm not just blue because I'm a Teir'Dal. I'm blue cause I'm not breathing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang looked at River for a sign of a joke, and was more disturbed by the serious look on his old friends' face.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need to talk about this....and more, don't we, River.&quot; Whiz said. It was not a question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and more.&quot; River replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;To my basement. We will have privacy there.&quot; Whiz said, ushering them though the doorway to the staircase that led into his library. &quot;Pedi, please bring some refreshment, and join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh good,&quot; Pedi replied. &quot;I just made a fresh batch of Gnome Shaped Cookies...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang exploded. &quot;How many times do I have to tell you no Gnome Shape Cookies in this house! It's symbolic of cannibalism, I tell you, and I won't....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU'LL EAT THEM AND LIKE THEM!&quot; Pedi roared. River nearly tripped down the stairs. Whizbang's mouth snapped shut and he descended into the cool depths of the library. Pedi turned a warm smile on her still youthful face towards River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, watch your footing, gentlemen, and you can tell us all about it down below. Have a cookie?&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 11:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> ...inhale...<br>
<br>
&quot;You say Innoruuk is dead.&quot; Whizbang said after a pause. The two gnomes and River sat at an oak table, with a burning candle and platter of cookies on it, while Vven paced nervously around the room, glancing at the hundreds of titles of Whizbang's library.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dead.&quot; River replied, watching Whizbang's face for any sign of belief. Whizbang was impossible to read when lost in thought, and lost in thought he seemed. &quot;Or...gone at least. Done in, in some way. The Elite acknowledged me as their new master.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi's face was distraught. &quot;Poor poor Camille! Trapped in Hate. River, how could you have made that agreement with Innoruuk? Any of us could have told you she gave you her soul long ag...&quot; But she trailed off unfinished, as River turned to her with a look of such self loathing she was left speechless.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; he said softly.<br>
<br>
She patted his hand. &quot;Well, it is the curse of all things male to make at least one huge mistake in their lives.&quot; she said. &quot;Now it is time to fix it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And fix ME, River.&quot; Vven said from behind him. &quot;An eternity playing spook for a human is not my destiny. Not even Innoruuk had that cruel a sense of humor!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm WORKING on it.&quot; River replied testily. He turned back to Whizbang. &quot;So, Whiz, any advice? Do you even believe me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've never lied to me before, to my knowledge, River, and I don't expect you would concoct something this bizarre even as a joke. Plus no one would suffer the ravings of this dark elf,&quot; a gesture to Vven, met with a theatrical hiss from the enchanter, &quot;for no reason. So yes, I believe you. Do I know how to proceed? No. My mind is old, but something keeps dancing at the edge of it. Something important. Something I've read.&quot; His eyes got a very faraway look in the candlelight. &quot;What was it......what was it.....something you said tripped a switch....&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly his eyes focused in again. &quot;Yes! That's it. Camille. You had said you had at first thought when she drowned herself she was with Marr. Mithaniel Marr, not Erollsi, yes? Camille worshipped Mithaniel?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Whiz. How did you guess that? Most women worshipped Erollsi rather than Mithaniel, but Camille was different. She called Erollsi too soft for a woman of steel. How did you guess that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because it makes sense. It is all starting to make sense.&quot; Whizbang replied. But rather than look happy with his discovery, Whizbang's look became more and more worried, deep lines cutting into his forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;River,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;You say you haven't eaten or taken drink in almost a week, yet have suffered no desire or need for food or water? A result of your godhood? And you were able to will yourself to my doorstep from Hate, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; River replied, &quot;I haven't felt the need to eat or sleep or drink or....&quot;<br>
<br>
And before River could even react, Whizbang with quick movements pulled a long hair pin from Pedi's bun, and drove it into River's palm. <br>
<br>
&quot;What the OWWW DAMMIT!&quot; River cried as the pin drove itself in and through his palm. Whiz pulled the pin out and absently handed it to a shocked Pedi, staring at River's twitching palm. At first there was nothing, but then the blood began to flow, puddling in River's palm and dripping to the table. River glared at Whizbang, teeth gritted in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hells, and you call the Teir'Dal sadists...&quot;, Vven chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are mortal yet.&quot; Whizbang murmured. &quot;Pedi, your skills please.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pedi took River's palm into her hands and closed her eyes. From under her lids, a flash of blue light. And then, the pain was gone, the wound disappearing before River's eyes. He knew Pedi was a cleric of no meager skills, but the shock of what Whiz had done still left him rattled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz, what in the gods' names was that all about?&quot; River asked, accepting a handtowel Pedi handed to him to clean up the blood. She then swatted Whizbang hard on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;STOP stabbing the guests!&quot; she warned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation woman!&quot; Whizbang cried, rubbing the lump that began forming on his forehead. &quot;I needed to know for certain!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Know WHAT, Whiz?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you were still mortal. A god yet still mortal.&quot; Whizbang said, leaping up, starting to peer at books lining his walls. &quot;Mortal Hate. I needed to know.....&quot; A pause, two books pushed aside, more frantic searching. &quot;Where is it, where is it...?.....I needed to know if you were mortal Hate...damnation, where is my Lexicon Of Prophecy??&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi and Vven pointed at the same time about a foot to Whizbang's left, and uttered the same word.<br>
<br>
&quot;There.&quot;, they said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrrumph.&quot; Whiz hrrumphed, pulling it off the shelf. Dust flew as he did. He slapped it down flat on the table in such a rush that he forgot River's puddle of blood, and the blood spread out from around the book's edges like a crimson aura. Whizbang began flipping through the pages in a rush.<br>
<br>
&quot;So this book has the answer to my problem?&quot; River asked, trying to make out any of the words or runes that flipped by as Whiz tore through the pages.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid this is much bigger than your friend Vven's life, or Camille's or your own, River.&quot; Whiz said distractedly, still searching through the book.<br>
<br>
River's bloody hand clamped over Whiz's, stopping the gnome for a moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; River asked intensely.<br>
<br>
&quot;My boy,&quot; Whiz said, turning to look at River dead in the eyes. &quot;If I am not mistaken, what you have described to me with be the end of Norrath. Of all things living...and dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven leaned in close. &quot;Wizard do you mean...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;End Game.&quot; Whizbang whispered. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
...a held breath...<br>
<br>
&quot;End Game?&quot; River asked blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, End Game.&quot; Whizbang replied, turning back to his book. &quot;End Game is...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...the end of everything.&quot; Vven finished for him. &quot;The Apocolypse. The destruction of everything. Everything just ceasing to be. Even we follower of Hate feared the thought of End Game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whiz continue on, flipping pages frantically as River digested what he was hearing. &quot;End Game, called thus on the latter day belief that we are just pawns being shuffled by a higher intelligence, beings greater than we, somehow more real than even the gods themselves. An absurd theory, if you ask me, but an apt enough name. End Game. The end of all games, this game that is our existance. There is a prophecy tied into End Game, and an odd one at that. Now where the Hells is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;...You see, the prophecy itself is unique, in a very odd way, which lends it some notice, if not full credibility...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;This version is in Common Tongue, but I, a master linguist, noticed something very odd about it...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;It rhymes, not very cleverly, but it holds to a certain rhyming pattern. As most prophecies do....that was not the oddity...&quot;<br>
<br>
---Flip---<br>
<br>
---flipflip---<br>
<br>
&quot;But regardless of what language it is translated into, whether it the grunts of the Trollish folk, the lyrical language of the High Elves, the gutteral slang of the Teir'Dal, regardless of the language...&quot;<br>
<br>
---flip---<br>
<br>
&quot;It STILL rhymes.&quot;<br>
<br>
River looked at Whizbang in surprise. &quot;But you know over a dozen languages....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DOZENS.&quot; Whizbang corrected. His flipping through pages came to an end, and he peered at an open page.<br>
<br>
&quot;...that would make that coincidence almost....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...impossible. Aye. I know.&quot; Whizbang tapped the page. &quot;Here. I found it. Listen to this. Sound familiar?<br>
<br>
When Hate finds love and walks the lands<br>
With enchanted dead close at hand<br>
And Mithaniel's handmaiden lays in sleep<br>
The End of All has a promise to keep.<br>
<br>
See the players here? Hate walking the lands...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me.&quot; River replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Whizbang nodded. &quot;Then this....enchanted dead....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roughly translated into 'a dead enchanter.'&quot; Vven supplied.<br>
<br>
Again a nod from Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Mithaniel's handmaiden laying in sleep...Camille.&quot; Pedi finished. &quot;I'm getting goosebumps.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare for goosebumps on top of goosebumps, woman.&quot; Whizbang warned, and continued on:<br>
<br>
&quot;The grounds in one moon will crack and split<br>
And all known cities slip into the Pit.<br>
Norrath will light with unnatural flame<br>
As begins the process known as End Game.<br>
<br>
All living will die, all growing decay<br>
All that was created will wither away<br>
And how it began it will all fade away.<br>
Thus will occur on Judgement Day.&quot;<br>
<br>
River swallowed hard. &quot;In one moon. A month. All this that happened with me. My death, Innoruuk's lessons, Camille put to sleep, even Vven dying....all of this, is going to cause the end of everything within a month?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So it seems, according to this, and its accuracy so far leaves me little doubt that we are reading what WILL come.&quot; Whizbang mopped some sweat from his forehead with a sleeve. &quot;Do I think you caused it to be? No, I don't think you had any choice in this. This was put into motion at the beginning of time. But are you the catalyst? Aye, River, you most certainly are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more, gnome.&quot; Vven said, looking over Whizbang's shoulder. &quot;What else does it say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The first was the bad news.&quot; Whiz said, &quot;Now here....here is the good news:<br>
<br>
The only hope to deny that fate<br>
is to be championed by mortal Hate.<br>
To reverse it, Hate must pass a test.<br>
A test that is part journey, part quest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mortal Hate.&quot; River said. &quot;Me again. I can fix this, with a quest.&quot; He sighed deeply. &quot;Why does it seem I am forever doing quests? Forever quests...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, &quot;Whizbang said, &quot;We get to the quest:<br>
<br>
Only when Fear can overcome fear, <br>
And a Nightmare shed a single tear<br>
And that tear does burn in Natural flame<br>
Can one stop the beginning of End Game.<br>
<br>
A sacrifice pure of mortal life<br>
When War finds peace from eternal strife<br>
And Love denied will even the score.<br>
Then all will be as it was Before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Welllllll.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Doesn't this seem easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It makes no sense, Whiz.&quot; River said in frustration. &quot;When Fear can overcome fear? Love denied? Riddles? Do you understand any of this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Whiz replied, &quot;But I didn't understand the first part either until you told me your story. Give me a little time and we can...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, from upstairs and outside, alarms began to sound from far off. The Gnomish Public Warning System, blaring its horns. In the distance, screams of women and children were heard. and then suddenly, to punctuate it, an awful banging on Whizbang's door upstairs. The ceiling creaked from the pounding, and several books slipped off the shelves to thump to the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, what NOW?&quot; Whizbang exclaimed.<br>
<br>
It was answered by one deafening word from upstairs outside his door.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot;<br>

<br>
And up the stairs she went.<br>
<br>
The banging continued till River feared the walls would come down. And the sound of a large crowd forming outside.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright, it's alright!&quot; Pedi's voice carried clearly to them in the basement. &quot;This ogre is trained and on a special job for Whizbang. Your children are safe. Go back to your business now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogre?&quot; Riverdane asked Whizbang with a raised eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't have the slightest clue of what that woman of mine is talking about.&quot; Whizbang said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
Then Pedi's voice again, as the murmur of the crowd dwindled and faded away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad ogre! How many times have I told you, come at night?&quot; A long sigh from her. &quot;Here drink this up and come in before the townfolk stick you with pitchforks.&quot;<br>
<br>
A crunching sound and the tinkle of breaking glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drink! Not eat. You...oh never mind. You are shrunk now, come in come in....watch your head.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Miz Pedi.&quot; her visitor said. &quot;But me so hungry. Me knew today Cookie Day, and no snacks from Miz Cami since she all cold and dead at guild house.&quot; And then the sound of cookies being devoured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah.&quot; Whizbang said, looking at River. &quot;Not just any 'ogga'. YOUR ogga.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a pet ogre?&quot; Vven said in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not exactly.&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the loud munching stopped, and the sound of sniffing filled the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me nose smell something not smelled in long time.&quot; her visitor said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh?&quot; Pedi asked innocently. The sound of the basement door quietly shutting was barely audible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya ya.&quot; the ogre said. &quot;Me smell...&quot; Sniff. &quot;Me smell...&quot;<br>
<br>
And suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps, a lamp crashing to the ground, a chair tipping back, and the basement door swinging open with a crash.<br>
<br>
&quot;No no no!&quot; Pedi cried, &quot;You can't go down there....&quot;<br>
<br>
Footsteps banging down the stairs, and an immense figure, even shrunk down as it had to be to even enter the house, loomed in the stairway. One of the ugliest, biggest (scaled down), STUPIDEST looking ogres any of them had ever seen. Weaponry was strapped to its sides and back, making it look like a porcupine, so many sharp edges protruded from its armored body. There it stood, looking for all the world like one of the most dangerous creatures in all the land. With a huge, stupid smile on its face.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; it said happily, pointing at River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk.&quot; River sighed. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;How....cute.&quot; Vven drawled. &quot;Is it housebroken?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He breaks houses.&quot; River replied, watching Ramluk carefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga knew!&quot; Ramluk said proudly, beating his chest. &quot;Me knew me smelled Riverdane!&quot; Then his face fell, and the smile dropped. &quot;Miz Cami cold and no moving at guildhouse. Grelin made me go away when I try wake her up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, Rammie, I know.&quot; River said softly. &quot;She's sick, and I have to find her some medicine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me sorry Miz Cami sick.&quot; Ramluk frowned. &quot;Miz Cami make number four best cookies. Miz Pedi number two. My momma is number one. Big momma make best cookies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is between Camille and Pedi?&quot; Vven asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me told you! No one!&quot; Ramluk replied. Vven rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;And this is one of your guildmates?&quot; he snickered. &quot;No wonder it took your guild so long to break Hate...&quot;<br>
<br>
River shot him a murderous look. &quot;Didn't take much to drop your god, did it?&quot; Vven was silent.<br>
<br>
Whizbang was oblivious to it all. His eyes were darting back and forth between Ramluk and a rack of vintage gnomish spirits a few feet from the ogre. Back and forth. Back and forth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk....&quot; Whiz said carefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ramluk said, stepping off the bottom step. He turned to Whiz, and one of his swords, arcing from the swing of his body, almost tipped the rack over.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOTHING!&quot; Whiz cried, hands up in protest. &quot;Nothing! Just....don't...move.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silly old fool!&quot; Pedi cried in disgust. &quot;The world is about to end and you're worried about your BOOZE?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Those bottle are older than your mother LOOKS!&quot; Whizbang snapped back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you dare bring my mother into this, you old goa...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; River exclaimed, sinking onto a stool. That stopped them midsentence. &quot;Let's figure out what to do here, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang cleared his throat. &quot;Of course, of course. Ok. Now, where to begin. Let's look at the prophecy first as a written piece. I already have a few theories on what this may mean. Or some of it, at least.&quot; He pointed at a few words on the page before him. &quot;Notice these words, here, here, here....a few more here. Capitilized in the middle of sentences. Like the first line, 'When Hate finds love...&quot;. What is the writer referring to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To me.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes to you, but not you as Riverdane. You as in the God of Hate. The diety. The capitilization is to name you a god, your proper title. Notice, handmaiden and enchanted dead, not capitilized. They aren't gods, no need to address them with respect or signifigance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, so it is my title.&quot; River said slowly, &quot;So these other capitilized words....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...are not actually words at all, but signify other gods, yes.&quot; Whizbang finished. &quot;At least, that's what it looks like, and seems as good a place to start as any.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So this first line in the quest part,&quot; Vven interjected. &quot;'Only when Fear overcomes fear....' That's where we begin, aye? In the Plane of Fear, with Cazic-Thule, god of Fear?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is what I am thinking.&quot; Whizbang agreed. &quot;Though what or who Cazic may be afraid of I don't have the foggiest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, Vven,&quot; River said. &quot;Have you memorized this prophecy yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven pointed to his head. &quot;All locked away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Whizbang.&quot; River said, turning to the gnome. &quot;You have started me off on my journey. Wish us luck, old man. The fate of the world depends on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which is exactly why I am going with you.&quot; Whizbang said, standing up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Whiz, no...&quot; River said gently. &quot;This whole thing is very dangerous, and I can't take the responsibility of getting you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...killed?&quot; Whizbang said. His eyes narrowed. &quot;River, I have seen more years on this world than you have hairs in that mane of yours. And for all its faults, I like this world, and intend to add more years on it. If you think this wizard is going to sit idly by while a young foolhardy shadowknight and his partner Vven the Unfriendly Ghost play with the fate of it, you are sadly mistaken. I am going with you to record the events that transpire for the sake of history, and to consult and decipher the rest of the prophecy, and you will not stop me, or my name isn't Whizbang Dustyboots!&quot;<br>
<br>
One look at Whizbang's stance, and River knew his argument was lost.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, old man.&quot; River said. &quot;I wash my hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if you did, ogga over there wouldn't have smelled you.&quot; Vven chuckled nastily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, gentlemen.&quot; Pedi said, removing her apron. &quot;Let me get my armor....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are NOT going.&quot; Whizbang declared.<br>
<br>
Pedi opened a closet and removed a red runed metal breastplate and began fastening it on with the leather straps. She did not look at Whizbang as she spoke. &quot;Whizbang, I have seen more years on this world than you have hairs missing from your head. And for all its faults, especially crotchety old wizards, I like this world, and intend...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ALRIGHT.&quot; Whizbang exclaimed in defeat. &quot;I get the point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides,&quot; she said, suddenly soft. &quot;Who's going to look after you, old man?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang's frown did not give way, but his eyes smiled, as his wife went back to adjusting her armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where we go?&quot; Ramluk said, breaking the silence loudly, beaming at everyone in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;We?&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miz Cami sick, me help.&quot; Ramluk said simply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk....&quot; River began.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Miz Pedi go. If she get sick, no more gnome cookies!&quot; Something in the ogre's tone left no argument. Riverdane sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright Ram. I can use the muscle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Pedi remarked, looking at them, final piece of armor in place. &quot;Don't we make a fine group.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If Innoruuk could see me now.&quot; Vven muttered. &quot;Grouped with a human, two gnomes and an OGRE.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where we go?&quot; Ramluk repeated again.<br>
<br>
Riverdane stood up, pushing away the stool.<br>
<br>
&quot;We start in the Feeroot, Ramluk. Your birth place. And then...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk smiled like a child. But River was not smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;...to the Plane of Fear.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;No need Whiz.&quot; River replied. &quot;One of my perks. I'll take us right to Ferroot itself. I don't know any safe area in Fear, so we'll go in the old fashioned way.&quot; He closed his eyes, and concentrated. A flash of light, and they were gone.<br>
<br>
They reappeared next to a large tree growing out of a hillside in the dank forest of Feeroot, home of the ogres. Crickets chirped and odd birds called out. The noise from serpents was so loud it almost sounded like one long continuous hiss. River pointed to the left of the tree. <br>
<br>
&quot;That rock face is illusory.&quot; he said. &quot;There are some spectres guarding the gateway to Fear. I'll just pull them out one at a time, and we'll dispatch them easily enough.&quot; And with that, River stepped through the rock as if it were air and disappeared from view.<br>
<br>
A short wait.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a spectre incoming....&quot; River called from within the rock. Ramluk drew out two wicked looking swords and braced himself. They waited.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River called out.<br>
<br>
Vven tensed up and peered at the rock, waiting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River said again, this time a little more urgently.<br>
<br>
Pedi glanced nervously at Whizbang, whose brows furled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Add.&quot; River repeated, voice going up a notch in pitch. <br>
<br>
Ramluk shifted impatiently.<br>
<br>
And out came Riverdane, with four spectres in tow, swinging their long scythes at him, skeletal faces hungry from within their hooded garb.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared, stepping into the mess. &quot;Help me start barshin' a spectre!&quot; His swords swung up to meet the first spectre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep.&quot; Vven murmured, splaying out his fingers. One by one, the other three spectres stopped moving, mesmerized by the enchanter's spell.<br>
<br>
Ramluk and the first spectre battled, swords against scythe. River chopped at the spectre's back, Reaver cutting into the bone that made up the spectre, trying to split it open. It was tough work, the spectre being powered by some unearthly force.<br>
<br>
A swing, a chop, and the scythe cut a gash deep into Ramluk's arm. The ogre winced in pain, arm going dead, his sword dropped to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing a spectre!&quot; Pedi cried, eyes flashing blue as she chanted the heal spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you're done healing the enemy, &quot; Vven said dryly. &quot;You may want to fix the ogga.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops.&quot; Pedi said redfaced. &quot;Healing Ramluk!&quot; Again the flash of blue light, and Ramluk's arm began to mend.<br>
<br>
Immediately, the Spectre turned toward Pedi and began chopping at her. She dodged in a panic to the side.<br>
<br>
Ramluk kicked hard at the spectre, to no avail. He swung and connected on the spectre's back, but still it chased Pedi around the area while she attempted to evade it. Another kick from Ramluk went unheeded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if you bothered to haste him, he may have some control.&quot; River called out to Vven. &quot;Or did you forget he was a warrior?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops.&quot; Vven said sheepishly. &quot;Warriors blades, dance!&quot; And Vven's fingers shot white light into Ramluk. Suddenly Ramluk's swings increased speed dramatically.<br>
<br>
The spectre noticed, and turned back to Ramluk. A slice of the scythe caught Ramluk in the side, and he staggered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing....Ramluk!&quot; Pedi cried out again, after a disoriented pause. Blue light, and Ramluk's side began to heal.<br>
<br>
And once more the spectre was all over Pedi.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk, didn't they teach you to TAUNT in warrior school?&quot; River cried in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me sorry.&quot; Ramluk said miserably, kicking at the spectre again. &quot;Me must have missed dat class.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of this!&quot; Whizbang called out, leaping into the fray, hands glowing white. He glowered at the spectre. &quot;When you see your god, tell him Whizbang Dustyboots sent you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang's hands pulsed white light radiating from his body, disintigrating the spectre to dust.<br>
<br>
And pulsing out to smash the other three spectres out of their daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooops?&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;How many times do I have to tell you no area spells when we have an enchanter??&quot; Pedi sighed.<br>
<br>
Ramluk kicked at a spectre, but they ignored him, all chasing the now fleeing Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind, Ram, I'll tank.&quot; River said. his hands flashed darkly, as he called forth spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;Disease eat away at this foe....&quot; he called, shooting a cloud of green smoke from his fingers at the first spectre. It enveloped the spectres body, and it turned on him.<br>
<br>
River pointed at the second. &quot;Shadows, make this specter creep....&quot; And black smoke engulfed the second spectre, as it turned, as if through mud, and slowly came toward him.<br>
<br>
Then the third. &quot;Hellfire, boil the marrow of this spectre!&quot; And red smoke this time, surrounding the third and drawing it in a frenzy toward him.<br>
<br>
Good, River thought, got them off Whiz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice move, genius.&quot; Vven said, staring at him. &quot;You just dotted all three. Have fun.&quot; And Vven threw up his hands and sat abruptly down, watching.<br>
<br>
River opened his mouth to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Whizbang said, running back, &quot;We know. 'Ooops'.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk, tank mez the left one.&quot; River said. &quot;I have the middle. Whiz, root and shoot the third.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang muttered something in gnomish. Roots suddenly flailed up from the earth, twisting themselves into the skeletal form of the spectre to the right. It held it fast to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Whizbang said to the glowering trapped spectre. &quot;You hate gnomes.&quot; <br>
<br>
BOOM.<br>
<br>
Whizbang blew smoke from his fingertips, having unleashed a firey bolt that all but destroyed the spectre.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Ramluk had one engaged and was methodically beating it down into the ground. The disease cloud from River was weakening its bone structure, and Ramluk's slices and pounding on it shattered it into little pieces.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, River was still locked in battle with the last spectre. It drew back its scythe high to chop at River's head. That's when River saw his opening.<br>
<br>
His hand shot out into the robe of the spectre, hand clamping around the bone that made the spectre's neck. His hand glowed with blacklight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye bye.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
--PULSE--<br>
<br>
With a muffled pop, Riverdane's harmtouch blew the spectre's head off its body. The arms holding the scythe went limp as the body collapsed lifelessly to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Vven said, standing up. &quot;Don't we just suck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Warming up.&quot; River said defensively. &quot;Shall we enter Fear?&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that he trudged back into the illusory slab of rock. They warily followed him, Whizbang in the back.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we're the only hope the world has for survival,&quot; he muttered to Pedi. &quot;I feel sorry for the world.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
A gateway of Fire. Portal to the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what's on the other side.&quot; Riverdane said to his four companions. &quot;And I don't know if it will acknowledge me as a god. Nor if it did if it would matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So basically...&quot; Whizbang began.<br>
<br>
&quot;....I don't know anything. Right.&quot; River finished. &quot;Shall we?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a nod from Whiz, all five stepped through the fire. It crackled and hissed as they passed through, but none were burned.<br>
<br>
Into Fear. A huge hilly area, with twisted, insane architecture and monoliths, with a large building in the center surrounded by a flaming moat. Fear, home of Cazic Thule, where when the skies wept, they cried blood rather than rain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Portal seems clear.&quot; Vven said, eyes darting around.<br>
<br>
River looked off to his left. &quot;So does the way to the west wall.&quot; River commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too clear.&quot; Vven added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone's here.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;This is too empty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; A loud booming voice called, the sound echoing through the grassy hills.<br>
<br>
And then the sound of chuckling to the west, on the other side of a hillock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ake got owned again.&quot; said a mild voice, with an odd ogre accent. &quot;Who wants to get get him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not me, I have to med.&quot; said a second person, clearly human. &quot;Tremas, you get him this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizzie gets no love.&quot; the third voice, presumably Tremas. It had the rich bass tones of a Eruidite. &quot;Where do you think I get this mana from, Aamedor, my good looks?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you stored it all in that huge forehead of yours.&quot; the ogre voice cut in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kiss my ass, Pron.&quot; Tremas said back. &quot;Alright, I'll get Ake this time. But give me a little downtime too, not like we doing this with a chanter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely,&quot; Riverdane said. &quot;Promethian Order is here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I take it this isn't a good thing?&quot; Pedi said, looking at the expression on River's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; River hedged. &quot;I'm fine with most of them. Aamedor is old Razor's Edge. Let's just say Akethadar and I have a little history. Let's go say hello.&quot; And they followed him up and over the hill.<br>
<br>
Promethian Order. One of the oldest and affluent military guilds of Norrath. Acceptance into the ranks of Promethian Order was akin to an adventurer coming of age. Its members had seen many things other guilds only dream of doing. And there were two of the members, sitting among a pile of corpses of the denizens of Fear. Dead scarelings, phoboplasms, nightmares, turmoil toads littered the camp site. And in the middle, Pron, a huge ogre warlord in full battle gear, and Aamedor, one of Promethian Order's high priests and former member of River's guild. Tremas was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
Aamedor saw them first. &quot;Hey, River.&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;And Whiz, Pedi. What brings you here? Alliance coming up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, Aam.&quot; River said, clasping wrists with the cleric. Whizbang nodded his hello. &quot;Actually, here for Cazic Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh.&quot; Pron chuckled. &quot;Promethian is coming here in a little while. The only thing left will be his corpse, I'm afraid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk was staring with his mouth open at Pron's array of weaponry and gear. &quot;Ogga!&quot; he said in amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Pron said in perfect common. &quot;I am of ogre descent.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You talk funny.&quot; Ramluk said, a confused look on his stupid face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was educated in the finest schools in the Plane of Knowledge, if that's what you refer to as 'funny'.&quot; Pron remarked loftily. Then his eyes narrowed as he looked at Ramluk's armor. &quot;My gods, man, where did you get your armor? Did you mother make it for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk looked at his feet with embarrassment, an emotion ill-suited to one his size. &quot;Ya, Big Momma make me armors.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then in came Tremas, dragging the dead body of a human. Tremas was dressed in an ornately decorate robe of many hues, his hood partially covering the freakishly high forehead that was the staple look of Erudite men. The corpse he carried in was dressed in the light garb of a professional monk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Riv, what's shakin'?&quot; Tremas asked. Tremas, publicity officer of Promethian, had dealt with River often in the past when the two guilds had bumped heads. &quot;And Whizbang....wiz power....!&quot; And Tremas made a symbol with his hand that Whiz smiled and emulated. Pedi sighed. Vven just watched quietly, looking around, waiting for anything to appear and leap at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ake bit it again, Fright is up and deathtouching.&quot; Tremas said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Must be...unpleasant.&quot; Vven commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hah,&quot; Tremas said. &quot;I swear he likes it. I think he's a rez junkie. All pullers must be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rezzing Akethadar....&quot; Aamedor intoned, hands and eyes glowing with blue light. The light shot out from Aamedor's hands to infuse the corpse of Akethadar. And Akethadar's eyes snapped open.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO MED BEFORE I BEGIN PULLING AGAIN.&quot; Akethadar said loudly, pulling himself to his feet.<br>
<br>
Ramluk winced at the noise. &quot;No need to shout...&quot; Pedi said.<br>
<br>
Akethadar favored her with a dour look, and then spotted Riverdane.<br>
<br>
&quot;River.&quot; he said, striding up to him. &quot;So, progressing from stealing camps in The Grey to stealing them in Fear, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you last time, Ake,&quot; River sighed. &quot;I was new to the area and didn't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you then, and I am telling you now.&quot; Akethadar cut him off. &quot;You will not stand in the way or interfere with Promethian Order or we will march across you like a rug. Stay out of our way and your lives can go on in the mundane way they always do. Get in my way and we will sweep you aside like the dust you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
River held his temper. &quot;We're not here to interfere with your raid, Ake. I just need to speak with Cazic-Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
Akethadar looked at him incredulously. And then laughed. Loudly. His three companions joined in.<br>
<br>
&quot;You five are going to walk into the home of Cazic?&quot; he asked. &quot;YOU five? We just cleared most of fear with four people and WE wouldn't just walk in there.&quot; He chuckled nastily. &quot;Remember to consent and after we destroy Cazic, I'll have Aamedor here resurrect your dead bodies.&quot; And then, not glancing again at them, he turned to his three companions.<br>
<br>
&quot;I AM GOING TO PULL. BE READY FOR SINGLES APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH.&quot; And he disappeared over the hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;MUST he shout like that?&quot; Pedi asked, frowning.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think it's all those rezzes.&quot; Tremas said, tapping his forehead pointedly. &quot;That can't be healthy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, River, he's right.&quot; Aamedor said gently. &quot;You guys are going to die if you go near Cazic Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane motioned for his four companions to follow him and headed north.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll see, Aamedor.&quot; he said over his shoulder. &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
A moat filled with flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright now,&quot; River said, looking at the wall of flame before them. &quot;How do we cross this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just cross.&quot; Whizbang said, walking through the flames. He disappeared from view. Vven shrugged and followed him. Pedi exchanged a look of uncertainty with River, and then lowered her head in determination and trudged into the flaming moat. Ramluk followed, and River picked up the end.<br>
<br>
COLD. The flames in the moat surrounding Cazic's home were freezing cold, cutting through to the very marrow in River's bones. He found his companions shivering on the other side. Except Vven, who was tapping his foot impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Next time, Whiz, a little preparation for that!&quot; River said, body still in shock from the freeze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you have gone through so readily?&quot; Whizbang asked, rubbing his hands together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, snowballs, whenever you're ready, I'd like to get my body back so I can freeze with you.&quot; Vven said. &quot;Can we move on now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River,&quot; Pedi said. &quot;Do you know what you're doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; River said simply. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
They trudged up the sloping embankment that led to the pyramid-like structure that held the God of Fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Whiz said.<br>
<br>
Standing just inside the entrance to the pyramid were ten huge looming creatures, with humanoid bodies and heads akin to massive squid. They turned as one to face the group, and their tenticled mouths gaped wide with a collective roar.<br>
<br>
&quot;This, I think,&quot; Whiz whispered to River. &quot;...is your cue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Amygdalan Knights, stay your hand! I am Riverdane Wyldechylde, heir of Innoruuk, and Prince of Hate! These people with me are under my care and are not to be harmed!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really now?&quot; came a voice from the back. The amy knights parted with military precision to either side, revealing the figure of a huge golem, body dripping molten clay from which it was formed. Its red burning eyes glowed malevolently from under its deep brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lovely, Fright, Cazic's general. Here comes a deathtouch.&quot; Whiz said from the corner of his mouth. &quot;Vven, go do your thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What thing?&quot; Vven whispered urgently, as Fright began lumbering forward slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just...&quot; Whiz said, &quot;Be YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, that's easy.&quot; Vven said, stepping in front of River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhhh, a mud thing! Aren't you a big one.&quot; Vven addressed Fright. &quot;Too bad I left four of your girlfriends dead at the portal. I must say tho, you are much wider in the hip area than they were. I guess too many pieces of cheesecake at the Spook Tea Party and your diet went all to Hells, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright's eyes scowled.<br>
<br>
&quot;VVEN!&quot; he shouted, voice booming across the landscape. Fright's eyes light with hellfire as he sentenced his deathtouch.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; Vven said, unharmed. &quot;With two 'v''s. People screw that up all the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright blinked.<br>
<br>
River surpressed a smile and stepped forward. &quot;I told you, they are under my protection, Fright.&quot; River said. &quot;Now take me to Cazic and do not attempt to interfere in business between gods again, or I will have Ramluk here in your position while you pick weeds along the moat for the rest of your existance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright seemed agitated. &quot;Well, the boss is not accepting visitors right now, your Excell...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NOW!&quot; River barked. &quot;Enough of your chatter! Or I will sic these rabid gnomes upon you to gnaw upon your ankles!&quot;<br>
<br>
River glance quickly at his companions. Pedi hissed at Fright. Whizbang just rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, your Excellence.&quot; Fright sighed, and motioned for them to follow him through the ranks of amy knights.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't we getting a bit dramatic?&quot; Whizbang said quietly, eyebrow arched. &quot;Rabid gnomes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go with it.&quot; River replied, striding foreward. &quot;I never claimed I was an actor.&quot;<br>
<br>
And they disappeared in the home of Cazic Thule.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/03 7:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;Um, Boss, Innoruuk is here.&quot; Fright said from within the room he disappeared into.<br>
<br>
&quot;He is?&quot; came a small, high pitched little voice. &quot;Thank Us he's here! I heard he was dead! Send him in send him in!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright poked out his massive head. &quot;He'll see you, Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot; River said, not correcting him. He led the five into the room, brushing past Fright.<br>
<br>
And almost screamed.<br>
<br>
A huge lumbering behemoth of a creature was rushing towards him, made up of earth, mud, twisted roots, vines like veins running across its body, moving at a dizzying speed at him with its massive maw agape. Just looking at it almost drove River to insanity. Listening to the sharp intake of breath behind him he imagined the others were likewise terrified out of their wits.<br>
<br>
Cazic-Thule was rushing at them.<br>
<br>
And speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you thank you thank you Innoruuk!&quot; it cried in that high pitched girl's voice. &quot;I have been so worried that I was in this alon....&quot; Suddenly, for all its tremendous weight, it screeched to a halt, took one good look at them, and screamed like a woman. Cazic dove behind Fright and peeked out over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh My Us! Who the Hells are you??&quot; he cried, trembling.<br>
<br>
Vven burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk is dead, Cazic.&quot; River said, stepping forward, shooting Vven a dirty look that almost silenced him, but not quite. &quot;I am the new Prince of Hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my, I was afraid of that!&quot; Cazic said, shaking. &quot;I heard Innoruuk was killed, but I didn't want to believe it! If Innoruuk could be slain, then how much security do any of us have? None, I say! We have none! Oh woe the day!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I seriously don't believe this.&quot; Vven commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come...&quot; River began, searching. &quot;To....help you. I need to know, why are you in this state, Cazic? What has you so afraid?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Them!&quot; Cazic whispered from behind Fright. Fright rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is them, Cazic?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
A voice outside cut them off. &quot;Sir, that monk is getting close to the moat again, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonono!&quot; Cazic wailed. &quot;Make it go away, Fright, make it go away!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright sighed. &quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; he boomed in an earth-shattering voice. A pause and then, &quot;Ok, Boss, I bought you some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'll be back....&quot; Cazic whispered in terror. &quot;They always come back...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute wait a minute...&quot; Vven said, a look of disbelief on his amused face. &quot;You are afraid of PROMETHIAN ORDER? That's 'them?'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are they here yet??&quot; Cazic shrieked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hahhah NO, but they should be, you COWARD, just to boot you out of this PLANE!&quot; Vven mocked. &quot;Boy, did I ever pick the right god to worship! Even if the great white hope here killed him,&quot; ...a gesture to a fuming River...&quot;....at least I bet he didn't go down screaming like a RANGER! What is WRONG with you?? You're a god, for gods' sakes. Stand up STRAIGHT!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DON'T HIT ME!&quot; Cazic shrieked. Even Ramluk sighed in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; Pedi asked quietly, &quot;Do any of your books mention Cazic being a....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...sissy pants? No.&quot; Whizbang replied.<br>
<br>
Vven started pacing. &quot;So aptly named, the God of Fear. I can't believe they let a creature as pitiful as you run this plane! No wonder no one ever sees you walking around outside, you're probably afraid of the fire that surrounds your own MOAT.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't always like this!&quot; Cazic cried, chest heaving. &quot;Just they started coming, every week, Promethian Order, with their sharp swords and wizards with fireballs and...every week. Marching in, MARCH MARCH MARCH destroying everything in their path like a swarm of locusts! A wizard epic here, an enchanter epic there, always knocking me unconscious and ripping out my brain! Do you have ANY idea how painful that is, to wake up to find your BRAIN missing?&quot; He searched their faces for any sign of compassion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, can't say I do.&quot; Whizbang tried lamely. Only Ramluk was nodding in sympathy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then fight BACK!&quot; Vven exploded. &quot;You're a GOD! Ok ok ok, how many death-touchers do you have? Fat boy over there and who else?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dread. He's on a coffee break.&quot; Cazic said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's ALWAYS on a coffee break....&quot; Fright grumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;TWO death-touchers.&quot; Vven confirmed. &quot;And all you do is death-touch their scout, a monk. He's a trained PROFESSIONAL. It's his JOB to lead you into SUBMISSION!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, he's the closest one...&quot; Fright began defensively. <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course he's the closest, they MEAN for him to be the closest! Ok ok ok. You, Thunder Thighs, you go get your buddy Dread in here. I'm going to show your boss here how to be a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fright looked around a little lost, but then realizing Cazic wasn't going to order him or stop him, marched out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok first things first.&quot; Vven said, inspecting Cazic like a bug. &quot;That voice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My voice?&quot; Cazic said meekly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that 'I spent ten years in a Trollish Prison' voice. Gotta go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want...?&quot; Cazic asked uncertainly. &quot;An accent?...or something?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DEEPER!&quot; Vven exclaimed, &quot;Ferocious! Terrifying!&quot; He turned. &quot;Ramluk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like THAT.&quot; Vven said. River just watched in amazement as Vven ranted. &quot;Think like an ogre, but more terrifying! Repeat after Ramluk! 'You will not evade me!'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WILL NOT INVADE ME!&quot; Ramluk repeated a happy growl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please do not invade me!&quot; Cazic squeaked. Vven sighed in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok ok ok work on that. Next, strategy. Now get Dread and...&quot; Vven suddenly paused, and looked around the room. &quot;Um, guys, could you give me and old Cazic here a few minutes alone? We need to talk, bad guy to bad guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not on your life.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh this will NEVER work!&quot; Cazic said, throwing up his hands in despair. And then....he started crying. Big wracking sobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't HAVE a life!&quot; Vven hissed. &quot;And neither do any of you, unless we fulfill this quest and have Fear overcome fear. So CUT ME SOME SLACK!&quot;<br>
<br>
River stared at Vven for a long hard time. &quot;Ok, Vven.&quot; he said finally. &quot;All you.&quot; And he motioned for Whiz, Ram and Pedi to follow him out to the waiting area, where they waited.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
&quot;AKETHADAR!&quot; Fright bellowed from across the land.<br>
<br>
And waited.<br>
<br>
Then, after what seemed an eternity, they heard a small tittering coming from the room. Cazic presumably.<br>
<br>
&quot;LAUGH LIKE A GOD!&quot; Vven bellowed, but you could hear triumph in his voice.<br>
<br>
And then the titter deepened in pitch, into a chortle, and grew, insanely in volume.<br>
<br>
Vven came out of the room, with a smug look on his face. &quot;Let's go back to the Promethian camp, shall we?&quot; he said. &quot;My job here is done.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do?&quot; River said, following Vven with his crew in tow as Vven stepped out of the pyramid.<br>
<br>
&quot;I taught him all about fear.&quot; Vven said replied nonchalantly. &quot;Let's get to that camp, you won't want to miss this. But I guaruntee you, this part of the quest is done. That boy doesn't fear ANYTHING anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
And ringing in the halls of the pyramid, the deep malevolent insane laughter confirmed that it was true.<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Aamedor looked at them with a sad smile. &quot;Decided it wasn't worth it, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For once you used your head, Wyldechylde.&quot; Akethadar sneered, seeing the five trudge back to his camp. &quot;Leave Cazic to the professionals.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're done with Cazic.&quot; Riverdane said evenly. &quot;Just wanted to warn you he may be...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're done with Cazic?&quot; Akethadar laughed. &quot;What did you go there to do? Take notes for your next wipe?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually...&quot; River began,<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Vven said, cutting River off. &quot;That's exactly what we did. Um, Whiz, you may want to prep for a gate outta here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang looked at Vven for a moment, and after meeting the enchanter's eyes, sat down immediately and started to recall the words to one of his portal spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea Whiz.&quot; Akethadar agreed. &quot;Port these losers out of here. And honestly, I thought Walkers on a higher teir than these amateurs. You really should watch what company you keep, gnome.&quot; Whizbang frowned, but continued to prepare his spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven, what did I need to come here to see?&quot; River mumbled angrily. &quot;Promethian Order's raid leader throwing yet another slew of insults?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'lllll seeee.&quot; Vven singsonged softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;ALRIGHT GUYS.&quot; Akethadar boomed, &quot;I'M GOING TO START PULLING THE GORGOLOSKS IN A SECOND. BE READY TO....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AAMEDOR!&quot; a deafening voice shouted from the north. Aamedor stiffened suddenly, and tipped over on his side, face the gray ash of the dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see,&quot; Vven explained with a smile. &quot;I explained why wait for them to come to your door, to identify whom to deathtouch, when I had the names of their healer....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;TREMAS!&quot; boomed another voice to the south. Tremas went rigid like a board, eyes wide in shock, and pitched straight forward, dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and their porter?&quot; Vven continued happily.<br>
<br>
Akethadar and Pron exchanged looks as Whizbang's chanting grew faster in speed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wyldechylde, what have you done?&quot; Akethadar began. &quot;If you meddled with...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WILL NOT INVADE ME, PRON!&quot; came the loudest voice of them all, sounding like a thunderclap going off in a stormy sky. Pron suddenly winked out of sight, vanishing into thin air. And then the horrid sound of an ogre screaming somewhere in the distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Close, big guy, close. EVADE.&quot; Vven sighed to himself.<br>
<br>
Riverdane stared at Vven in horror. &quot;You just massacred them...&quot;<br>
<br>
Akethadar had thrown himself to the ground and was laying very very still, the defensive position of a monk feigning death to avoid notice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nah...&quot; Vven said. &quot;Promethian Order has more clerics than the Temple of Marr. They'll have this recovered in an hour. But for now, our blubbering God of Chicken now has his confidence back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane shot Vven a venemous look and then turned his attention back to Akethadar. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ake,&quot; he offered urgently. &quot;We still have room, port out of here with us, before....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't port anwhere with you, Wyldechylde.&quot; Akethadar replied, his voice full of hate. &quot;You screwed up again and meddled in the business of Promethian Order.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh don't be an ass.&quot; Vven said. &quot;He's giving you a chance to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll pay for this, River.&quot; Akethadar swore. &quot;If it's the last thing I do, I'll have your guild destroyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Akethadar....&quot; River tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot; Vven cut in. &quot;Have it your way.&quot; He turned and cupped his hands to his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;HEY CAZIC!&quot; he shouted, &quot;You know that monk that was giving you that trouble?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go now Whiz, hurry.&quot; River said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Going.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Hold onto your seats!&quot; And they began to shimmer from view.<br>
<br>
&quot;HE'S FAKING!&quot; Vven finished with a smile.<br>
<br>
And they were gone. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xuakalzilthane>XuakalZilthane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 11:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> Damnit!

Have you ever ONCE thought about USING IT?&quot; Whizbang swore.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't possibly be talking about me.&quot; Vven replied, honestly looking around to see if another Teir'Dal was nearby. All he saw was Ramluk looking confused, Pedi looking concerned, and Riverdane looking....dangerous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see any other half-baked, sociopathic, hang-out-with-me-and-screw-up-your-life dark elves around?&quot; Whizbang exploded.<br>
<br>
Vven looked miffed. &quot;WHAT IS YOUR POINT?&quot; he replied testily.<br>
<br>
&quot;His point, Vven.&quot; Riverdane said in a low growl. &quot;Is that you just murdered four members of Promethian Order. And you were right, they have enough clerics and force to go back in concentrated, whether Cazic is no longer afraid of them or not. And they will rez Akethadar and his boys, and they WILL remember who trained them. And due to your little trick, you have put both Razor's Edge and Walkers in a very serious political dilemma.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; Vven said casually. &quot;I'm from Black Reign. We don't believe in politics. We live for this crap.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And we DIE from this crap!&quot; Whizbang fumed, the top of his bald head going red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, relax before you icecomet your foot off!&quot; Pedi commanded. Then she looked at Vven. &quot;That was very irresponsible, Vven. You have put our and River's guilds in great danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, I was doing what was necessary, ok?&quot; Vven cried out defensively. &quot;I just want my damned body back! And if Cazic didn't get over his cold feet, there isn't going to BE any guilds or politics in a month! My methods may not be to the liking of you goody two-shoes but they WORKED! So bitch AFTER I save the world, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
All the anger went out of River like steam from a kettle. &quot;Vven, for now on, talk to me first before you pull any more stunts like that. I thank you for helping us get past the first part of the quest, but you may have damned us anyway even if we do fix this. So no more surprises, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;River, are you mad?&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;This dark elf is going to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehh hehh, 'He faking it.&quot; Hehh. That funny.&quot; Ramluk suddenly said.<br>
<br>
They all went dead quiet, looking at the chuckling ogre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Faking. Heh.&quot; Ramluk said again.<br>
<br>
Pedi was the first to crack a smile. &quot;Brell help me, but that was rather amusing. The look on Akethadar's face...&quot;<br>
<br>
And she and River burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation!&quot; Whizbang muttered.<br>
<br>
River got control over himself, and looked around for the first time. &quot;Whiz, where are we?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Plane of Knowledge.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Starting point for the next part of our journey. Have any of you been here before, besides Pedi?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven shook his head. As did River. Ramluk just looked confused. He pointed. <br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
And where he pointed, an ogre stood chatting with an armored high elf female. Then, through an arch in the impressive looking walls, a dark elf came marching through, turned to the high elven woman, and saluted crisply. Then the dark elf marched on past them, towards River and crew on the grass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine day we're having!&quot; the dark elf said exuberantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You saluted a high elf.&quot; Vven said in shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; the dark elf said. &quot;I always salute my high officers!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to be sick.&quot; Vven said miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the Plane of Knowledge,&quot; Whizbang said to Vven with an evil grin. &quot;All races put down their natural animosity and live together in the peaceful search for knowledge. It's quite a wonder. In this tiny plane, one can find trolls shaking hands with dwarves, and iksar studying with wood elves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a small world, after all!&quot; the dark elf agreed. Vven gaped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to see my betrothed.&quot; the dark elf said, saluting them. &quot;You've never seen a prettier halfling lady!&quot; And with that, he was off.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's marrying an assling.&quot; Vven said in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whiz,&quot; River asked. &quot;Why here? Where are we going?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Recall the prophecy.&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;...'And a Nightmare shed a single tear'...&quot; Vven said automatically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Nightmare.&quot; Whizbang repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;So that means we're going to...&quot; Pedi began.<br>
<br>
&quot;...the Plane of Nightmares.&quot; Whizbang finished. &quot;We're going to see Terris Thule.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 2:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> The Plane of Nightmares.<br>
<br>
Twisted gnarled trees dotted the landscape, under a purple sky perpetually clouded over. Howls and eerie sighs carried across the winds. Tombstones dotted the entrance to the plane, the place they appeared after climbing into a huge hollow stump outside. Here existed things only glimpsed while deep in slumber, things that would wake you panting hard and biting back a scream.<br>
<br>
Only one person was within sight. He ran backwards, bow in hand, firing at almost a blinding speed at an uprooted tree that was slowly chasing after him. The tree's base was riddled with arrows. A huge knot hole in the tree began opening, revealing jagged edges of bark.<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't that one of yours?&quot; Whizbang asked, looking at the ranger as he drew near.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Riverdane said. &quot;Talvarien. I heard he likes to bow kite here.&quot;<br>
<br>
More arrows flew, thunkthunkthunk into the base of the tree. The tree waved two huge branches in anger and trudged on slowly toward the ranger and Talvarien passed them.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk cried in recognition.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Rammie!&quot; Talvarien said, spotting him, &quot;Hey Riv!&quot; Thunkthunkthunk. Suddenly Talvarien stopped dead in his tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;RIV!&quot; he exclaimed in shock, standing with mouth agape. &quot;Oh my gods, it's you...they said in the guild house that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Talv...&quot; Riverdane motioned to the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Talvarien said, looking where River was pointing. The tree opened its mouth wide in anger. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shi...&quot; Talvarien began.<br>
<br>
With creaking jerks, the tree tore both of Talvarien's arms off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ranja....down...&quot; Talvarien whispered, blood bubbling to his lips, as he slumped down into a bloody mess. Somewhere in the distance, a bell rang.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's true.&quot; Vven commented offhandedly. &quot;Every time a bell rings, a ranger dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk roared, leaping onto the tree. River drew his sword.<br>
<br>
Weapons sang as they whistled through the air. Huge chips of bark flew off the tree as Ramluk hacked into it, sap running down its sides in a torrent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Matches don't start forest fires.&quot; Whizbang intoned, hands glowing bright. &quot;People do!&quot;<br>
<br>
WHOOSH........<br>
<br>
The fireball lept from Whizbang's fingertips, enveloping the tree in flames. Riverdane grabbed Ramluk by the shoulders and with a massive pull yanked him back off the tree, before he too was consumed by the fire. The tree mewled like a hurt kitten as the fire ate away at it. Its thrashing branches darkened and crisped to ash, as wizardfire finished its life.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Pedi said, looking down at Talvarien's destroyed body. 'Isn't this a mess. Rangers always die so....violently.&quot; She looked up at Ramluk. &quot;Ramluk, be a dear and collect those arms for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, Miz Pedi.&quot; Ramluk said, prowling among the tombstones looking for Talvarien's arms. River just watched her preparing to do the resurrection.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such an incredible job you do.&quot; Riverdane commented. &quot;I don't know how you stomach this. All this blood and gore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi smirked as she accepted an arm from Ramluk and placed it next to Talvarien's crumpled form.<br>
<br>
&quot;Try dealing with Whizbang's snoring and you can stomach anything.&quot; she said sweetly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed. &quot;I told you a thousand times I don't snore!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? UNLIKE ME YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT!&quot; Pedi roared. And then, taking the second arm from Ramluk, &quot;Thank you dear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Death has become just an annoyance, thanks to you skilled clerics.&quot; River remarked.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lifetime of service to your god, it's the least they can do.&quot; Pedi smiled. And began chanting the resurrection. Blue light flowed from her hands into the pile of remains that was once Talvarien.<br>
<br>
And nothing happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Pedi said, brow furrowing. &quot;It's not taking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, maybe he didn't accept? Maybe he wants to do like I did, and serve his god.&quot; Vven said. Then after quick reflection. &quot;Why would anyone want to serve Tunare?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nono.&quot; Pedi said, panic creeping into her voice. &quot;It didn't take. At all. There was no soul to call...nothing!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is not good.&quot; Riverdane frowned. &quot;Try again, Pedi, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again she chanted, again the blue light. Nothing. Pedi looked stricken, collapsing to her knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Brell, have I somehow offended thee? Please with your divine light help this fallen ranger see his way back into...&quot; and she went off in miserable prayer to her god, eyes brimming with tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is unheard of.&quot; Whizbang said, closing his eyes in concentration. &quot;I must check on something. I'm beginning to fear the worst.&quot; And after a short gnomish chant, he blinked out of sight, teleporting away.<br>
<br>
Pedi continued to drone on, tears dripping onto the destroyed body of Talvarien. Ramluk stood very still, confusion in its normal state across his face. River just glanced nervously at Vven, who shrugged.<br>
<br>
After a brief moment, Whizbang appeared again from over a tombstone. His face was ashen.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, Whiz?&quot; Riverdane asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's as bad as I feared.&quot; Whizbang said seriously. &quot;I checked in the local tavern for some news. Promethian Order did go back and recover Vven's little incident, and defeated Cazic Thule. Akethadar was recovered, as was Pron. But Tremas, Aamedor? Gone. Unable to rez. Several Promethians were drunk in the bar and talking about it, toasting to their memory. And looking quite lost.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That makes no sense, Whizbang, they had plenty of time to be rezzed.&quot; Vven said.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;There is much wailing in the temples. This is not regulated to just Promethian Order or Talvarien here. Resurrections are no longer working. The dead stay dead. Permanently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang,&quot; River said, mouth dropping open. &quot;Is this....?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;....End Game.&quot; Whizbang whispered. &quot;It has begun.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riverdane took a sobbing Pedi by the shoulders and gently pulled her away from Talvarien's remains. Even Vven had nothing to say as they looked down at the fallen ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ramluk.&quot; River said finally. &quot;Take your sheild and dig a hole and bury Talv. Please do it quickly.&quot; Ramluk nodded and dropped to his knees and began to dig. <br>
<br>
Whizbang put his arm around his wife as she cried into his shoulder. Riverdane started breaking up the ground near a tombstone with his sword to help the process along.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a month seemed very short. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
The gates to the Lair of Terris Thule.<br>
<br>
The crossing of the Plane of Nightmares went with no speaking except the chanting of the casters as they recalled their spells. From all sides they were attacked, blood ravens diving in out of the sky to pick out their eyeballs, more twisted trees to rend them, spiders the size of large dogs scurrying across the toadstool-ridden grass to drink their blood, wraithes like mutated, fearsome butterflies swarming them to destroy them. But Talvarien's permanent death had them all sober, and they worked quietly dispatching each of the new threats. But there was an undercurrent of panic and desperation to their fights, since the knowledge that the free ride was over. One mistake and there would be no coming back.<br>
<br>
Finally, following Whizbang, they came to the iron-worked gates themselves.<br>
<br>
The two customary guards that usually watch over the gates were dead, laying side by side in crumpled heaps on the ground. Huge skeletal figures, in full battle armor, now inanimate and broken. A warrior and a shaman were picking through the remains, as they approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail!&quot; the shaman called out hesitantly. &quot;Are you going through the gates? They're safe, we killed the guards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; River replied, also noticing the bodies of four of their companions, strewn among the corpses of the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just waiting on the cleric to get back.&quot; the shaman said a little nervously. &quot;Been a half hour. Heh, getting a little nervous.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven exchanged a look with River. Neither said anything.<br>
<br>
The warrior drew up from his seated position and pointed at Pedi.<br>
<br>
&quot;You, gnome.&quot; he said. &quot;You can save us some time. You a cleric?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a rogue.&quot; Pedi said flatly, pushing past the warrior towards the gates. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
She never looked back.<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare...&quot; Riverdane said softly, looking into the distance past the gate, at the twisting canyon that lead to the home of Terris Thule, Goddess of Nightmares. He could not see far, the tall walls of the canyon twisting off to the right, but he did see the two 20' skeletal guardians posted sentry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ram,&quot; River said, &quot;There's no way for me to get one, they're too close together. I need you to tank one while I grab the other, unless Vven gets a mezz off. Vven, if you can't mezz, slow them both down. With just Pedi we're dead if they're unslowed. If they are unslowable, Whiz...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...gate us out. Loaded.&quot; Whizbang finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know I'm preaching to pros.&quot; River said, breaking out in a cool film of sweat. &quot;It's just.....everything feels different now. There is no room for mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~do not attempt my guards, or you will die, riverdane wyldechylde, son of innoruuk~~<br>
<br>
A haunting, echoing voice, floating through the canyon, raising the hackles on the back of River's neck. Ramluk made a low sound like a dog cowering in fright, primative fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems Terris is aware of our presense.&quot; Whizbang said reduntantly.<br>
<br>
~~come to me, mortal hate, through my guardians~you will not be harmed, but if you or your companions lay hand or spell upon me or my minions, i will turn your lives into living nightmares for eternity~~<br>
<br>
That voice....feminine, deep, rich, aristocratic.....seeping into his very marrow as he heard it, or rather, sensed the sound. A lyrical quality to it, but not a song of joy....nor even, of sadness. It was a song of ice, a cool, unemotional sound, that cut to the very core of him and observed him as if he were a bug. No other words could decribe the alien tone of that bodiless voice.<br>
<br>
Even Vven looked as if he shivered from the tone, and turned to comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Skeletons and guardians and voices.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...Oh my.&quot; Pedi said.<br>
<br>
The five began walking through the twisting landscape to meet the Goddess of Nightmare.<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
~~closer, riverdane wyldechylde, so that i may gaze upon you~~<br>
<br>
There was no compromise in that unearthly voice, and River found himself stepping into the huge arena that contained the Goddess of Nightmare. Through her silent, staring guardians they had passed unharmed, growing more restless as they neared the shadow-strewn structure at the end of the canyons. Now stepping into the gloom, River's eyes began to adjust.<br>
<br>
Four stone gargoyle statues surrounded her, each with their wicked sharp claws resting on their knees, perched squatting on four columns. And in the center of it all, the Lady herself.<br>
<br>
She was clad in a highcut purple bodice, dress full legth, beyond where her feet should be. There she floated in the center, two feet of the ground, appraising him. Long violet hair brushed back from her alabaster forehead, with two horns of bone sweeping from her temple back along her hairline, like the horns of a wilderbeast, at first seeming like part of her hair itself, a fine white streak of locks contrasting with her dark hair. Her eyes, those huge eyes, were all pupil, black and fathomless and cold, so cold. And her mouth....was missing. No lips, teeth or tongue, just smooth bone white skin where her mouth should be.<br>
<br>
Riverdane stood in the presense of the goddess, his friends slightly behind him, frozen in awe. For all her oddity, she was breathtaking in beauty. And terrifying in her cold stare.<br>
<br>
~~so you are a godling, little man~~ Terris intoned. ~~you have killed your father in hatred, and assimilated his throne, and set end game into motion~~<br>
<br>
River thought to clarify or defend his culpability, but could merely say:<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~i dreamt of your coming here, long ago~~ she droned. ~~i dream many things, and they always come true~but your dream stopped here, something, your godhood perhaps, prevents me from seeing further~so i ask you~~~why are you here?~~<br>
<br>
&quot;I need a tear from you.&quot; Riverdane requested.<br>
<br>
Terris scowled, a terrifying feat with no mouth to turn down, but a scowl all the same.<br>
<br>
~~I CRY FOR NO MAN, BE HE MORTAL OR GOD!~~ she thundered, voice echoing loudly through the empty hall. All four gargoyles suddenly moved as one, with a great grating of stone, Heavy rock wings beating the air and lifting their tremedous weight, until they settle around her on the ground like large vultures swooping down on a corpse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Boy, SOMEONE'S got issues.&quot; Vven muttered behind River.<br>
<br>
~~and you, vven psyphon, innoruukspawn, teir'dal, what do you want?~speak now, creature of memories past, before under my gaze i disperse the very dreams you are made of~~<br>
<br>
Vven's blue skin paled to almost white under her glance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just want my body back!&quot; he whined pitifully, fear making his voice shake.<br>
<br>
~~why should i cry for you, foul demon of smoke?~~ she said derisively. ~~for what reason should i weep? to give you back your physical form?~~<br>
<br>
Vven mustered up every ounce of physical courage he possessed. &quot;No! The world is ending!&quot; he blurted out. &quot;With no more mortals, what will you feed on? What dreams will you have?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~FEED?~~ she bellowed. ~~DO YOU THINK I FIND JOY IN WHAT MORTALS DREAM? THE MURDERS THEY COMMIT IN THEIR DREAMS, THE WANTON LUST, THE GREED, THE IGNORANCE OF MORTAL DESIRE THAT THEY CONJURE WHEN THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES AT NIGHT?~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Oooook&quot; Vven stammered. &quot;You win. Let em die. Listen, um guys, I did the Cazic part, so uhh this is all you, k?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA!&quot; Ramluk tried helpfully. Terris ignored him.<br>
<br>
~~i will cry for no man~~ she repeated. ~~nor for mortal hate~~<br>
<br>
She drifted toward River, gargoyles lumbering behind her like grotesque wolves.<br>
<br>
~~do you sleep anymore, son of innoruuk?~~ she asked him. ~~do you dream?~~<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; River said quietly, eyes haunted under her scrutiny. &quot;I have not been able to sleep since I killed Innoruuk.&quot; He could not bring himself to say 'my father'.<br>
<br>
~~i would like to see what a god dreams~~ she declared, hand waving in the air.<br>
<br>
And for the first time since Innoruuk's death, Riverdane Wyldechylde fell into a deep slumber, body sinking to the ground, eyeballs flittering behind closed lids.<br>
<br>
And dreamed. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 4:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> A match touches itself to the end of a cigarette...spark of light dimly illuminating the muck covered wall...<br>
<br>
....inhale....<br>
<br>
&quot;It still in there?&quot; Riverdane Wyldechylde asks, smoke curling from his fingertips. A long time ago he would be worried the smell of it would alert the inhabitants of Lower Guk, but hundreds of battles later he knows undead don't smell anything.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Bwael Kyorlean replies, closer to the entrance to the torture chamber of the undead frogs....his finger runs a trail through thick dust...&quot;It's been in there unmoving for a long time...a long time&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If that dust is undisturbed, its friends are in there too, then. &quot; Nizzre Kyorlean, Bwael's brother replied. How different they looked, Nizzre in his plate and Bwael in his chain and leather. Yet there were times River would swear they were the same person, thinking with the same mind, that's how fluidly they worked together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; Bwael said, &quot;The ones I tracked to this room last week are still here....the undead are funny, they just stand in place like sentinels, not moving for weeks on end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's Grelin?&quot; River asks. &quot;Can we take on this bastard without a healer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Grelin's still coming.&quot; Nizzre said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Grrrreat.&quot; River replied, &quot;We have twenty minutes before he gets here...&quot; He sighs impatiently. &quot;We have to do this now, before these frogs get wind of what we did to the previous guards&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll heal...&quot; Camille Wyldechylde, River's beautiful blonde wife says. She smiles winningly, and something in River's heart aches. &quot;I won't let you die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You never do, baby, you never do...&quot; He looks over at Bwael and Nizzre. &quot;You want to risk it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bwael looks at Nizzre. &quot;I'll snare?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nizzre nods, &quot;I'll root.&quot;<br>
<br>
River smiles. &quot;No way to yank this one clean, the room's too small.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bwael draws a wicked blade. &quot;Bring it.&quot;<br>
<br>
On that, three more blades whisper out of scabbards, and River makes his way around the corner.<br>
<br>
There it is...the Frenzied Ghoul, with two other frogs, one, a lesser muscled frogluk zombie, undead rotted animated remains of the proud froglok race, and the other with totally white eyes, blind and yet seeing, eminating the quiet power of a wizard. A caster of power...but River is not without power himself....<br>
<br>
His fingers stroke his moustache thoughfully, words of power spoken quietly under his breathe...then, with fingers splaying forth he murmurs &quot;Bringing a world of pain, via Riverdane, to the Frenzied ghoul.&quot;<br>
<br>
A small nimbus of power leaps from River's fingers, shooting across the room to infuse the Frenzy. Immediately there is motion. A bolt of power flies from the wizard's webbed fingers. Only ducking behind his shield did River keep his head on his shoulders, the bolt deflecting off the polished face to explode off a close rock. And then the frogs were upon him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to dance with the Frenzy!&quot; River called over his shoulder. He flicks his cigarette to the ground and stubs it out. A pivot, a dash and River is running back to the group, to see the dead set stares of Camille, Bwael, and Nizzre,<br>
<br>
&quot;we've got a few incoming&quot; River says. Camille nods to him curtly. She has been here all to often before. She knows the drill.<br>
<br>
Four swords lift as one, each person pulling forth their own arcane knowledge.<br>
<br>
River's eyes are on fire as the three frogs turn the corner and decend upon them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do it to it....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
....sheild up....<br>
<br>
.....the Frenzy is upon them....<br>
<br>
...the frogloks, all three are singular in purpose....Riverdane has woken them from their silent guard, and they have one singular thought....destroy the shadowknight...<br>
<br>
One webbed fist swing, hard enough to crack stone, to bounce off River's sheild....With the Frenzy deflected, River swings up and parries with his sword a descending blade from the Warrior, rebounding it to the side....one arm committed to the Frenzy, one to the Warrior, and River hears the sound of energybuilding up in the Wizard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Shi......stuns UP!&quot; he cries.<br>
<br>
Nizzre and Camille nod at each other and wrinkle their brows.<br>
<br>
Blue light flies from their hands, a virtual force. The wizard is stopped dead in its tracks, blood trickling slowly from its ears and the double stun knocks it temporarily senseless.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have the Warrior.&quot; Bwael calls out, dashing to a far corner and drawing his bow....in an instant, the arrow is knocked and flying, catching the warrior in the back of the neck. The Warrior bellows in anguish, both it and the Frenzy turning to the ranger in the corner, who has already slung his bow onto his back and has sword out, ready....<br>
<br>
The Wizard begins to blink, regaining its senses. The mumbling begins again, until Camille's sheild smashes itself into its face. &quot;Be quiet, you.&quot; she says. It has no choice but to comply.<br>
<br>
The Frenzy and Warrior advance quickly upon Bwael. His small woodelf frame is overshadowed by the two hulking undead frogs, but he is unflinching. These four have faced far worse than this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come here you...&quot; River calls out, with a gesture at the Frenzy with his sheild hand....a green nimbus, smokelike wafts out of his fingers, curling into the ears and eyes of the Frenzies head. It makes a small sound.....pain?...as the disease cloud begins to eat at its cells. It's attention turns back to River. <br>
<br>
&quot;There we go...&quot; River murmurs, and readies himself for this juggarnaut.<br>
<br>
The Warrior is oblivious to the loss of his companion. Narrowminded, focused and bent on Bwael's destruction, it advances another foot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rooting the Warrior.&quot; Nizzre calls out. Camille nods, hacking her sword into the Wizard's shoulder. Black blood sprays across the wall and onto her armor. Hmm, I'll have to clean that off later, she thinks. Might stain.<br>
<br>
Nizzre's fingers twitch in the direction of the warrior. Suddenly thick brownish roots spring from the floor, an articifial substance drawn from the very floor itself. They quickly wrap the ankles and legs of the Warrior, holding it down to the ground. It blinks lids over eyeless holes in surprise.....focus on Bwael lost, it begins to hack at the roots with it's sword.....Bwael hugs the wall tight to join Camille and Nizzre, and the butchering of the hapless Wizard continues, this time, three swords instead of one.<br>
<br>
River swings up his sword at the Frenzy, as another green black arm descends upon him......connection, and the swing should have cut off the Frenzy's arm.....instead, it sinks perhaps half an inch in....The Frenzy bellows in pain, as River yanks the blade free.<br>
<br>
Half an inch...<br>
<br>
Oh boy...<br>
<br>
And then River discovers why the Frenzy is called the Frenzy...<br>
<br>
A black cord cinched around the frogs &quot;waist&quot; begins to glow and hum with a force all of its own.....and suddenly the Frenzy's webbed claws are flying in a flurry of attack, River barely able to follow their movement.<br>
<br>
Connection to his chest, air knocked completely out of his lungs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh, that's going to leave a mark&quot; he sputters, trying to get his breath.<br>
<br>
Another connection into his chest plate. And a loud crack. Black spots before his eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yup.&quot; River says, as unconsciousness begins to steal over him. &quot;That was a rib.&quot; He stumbles, attempting to stand upright, but light and coordination is beginning to steal away from him.<br>
<br>
The Wizard is little more than a throbbing pile of severed flesh, Camille, Nizzre and Bwael slicing it repeatedly, as it continues in the amazing way of the undead to fight....Camille senses rather than hears River faltering....Her sword continues to slice,as she turns her head in River's direction...to see him slipping to the ground...<br>
<br>
Her eyes light preternaturally blue, aglow with light...<br>
<br>
&quot;Heal...&quot; she whispers... <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
.....light....<br>
<br>
....bright blue light.....a supernova under closed lids...<br>
<br>
....and Riverdane draws himself erect, ribs mended, bruise there but body healed....<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you baby.&quot; he tells Camille, spitting at the webbed feet of the Frenzy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're welcome, baby.&quot; she replies, as she beams a smile at him and lops the wizard'd right hand from its wrist. Bwael and Nizzre stop a moment to exchange a look. Nizzre rolls his eyes.<br>
<br>
The Frenzy gives pause, a moment...a dangerous moment. River sees the opening, and lunges with his sword. The Frenzy is a trained warrior, turns sideways, smacking the blade away from where it was aiming to skewer his body. Exactly the move River has anticipated.<br>
<br>
The tip of River's sword snags the belt cinched around the froglok. With a quick twist of his wrist, River slices it in two and flips it up in the air in a high lazy arc.<br>
<br>
&quot;Inc flowing black silk sash&quot; River calls out, bringing his armored knee up into the Frenzy's belly. Crunch, and crippling pain shoots through River's knee. Next time use weapons, River, he thinks. Monk you're not.<br>
<br>
Bwael's free hand reaches over his head mid-swing at the wizard's side, grabbing the flying belt. He tucks it into his pocket. &quot;Nice ghetto pick pocket, Riv...&quot; he says, chopping a huge chunk of decaying flesh from the wizard.<br>
<br>
&quot;And ghetto slow....&quot; River laughs, pushing the Frenzy back violently with his sheild. Another splatter of blood splashes across his face from their direction. He looks over, and tries to make out what reason they may have for beating the misshappened quivering mass of frog flesh before them.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's dead, guys.&quot; Another spray of blood. &quot;Trust me, it's very very dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
And STARS as the Frenzy connects to the side of his head.<br>
<br>
River staggers to the side, spots again before his eyes. He spins against the wall blinded momentarily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; he hears Nizzre say. &quot;It's dead.&quot; And then more butchering, closer. Steel hitting stone, by the sound of it. They are upon the Frenzy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You ok?&quot; he hears Camille ask, his eyes still blurred.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm good I'm good...&quot; He replies shakily....he knows how every heal takes a little more out of her, till she has nothing left to give. His sword raises shakily, blood trickling down the side of his face. Concentrate River. He hears a sharp sound of pain. Camille caught the aggro, the Frenzy was upon her, somewhere to his left. Reflex and his hand flays out two fingers separate and cross, and a wave of power pushes out in the direction of the battle. Come on you bastard taunt....two fingers splayed and crossed was his most powerful taun...wait a minute. He shakes his head again to clear the cobwebs, and wipes blood from his eyes. Cross the fingers after, or before...?...hmmm<br>
<br>
&quot;Riv...&quot; Bwael says dryly, chopping at the Frenzy's back. &quot;You just feared the warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nizzre has stopped fighting. Camille has stopped fighting. Even the Frenzy seems to have stopped, in his blurred vision, to gape at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Root just broke.&quot; Nizzre finishes.<br>
<br>
River's head snaps to the right to see the panicked Warrior disappear around the corner. His desperate eyes turn back to his three companions, who were pushing the Frenzy back and forth between them with sheilds and kicks. And then that far off sound. Growing louder. The sound of many webbed feet hopping....getting louder.<br>
<br>
With two hands wrapped around his sword Reaver, he swings up in an arc, down, and cleaves the skull of the Frenzy in two....it drops to the ground as the four pull their swords from various spots in its now inanimate carcass. River grabs Camille urgently by the wrist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crazy bastard uses fear in a dungeon.&quot; Nizzre mumbles, shaking his head, sheathing his sword. Bwael has already unslung his bow and heading an opposite direction the Warrior has fled.<br>
<br>
&quot;That way!&quot; River calls, as if Nizzre doesn't already know...<br>
<br>
&quot;TRAIN...!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Through corridors they run, up stairs, the sound of the undead frogs deafening, a blind alley, four friends backtrack and choose the correct path, but the lead they have on their pursuers is waning.<br>
<br>
Closer, closer, a collective froaking building in pitch, another stairs, another corner and...<br>
<br>
Grelin standing in front of them, chewing on a piece of hay.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi guys.&quot; he says.<br>
<br>
&quot;TRAIN!&quot; River exclaims lifting up Grelin by the arm. Nizzre grabs the other, and they carry Grelin backward, his feet a foot above the ground. The half-elf's feet dangle uselessly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, evac?&quot; he offers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea.&quot; Bwael comments, turning around to run backwards, firing lightning fast into the green tide about to sweep them over.<br>
<br>
A few words in broken Elven, and the druid Grelin's eyes light green, and with a wink, stopping the frogs dead in their tracks, they are gone.<br>
<br>
POOF.<br>
<br>
A grassy gnoll, next to strange druidic statues. The druid ring in Southern Desert of Ro. They are panting, the sounds of their gasps loud in the relative quiet of SoRo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice timing, Grel.&quot; River remarks, waking toward wear the grass ends and the dunes of sand begins.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was fun!&quot; Camille says, eyes sparkling, joining her husband as he sits down on a hill of sand and begins stripping off his armor. She removes the plate pieces from her sweat-drenched armor one by one, and Nizzre also removes his battle gear in favor of the light, everyday clothing they wore underneathe. Bwael is counting his arrows in his quiver. Grelin, as usual, is just sitting on his haunches, chewing on that piece of hay, watching them quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know,&quot; River says. &quot;We do some pretty impressive stuff, considering the gear we have. This black silk sash should help outfit us a little better. No cleric, no chanter, but we still lived.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks to Grelin.&quot; Bwael adds. Grelin just chews.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want good gear, join Promethian Order.&quot; Nizzre says. &quot;I saw a few of them the other day up close. Those guys are geared to the teeth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not my style,&quot; River says laying back on the sand and popping a fresh cigarette into his mouth. He lights and inhales deeply. &quot;Their requirements are too military for me, and I need my downtime. Plus, I don't take orders very well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We know.&quot; Bwael and Nizzre say in uncanny unison.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, WE could start a guild...&quot; River muses.<br>
<br>
Camille crawls across River's prone body and rests her head against his chest as he gazes up at the clouds. &quot;Silly.&quot; she says, &quot;What do you want to make a guild for? The five of us do just fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Baby, there's other things out there I want to see, you know. I'm tired of Guk.&quot; His eyes have a faraway look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Riv, you DO know a ton of people. I bet you could find some more to join.&quot; Nizzre contemplates.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to get more sun.&quot; Bwael says, &quot;Guk is getting old.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A guild, a guild.&quot; River repeats. &quot;But what would we call it? We don't suck, we're rather good at what we do, and we operate well under pressure. We like danger and high pressure, dancing along the razor's edge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it, there's our name.&quot; Grelin says suddenly. The other four turn and stare at him. Grelin rarely ever speaks.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's our name?&quot; River asks.<br>
<br>
Grelin chews on his piece of hay and smiles. &quot;...'We Don't Suck.'....&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 5:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> ~~wake~~<br>
<br>
River's eyes snapped open, as he saw his friends and Terris staring at him. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw the images of Camille, Grelin, Nizzre and Bwael wisp away like smoke. His recollection of the past, his dream, was physical for all to see. He felt violated in some abstract way. They were his memories.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should have stayed with 'We don't suck'.&quot; Vven commented.<br>
<br>
Terris' face was impassive. ~~even as a god, you dream of war, conquest~men are so predictable~show me the woman~<br>
<br>
River tried to resist her command, but found himself impotent against her will.<br>
<br>
~~sleep~~ <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Smoke wafts upward before his eyes, the acrid clouds stinging his eyes, as he glances down at the task before him.<br>
<br>
One blue vellium boot, taken from a fallen dorf in Icewell, slips onto a foot.<br>
<br>
Camille's eyes are on his back, those twin blue beacons....she watches him silently putting on his armor, knowing once more he is leaving their home...a sharpening stone hones the edge of her sword, yet not a sound leaves her lips, as she watches her man preparing.<br>
<br>
Another blue boot, heavy armor, weighing down his every step....a flick of his cigarette, ash falls into a pottered bowl.<br>
<br>
A knock on the door. Camille's eyes register on it, sharpening stone working the blade, working the blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come in.&quot; he says, lifting greaves off their hook on the wall....the guardian armor, silver and shining, clinks together as he begins to snap in place the buckles and ties to hold it together over his tanned leggings.<br>
<br>
A reptilian head pokes its way into the room. Zullie, one of his officers, looks through serpentine eyes at Camille and him as he snaps the last buckle into place and straightens himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just the daily news.&quot; Zullie informs him. &quot;Is now a good time, or...?&quot; She lets the question hang pregnant in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; he says, fitting the black umbral tunic over his torso. A gift from the time he had successfully walked the Plane of Fear....taken without permission from its owner. Vambracers followed, the same hard heavy metal. Camille's stone works the blade, works the blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, several members left, and word is several more planning to.&quot; Zullie begins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Expected...I am rarely surprised.&quot; Shoulder pieces set and locked, another tap of ash.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also applications from about a dozen people, Nizzre gave them to me this morning.&quot; She waved several pieces in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, Zullie, on that pile over there.&quot; With one hand being slipped into a guardian bracer, he gestures to a growing pile. &quot;Let's hope these applicants know what they are signing onto.&quot; The bracer seemed heavier, this afternoon....all of his armor seemed heavier.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Alliance is doing well, but they want to know when another Fear raid will be planned, and Kedge Keep, and an assault on the Plane of Growth....and of course Temple of Veeshan&quot; Zullie checked off her list matter of factly.<br>
<br>
Another bracer locked into place. Reaching for his blood ember gauntlets, lying on the table. &quot;All those raids, do they have leaders yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Zullie blinks heavy lids and looks at him. &quot;No, just talk, I think they are waiting for you to lead.&quot;<br>
<br>
He glances over at Camille, but she is intent on her weapon, working the edge, working the edge.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also with the momentum gained from our recent Epic successes, folks are wondering why you aren't focusing on cleric epics, wizard, and bard...or warrior, or..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When I can get to them Zullie&quot; he says, too short for his own liking. His gloves slip on as Zullie flinches.<br>
<br>
She seems reluctant to go on. &quot;Also, the younger folks want more lower geared raids, to train on, they think you focus too much on the more experienced members...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've begun that....&quot; he says, looking at the helm on the wall...he rarely uses one, not liking the way it confines him. But today, he wants to hide from the world...he stubs out the cigarette and lifts it over his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell them all I am working it....all of it.&quot; he says, dropping the helm over his head. A sharp cry from Camille, short. The sharpening stone lays split in two on the floor, her hand bleeding bright red drops. <br>
<br>
&quot;Very well.&quot; Zullie says, backing toward the door.<br>
<br>
He remember when it was simpler, when the only responsibility he had was to his wife and three companions. Since then he had helped build an empire, and with it, came change. With a silent groan, he lifts his armored body to full stature....Camille has healed her hand already, and finally looks at him. Those beautiful eyes lock on his. But they are older now, those eyes. And they look tired.<br>
<br>
Zullie bumps into Nizzre coming through the door. He moves to accomodate her, and glaces at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;River, they're waiting for you.&quot; he says.<br>
<br>
He takes his sword Reaver from its place on the wall, not looking at anyone anymore.<br>
<br>
A whisper.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm coming&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
~~wake~~<br>
<br>
Riverdane's eyes flew open. Terris was standing above him, disdain in her eyes.<br>
<br>
~~what of her?~~ Terris' voice floated down, judging him in tone and finding him lacking. ~~she bled for you, bled BECAUSE of you, and yet, you left her~~ Her eyes held the accusation, and River could not meet them. Her voice grew thick with scorn. ~~what did she ever see in you, riverdane wyldechylde, son of innoruuk?~~<br>
<br>
'That's what we're ALL trying to figure out.&quot; Vven muttered.<br>
<br>
~~SILENCE, THING OF DREAMS!~~ she bellowed, the volume of her voice literally pushing Vven back. His lower lip trembled in fear. ~~you share the same wicked sex as he~speak again and it shall be the last words uttered from your cursed lips~~<br>
<br>
Vven, eyes wide, made a gesture across his lips as if locking them shut and then promptly throwing away the key.<br>
<br>
Pedi took a tentitive step foreward, gripping Whizbang's arm unconsciously and dragging the trembling gnome forward quite against his will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, Terris?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;Why do you hate men so much?&quot;<br>
<br>
Terris fixed her glare upon the small woman. ~~you will learn~~ she said with a nod, gesturing with one long wraith-like finger at Whizbang. ~~did he tell you he loved you?~did he pledge his soul to you~what lies did he whisper in your ear as you lay panting upon sweaty sheets in the dark?~ Whizbang's face, top of his bald head, and prominent ears all flushed a deep red.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Pedi said, gathering courage. &quot;My Whizbang loves me.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~he lies~~ Terris replied cooly. ~~all men lie~they tell you what they must to part your legs, and then, eventually, they part your company, leaving you with a broken maidenhood and a broken heart~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang has never lied to m...&quot; Pedi began earnestly.<br>
<br>
~~ALL THINGS MALE LIE!~~ she thundered. Then her voice dropped in volume. ~~do you find it odd?~that i have no mouth?~~ She regarded Pedi, waiting for an answer. When she received none, she continued on. ~~i removed my own mouth, as if it never existed, after telling a male that I loved him~he lied to me, and when he left me alone, i vowed i would never speak of feelings of love to a man ever again~~<br>
<br>
Pedi's eyes were huge, as she stared up at the goddess before her. &quot;You loved a man, and he left you, and when he did you removed your own mouth?&quot;<br>
<br>
~~not a mere man~~ Terris murmured, her voice far away. ~~a god~he took my heart in his powerful hands, and made me a woman while whispering the tenderest song to fall from any man's lips that walk the heavens or hells~and made more powerful by the sheer opposite he was of a tender man~rallos zek, god of war, took my innocence in his stride~but where i thought i met him on a field of white lilies, he saw it as just another battlefield, with me a war to be won~and win he did, i loved him and begged before i opened myself to him that he would never leave me~and he agreed, and i, fool that i was, believed him~and when he had had his way with me, he marched off to yet another war~and never came back~~ She blinked slowly, lost in the memory, and then slowly opened her eyes.<br>
<br>
~~he never...came...back~~<br>
<br>
A single teardrop, as silver as the moon, glimmered in the corner of one eye, and then, dropping in slow motion, fell.<br>
<br>
Pedi cupped her hand, the tear falling into it, frozen in its shape, not cold like ice, nor hot as salty tears are, just a solid, pearlescent reminder of a goddess' sorrow. She held it as if it were a living thing.<br>
<br>
~~for you i cry~~ Terris said to Pedi. ~~and for camille, that she may live~~ Pedi regarded the solemn woman with her own eyes brimming with tears. ~~and for me~~ Terris finished quietly, ~~i cry for me~~<br>
<br>
Terris turned her swanlike neck to River, and her eyes were cold once more.<br>
<br>
~~begone, riverdane wyldechylde, son of innoruuk~~ she commanded. ~~wake mithaniel's handmaiden, lest i cry in vain~~<br>
<br>
And with that, she shimmered from view, her two luminous black eyes the last thing to vanish into the perpetual night. <br>

The sooner they were gone, the better.<br>
<br>
Whizbang pulled a small book out of his pocket and flipped a few pages, recalling the spell. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hold onto your seat!&quot; he announced, and then began reciting the spell.<br>
<br>
And...<br>
<br>
...nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Odd.&quot; Whizbang frowned. &quot;Not even a fizzle...&quot;<br>
<br>
~~end game~~ floated down from the sky. ~~the world changes, and so do we~~<br>
<br>
Ramluk trembled. That, more that Terris' disembodied voice, frightened River more.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the ground near their feet heaved. The gnomes clung to one another and River struggled for balance, as the floor split. Red heat and light poured from a growing crack in the ground. River stared. Smoke and ashes blew out of the growing hole.<br>
<br>
And from the depths of the earth, a black stallion cantered out, flames licking its hooves. A gorgeous ebony horse, with glowing red eyes.<br>
<br>
~~a nightmare~~ Terris' voice intoned. ~~from my personal stock~resurrections have ceased, and now teleportation~eventually it will all end, and i along with it~without people to dream, even dreams of poison, i will simply fade away~i am not quite willing to be so easily discarded a second time~use the horse, and when your mission is done, i will reclaim him~your companions need but to touch him, and he will carry you swiftly to where you need to go~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice entrance.&quot; Vven said quietly, staring at the horse with mistrust. It was trotting toward Riverdane, smoke still curling from its nostrils. &quot;Stepping out into the world amidst fire and brimstone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Brimstone.&quot; Riverdane declared, naming the horse. Somehow, it felt fitting. &quot;Come here, Brimstone.&quot; And with uncanny intelligence, the horse came to him and nuzzled his palm. Its flesh seemed warmer than possible for it to still live, yet it was the most remarkable, healthiest specimen of horse he had ever seen.<br>
<br>
Riverdane climbed up onto the horse's back, and reached down to extend a hand to Whizbang. The gnome didn't look happy, but took River's hand regardless and was pulled up onto the horse. Ramluk, still trembling, as spooked as any animal would be anywhere near the goddess of nightmares, lifted up Pedi and placed her on the back of the horse behind Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ram, Vven, place your hands on the horses flanks, please.&quot; River suggested. Then Terris' voice assaulted them one final time:<br>
<br>
~~your time grows short~keep the elf of dreams and the ogre close at hand, for i predict the fate of the world rests directly with their involvement~for now, ride, mortal hate, RIDE~~<br>
<br>
&quot;To the Plane of Knowledge, Brimstone.&quot; River said in the horse's ear, squeezing its sides with his knees. &quot;Ride.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with a flash of red light, they were gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
They sat under a tree in the Plane of Knowledge, mood grim. Brimstone grazed nearbye, as River lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. Vven regarded him sternly.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you ever bring me back to that psycho bitch again, River, I'm putting you on my permanent 'Haunt' list.&quot; he said bluntly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Terris certainly hates men.&quot; Whizbang concurred. &quot;I stood there with my legs crossed every time she looked at me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's been hurt.&quot; Pedi retorted. <br>
<br>
&quot;She gave me nightmare.&quot; Ramluk said, trembling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Whizbang said, turning to the ogre. &quot;While we were there? I must admit while she was opening River's mind, I could feel some residual power from her prying at my mind as well but I resisted it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So did I.&quot; Pedi said. Vven just nodded in agreement. &quot;It was like she was trying to look into River and ended up blanketing us all with her power.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me had bad dream, but no dream, cuz awake.&quot; Ramluk said. &quot;She scare me with dream.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven snorted nastily. &quot;What in Inny's name could frighten an ogre?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk looked ashamed. &quot;When me little ogga, me and Big Momma come to elf land to find brownies to rip off legs to make chocolatey cookie. Was Ramluk birthday! So we sneak on boat, hide with rats in bottom. Get hungry. Eat rats. Sneak through dorf town and then elf land. Find brownies. Try rip off legs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ram,&quot; River said, exhaling. &quot;Was this a nightmare, or true?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;True but purple lady make me rethink it.&quot; Ram said, lost in the memory. &quot;Brownie look little, but they mean. They beat up Big Momma! But even as little ogga, me jump on them and barsh them good. And nice gnomes come and heal Big Momma and give us cookies and rip off brownie legs and send us home. The end.&quot; He beamed a smile at Pedi, who returned it. Whizbang just frowned incredulously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Funny,&quot; he began. &quot;I don't recall in gnomish history the gnomes EVER helping an og...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a wonderful story, Ramluk.&quot; Pedi said, shooting Whizbang a glance.<br>
<br>
&quot;But no where in the history of Ak'Anon...&quot; Whizbang tried again.<br>
<br>
&quot;THAT'S A WONDERFUL STORY!&quot; Pedi growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Whizbang said with a sigh. &quot;Nice nightmare, Ramluk. Wonderful story.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga.&quot; Ramluk agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, storytime's over.&quot; River said, stubbing out his cigarette. &quot;Vven, what's the next part of the prophecy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's see...&quot; Vven said. Suddenly, a halfling, dressed in the leather and chain garb of a rogue, stepped from the cobblestones near them and walked up to Vven, eyes shifting everywhere but at Vven himself, with a rolled up scroll in his hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon?&quot; the halfling asked. One of Vven's eyebrows lifted in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, assling, what can I do for you?&quot; Vven replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is for you.&quot; the halfling said nervously, trying to push the scroll into Vven's hands. The scroll past right through the incorperal matter that made up the Tier'Dal. The halfling looked more nervous, continually trying to place the scroll into Vven's hands, and dropping the scroll to the ground. The more he tried, the more nervous he grew.<br>
<br>
&quot;River, open that scroll before he goes into convulsions please.&quot; Vven said impatiently.<br>
<br>
River reached down and picked up the scroll from the ground and unrolled it.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, with a flash of light, blue chains and shackles flew from the scroll in River's hands. Whipping like metal snakes, they flew through the air, more and more length pouring out of the scroll. Shackles clasped around Vven's wrists, and before the shocked party could even react, more chains wrapped around Vven like tentacles and with a snap, began retracting back into the scroll. Before they knew what had happened, Vven and the chains disappeared back into the scroll, leaving no sign of anything strange, just some sentences on the scroll. The halfling seemed relieved, and addressed the scroll Vven had disappeared into, as if Vven could hear him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon,&quot; the halfling said. &quot;You've been served. Have a nice day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Served!&quot; Whizbang said, as the halfling scurried away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang, I can't read this.&quot; River said, handing the scroll to Whizbang as if it was a snake that might bite. The gnome took it in fascination.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's because it's in Higher Planar.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Few bother to learn it, or have the skill.&quot; He read it out loud, frown lines increasing as he did:<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon, you are hearby accused of crimes against the universe by the Tribunal, and are sentenced to permanent imprisonment until Trial of Execution, beginning immediately.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trial of Execution!&quot; Pedi exclaimed. &quot;You mean Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...is in jail.&quot; Riverdane sighed.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etelka>Etelka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 607<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 5:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> Fantastic - please keep them coming! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/03 8:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;Let him rot.&quot; Whizbang said. Pedi punched him hard in the shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ow! Damnation, woman!&quot; Whizbang exclaimed, rubbing his shoulder. &quot;That evil bastard was more trouble than he was worth!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Regardless,&quot; Riverdane said, leading Brimstone toward the portal stone to the Plane of Tranquility. &quot;You heard Terris. Vven is vital to the success of this quest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I heard her.&quot; Whizbang grumbled, reluctantly falling into step behind Pedi and Ramluk. &quot;She also mentioned something about male reproductive organs roasting on a spit.&quot;<br>
<br>
They touched the portal stone, and were gone. <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He looks so....lonely.&quot; Pedi commented quietly, peering through the bars.<br>
<br>
Vven sat on the edge of a cot, a piece of chalk in his hand, scrawling something on the walls. Next to the bed was a platter of mouldy bread and an empty cup. Vven was scratching out his writings over a foul smelling hole in the stone floor. Most likely the toilet in his drab prison. He was writing in Common tongue, large letters River could make out from outside the cell:<br>
<br>
-Here I sit, a lonely inky,<br>
Oh! I just left a stinky!-<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you have your body back, if you're holding that chalk.&quot; River said, snapping Vven's head around in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Vven said miserably. &quot;Just in here I am solid, to prevent me from passing through the bars. Took you long enough, I've been in here ten minutes. Some friends you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm leaving.&quot; Whizbang said abruptly. Pedi stepped on his foot. Hard. Whizbang choked back a cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been spending my time rotting here reading a few bits of enlightenment from past prisoners.&quot; Vven went on. &quot;Seems some of Norrath's more nortorious criminals have spent some time in this cell.&quot; He pointed to the wall at something written in Iksar. &quot;Like this, 'Saalron was here, 3712'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Somehow, you occupying the room of former sociopaths doesn't surprise me, Vven.&quot; Whiz said dryly, stepping to the side reflexively to avoid Pedi's jab to his ribs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here's one of my favorites.&quot; Vven continued, pointing to another set of scribbles. <br>
<br>
-There once was a woman from Halas<br>
Who used fireball wands as a phallus<br>
They found her left breast<br>
In the Estate of Unrest<br>
And half of her-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo, how are we getting you out of here, Vven?&quot; Riverdane interrupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Vven said forlornly, slumping onto the cot. &quot;They haven't even told me what charges I am imprisoned for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They're probably still reading the LIST.&quot; Whizbang snapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back OFF, gnome.&quot; Vven growled. &quot;Before I reach through these bars and ADD to that list!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; Riverdane sighed. &quot;Whiz, how do we get him out?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang didn't look happy giving the information, but after a glare from his wife decided it was in his best interest to divulge. &quot;We need to take his case before the Tribunal. They may grant us audience to clear his name...in the odd chance that he didn't do whatever they think he did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, Vven, sit tight.&quot; River said, then turned to Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lead the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
Surrounded.<br>
<br>
Riverdane's stomach heaved as he glanced down at his feet. Standing in the trial room of the Plane of Justice, the large stone slab he stood on would suddenly disappear, leaving him on solid ground, but standing in empty space, floating seemingly in thin air. Ramluk growled next to him, also thrown off by the sudden change in perspective. Whizbang and Pedi shifted uneasily, one moment firmly planted on the ground, the next, suspended in a night sky with stars and suns dotting the background, above them, below them. And around them, six huge robed figures staring silently at them, was the Tribunal. Each carrying a huge hammer, each no more than a living robe. But the power eminating from those robed non-beings was stronger than any physical shape could produce. River felt as if he were guilty of....something. It didn't matter what. Just feeling as if he was guilty and that they knew it, and were, with their eyeless gaze, deciding on his sentence.<br>
<br>
The first spoke, voice deep and resonant, coming from within the robes. The voice of The Law.<br>
<br>
&quot;What...&quot; it said.<br>
<br>
And then clockwise, each figure said but one word. River turned to face each like a top.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Seek...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mortal...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hate...?&quot;<br>
<br>
River swallowed his unease with difficulty and addressed the first on.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a companion of mine, Vven Psyphon.&quot; he said carefully. &quot;I would like to know what charges he is being imprisoned for and how we may go about freeing him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bringing...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Forth...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prisoner...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Psyphon...&quot;<br>
<br>
On the last word, Vven appeared in a blink before them, from thin air. His hands were shackled together, as well as a short chain binding his feet. The chalk was still in his hands. He gaped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prisoner...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Psyphon's...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trial...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Commence...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well.&quot; Vven said testily. &quot;Don't you guys knock first? You almost caught me with my pants down. Your gourmet bread gave me the runs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prisoner...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Judged...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Vven said. &quot;Do you guys share the same brain?&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
Vven opened his mouth to say more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven.&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;Shut up.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then as one, all six hammers swung down, hit empty air and the deafening sound of a gavel strike reverberated through the room.<br>
<br>
The first Tribunal spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;This Court is now in order.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the distance, the sound of cell door slamming closed, and a muffled scream.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/23/03 2:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> The first Tribunal spoke, a flat, emotionless voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is the defendant aware of the charges brought against him?&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven opened his mouth to speak, and then paused, a look of concentration on his face. A short time passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this about those three assling missionaries in the Nektulos?&quot; he asked cautiously.<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm.&quot; Vven said, &quot;Um, how about that casino scam in the Bazaar?&quot;<br>
<br>
No answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooook, the Wood Elf Strangler? Not that I was anywhere near Greater Fay at the time, just wondering and all...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven!&quot; Pedi exclaimed, shocked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't do it!&quot; Vven exclaimed, &quot;I just used to play poker with a guy that might have...&quot; He waited. &quot;No, huh? Hmm....How about the fire in the Marr temple in Freeport?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That was you?&quot; Whizbang said incredulously.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't do it!&quot; Vven added again hastily. &quot;Fire isn't my thing. I don't even smoke!&quot; He waited for any sign of movement from the Tribunal. &quot;HE smokes.&quot; Vven said, pointing to Riverdane. <br>
<br>
River shot him a dirty look.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lot.&quot; Vven finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ogga.&quot; Ramluk agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven?&quot; Whizbang asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The defendant is unaware of the charges being brought against him.&quot; the Tribunal intoned.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are the charges?&quot; River asked.<br>
<br>
The second Tribunal spoke. &quot;Akethadar of Promethian Order had accused you, Riverdane Wyldechylde, of causing the first permanent death of the Universe. After our investigation, it seems the instigator of Cazic's attack was not you, but Vven Psyphon, and he stands here for sentencing today.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh that...&quot; Vven said. &quot;That I did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We will now hear arguments for his defense. If we find the defense to be weak, he will be sentenced to stay imprisoned for eternity.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, &quot; River began, &quot;We needed to go to Fear because...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not you, Mortal Hate.&quot; the first Tribunal said. &quot;You were implicated by Akethadar, and your testimonial would be in question.&quot;<br>
<br>
All six lifted discorpreal arms and pointed at Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;You, Whizbang Dustyboots, will defend Vven Psyphon.&quot; the Tribunal said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great, I'm dead.&quot; Vven moaned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pass.&quot; Whizbang said.<br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't a loot roll!&quot; Pedi exclaimed, hitting him in the shoulder. &quot;Defend him!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnation!&quot; Whizbang muttered. <br>
<br>
The Tribunal dropped their arms and Whizbang suddenly found himself in a bright, almost blinding light, cutting through the gloom. <br>
<br>
&quot;The defense of Vven Psyphon by Whizbang Dustyboots shall commence.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;For the record,&quot; Whizbang said, squinting in the harsh light, &quot;State your name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon.&quot; Vven replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;With two V's?&quot; Whiz clarified.<br>
<br>
&quot;With two V's.&quot; Vven sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;And a &quot;ph&quot; instead of an &quot;f&quot;?&quot; Whiz asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this really necessary?&quot; Vven snapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show the defendant is hostile.&quot; Whizbang said smugly.<br>
<br>
&quot;It shall be noted.&quot; The Tribunal said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whizbang.&quot; River murmured through gritted teeth. &quot;I think the prosecutors have all the help they need.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang looked abashed. &quot;Alright, may I please see the evidence and testimony that led to Vven Psyphon's incarceration?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Witness number one:&quot; the Tribunal said. &quot;Akethadar of Promethian Order.&quot;<br>
<br>
A flash of light, and Akethadar appeared in the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Akethadar, account for us what happened to Aamedor and Tremas of Promethian Order.&quot; the Tribunal commanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;WYLDECHYLDE TRAINED CAZIC THULE ON OUR CAMP, CAUSING THE DEATHS OF FOUR PROMETHIAN ORDER, TWO WHOM WE COULD NOT REZ AFTER AND ARE FOREVER DEAD.&quot; Akethadar said loudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was Vven Psyphon in attendance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is Vven Psyphon?&quot; Akethadar asked.<br>
<br>
The Tribunal lifted a robed arm to point at Vven in his chains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Him.&quot; The Tribunal indicated.<br>
<br>
&quot;YES, THE DARK ELF SCUM WAS THERE AS WELL.&quot; Akethadar concurred. And then, with another flash of light, Akethadar was gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show the witness has placed the defendant at the scene of the crime.&quot; the Tribunal declared.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was there, yes.&quot; Whizbang began, &quot;but that hardly proves that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Next witness:&quot; the Tribunal interrupted. &quot;Cazic Thule, God of Fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
A flash of light, and Cazic's huge form filled the trial room, lumpy misshapen hands shackled together. He looked utterly miserable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell us of your involvement with Vven Psyphon.&quot; the Tribunal demanded.<br>
<br>
Cazic turned his head to peer at Vven, and then gave out a little shriek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my us! It's him!&quot; he cried. &quot;Keep him away from me! He made me crazy! If it wasn't for him poking and prodding me to kill those Promethian Order people, I would be home now instead of in prison! I wish I had never set eyes on him!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show that the co-defendant has indicated conspiracy of the defendant.&quot; the Tribunal intoned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I please go home now?&quot; Cazic begged pitifully. &quot;This centaur in the next cell keeps looking over at me and calling me sweetheart!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a flash of light, Cazic was gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cazic commits the murders through his henchmen, and Vven goes to prison?&quot; Whizbang said scornfully. &quot;I certainly hope you have more than THAT.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Next witness:&quot; the Tribunal invoked. &quot;Fright.&quot;<br>
<br>
Same flash of light. And there stood Fright, chained as Cazic was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell us what you witnessed, Fright.&quot; the Tribunal instructed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, see, it's like I said.&quot; Fright began. &quot;We were just death touching the monk, who GOT his rez, by the way, when in comes this dark elf with Hate over there and the ogre and the gnomes. And the dark elf starts working up Cazic till he was like...crazy. Haven't seen him this bloodthirsty in years. Next thing I know, I am being commanded to deathtouch the cleric. I was just following orders, ya know? But the orders started with the darkelf over there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show the witness has indicated the defendant masterminded the murders.&quot; the Tribunal declared.<br>
<br>
Fright leaned in close to Vven. &quot;I'll see you after lights out, bish.&quot; he growled. Vven went two shades lighter.<br>
<br>
&quot;The prosecution rests.&quot; the Tribunal said.<br>
<br>
Whizbang paused for a moment, then squared up his shoulders. <br>
<br>
&quot;So does the defense.&quot; Whizbang pronounced. &quot;He's guilty as hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi bonked Whizbang over the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;GET ME A NEW LAWYER!&quot; Vven wailed in shock. &quot;I'll even take the ogga! Filthy rotten rabid gnome!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the record show that the defendant requested new representation, and that the court assigned Ramluk in place of Whizbang Dustyboots.&quot; the Tribunal announced.<br>
<br>
Ramluk was bathed in a bright white light. Riverdane groaned.<br>
<br>
&quot;OGGA.&quot; Ramluk said happily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the defense of Vven Psyphon continue.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/leopa/misc/riverdane_animatedbanner.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riverdane>Riverdane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 7:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breathe</span><hr size=1> &quot;Say name.&quot; Ramluk asked Vven.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't we already do this?&quot; Vven sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;NAME!&quot; Ramluk roared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven.&quot; Vven said in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ven.&quot; Ramluk repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two V's.&quot; Vven added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ven Toovees.&quot; Ramluk corrected.<br>
<br>
Another sigh. &quot;Psyphon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk wrinkled his brow. &quot;Who Fon? Why sigh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Forget it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Proceed.&quot; the Tribunal said flatly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, ogga go.&quot; Ramluk said. He walked up to the Tribunal, and jutted a finger at Vven.<br>
<br>
&quot;He no do it.&quot; Ramluk said, and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes he did.&quot; the Tribunal replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, ok.&quot; Ramluk said, crestfallen. Vven looked like he would weep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Proceed.&quot; the Tribunal repeated.<br>
<br>
Ramluk then grew very very still.<br>
<br>
Time passed.<br>
<br>
No movement from the ogre. River could hear a pin drop if it fell.<br>
<br>
More time.<br>
<br>
Even the Tribunal started shifting uncomfortably.<br>
<br>
More time.<br>
<br>
Then....<br>
<br>
Ramluk scratched his rear end.<br>
<br>
More time passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh would you get on with it already you big oaf!&quot; Vven screeched.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kk.&quot; Ramluk said. He pointed at Whizbang.<br>
<br>
&quot;What you do?&quot; Ramluk demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me?&quot; Whizbang said. &quot;I didn't do anything but port out of Fear!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No no not then.&quot; Ramluk clarified. &quot;What you do for job?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot; Whizbang said, rolling up his sleeves. &quot;I am Whizbang Dustyboots, gnomish sorcerer of the fourth rank, Baron of the Dragonscale Hills, a Master of the Eldritch Collective and wielder of the Staff of the Four. I am the scourge of the Teir'Dal, death incarnate to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nevermind.&quot; Ramluk said, stopping Whiz mid-sentence. He turned to Pedi. &quot;What you do? Beside make good cookie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pedi smiled and obliged him. &quot;I am a cleric. I heal people. I make others well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya!&quot; Ramluk exclaimed. Then he turned to Riverdane. &quot;What you do?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm...&quot; River said, caught off guard. &quot;I'm the guildleader of Razor's Edge. I....I lead people.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya!&quot; Ramluk said again, quite pleased with the answer. &quot;That what you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get to the point, ogga!&quot; Vven cut in. &quot;God I hate oggaspeak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya!&quot; Ramluk said. &quot;That what you do. You hate gud.&quot; He turned to the Tribunal. &quot;See?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; the Tribunal said. &quot;Explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ramluk sighed, then tried again. He pointed to the Tribunal.<br>
<br>
&quot;What you do?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We judge and sentence mortals for crimes against the universe.&quot; the Tribunal answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; Ramluk asked.<br>
<br>
The Tribunal paused. If River read them right, they seemed to be at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
After a pause, the Tribunal answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is our function in this reality to do this. It is our purpose for being.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya!&quot; Ramluk said excitedly. &quot;Same for Ven Toovees! He hate gudder than any guy me know! He full of hate like ogga full of fat and muscle! He live to hate!&quot;<br>
<br>
Whizbang jumped in to add, &quot;What Ramluk is trying to say is that it is in Vven's nature to hate and destroy, and to try him on his basic nature is no more applicable than to charge a cat for killing a mouse, that it is instinctual.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya!&quot; Ramluk said. &quot;Ven stink!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Instincts are for animals.&quot; the Tribunal said. &quot;Vven's destruction was premeditated, not born of passion or instinct. Whether evil or good by nature, he broke the very fabric of natural law by causing not ordinary death, but permanent death, altering the fabric of our reality.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ven just make people die!&quot; Ramluk protested. &quot;Nature law make people stay dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Tribunal stared at Ramluk, paused and then said: &quot;Explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once more, Whizbang stepped in, a look of dawning comprehension on his wizened face. &quot;What Ramluk is saying is that Vven was but a tool used by natural law itself. That the Prophecy named him &quot;enchanted dead&quot; and that Terris herself even deemed him as &quot;necessary for the fulfillment of the Prophecy&quot;, to paraphrase her. What Vven did was not an unnatural act, but fulfilling the very direction that nature, through the Prophecy, was directing us all towards. Vven was but a tool of the natural order of things, as redefined by the Prophecy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me did?&quot; Ramluk asked, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;You did, my boy.&quot; Whizbang beamed. &quot;You did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We will confer.&quot; The Tribunal said, turning toward one another and speaking in hushed tones.<br>
<br>
River leaned into Ramluk. &quot;You're a lot smarter than people think, ogga, but I get the feeling you know that.&quot; he whispered.<br>
<br>
Ramluk gave River a sly smile. &quot;What better?&quot; he asked. &quot;People thinking you smart when you stupid? Or people thinking you stupid when you smart?&quot;<br>
<br>
River fixed him with a long odd look. Ramluk winked.<br>
<br>
The Tribunal turned back to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have reached our decision.&quot;<br>
<br>
River turned away from Ramluk and held his breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the sentencing of Vven Psyphon commence.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   ***   ***   ***<br>
<br>
<br>
No one dared breathe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven Psyphon, it is the opinion of this court that you acted with premeditation and deliberation to cause the deaths of two Promethian Order members. It was not a crime of passion or one born of insanity, but rather, a carefully planned murder.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....yeah.&quot; Vven shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;However,&quot; the Tribunal said. &quot;We have also determined that you had no knowledge of the permanency of the death that you caused, nor if you had known, that the Prophecy would have permitted you to act in any other form than you did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven blinked. &quot;Soooo...I'm off the hook?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Tribunal ignored him and continued on. &quot;Your guilt or innocence, therefore, will be determined by the very fate which seems to have driven you to your present dilemma. If fate would have you free, it will aid you in the task we will set before you. If it would have you imprisoned forever, you will fail.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What??&quot; Vven asked incredulously. &quot;Talk about passing the platinum piece! You can't come up with a straight answer so you're going to let 'fate' decide it? What kind of backward system do you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vven?&quot; Whizbang cut in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven shut up.<br>
<br>
The Tribunal went on: &quot;You will perform the Trial of Execution. A prisoner will be at a beheading block, as one of our executioners and his minions make their way towards him. You must defeat the minions and then the executioner himself. If you take too long, the executioner will behead the prisoner, and you will have failed the trial.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vven had listened quietly through the explanation, but seemed unable to contain himself. &quot;You know, fellas, that would make a really great concept for a game or something, but obviously you aren't too well grounded in reality. Ok, ok, I'll do it. And if I kill enough of your minions, I will prove I'm not a killer. Sounds perfectly logical. I once dated a girl with logic like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You may bring up to five companions to assist you. Just concentrate on them deeply, and they will be summoned here to serve justice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Vven said, looking around the room. &quot;I have four right here. But I don't have the foggiest who I should pick as the...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Allow me.&quot; Riverdane said, furrowing his brow. A look of heavy thought crossed his face. And suddenly there was a flash of light.<br>
<br>
A young high elven male appeared in the middle of the room, clad in nothing but a pair of black boxers with rather bright red hearts embroidered on them. Bright white light bathed him suddenly, making his pale skin go ghost white. He squinted at the Tribunal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, if this is about Aiene....&quot; he said quickly, &quot;...I had NO idea she was only seventeen....&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence from the Tribunal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm, the paternity suit from Midasa? The kid looks more human than elven!&quot; he tried.<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;They must get more confessions this way.&quot; Whizbang commented dryly.<br>
<br>
The elf squinted into the shadows, recognizing Whizbang standing next to Pedi. &quot;Is this about Pedi?&quot; the elf said. &quot;I never even THOUGHT about Pedi. You have the wrong guy, I never touched her.&quot; Then after an appraisal of the gnome with his eyes. &quot;Um, you and Whiz breaking up Ped? Cause if you're free...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Verdad!&quot; Pedi exclaimed, kicking him in the shin. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, ok! Can't blame an elf for trying!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Verdad Primo, you have been summoned by the Tribunal to participate in the Trial of Execution in the defense of Vven Psyphon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Verdad blinked in surprise. &quot;Area blasting?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
