Considering that there is no targetable level-limited version of that line of songs? Hard to say, since even though you assume there might be a level limit, it is never seen.

Even then, songs work differently then spells. The level 4 cleric will not have the benefits of the song without the bard (well not for long anyways). The level 4 cleric will have all the benifits of KEI without the ench for 2.5 hours+.<br>

Sometimes the fact that you are using a bug is clearer than others though. <br>
<br>
Fearing things into obstacles, duplication tricks, getting mobs stuck on geometry, and using safe spots are pretty clear cut examples of exploits.  I know of a way to kill certain types of mobs with certain types of characters in complete safety, it is certainly an exploit, but even then I wound up using it a few times before I was aware of what was going on. Once I realized the bug I went out of my way to avoid those situations though.<br>
<br>
While getting the high level group buffs at low levels probably is an exploit, many of the people taking advantage of it might not realize that they are exploiting a bug. There are other spells that require grouping without having a level limit, invisibility  comes to mind, and it is true of group effect bard songs as well. <br>
<br>
It is even possible, though less likely, that the people casting the spell don't realize it can't be cast with lower level people targetted. They may just habitually target themselves when casting group spells (I do that). I was surprised the first time I tried to cast Boon of the Garou on someone who was under 44. I got the message that they 'were not worthy' of the spell, not even clearly that they were not high enough level. In fact, since I was level 44 and it was in a group I was fighting with, I didn't expect that to be a problem.<br>
<br>
The real clue should be how overpowering the spell is at those levels. I think that fixing it might be more difficult than some people here seem to think, and that might be part of the reason it hasn't been changed yet. In the short term, they probably could cut the duration of KEI in half, which might make it less desirable (though the people who want it would come back twice as often.) It would be interesting if they could code group buffs to scale in effectiveness acording to the recipient's level, so that KEI is no better than clarity at level 20. That probably would be difficult though.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nicolheartsbane>Nicol Heartsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 932<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/31/03 1:44:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25564.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.hiwaay.net/~kostrom/erudite.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> I have posted on many occasions that I consider high level buffs on low level players to be a bad and imbalancing implementation.  The blame for this can ONLY be placed on sony, as this is clearly NOT an exploit.  You cast KEI, person in group gets KEI, the spell works as intended.<br>
<br>
I don't think you were even playing, Whiz, when group spells checked against everyone in the group before refusing to cast.  This implementation was a major pain in the ass, and the level limits for the spells were often not reasonable or fair.  Additionally, you could not cast a self-only buff if you had a low level character targeted, also a major pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Verant changed it so that you could cast the group spells instead of asking level-appropriate people to disband while you cast a buff.  The way it works now is an intentional change away from a bad implementation that has been proposed in this thread a few times.<br>
<br>
Go forward a few years and now much more powerful group buffs with extremely long duration are available, and land on low level group members for extremely imbalancing effects.  You see that people are upset about imbalance, and rightly so.  Will calling this an exploit be a useful rhetorical tool in convincing sony to do something?  If so, go ahead.<br>
<br>
My own opinion is that all buffs should land on all players, but should have reduced effectiveness if there is a sufficient level difference.  Buffs should have recommended levels.  KEI should simply generate a lot less mana on a low level character.  On the other hand, I should be able to cast levitation on a player who can freaking cast levitate on herself anyway, but doesn't have bat wings.<br>

<br>
There are two types of bugs: data bugs, and coding bugs.<br>
<br>
A data bug is when someone enters the wrong data into the game design, this includes things like pathing maps, item stats, spell effects, etc.<br>
<br>
A coding bug is a mistake or oversight in the way code is written.  Including things like carrying so much copper that your weight becomes negative, the ability to stack certain spells that aren't supposed to be stacked, etc.<br>
<br>
Things that are commonly called exploits, but aren't (although they might be against the rules):<br>
<br>
1. Spawn camping is not exploiting a bug, because there is no bug involved. (example of a rule that has nothing to do with any kind of bug)<br>
<br>
2. Gravity Fluxing yourself to heights / Pulling with Eye of Zomm.  (example of relative coding, effects that can be negative or positive, depending on the situation, you can't have it both ways)<br>
<br>
3. Mob warping / Nuking through walls / Summoning through locked doors. (examples of poor design and bad solutions to particular problems, rather than fixing the bug itself, programmers add extra code that &quot;compensates&quot; for a bug, kind of like fixing a leaky pipe by heating the water so it evaporates before it hits the ground)<br>
<br>
4. Manastone + cheal / negative spells not stacking with rez effects / corpse dragging. (examples of lack of foresight, designers fail to realize all possible uses and applications)<br>
<br>
There are more examples, but the word exploit is so misused it isn't funny..<br>

They added it due to huge ammounts of player feedback.<br>
<br>
When you cast ANY level 50+ spell on someone, it checks your targets level, and if able, it casts the spell.<br>
<br>
Before TGB was introduced, if you had a player outside of your group targeted, and were casting a 50+ group spell, the following would occur:<br>
If the player was level 30, it would not cast the spell.  It would never go past the client when it made this check.<br>
If the player was level 45, it would cast the spell, but land only on you and your party.<br>
<br>
I agree, its obvious that somewhere, a bug does exist.  Personally, I believe that the bug exists in checking the level of the target, and the level of the spell, and never considering the type of spell.  Many other people believe that the bug is in not checking when the target is of the appropriate level.<br>
<br>
It would be interesting to know if someone made a client-side hack that let people cast group spells on people too low that were not in their group.  As I understand it, thats not possible anymore (but with hackers, who knows).<br>
<br>
I state again: KEI is unbalancing, but its unbalancing because it lasts for 4 hours.<br>
If it had a capped duration of the standard 2.5 hour duration, it would, in my opinion, still be too long, but at least groups would have to function without it.<br>
<br>
Go play a level 30 cleric.  Get C3, and grind for 4 hours.  Now, go get an enchanter to sit by you and keep you stuck with Gift of Pure Thought.  There should be almost no difference.  If you can keep a high level Clarity (the original) on you constantly you will notice the difference, but Clarity is still easily sufficient for a group.<br>
<br>
The mana regen doesn't hurt.  The fact that a caster can grab C3, then go lfg and group for the evening and never need to group with an enchanter or bard, or most other classes, IS unbalancing.<br>
<br>
If Speed of the Brood lasted 4 hours, the low end game would be even more disgusting for the melee's, luckily we only have to worry about them having Aegolism.<br>
<br>
Whizbang accused me of taking this down to a ridiculous level (I think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). But the entire thing IS ridiculous. Where are you drawing the lines between &quot;exploit&quot; and &quot;legit&quot;?<br>
<br>
If the Bard Travel Song is okay, what about Flight of Eagles?  If its okay only because its a bard song, is a bard standing near your group singing Epiced Chorus of marr (which is like 31mana 31hp/tick when properly equipped I think, and if I'm wrong, its still 20) okay?  Thats twice as high as C3.  <br>
<br>
That is the entire basis of the thread, and everyone keeps pointing at C3.  <br>
Where are the lines drawn?<br>
<br>
Note: I snipped a big section about C3 out of here, I may have to edit.<br>

<br>
In the attempt to come up with a &quot;logical definition&quot; of an exploit, these features are proposed as a means to identify an explit:<br>
1) intentional action<br>
2) resulting in unfair advantage or reward<br>
3) by means of something unintended, or a &quot;bug&quot;<br>
<br>
This position is best stated in Goladus's post:<br>
An exploit is a situation that exists such that a player can take advantage of a bug or unintended design consequence to achieve an unfair advantage over other players, especially in terms of items, platinum, experience, or spawn competition. Also any situation that allows harassment of other players or the ability to make gains with zero risk would be an exploit. More generally, the use of bugs and unintended features to generally break the foundations of the game and make it generally less fun.<br>
<br>
In order to analyze this definition, I propose that we look at the logical requirements of a definition, and then start testing the definition to see if it identifies exploits and non-exploits correctly.  <br>
<br>
A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions.  In other words, it must tell you what is and what is not an exploit.  In evaluating the definition, we will have to examine several cases, and see how it stacks up against what we expect, and what Verant has ruled.  I have prepared a list of cases, mostly from this thread.  Many of these I consider to be obviously exploits, or obviously not exploits, but if we are looking at a definition, we have to be sure it agrees on obvious cases.<br>
<br>
a) Killing mobs from safe spots.<br>
b) Using corpse dragging to simulate CoH where disabled.<br>
c) Using tradeskill containers to transfer nodrop items.<br>
d) Using summon corpse to hop islands in sky.<br>
e) Casting KEI on low level players.<br>
f) Charming a very powerful mob to kill a named with great loot solo, when a full group or more would be needed for a conventional fight.<br>
g) Splitting pulls by means of feign death.<br>
h) Quad kiting.<br>
i) Using high level equipment on a low level character.<br>
j) Powerleveling using non-damage abilities to help.<br>
k) Powerleveling with memory blur.<br>
l) Pulling the Dain to the pits under icewell keep.<br>
m) Using fear where a mob runs away to one spot and stays there.<br>

&quot;An exploit is a situation that exists such that a player can take advantage of a bug or unintended design consequence to achieve an unfair advantage over other players, especially in terms of items, platinum, experience, or spawn competition. <br>
<br>
The major problem is that you defined exploit using equally undefined and judgemental words:<br>
Define what is fair or unfair.<br>
Define what is intended.<br>
<br>
The additional comments are all problematic:<br>
<br>
&quot;Also any situation that allows harassment of other players or the ability to make gains with zero risk would be an exploit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gains at zero risk: I just made a mistletoe cutting sickle without leaving a combat-safe zone.<br>
<br>
Harassment is bad or wrong, but how did it enter into a discussion of exploits?  I'm not clear on that.<br>
<br>
&quot;More generally, the use of bugs and unintended features to generally break the foundations of the game and make it generally less fun.&quot;<br>
<br>
In such general terms, you can't expect this to be accepted as a logical definition which does not rely on opinion and individual interpretation.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Suppose there is a situation in game where you can do something in two different ways, and they work differently.  If one way works better, are you exploting if you do it that way?  Casting force shield after spiritual purity so they both stack would have been an exploit, then, by this definition?<br>
<br>
CoH is disabled in many zones, therefore using a rogue to drag a corpse to the raid is against what is intended for those zones, and this definition clearly labels that an exploit, but this is contrary to the opinion of verant and most players.<br>
<br>
Group buffs were explicitly changed to take hold on low level group members, but some people call it an exploit anyway.  Did verant intent change while the code base remained the same?  If so, this indicates that defining an exploit in rigid terms is impossible, and the &quot;case law&quot; definition holds true.<br>

It depends. I know what you're talking about, but I also know people that killed them BECAUSE they could fear-kite them, not because they could get stuck.<br>
<br>
But back to when you mentioned charm.<br>
That is an example of imbalance, and in my opinion, was completly intended, it was the totality of what was happening that was overlooked.  Thus I don't consider it an exploit.<br>
<br>
My view on powerleveling/twinking is that its up to the player. I have a couple characters I have leveled without powerleveling/twinking, and 1 that I have heavily powerleveled (started an enchanter on my second account so I could 2-box with my wizard to fill in for the lack of chanters in my guild).<br>
<br>
It's unintended, but not really a bug.<br>

Nadier, the point was to see if Goladus's definition agreed with your opinion on each case.  You forgot to evaluate whether or not each case is an exploit according to the definition and why.<br>

From the Customer Service FAQ, (which I discovered while reading up on how to email a Server GM to get back my bridle lost in an LD corpse looting fiasco):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Q. I think someone on my server is exploiting a quest.  He has pulled the two NPCs close together so he can get the quest item and turn it in very quickly. Is this ok for him to do or should I report him?<br>
<br>
A. This is indeed an exploit.  Please report this with a petition as soon as you notice.  Be sure to include the name of the player involved, the name of the NPCs, the zone that player was in, and what the person was doing at the time.<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now, this seems to refer directly to this quest: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=141">everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=141</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Problem is that this is a pretty old quest.  Erudin's been around for awhile, and I challenge you guys to find a site that lists this quest and doesn't specifically mention hauling Slansin up to Toresian.  Most people that have used this quest have at least considered doing this.  It's also easy to do, since nothing in the Tower of Erudin assists Slansin if you pull him and root him up there.  There is also some risk involved depending on your level, since Slansin's lvl 10, if you tried this at the first level you got root, he'd probably drop you before you managed to get up the stairs.  While I might understand the issue if this was on a different quest, my question is, 'Who does this hurt?'<br>
<br>
The only major advantage you get out of this exploit is that you don't have to run up and down 3 flights of stairs anymore.  Anyone else trying the quest isn't hurt by having the NPCs this close, since they still can complete the quest.  The exp gain is also pretty marginal.  Unless you've got a major running fetish, I don't see the harm.  Yes, Slansin has been moved out of his location, but he's only there for one quest, and he's now right next to the NPC that starts the quest.  Is there some kind of problem with people getting lost five feet from where they started?<br>
<br>
If SOE wanted to fix this one, they'd have had ample time to do so, all they'd really need to do is make Toresian assist Slansin.  Changing one NPC would have the effect of rendering this quest exploit a deathtrap, as everything else in that room would auto assist Toresian, and that many lvl 60 casters would burn you down pretty fast.  I have personally used this exploit before, though I've since started doing it the long way after reading the FAQ.<br>
<br>
That may have been a bad example, but I think it illustrates a major point I have on what is and is not an exploit, HARM.  If you can prove to me that something is damaging to other players, then I can see the point about banning it.  <br>
<br>
I've schooled a lot of tanks who think quadding is an exploit by letting them watch what happens when I actually do it.  All it usually takes is one good snare resist, or getting stunned by moving just a little too close to my mobs for them to see the actual risk we take soloing this way.  When they see the work I actually have to put into first planning it out and then doing it, they generally change their opinions of the tactic.  <br>
<br>
One of the major problems with any kind of list like this one is that even this late into the game, we still have no clear concise definition of what we should and should not be able to do.  Look at the class descriptions for example, they give only the most bare boned information on what each class is capable of.  We started out 'masters of DD', then 'masters of arcane teleportation'.  I expect to be 'master of Cabilis's sewage system' by sometime next year.  They're inconsistent over time, and they don't really give you much info beyond the RP aspect and a very general overview.  If someone came out and wrote up: &quot;a wizard's job in a group is to do X, to assist in doing Y, and to pull off Z when all else fails&quot;, that would probably help with some of the problems we see in the game now.  Also, how is a group supposed to work according to: &quot;The Vision&quot;?  I've never seen &quot;The Vision&quot;, and I'm of the opinion that keeping this secret from us, even long after they've supposedly dumped it in favor of &quot;fun&quot;, is a mistake.  <br>
<br>
If I can't see how I'm supposed to be playing, how do I know if I'm doing anything wrong?<br>
<br>
That line probably seems stupid, but think about it for a second.  If someone had done all the up-front work on writing out exactly how they expected the game to work, and what each class's role was, would we have as many problems today defining what exploits are, and have to continually ban or warn players about them?  Yes, that style is more than a little limiting, and penalizes players for 'thinking outside the box', but is it really realistic to send people into a world with a pat on the back and a few toys to play with, then punish them for using those toys later because they don't conform to our unwritten rules?  While I don't personally advocate using any form of exploit, the enforcement policy does seem overly arbitrary at this point.  If you're going to punish me, at least spell out for me what is and is not legal before the feds start knocking down my door.<br>

The question I'd have for anyone exploiting this is, 'Why'?
