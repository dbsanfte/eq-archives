<br>
I guarantee that if you took lvl 50 toons today with original game equipment you could easily own the original planes.  You would destroy Vox and Naggy.  <br>
<br>
Recently I joined a guild that came back after leaving in early velious.  They had never been in NToV yet we went in there with high 20s to low 30s of people equipped with bazaar items and owned the place.  This was not a challenge.  Same with Luclin.  All the mobs were very easy.<br>
<br>
PoP mobs are quite a bit more challenging AND interesting.  I can count the number of times I have been one rounded on one hand prior to PoP.  Now I have lost track of the number of times I have died in one round.  At the same time much more is going on in fights than before.  Of course I haven't made it to the elemental planes yet, but it won't be long.<br>
<br>
The game is just less tedious and less surprising now than it used to be.  You will likely never have the same exp with any new game as you did with the original EQ.  <br>
<br>
This is like saying Final Fantasy One was harder than any other final fantasy, just because you had to walk back and forth over one spot waiting for mobs to attack you so you could level up and move onto the next spot.  That isn't challenging, that is tedious. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=broddathep>Brodda Thep</A> at: 2/12/03 3:10:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2281<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/12/03 3:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> &gt;I guarantee that if you took lvl 50 toons today with original game equipment you could easily own the original planes.

<br>
Don't really see your reasoning here. I agree that it would probably be a bit easier because of experience, but with only gear and buffs available back then, it would still be a fairly decent fight for most.<br>
<br>
Nothing could ever really be considered a challenge according to the way you look at it I think. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
The amount of coordination between classes that is needed during raids has gone up a lot since the early days.  I remember our old Naggy/Vox slayings.  It was basically just 4-6 exp groups all acting independently of each other.  But it got the job done.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 2282<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/12/03 5:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is dying</span><hr size=1> &gt;The game has evolved a lot.

<br>
And I disagree, I think it is more a combination of the 3. It should be noted that raids on Vox/Nags still do fail these days, even with all we have learned. And that is with extra levels, better gear, and a lot better spells. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Not everyone is good at the game nor has the experience...

I don't think EQ is dying. Quite the contrary. I think (and this isn't a conspiracy theory, honest!) SoE is making EQ1 very casual gamer friendly because they know as soon as Shadowbane/SWG/WoW/EQ2 come out, their powergamers are going bye bye. If they don't have a firm hold on the majority of the casual gamers, they're gonna hemorrhage cash from this division like you wouldn't believe.<br>
<br>
Look at it from Sony's perspective. High end &quot;ubers&quot; (god, I hate that term. it's so trite now) are high maintenance. They tear through content like mutated termites in a wood shed. Casual gamers take YEARS to consume the same content. Unfortunately, the high end gamers are also the most volatile demographic in the game. How many times towards the end of an expansion do people take extended breaks or call themselves quitting....only to return when the next expansion drops? Might've been more pronounced in Velious than Luclin but it was still there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, the game is easier now if by easier you mean far more convenient. No more walking 10 miles in the snow with tattered sandals, uphill both ways. With that added convenience, the thrill of exploration was eroded. I remember the first time I ran from Qeynos to Freeport (early December of 99) at level 8. Followed the zone wall to the river in WK and stayed tight against the shore all the way thru WK and NK to the wood bridge. Then died running to the highpass ramp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then a friend (who was a level 27! druid saw my corpse, I consented her, and she brought all my gear back to me in Qeynos <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). I remember the first time I saw someone with a few pieces of Rubicite and Lustrous Russet armor. I remember hearing about those horrific Fear breaks when people would lose ENTIRE LEVELS doing CR. Made me wanna stay low level, that's for sure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yep, the game is much, MUCH more casual gamer friendly now. Some might see that as 'easy' but I don't think those folks would agree with that. Sure, having constant access to KEI makes things a lot easier and with new (old) gear trickling down at amazing rates, folks are a lot more powerful now than they've ever been. One thing I was talking to a friend about (that level 27 druid?) is that stuff that rots on bazaar traders now would've made people scream &quot;TWINK!&quot; back then (Acrylia studded/reinforced tunic blows the Mithril Runed Tunic, that USED to be considered the ultimate druid chest piece, out of the water). Some of the old items that were removed from the game for being 'overpowered' would be vendor fodder now besides the basic novelty (Scimitar of the Mistwalker anyone?). Honestly, if the Box of Abu-Kar dropped again, would anyone rush to farm it? If Rubicite started dropping in Najena, how long would it take for word to get out and how many people would actually WANT it? &quot;Oh look, red armor with crap AC&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yeah, now that I think about it, the game has gotten a lot easier, to me at least. The playerbase is pretty much spoiled now. Items, for the most part, have no mystique about them anymore. People want stuff because of the stats or effect, not because of the item itself or what it represents. People want an SMR now because of spell haste on it or 9 INT whereas 'back in the day', you wanted an SMR because....IT'S AN SMR!!! I think it also has to do with the &quot;maturing&quot; of the players as well. People are more strat conscious now. Look at the equipment forum. People are strategizing on how to maximize mana while keeping resists high and such as low as level 30. That didn't happen before (or if it did, I didn't take notice).<br>
<br>
I still maintain that one of the main reasons the game is easier now is because much of the tedium has been removed. The timesinks (I'm not referring to VT key type timesinks, I mean everyday, unavoidable time sinks) have been largely removed. Whereas before, if you couldn't find a port (which was a fairly common occurrence), you had a long run/boat ride ahead of you. If you couldn't find a rez (which was also a fairly common occurrence), you had a long ways to go to get that xp back. You planned your levelling around 30, 35, 40, and 45 knowing you were going to be in those levels for a while but if you died in them, the xp loss wasn't so bad. But woe is you if you died in 31, 36, 41, or 46. Hunting choices were extremely limited (which also adds difficulty because you had to know &quot;the right people&quot; to get into groups fairly quickly).<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess my point is, whether the game has gotten easier or harder really depends on your perspective and how you view things now as opposed to then. Yes, it's much easier for folks who went through those difficulties but it's not THAT much easier to folks now (since they don't have that perspective).<br>

<br>
     I wanted to make a comment on this subject.  I have played EQ since 2000.  I leveled up a HE wizzy and a Barb shammy to the low 50's.  I quit the game completely in January of 2002.  The main reason being that it was requiring way too much time for me and at that point EQ was not a casual game for casual players.  It had taken me about 12-15 months to level up my toons to the low 50's.  I believe that when I quit I had roughly 82 days played between the two.  BTW this is before the bazaar was live.  <br>
<br>
     A good RL friend of mine that I started playing the game with remained active in EQ and we would chat about the game from time to time.  I finally got interested enough to start playing the game again.  I decided to come back in as a shammy as I had a lot of fun playing them and they were more casual to play as they were easy to get in pick up groups.  I started back up mid December of 2002.  My friend helped me out with gear that was for the most part good low to mid level stuff.  I of course purchased quite a bit from the bazaar as well as  kept KEI running.   I have not 2 boxed, no PL'ing from high levels, I just played my toon. Since December I have played a total of 7days 14hours.  I just dinged 51 yesterday.  I have kept up with all my skills, other than trade skills, just working on leveling, almost all of it solo or at most 2-3 peep groups.  Working dungeons and outdoor zones.  <br>
<br>
     The game is much much easier from what I have experienced.  It has also moved away from the original vision as I can see. I have the benefit of having been apart of the VI years and came back during the Sony years.  The game now seems like a more complicated version of a first person shooter.  In my mind the original everquest is dying.  EQ2 comes out soon, the rest if the MMORGP world is just about ready to explode like a super nova.  <br>
