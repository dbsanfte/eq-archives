<br>
There are always an abundance of ideas on how to help the Wizard in grouping situations.  There are 2 aspects which seem to nullify the suggestion.  1) They infringe on another classes abilities.  2) They impact the solo ability and/or raid value of the class.  With this in mind, I was thinking of how we might be able to use our current spells and abilities.<br>
<br>
Parameters:<br>
Minimal impact on Solo Ability<br>
Minimal impact on Raid Ability<br>
Stay within the current abilities of the class<br>
<br>
What hinders the wizard from reaching his full potential in group situations?  In my opinion, it is the fact that preventing damage is more important to the group than causing damage.  It is true that by causing quick damage, we are killing the target faster and therefore less damage is incurred.  However, if the mob is causing damage very fast, the healer is forced to use less efficient healing methods to keep up with the damage.  Many groups are limited by healer mana even when a mob is slowed; because of this back-up healers are often sought in experience group situations.<br>
<br>
The wizard is capable of preventing damage using our stun line of spells.  In the Kunark era, it was possible to chain stun mobs to help reduce the damage output.  When we stole agro, we could actually survive a round or 2 of melee.  In PoP the mobs hit too fast and too hard to dare to attempt this, the agro will almost surely get you killed.  <br>
<br>
If a wizard could chain stun without the extremely high agro that goes with stun, a wizard could effectively reduce the damage output of the mob.  Without stun agro however, there would be nothing to prevent multiple wizards from effectively chain stunning a mob and reducing the damage output to zero.  With that in mind, I would suggest a non-stacking debuff added to the 'wizard stun' effect.  This way it would not be possible to completely avoid damage, the mob would be able to melee in-between stuns.  <br>
<br>
With resists, the chain of stuns would perform like a variable slow.  The higher the level of wizard the more stuns they can add to chain.  Because our stun spells are not the most efficient, the wizard would be making a decision between causing damage and preventing damage.  Using multiple spells slots also limits the function of the wizard if he needs/chooses to perform this role.  A wizard would never replace a reliable slower, but in a pinch we might be able to supplement a lesser slow, or use the ability in ghetto type groups without key classes.  In testing, resist levels and agro modifiers could be adjusted to increase or decrease the level of effectiveness of this method.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deficits:<br>
Lower ability to help the group prevent damage.<br>
Agro limited more than mana limited. <br>
<br>
Spells:<br>
Telekin: 8 sec stun 18 sec recast 900 damage<br>
Marker's Discord: 8 sec stun 24 sec recast 750 damage<br>
Thunderbold: 3 sec stun 18 sec recast 600 damage<br>
Tishan's Discord: 5 sec stun 18 sec recast 260 damage<br>
<br>
Changes:<br>
Remove/significantly reduce stun portion of agro, if this is not possible add an offsetting amount of agro reduction.<br>
Increase level  affected target to 65<br>
Add non-overwritable debuff (similar to Manaburn) to prevent stun locking for balance<br>
<br>
Another thing that I miss is the ability to root an extra mob on incoming.  Yes, we can still do it, but again agro makes this a far too risky maneuver.  Some classes have agro radius reduction type spells, which aid the pulling of single mobs.  We need to deal with them after they are already at camp.  If the agro were reduced on Greater Fetter, we could better perform the crowd control function, and aid traditional crowd control by separating and keeping the mobs off of primary mezzer.<br>
<br>
Deficits:<br>
Rooting has such high agro that a quickly broken root or resist on incoming can = dead wizard.<br>
<br>
Spells:<br>
Greater Fetter<br>
<br>
Changes:<br>
Remove/significantly reduce agro, if this is not possible add an offsetting amount of agro reduction.<br>
<br>
Neither of these change would significantly impact our solo abilities positively.  By changing the stuns, it will take away the ability to stun lock mobs.  Because in solo environments we own all of the agro, adjusting agro has no affect.  The overwhelming majority of raid level mobs are unstunable, having little impact on our raiding ability.<br>
<br>
What do you think?  Workable?  Not significant enough to impact groupablity?  Overpowering?<br>

On top of everything you've mentioned, here is something I've been using stuns for, to give clerics needing to cast a Complet Heal, a few extra seconds. When I see the complete heal message, I stun the mob. There have been many times where this made a difference. The 8 second stuns are great for this tactic. <br>
<br>
I've said in other threads how my normal group contains a second wizard. We've worked out a system of alternate stunning/direct damage. When he's stunning, I'm nuking, and vice versa. It's amazing how fast the mob goes down and how little damage the tank gets. We are both one step away from completing the concussion spell (City of Mist is all that is left). <br>
<br>
Stuns can also be used in crowd control. If the tank says he's over pulled, I stun one coming in, then root it. If we have our enchanter with us, he mezzes while it is still far away. I then snare it so if it gets free, it's not going anywhere fast and we have time to act. <br>
<br>
Stuns are also great if your group over pulls with no enchanter. I'll snare, and sure enough, one of the mobs comes after me. I let it get close, stun, root and move away, then snare. That way it's not pounding on the tank. Yeah, it takes some mana, but not much. <br>
<br>
Once I get the concussion spell, it's really gonna be easier! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/03 12:08 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group desirability without significant impact on raid/so</span><hr size=1> This infringes on paladins alot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 7523<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group desirability without significant impact on raid/so</span><hr size=1> Before getting too carried away with this, recall the words of Absor when he said they wanted &quot;all characters&quot; to be of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>similar power for soloing, grouping, and raiding.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Now, what this really meant was &quot;Priest classes above level 55&quot; but that's what they said.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This infringes on paladins alot. - Zuratuli<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am at a loss why this would infringe on Paladins.  This is an ability we already have and used to be able to use more effectively when mob dps was not as overwhelming as it is in PoP.  Paladins like stun as much for the increased agro it generates the decrease in the dps of the mob.  I was not proposing decreasing all stun agro; That would truly be a nerf to Paladins.<br>
<br>
It has been my experience that Paladins and Shadowknights are in high demand as group tanks in PoP.  They can generate a lot of agro and stand up decently to the dmg output of the mobs.  <br>
<br>

Ahh my friend, but I think we do.  Wizards certainly to not need any more encouragement to solo, as is evident by the many boasts on these boards on our soloing ability.  Also other classes are aware of our soloing ability, and would certainly object if soloing was significantly improved. <br>

This is certainly a possibility to do within guild and known friends.  I would never think of doing this with pickup group members.  I must say I have not done this in PoP, but participated in many of these in Luclin.<br>

<br>
I agree that the 'holy trinity' is no longer true, it seems to me that now more than ever groups look for specific abilities over classes.  I do think certain classes spend more time looking for groups than others.  I have not seen Enchanters losing spots to Shaman, perhaps this happens more in the elemental planes.  If this is happening often, it goes to show you the power of slow and heal.<br>

<br>
I do not see evidence of our above average status in experience groups.  The damage charts and logs seem to support that we are on par in lower up time groups (in comparison to melee dps), and drop in damage as up time is more frequent or we are responsible snaring.  If we have a nuke item, it appears that a Wizard can compete favorably, but alas the higher end click items are not common enough.  We can not compete with charm dps, and Mage dph has traditionally been better in a higher uptime group even with traditional pets.  <br>

Again, I don't want to give the idea we are broken.  I, like many others, would just like us to see us be more wanted for experience groups.  I am not saying my suggestion is the answer.  I don't think public opinion is won or lost here.  While grouping, I would never suggest that I was anything less than nuclear fission in action.<br>

One of the game's official spokespeople say in black and white that they want the classes to be roughly equal in grouping, and you STILL can say there isn't a problem? Take the freaking blinders off, man. Or are you gonna claim that Wizards are as wanted in grps as the holy trinity?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm gonna say that, cause I get asked to group ALL the time from people that know me and don't know me. I've never had a problem getting a group, or getting a group together. Once in a great while, I'll answer a LFG call and get told, no, we already have a wizard. Not, we don't want a wizard, but we already have one. Other then that, I never get told no, I get meet us at so and so.<br>
<br>
So, I can't agree with you cause I simply don't have your problem. I can get groups, I get asked to group. For lots of reasons. When anyone in my guild want XP, the ask me and the other high level wizard to come hunt, cause they know, we help kill mobs fast.<br>
<br>
So I'm not blind. Your experience has been bad playign a wizard. Mine has been very good. Neither is an indication that wizards are broken. But since most people on this board don't feel the same way you do, I would say that they are not broken. Sure, I would like to see more attention paid to them by Sony, like the do for other classes, but it could be worse.<br>
<br>
I could be a Ranger. <br>

Please people, let us get away from the very old and useless &quot;I get/can't get groups&quot; proof ok?  It has zero validity due to a host of factors that cannot be controlled.  <br>
<br>
I'll say this only for clarity: Wizards are comfortably and easily outdone by Mages in damage per second and damage per hour in groups below level 50.  Everything you point to that helps Wizards helps Mages also (foci, resists, etc) except crits, which amount to a whopping 10% gain in power at best.  That doesn't make up the gap in any way.  Thus, Wizards have to hope either there are no mages around (happens too often, sadly) or that people will want them for their L337 snaring skillz, an ability shared by 5 other classes.  This doesn't equal great grouping ability, so there's a problem below level 50, and always will be.<br>
<br>
However, seeing as this isn't going to change and there's no way in hell SOE will fix the problem, focus on your strengths.  Make friends, group with them.  Solo when you can't get a group, or play another character.  Be the best, most well-informed Wizard you can be.  Get your strategies and power down rock solid, make few if any mistakes, be on top of everything.  Be the eyes and ears of the party, you'll have more freedom than anyone but the Cleric to watch battle spam and adds.  You as a player have to make up the small gap that's there in grouping ability because your class design won't do it.  Get the best gear you can, avoid fancy flashy stuff and stick to what makes you better at wizardry: INT, Mana, Focus.  Keep your aggro under control, don't screw up with AE or adds, evac when its needed and always be ready to port people in your group around.  Be friendly, fun, intelligent, and capable.  Know as much as you can about the area and targets, know more than everyone else if you can - role play the &quot;wise one&quot; aspect of Wizards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Take it from me, there is no human on the planet with more experience on this matter:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Bitching on Message Boards about problems and ways Wizards need fixing will make <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ZERO DIFFERENCE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the SOE about the class.  There was a time they wanted input and did some small things, but they're all but done with EQ anyway, if they do anything it will be only something to playtest EQ2.  Don't come here with constant screaming complaints about how your favorite solo fishing hole was nerfed and the world is ending.  Don't come here talking about how the class &quot;sucks&quot; or is &quot;broken&quot; because all that accomplishes is general mockery and the possibility of others thinking Wizards suck and treating you like it in the game.<br>
<br>
Make friends.  Be a good player.  Enjoy yourself, its a game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=903.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=903.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=903.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=903.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=903.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=903.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
