Just recently i was about to go kill BG, but i couldnt find my sprocket. The last time i had seen it was about 4 months ago on a PoF raid, where i did not turn it in because another wizard beat me in a roll. When i went to get another one i found that i was apprehensive and kandin would yell at me to go away when i said &quot;What oil?&quot;. I petitioned and 24 hours i found that the GMs wont do a thing....what should i do now?<br>
<br>
here's the conversation i had with the GM:<br>

You did the prereq a year ago and had all this time to turn in your sprocket but chose not to do so over a lost roll by another wizard. So now that you want to complete your epic you need the item but cant find it. <br>
<br>
<br>
What probably happened is you cleaned out your vault one day and accidently deleted it. Maybe you noticed it maybe you didnt but the GM is not required to replace it for you. Thats the bottom line. Sony has made some exceptions in the recent past at replacing items lost but given no timeframe other than &quot;Sometime between January and Now&quot; your literally talking about a massive hunt for an item on your account. Sony is religious about backups but comon man. 1 yr??<br>
<br>
Also expecting the GM to just reset your faction because somehow it got lowered is a bit much. in 1 yrs time there are several npc's thruout the game world who can lower your status with truespirit. Its your fault you took a year away from your epic. Not Sony's. Id have to side with them on that. Be thankful they implemented a quest to reset it. I know plenty of wizard friends in the past who literally were SOL.<br>
<br>
<br>
If i was the GM and listened to your complaint i would have handled it in the same mannor. Be thankful he didnt respond the way you did in tells. There is an old addage in the  Customer Service field that i use to this day. If you want good service don't take it out on the represenative. If it were me i would have been less inclined to help you with your concern.<br>

BTW, yeah i might have been a little rude in some of the things i said in there, but i was angry, and you should understand that.

Actually he gave you about 3 reasons, 1 of them being a server switch. The other 2 being SK Epic/ Shaman Epic assistance.<br>

<br>
Thats a personal choice my friend. Again they are not obligated to fix anything here. There are 3 reasons listed above alone that could be to blame; but those arent the only truespirit faction npc's in the game. There are quite a few<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And the reason ive taken so long is because it is hard for me to do. I dont have 3 groups of people at my side on my command to break into PoF and kill a mob for me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Understandable. But you can't expect SOE to give into every player that has a problem with the game. If we could all blame everything on the game and have GM's cave to our every whim the game would get boring fast. Ya took a year off your epic which is fine, but somewhere within that year you did something to directly effect your faction. It doesnt just happen. Faction changes with truespirit are limited to 1 of about 30 mobs total in the game. Somewhere along that line you interacted with one and lowered your faction.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No matter when i did the quest i should still be able to get another sprocket. If i destroy i sprocket, it should not matter because i have done the prequest.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Provided you hadnt manipulated your faction with the required npc in that time sure. You should have been able to walk right up and request another one. But you yourself are uncertain if you have interacted with any truespirit mobs in that year's time. Starting over the faction is all you can do, and i think the GM was more than fair. Thats just my opinion though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yeldareyugami>Yeldare Yugami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/03 9:20:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26381.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic quest problems</span><hr size=1> Okay, this stuff about manipulating my faction is utterly wrong. The GM is just resorting to this. Sure, i cant prove i ever had good faction, but he cannot prove that i ever had my faction lowered. Why assume that i had my faction lowered by other epics rather than assume that it is an error with the game? Nevertheless, the wizard epic faction is not MEANT to be adjusted by anything. I know i cannot prove it, but i NEVER had my true spirit faction adjusted since the quest. I never assisted anybody with a shaman or SK epic quest. NEVER. Just assume for a minute that this is an error with the game, would this be right? Think about how the epic is meant to be. They dont want wizards to have to redo the epic quest. <br>

That is the only answer he gave there. That means that their is NO other reason i am MEANT to do the prequest. To resort to some other classes' epics is just a way to shut me up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xasbik@graffeswizardcompilation>Xasbik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/03 9:24:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26381.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> its because</span><hr size=1> They changed the whole faction adjustments given at different steps in the Wizard Epic quest a while ago because whiny people kept complaining the quest was broken, even though I and many many other Wizard friends completed the epic fine start to finish prior to any changes (no, not months before, some literally 1-3 weeks before they finally changed the faction from the quest).  <br>

Did you go inactive?  You should of seen the change in the patch message.  Really, I don't see anything wrong with how the GM handled the situation, but I do see that you were completely rude with them.  If I was that GM I would of made you scowls to truespirit after the way you treated them.  <br>

Be serious here, you did the pre-quest a YEAR ago, they aren't going to have your records for that.<br>

Is 1900pp really that much of an issue for you that you can't do the prequest over again?  Any 50+ Wizard can make 1900 easy in 1-2 nights play time.  <br>

Hell, what server are you on?  If you're on mine I'll give you 1900pp just to make you shut up.  Again, the GM didn't do anything wrong and all you did was treat them like crap.

You petition, the gm blabbers on about how he doesnt have any evidence of you owning an epic.  Unluckily a glitch occured in the game where your epic got poofed.  Are you telling me that you wouldnt get mad? You would brush it off and say, oh just 25 more phinnys again.

Given the context of his replies to the GM do you really think he deserved anything less than the response he was given? The GM acted professionally within his bounds to help the guy. If the information isnt there move on and deal with it. 1 year's time is a bit excessive to expect a GM to just pushover and succumb to your whims just because you're their customer. If there is no log for him to retrieve the data from that far back then he gave the customer avenues with which he could take to finish out his epic.

That being said, no GM will help you on this matter.  You only have a couple of options:<br>
<br>
1) Reset your faction in Sol Ro, then do faction work to raise Truespirit.  You don't have to redo the 2k though, look up the shaman epic and do the early step over and over again to raise the faction.  (Something about spawning &quot;a lesser spirit&quot; in OOT or RM then handing in an item in FP.)  Or you can go the fast way and redo the wizard epic steps, which is what I did when Kandin wouldn't talk to me.  You lose 2k, but it only takes an hour and you're ready to finish your epic.<br>
<br>
2) Get another wizard with good epic faction to get you a gear (they aren't nodrop), get your oil with that, then do the invis trick to hand in the items.  I don't know if this even works anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it.  I doubt a GM would be very willing to help you recover your lost epic items if he discovered you used invis to try and raise your faction artificially. <br>
<br>
The bug is stupid and gave a lot of people grief, but it's there and you'll have to work around it, if you want your epic.  It's not hard to do luckily, just takes a bit more work.  <br>

I had also already done the first part of the epic with paying the 2kpp so if you havn't done that might take more trips.<br>
<br>
As to the original poster I'm the type of person that is of the opinion if you can fix it without to much trouble yourself then theres no point in complaining about it.  If I go to a store and spend 50 cents on something and find something wrong with it I'm not going to bother returning it because it was a small investment.  Were as if I had spent alot of cash on something and found something wrong heck yeah im going to want a refund.  <br>
<br>
I see this the same way with your above problem.  Your complaining becuase your small investment isn't working right, do you have a right to complain sure, should you complain?  I don't think so.  If you had lost your epic instead thats a BIG investment and well worth complaining about.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to bet in the time you spent trying to get a GM to answer your question you could have better spent the time getting cash and redoing the first part of the epic and even finding out here on this site how to raise faction and finding someone to help you get to indifferent.<br>

Ohh and if you reset faction in solusek temple it resets to what it was when you first started your character. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azzitay>Azzitay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 253<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/5/03 2:33:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26381.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Epic quest problems</span><hr size=1> Ack,<br>

<br>
stop bitching so much about a minor fixible problem. you lost aout 1/100th of the work the epic requires. redo it and be happy your staves werent eaten.<br>
<br>
thumbs up to the GM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26381.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26381.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26381.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.graffe.com/images/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26381.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26381.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26381.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26381.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
