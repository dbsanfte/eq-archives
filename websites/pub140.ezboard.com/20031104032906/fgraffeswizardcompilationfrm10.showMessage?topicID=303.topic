You can go to any class web page like Graffes(www.graffe.com  for Wizards go to there msg board and about class balancing and theres over 2000 post of pissed of Wizards and even a few druids Who feel VI really stuck it to us. We cant solo as well as before and thats ok, cause Vi wanted to make the game more group based but when you make these to classes least disirable, theres no point to even looking for a group. Unless my guild needs me for raids or groups no strangers want wizards you can spend 4 hours in Seb and never find one and all the other casting classes around you mag, Ench and necros are taken without hesitation. With the big fix the 2 bane spells that cost almost 30 pp to cast each time arent even worth what they do . we have the longest downtime of all class and if thats not bad we arent even the masters of DD anymore. Mages and Shms and Ench have over taken  us almost. For every group fight i have i have to sit for 5- 10 min and the pulls come to fast after 30 min im always medding. Theres no Balance. With the new Vel translocate spell it makes us more of a bitch class. I dident start a Wiz to port tanks all around the world thats all i get tells for . However Wizards and Druids have leverage over the entire game and its time we use it. WE are the only classes that can port, if we want to see changes made then its time to Use it.

Wow 4 hours in Seb not getting a group.  Either you have a reputation as a bad Wizard or are annoying because that should not happen.  Besides we have the ability to get ourselves to other places to look for groups in or we can get on a few waiting lists then solo for better exp in any of several places.  Other classes are hooped if they don't get a group and are less able to look for groups in other places.<br>

/agree they do suck, but how do you figure they are a fix?  Anything that you have to get to level 60 to be able to do is in no way a fix to a class.<br>

Wizards are 100% mana dependant and groups are just mana management.  You must have known that is what we are like in a group when you chose the class at the very beginning.  We stand, cast, sit, stand, cast, sit... it is what we do.  You have to accept that early or choose to be a warrior.<br>

Umm do what?  What balance are you looking for and what changes do you think that would make?  Make the need for teleporters a thing of the past, thus removing the main reason we get asked into groups or on raids?  We could all refuse to port people and that would accomplish 2 things:<br>
1. Leave places like Hate completely empty.<br>
2. Make us look like vindictive whining idiots who have know idea how good we really have it.<br>
In groups we do damage, some crowd control and evac. When not in groups we can solo better than most classes and take ourselves or others to various places very quickly.  That is our lot in life.  Get used to it or change classes.  I hope you don't think of this as a flame.  It is not meant to be.  I just think that if more Wizards would look at the big picture and see what each class is really capable of they would be much happier being a Wizard.  We don't have to deal the biggest amount of damage in a group because that is how our class is described.  Because a rogue may outdamage us in a group situation does not make a rogue a better class.. far from it we can do much more.<br>
<br>
We cannot do it all or be the best at everything.  No class can. <p><embed src="http://www.allcanadiantrees.com/eq/Zapin1.swf" width="280" height="160" quality="best" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">

As for crowd control, what has the whole wizard community up in arms is that velious has rocked our individual crowd control.  We're solo machines now in kunark and old world, but that's about it.  Because of velious and mobs with uber resists and massive hp, our dmg is minimal and can no longer be considered crowd control.<br>
<br>
Given we are still useful against old world and kunark mobs, but other classes only see usefulness in velious as their prime purpose.  In addition, this also means that this will be the precedent for any future expansions, so wizards will ALWAYS from now on be limited to the old world and kunark.  Hell we aren't even the best farmers, look at necros and mages with their pets, I've seen a mid 50's necro plow through mobs in Sol A with his pet while I can only take down 3 at a time before having massive DT.  What has wizards up in arms the most (and this is my opinion) is that verant has crossed the balance lines.  Tanks have become the caster and the tank.  Their weapons and armor from kunark almost all have some effect that will prove useful in a defining way that will seperate them and make them very powerful since they are an item based class.  With lower dly's, higher dmg, better haste items and special magical effects on their armor, tanks have overtaken the role of the caster as being better at dmg output.<br>
<br>
The old scenario is this, tank does the most dmg in the long run, but in an over pull, you need an enchanter to mez, a wizard to drop the mob down through berserk phase or just outright kill one or 2, and a cleric to heal and the wizard pays a downtime during the over pulls and contributes stuns and evac but meanwhile isn't the prime source of dmg.  Now our dmg is nothing if cosmetic and our lack of class defining items (it's much harder to come up with these for a spell based class) is leaving us far behind since the upgrades to our spells have been less than adequate (the only truly useful spells I've seen come out are lures, draughts and sometimes jyll's) and they nerfed our lure line which really blows (like I've said, was it really THAT powerful considering tanks don't run out of swings on uber mobs and all we have is mana?).  I think with the mana/dmg ration of lure line, it OUGHT to be nearly unresistable, but apparently verant deluded as always thinks we are overpowered.  They clearly are NOT paying attention to us, they closed our msg board, released 2 lvl 60 bane spells with high costing reagents and are saying bend over, take it and shut up.  Hell, they put a dumb dmg shield with a WEAK clarity effect on our epic for crissake.  Where in my class description did it say we were shields?  Apparently verant wants us to be the tanking class of the casters for some strange reason.  We get more aggro than we should, more resists than we should (why is it a resist causes as much aggro as a hit?) and less mana than we need with a less than adequate mana/dmg ration for velious.  In addition, they outright lied to us by telling us fast cast &quot;haste&quot; items for casters or focus dmg items were impossible, yet they just lowered cast times in increasing percentages post 50.  <br>
<br>
We have been lied to, we have been deceived, we have been ignored, and we have been abused as a class.  I'm not saying a port strike is the answer to this, but to say we are balanced since velious came out is absurb.  Pre-kunark we were gods with minor complaints, and now we're unwanted, not needed and worthless and verant is blind to that.  all I can say is TAXI!!!<br>

You seem like an intelligent person Zapin, and maybe things are different on your server.<br>
<br>
My last three trips to Seb where I GOT a group, one I started and got lucky with the people there. Darn good group and we were going strong in 4 room till the patch.<br>
<br>
However, while I was down there there were 4 other wizards shouting for groups almost the entire time. We're talking about over an 8 hour period. One was 57 ... he kept getting groups that didn't last it seemed. His shout was looking for a group again.<br>
<br>
One was sitting there shouting the whole time. The other two were popping in and out.<br>
<br>
The next two times, I went with friends. Both times there were people who left the group because my friends wouldn't kick me out for anothe melee. Both times there were wizards at the entrance shouting for a group and not getting one.<br>
<br>
You can almost be a total jerk but a cleric or chanter/bard and you'll get a group. W/o my friends I'm screwed.<br>
<br>
Over the last few weeks I've been going to Seb I pop my head in shout for a group, try to group with people at the zone and pop out to solo again. That's just not what I'm paying $10 a month for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/useverinewolfe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Severine Wolfe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/4/01 9:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Agree and disagree</span><hr size=1> OK I can address this issue.  We have only 3 high level wizards in our guild, seems like all the rest are shaman or dr00ds, so I NEVER have trouble finding a group.<br>
<br>
I learned by level 16 to NEVER get into a pick up group.  If I am not in a guild group I am working on skills or porting.<br>
<br>
One thing most of you have to learn is that other players are the most dangerous things in the game. I have never been in a pick up group where I did not get killed because no one knows each other's fighting styles or is completely ignorant of their own class.<br>
<br>
So we can't do everything... Big Deal!  Dr00ds do EVERYTHING and they're always OOM.  they also have a ton of epic quests, whereas we have ONE and it's always broken.<br>

Only hunt with guild mates. Problem is, I have yet to find a guild on Karana that I could ever group with people.<br>
<br>
The first guild I was in, I was too low to group with most. And when I did get together with them I got massacred ... finally got booted for kvetching about it, and that guild wound up being investigated by a GM for their treatment of me. (I was invited back the next day but turned up the opportunity.)<br>
<br>
Second guild I was in, again I was too low. Left after 3 days. Incidentally, so did half of the members of the guild but that's another story.<br>
<br>
Third guild, I hardly got to group because I was always the highest and the other 3 close to me were their own clique.<br>
<br>
Fourth guild started out great, but fell apart. I ultimately became the leader of the guild and had the unpleasant task of disbanding it.<br>
<br>
At 54 I am now guildless, and searching. Shadowed Fates THE uber guild on Karana isn't really even much interested in another wizard. I could MAYBE get in at 56 ... maybe. Most of the other high end guilds with enough people to regularly take down the uber mobs are French. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaendayar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aendayar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/01 1:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Agree and disagree</span><hr size=1> Start your own group if you can't find one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/12/01 7:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Agree and disagree</span><hr size=1> Have you ever seen an open camp in OS, or a time when Karnor's isn't fully camped?  I love how people say to start a group, but where to camp is the question.  Chardok has two camps for a single group for the most part(In and outzone tunnels), and those are usually taken these days it seems.  Howling stones takes a bit of planning, and honestly needs a 51+ rogue to pick the locks, as well as a nice walk to get to the zone as well.  Don't even think about Velious, where it's green halfway into the zone before blues start to show up in numbers high enough to be considered a decent camp.<br>
<br>
Let's face it, 51+ SUCK because there's a shortage of good zones to go to where pickup groups are a possibility.<br>
