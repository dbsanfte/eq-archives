Its essentially a fancy buff. The concept of a familiar has a great wealth of possibility, but sadly it was botched. Here are some numbers to ponder and then an idea to make them as awsome as they could be<br>
<br>
PoTG:<br>
1200 mana<br>
Group<br>
Castable on others<br>
Increase AC (24) <br>
Increase Hitpoints (450) <br>
Mana Regen (6 per tick) <br>
Max Duration:  1 hour 40 minutes <br>
<br>
Greater Familiar<br>
650 mana<br>
Self only<br>
+25 all resists<br>
Increase mana regen 4 a tick<br>
See invis<br>
Upon death of familiar wizard looses 50% of mana or if mana pool is empty health<br>
<br>
Is it just me, or does the familiar look extremely dissapointing in this light. Familiar is a huge liability to the wizard, and benefit we receive for such risk is virtually nil. +25 resists (extremely easy to reach 255 of any resist with proper buffs/equip) And see invis and 4mana a tick. Along with the vunerability to AE spells.<br>
<br>
When i first heard about familiars i assumed they would be true unique buffs, augmenting casting in a new way. Instead we get a buff with a graphic. Here's what i suggest<br>
<br>
Level 30/50/60 spell: Invoke lesser/greater/arch efficency<br>

<br>
Not stackable. You would have to change augments as the situation calls for, adding a nice level of variety and spice to the wizard class.<br>
<br>
Make them quest rewards. With a story and flavor to add to the game, not &quot;kill uber mobs A,B,C,D and then give me their rare drops&quot;<br>
<br>
This would add some much needed power and spice to wizards, and make familiars damn cool like we all thought they'd be.

<br>
Question then: if you cast 1 of these &quot;augment&quot; spells and another is already there, do you overwrite the existing one, or fail on the new one?  I think for balance, we should have the new one fail, so that the familiar would have to be removed, then recast as well. <p><br>Aniar Orrenson

The numbers may seem high, but i think it finally puts us where we should be. Portable thermonuclear missles who tear like wet tissue paper when attacked.  Plus, no wizard could really use the familiars in a raid situation without improve familiar, as they die on the first AE mob =\ And we are sorely lacking in 6 man pickup groups. The only issue i see is improving wizard soloing, but then again i've seen twinked melee with fungi's tear through levels faster than we ever could. I fail to see how a fungi is less unbalancing that this in terms of level'ing <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ushimmerdark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shimmerdark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/21/01 9:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to make the familiar worthwhile, rather than a poor </span><hr size=1> There is no reason for subtly, it is an alternate exp choice. <br>
<br>
I think we need to stop complaining about what we get, other classes are starting to look at us as whiners. We get a great spell like a Familiar, and we complain and want more. Granted they need to fix it so they aren't as buggy but 25 to all resists and 4 mana a ticks is nice. Pretty sure any class would like 25 to all resists and mana regen that stacked with everything else out there. If your worried about him getting killed just loose him someplace it's not that hard.<br>
<br>
At 60 we regen about 25 mana a tick, the familiar is a 16% increase in mana regen not to mention it stacks with everything else.<br>
<br>
Epic/Familar/C2/Bard Song/PoTG = About 50 or 60 mana a tick, it all adds up. <p><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Shimmerdark<br>Sorcerer of Innoruuk<br></font><A href="http://www.fnurt.net/amici/">Amici</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulunasnoewe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunasnoewe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/8/02 1:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Are you sure?</span><hr size=1>  Are you sure they dont stack ?

That has to balance against something. Even if we aren't balanced now, we're not going to -achieve- a happy balance by competing for a role that's already taken. If you give us 15 more mana per second, we'll just be a little better at being crappy rogues. This is NOT where I want to see my class headed.<br>
<br>
Personally, I've had it up to _here_ with sustained dps. I'm tired of my class being measured in terms of our performance as second-rate dots.<br>
<br>
I would rather say the hell with sustained dps. Make me LAST at sustained dps. I forfeit. Give me something which will improve my performance in the thing I'm actually -useful- for: immediate, catastrophic damage.<br>
<br>
So the only one of your choices I solidly agree with is enticement. We do need more ways to reduce our resist rates.<br>
<br>
Kill the option that increases our damage per nuke. Replace it with an option that will increase both our damage and -mana- per nuke. 1.2x / 1.3x / 1.5x. Same efficiency. More impact.<br>
<br>
Kill the options that improve our mana regen and casting efficiency. Replace it with an option that gives us 10 / 25 / 33% more mana -capacity-. Bigger burns and deadlier manaburns. THAT is what we are about.<br>
<br>
If none of these will help us get into pickup groups, do we really care? I don't. I was thinking about pickup groups the other day, and realized I really don't care anymore.<br>
<br>
If my friends are online, they'll play with me because they are my friends.<br>
When they aren't online, I do not envy impersonal grind groups.<br>
Those are really just the same as soloing, but with more keystrokes.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps I'm missing something badly... but anyway that's how I feel at the moment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukazzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kazzap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 643<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/1/02 10:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to make the familiar worthwhile, rather than a poor </span><hr size=1> My little flappy...<br>

Two points of mana regen when not around AE mobs.  Nice, but for this I trade my piece of mind and ability to target? (noisy, frenetic little drake).<br>

Let's complain about everything, shall we?<br>
<br>
AoE kills your familiar?  Then don't summon it.  If you're on a raid level encounter where a mob is using massively harmful AoE, chances are you have plenty of support.  If the usual line of resist buffs, PoTG/KEI-C2/Flowing Thought/Bard Song, and Hp buffs aren't enough to keep you alive and fruitful, get out of that raid.  You're going to kill someone other than yourself and possibly everyone who is counting on you to do your job.  Your job on high level encounters?  You'd better know this already, but I'll spell it out:  DON'T out aggro the MA and ping pong the mob all over the place, DON'T overburn your mana too soon and leave the mob alive when everyone else has expened their mana and hps to get it to X% hps, DO nuke only when told to, and FINISH off the mob when it's time for you to do so.  Still want your familiar with you on such outings?  Put AA points into the class enhancement for it and make it immune.<br>
<br>
Now that raids are out of the way, let's address the single group--<br>
<br>
Familiar dies when you invis?  Eventually (we hope) this will no longer be an issue.  Verant has listed this as a known bug and table it to be fixed.  Until such time, a little forethought and planning goes a long way.  Don't summon the bloody thing until your at your particular camp spot.  If you need to invis in order to get there, chances are you're avoiding mobs rather than fighting them and a familiar isn't needed when one is evading.  Get to the camp, set up, summon your familiar and let the pulling begin.<br>
<br>
Mana regen is negligable?  Are you crazy?  If you can't maintain a mana pool during a regular ol' group, you're obviously a poor choice and should be dumped for someone else.  ANY mana regen is better than nothing, and familiar mana regen stacks with everything.  EVERYTHING!  KEI-C2/Flowing thought/Bard Song/PoTG.  If you need even more mana than even C2 alone can provide, again you are a poor choice and obviously in over your head.  I'll take any mana regen I can get, thanks.<br>
<br>
Fizzle rates aren't an issue?  That is just plain silly and bordering on reckless, IMHO.  I can't begin to name the times when I've tossed a stun on a mob to buy an enchanter a few extra seconds to re-cast a resisted stun, or to prevent a gate or CH from going off for that matter, only to have a fizzle kill my timing.  It's not often, but ANY reduction is more than welcome.  You don't use stuns, you say?  If you don't, it's because another player has that role covered, or you're an overburning agro-hound who can't deal with the adversity of playing multiple roles according to each unique scenario. =P<br>
<br>
Targeting is a pain with the flappy around?  If you don't have a hotkey for using /assist by now, please go back to soloing as you're not fit for any group over level 35.  Period.  Any enchanters or warriors out there disagree on that one?<br>
<br>
Forgive my rant, but I once looked forward to the release of the Translocational Suppression line--only to watch it go down in flames as message after message was sent to VI to burn it down.  How many other assets might we have today if all of us weren't demanding the full monty?  I understand that there may have been other issues surrounding the lack of help to our class, but I highly doubt that all the childish complaints sent to VI did much to encourage them.  <br>
<br>
In conclusion, shaddap, be creative, adapt to your surroundings, and make the most of what you DO have rather than complaining about it.  Could Familiars be better?  Certainly.  I could have a 10k mana pool and a 9:1 ratio nuke too, but I don't.<br>

Familiars are used for mana regen as well as resists, and while the increase to the mana pool might be used for casting spells in combat, the purpose of a familiar is NOT &quot;just for combat&quot;.  So, while we want to evade mobs, we want our familiars.  There are also times where we don't use the standard group balance and are expected to assist continually.  Melees, clerics, enchanters, the list goes on for seeing the familiars getting in the way as a problem.<br>

So, yes, there are many problems, and yes, they can be made more useful as I have mentioned in my last post to this thread.  So, while I agree that those who whine deserve to be yelled at, YOU deserve it even more for not understanding all the issues.<br>

I read your post twice and tried to find something in it that I could argue with. And since I could not find anything I would just like to say to the rest of you... When will it ever be enough?<br>
<br>
I look at the Pre-Kunark game, and I remember telling myself I am a Wizard I won't begin to shine until I have truly proven myself to the world. But then Kunark came out and that whole way of think was shot to hell! (And Velious only made me feel worse). But now we have Luclin and preceding that expansion's release we have a very long list of demands/requests/suggestions concerning our class. We wanted Mana regen, we wanted more mana (even if it were just a little) we wanted higher damage, we wanted a 'real' nuke for level 20, we wanted a level 60 nuke that was not a joke, we wanted to be able to offer something to our groups that did not involve teleports, some of us even wanted pets(what a joke), and the list just goes on and on and on.<br>
<br>
When Luclin came out we were given new spells (we won't talk about the O'keil line of spells... ever), and in the list of these new spells we find that we have a level 20 nuke that is actually useful (I even use it from time to time), we are given new teleport spells (though the function of these spells may require a rant of their own), and we have our much anticipated familiar spells. The level 29 familiar while not totally useless could be better. The level 49 familiar gave us a number of buff the most important of which was our much needed (and deserved) mana regen. Now on this point many complain that the mana regen is 'only' equivalent to FT1, and to that I say, sooooo? I personally feel that 1 mana per tick is better than the 0 mana per tick that we had before... The level 54 familiar (which I am using now) Is wonderful! 2 mana per tick (the same as breeze) resists, see invis, 75 mana added to our current mana pool, and some say that they also give 'random bursts of mana' (I haven't seen it nor I have read anything about that from Verant, so I won't mention it again). I won't talk about the 4 mana per tick or the 150 extra mana that the level 60 familiar gives since i don't have that one yet. Instead I will ask this... when will we be happy?<br>
<br>
Ok yes the familiars could be better as Valraukar stated, but who cares? Samantha (my familiar) works her butt off for me and in return I make her food, because she's a good little drake. When she gets lost she doesn't get into trouble, and when she finds me, she doesn't bring me all of the friend she met along the way. And to the people who think that she should be throwing out 'baby nukes' I say, 'Play a Mage!'<br>
<br>
Our teleports are not perfect. I was more than just a little upset about the Surefall Glade teleports, and yes, I am still bitter. I'm not happy that the Luclin teleports... Ok 'suck' is the word I'm looking for here. And the grouping requirement should be removed from the TLs. Though if just one of these things were fixed, I don't think I would complain 'openly' about our teleport spells. They are all fairly small issues if you consider the fact that it is a game, so I would be happy with one of these being fixed. But other would not, and you all know who you are.<br>
<br>
Our nukes aren't as good as they should be. Try reading a fantasy book that has a wizard in it, you will see that they do not show real power for quite some time. They struggle and endure for long periods of time, and many do not make it; but those who do become legends and sometimes even gods. I'm not saying that a level 60 Wizard is better that a level 60 of this class or that class, or that a level 60 Wizard could beat this person or that person in a duel, what I'm saying is that when it comes to doing what we do at that level, I challenge you to find a class.. AND class that does it better, or even as well as we do.<br>
<br>
Be proud of who you are. Solusek Ro has blessed you with a gift (even the disgraceful gnomes out there). We are very powerful and with that power must come an understanding. And if you do not understand, if you do not know your place, then you really should consider another class, and stop complaining about mine.<br>

Lets say verant adds +1 damage to all DD spells. Sure it's better than we had before, but it hardly counts for jack when rogues can pull a sustainable 140DPS and we can do 240 for about 30 seconds then med for 10 minutes<br>

And I fully expectd to get yelled at for laying out how I feel about my class.  Yes, we &quot;want&quot; our familiars during evasion.  And we all want it right now.  Not when verant gets around to fixing the bug and testing the coding--now.<br>
<br>
I also understand that this theoretical &quot;group balance&quot; doesn't always get acheived.  I do howver always find a way to be an asset or point blank tell the group that they should find someone else.  I'm here to play the game, enjoy it and the people I group with. <br>
<br>
If I snare a mob, I'm an asset.  If I stun a mob and prevent a CH or a gate from being cast, I'm an asset.  If I deliver the killing blow to a mob and saved even 30 seconds of fighting time, I'm an asset.  And yes, I will, and can, and HAVE done so for hours on end with no mana regen at all.  If I'm not enough of an asset to the group, most are straightforward enough to tell me so and I go my merry way without regret or hard feelings.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry your wizard isn't what you &quot;want&quot; or even maybe what you expect.  I didn't start playing a wizard with any preset notions on what I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be.  I took what I was given and made the most of it.  And the vast majority of the community on this board does also.<br>
<br>
But how many good ideas get trashed by our beloved community for no other reason than it's not what we &quot;expect&quot; or &quot;want&quot;?  I feel it's a valid question.  I don't think wizards couldn't use some fixing here and there, but I'm not going to trash what I have been given because it's not good enough.  It'll do until I'm given something better.<br>

<br>
You are kidding right?<br>
At level 1 adding 1 damage would be helpful, at level 50 however you're not really going to see it. None-the-less your comparison is nothing short of ridiculous.<br>
<br>
At level 60 we regen mana at 25 per tick... Adding 1 to that is just a little different than adding 1 to 1120. So again 'its better than nothing.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 432<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/7/02 12:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The insanity goes on...</span><hr size=1> The wizard class at level 60 on LUCLIN is what I want the class to be, and I love playing a wizard.  I was responding to the posts here.  I don't complain about the wizard CLASS, but I do see some ways to improve things that would enhance the class without altering the balance in any way, shape, or form though.<br>
<br>
What I DO complain about is the way we can lay out ideas over and over again to Verant, and yet, most of them get ZERO response.  Then again, I'm sure that for scouting, instead of using the useless eye spells that last for only 30 seconds, we could use familiars for the scouting aspect without the familiar being a scouting tool.  Or to have familiars be TINY, and sit on the shoulders of wizards when they arn't being used for scouting(if that would ever be a benefit of them).  If we can bind sight, why can't we automatically see through the eyes of our familiar, no matter how far away the familiar might be?<br>
