1.he is small and can fit in to a lot of places that others can't<br>
2.ultravision (unff said )<br>
3. frogs start with a swimming of 125 <br>
4. the fact the frogs and hold there breath for just about for ever is VERY nice. (that and point 3 let me get my staff of the wheel sooner then most other Wiz i know) <br>
5. and IMHO frogs look sweeeeet doing backflips when we cast <br>
6. and last and also IMHO frogs have the best looking /bow  /cheer and /dance in the game <br>
7. frogs have webbed feet the will let them get some good force behind a gnome when they punt them <p>Nemo Me Impune Lacessit - The BlackWatch</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarroslivinglight>ZarrosLivinglight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/03 1:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Froloks are gonna make things intresting.</span><hr size=1> We do NOT punt gnomes!

<br>
Technically, NO wizard can punt...no kick skill.  However, froglok warriors at least look graceful while they kick, almost like a ballet dance move of death.  No other race has that.  Furthermore, while every other race looks like a spas when /dancing, frogloks do this really cool alternating kick dance that clearly demonstrates our superior kicking ability.<br>
<br>
The only argument against frogloks, and its lame and easily solvable with gear everyone gets anyway, is lower starting intelligence compared with that of the gimpudites and other overtall races, excepting humans with whom we are tied. <p>--------------<br>

I'll list what he does:<br>
1. Crappy rings<br>
<br>
Ok, list done.<br>
<br>
No improvements in faction except the Temple in Lavastorm, and the improved faction is irrelevant to everything except saving maybe a couple plat on some spells bought there.  Weeee.  I'm impressed...<br>
<br>
If we're going to focus on dieties, then wake up and face the fact that by that standard Innoruuk and Tunare are better wizard gods because the cultural/imbued armors for high and dark elves are caster wearable. And pretty decent.<br>
<br>
So the argument that frogloks are weak for not having that pathetic godling for a choice is, well, weak...LOL<br>
<br>
1. Ultravision without spell or gear.  How about you erudites and humans?<br>
2. Extended breath holding/high starting swim skill.  Not game breaking, but definitely useful on a CR to airless environments.<br>
3. Very nice secondary stats, arguably more important than intelligence unless you are a newbie that cannot twink or a perma-n00b that never gets to the end game.  Erudites = race for n00b wizards.<br>
4. Backflips.  Enough said.<br>
5. Small size, we don't need no steeeenkin shrinks.  Erudites need shrink just for their foreheads.<br>
<br>
Face it Eamin.  You're jealous.  Admitting it will start the healing process. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>--------------<br>

3. Wow, high DEX, that's going to be a major benefit later in life!! Gimme a break, froglok stats SUCK.<br>

4. So backflips make them good wizards?<br>

5. Small size is another nonbenefit. Unless you're grouping with halflings (!!!), gnomes, and dwarves, you're going to need to shrink at least some people to get around.<br>

First of all:  those rings are easily the best rings in the game for a young wizard, and arguably up until your mid 50s.<br>
<br>
Second of all:  no one besides an individual that's twinked up the ass will ever get their hands on Innoruuk and Tunare imbued caster armor, unless they're too high level to use it.<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro faction is identical to Agnostic, except two points:  amiably with Temple of Solusek Ro, KOS in Plane of Growth (which doesn't matter for DEs). That means I, as an Erudite, started out KOS in the following cities across all Norrath:  Paineel, Oggok, Kael Drakkal, Skyshrine. Frogs have sucky faction.<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro is the God of Wizardry - there is no argument. It is He who burned down the ancient Elven Empire of Takish`Hiz, it is He who created the Staff of Temperate Flux and the Staff of the Four, it is He who is even now readying his armies to destroy the world of Norrath! Which of your pathetic gods can claim that much, infidel? Mithaniel Marr, who is as incestuous as an Alabama native? Because that is the only god Frogloks can worship! Those who do not worship the Great Lord are naught but thankless druids, who know not the true meaning of Power! You shall all be crushed beneath the Will of the Lord, when the flames consume Norrath your flesh shall be sloughing off your bones, you shall be screaming for mercy from the Lord, in vain, for He takes not a pleasant stance towards those who oppose Him! AKNOWLEDGE YOUR SINS AND REPENT, or FACE THE CONSEQUENCES, DRUID! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarroslivinglight>ZarrosLivinglight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/13/03 12:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> 1. Yes, but ultravision is a huge benefit for the untwinked newbie you allude to later in reference to the rings.  Furthermore, we don't need to waste a buff slot or devote the (admittedly trivial though annoying) effort to mem and cast it on ourselves.<br>
<br>
2. Frogloks can solo every piece of the Staff of Temperate flux at level 16 excepting the Lower Guk piece, without needing to purchase any expensive equipment.  With a small amount of plat, they can do it at level 1 with invis potions.  I never said it was huge, but it is still an advantage.<br>
<br>
3. Dex, Stamina, and Agility are all very nice to have as a newbie/lowbie, when wizards actually *gasp* melee from time to time.  Higher stamina means more hitpoints, and every little bit helps.  Higher agility means a boost in AC, same deal.  <br>
<br>
4. Absolutely.  Its clearly evident you're jealous of them.<br>
<br>
5. Ah...you've never been on a raid then.  Understandable you might not see that benefit.<br>
<br>
Rings: Yes they are great rings for a newbie wizard, minus the strength hit that you keep glossing over.  Nothing quite like having a strength of around 50 eh?  Face it, the rings are gimp.  And as far as the cultural armor goes, I mention it only because they are much more valuable/useful than the frickin rings, and are provided by other gods.<br>
<br>
Destroy the World: Actually that is Fennin Ro's deal, I'll refer you to the cleric epic quest for details about that plot being revealed and halted (repeatedly as it happens - Fennin never seems to learn.)<br>
<br>
Destroy Klik'Anon and the ancient Elvish Homeland: proves that Solusek has a massive inferiority complex and anger-management issues (reminds me of you kinda Eamin.)  I mean, come on, he did in the elves because Tunare turned him down for a date.  As far as Klik'Anon goes, he obviously was jealous of their location (the 3 most important qualities of real estate are location, location, location) and so resorted to over-the-top levels of force (demonstrating a lack of finesse and style that is staggering) Excuse me while I /yawn<br>
<br>
As far as Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr, you might want to actually read some books, instead of burning them.  Mithaniel was captured by Terris Thule, with the help of Cazic-Thule and Morris Thule took his life essence, spread half of it over the Innothule Swamp, giving rise to the first froglok tads, and placed the rest of it inside of Erollisi having the unintended side effect of making her pregnant (and incidentally giving birth, literally, to the barbarians, from whom the humans and erudites are descended...)  So, if we're going to talk about inbred hicks, it occurs to me you might start by looking in the mirror, rather than at frogloks.  Even then, Lord Mithaniel and Lady Erollisi Marr had no choice or say in the matter, but have instead behaved in an honorable and respectable fashion.<br>

What's wrong with having 50 STR? Seriously, you haven't even made a halfway plausible case as to how that's some uber disadvantage. Oh no, you might become encumbered! HEAVEN FORFEND! It's not like 16 more STR would stop you from becoming encumbered indefinitely. Yes, you may concievably need to bank more. Please wipe the shocked expression off your face. 16 INT, 90 Mana, 20 HP, 8 SVFire more than make up for that.<br>
<br>
And equipment you can't possibly get your hands on unless you're a cream-filled little twink isn't useful. It's a waste of gamespace.<br>

<br>
1. Small races &gt; medium and large races.  Less headaches needing to get shrunk or get gear to be shrunk.  Yeah, its not (pardon the pun) a huge deal to get shrunk, its just nice to not have to worry about it.  It also makes it easier to get around in Kaladim, Ak'Anon, Thurgadin, and the dwarven outpost in Crystal Caves.<br>
<br>
2. Innate ultravision is also very nice.  Yes its duplicatable in gear and spells, but the luxury of not needing to worry about it is also nice.  Frogloks get this advantage without having to deal with faction issues like the dark elves do.<br>
<br>
3. Swim at 125 and amphibious breathing, again nice perks.<br>
<br>
4. I love the animations the frogloks have.  Iksar used to have cool animations, then they got nerfed in Luclin graphics.  Backflips when casting &gt; all.<br>
<br>
The only appreciable &quot;disadvantages&quot; to being a froglok wizard are:<br>
<br>
1. Diety. Frogloks can't choose Solusek Ro, a fact I am not losing sleep over to be honest.  I consider the rings to be overhyped in the extreme, and there is nothing else for wizards that is Sol Ro only.  Since SOE has no plans to introduce more diety specific items, we see cultural smithing and tailoring being more useful (if pricier) an option.<br>
<br>
2. Intelligence.  Tied with humans for lowest in the game.  Such an incredible non-issue as to make one wonder why it even gets raised.  Intelligence is one of the easiest stats to raise as it is and no race gets an advantage in mana regen except iksar shamans and necromancers (regen while canni/lich helps a small bit.)<br>

Amulet of the Grey Wastes is cake to get at any level, really, since you can MQ it. Hang in The Grey long enough and you can loot someone elses intestines.<br>
<br>
Frogs are ugly. I wanna nuke every last one of the little bastiches. And the flipping makes me wanna scream.<br>
<br>
The Sol Ro rings rock, I've had 2 since level 16 and still have em at level 52. Faction is a laugh, since I've been a DE SK, I know how to get around that issue. Talk about n00bs... those are the only people that care about faction anymore<br>
<br>
Frogs make me wanna scream. Did I mention that?<br>
<br>
Frogs are stupid. It's scary, really. The other stats are easier to raise than Int if you know how to look. Plus, no matter what the level, no Wizzy has to melee if they're worth their salt <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alexiiacorin>AlexiiaCorin</A> at: 5/20/03 7:09:46 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.showMessageRange?topicID=369.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.showMessageRange?topicID=369.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.showPrevMessage?topicID=369.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.showNextMessage?topicID=369.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.emailToFriend?topicID=369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.threadControl?topicID=369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm38>Discussion of Inter-Species Tension</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
