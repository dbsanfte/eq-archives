Whizbang's notes: A great upgrade for the naturally night-blind human and Erudite wizards. Personally, I only occasionally cast this until I attained magical items with it as an effect, simply because I'm really, really lazy.<br>

Whizbang's notes: While the landing spot is almost always safe, it is surrounded by dragonkin (wyverns and drakes) allied with the Claws of Veeshan. If you have no idea of your standing with Claws of Veeshan, trust me when I say you'll be killed on sight. Kill lots and lots of Kromriff and Kromzek to make this a safe landing spot. This is an extremely popular quad-kiting area, and is also the closest our gate locations get to the Western Wastes and Temple of Veeshan, so whether you're a soloing wizard or a raiding wizard, expect to be casting this spell, and its siblings, an awful lot.<br>

Graffë's notes: Costing only 25 mana to cast and only taking 2 seconds to get the cast off, this spell will lower a mob's aggro to you by approximately 400 aggro points. Therefore, if you overburn on a mob, you cast this upon that mob and it will turn back to your group tank (in theory). Sometimes it takes more than one cast but from all the wizards that have it, they say it is an invaluable spell.<br>
Whizbang's notes: I have it and it is an invaluable spell. However, having said that, it's not a spell that a level 39 will need or even use -- its use comes in groups and raids starting around level 55, in my experience at least -- which is a good thing, since the quest is extremely difficult to complete, with most wizards finishing the City of Mist portion at or after level 51. Don't beat yourself up trying to get this beforehand; you'll just get all your friends killed and put yourself through needless frustration.<br>

Whizbang's notes: This is an interesting spell -- a root spell that works off of cold resistance instead of magical resistance, and the only wizard root that does damage. Unfortunately, like happened to druid roots for so long, this root used to break when the damage portion of the spell went into effect. Although that's nominally been fixed, you will find many wizards retain a bias against using it. Personally, I think it casts too slowly and uses too much mana to be a total Root upgrade, but I think the idea of it has merit and have found occasion to use it in the past. Fortunately, you also get a more traditional Root upgrade at this level.<br>

Graffë's notes: It will drop your party to the combine ruins within the desert of South Ro. Many use this for personal travel to get closer to Guk and the surrounding area.<br>
Whizbang's notes: Even if you don't buy spells like Evacuate North, which just duplicates the effect of North Portal, but faster and less reliably, get this one, as it's the only spell we get to this destination. Note that, as with all evacuation spells, there is a remote chance of leaving a passenger behind when this is cast.<br>

Graffë's notes: Another area effect spell for us to commit suicide with.<br>

Graffë's notes: This is a self-only spell that will make us invisible to undead creatures. This is not the same spell that you can purchase from vendors for other classes such as clerics. This spell is mob-dropped ONLY. You will only be able to use this spell or the level 16 spell Invisibility, not both at the same time. Even if another player casts Invisibility on you, it will make this spell drop.<br>
Whizbang's notes: I periodically hear wizards scoffing at this spell, which I find odd, as undead can be found at all levels of the game, from apprentice to arcanist, and having the option of avoiding combat with some of them seems prudent to me, to put it mildly. In any case, I love this spell and find it very useful.<br>

Graffë's notes: The drop point for this spell is relatively safe. Just invis up and start your destination run.<br>
Whizbang's notes: Note that the Emerald Jungle is populated by a mix of aggressive live and undead creatures, including the dragon Severilous. Your best bet is to pick one spell or the other, have a good idea of where you're going, and move quickly, not stopping if you can help it. While most use this as a means of traveling to Old Sebilis or the City of Mist, a quick Lesser Evacuate will drop you near the pass to the Field of Bone, which some find safer than going there from the Plane of Knowledge. Like all evacuate spells, this has a remote chance of leaving someone behind.<br>

Graffë's notes: This is just like Bind Sight yet it has the added ability of infravision.<br>
Whizbang's notes: This is an upgrade to Bind Sight, generally speaking, in that its duration is three times as long as that of Bind Sight. I think it would be rare that anyone would need a longer duration on Bind Sight, but if you do -- or if you're a naturally night-blind race -- you're in luck.<br>

Graffë's notes: The drop point for this spell is not overly safe. Be careful when using this evac.<br>
Whizbang's notes: I think it's safe to say that Tishan was suffering from suicidal depression when he created this spell. I can think of no other reason than that as for why he'd chose a landing spot that might as well be inside a chromadrac's stomach as far as danger goes. Have Lesser Evacuate memorized before you cast that, and advise any traveling with you to be invisible before you cast this spell. Like all evacuate spells, this has a remote chance of leaving someone behind.<br>

Whizbang's notes: Yes, you too can live the life you've always dreamed of, and become a Nexus Scion! Seriously, though, this is a handy spell, especially since translocates to Nexus spires (or the target's bind point) only use mana.

Whizbang's notes: This location is not exactly convenient to anything except the outpost and the Acrylia Caverns. Before sending someone here, make sure they are aware of that, or they have the ability to get to Shar Val or to gate out on their own. Note that the subject gets a pop-up Yes/No box to choose whether or not they want to go to where you're attempting to send them. This spell requires the use of a portal fragment, which is sold by Terblyn Zelbus in the Temple of Solusek Ro for just under two platinum pieces. All translocates that do not go to a Nexus Spires or bind point require this expenditure.<br>

Whizbang's notes: Since this requires no portal fragment and it's adjacent to the Plane of Knowledge, this is a good alternative to Translocate Knowledge (which also takes more mana and is slower-casting, to add further insult to injury). Because I'm an incredibly swell guy, I sometimes stop to cast this on people gathered at Nexus Spires on Norrath. Note that the subject gets a pop-up Yes/No box to choose whether or not they want to go to where you're attempting to send them.<br>
