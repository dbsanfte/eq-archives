<br>
The first thing I did was log in and create a Gnome Wizard named Blixo, so I could check out klik' Anon for the “Baron”. <br>
<br>
Before I go any further, let me reiterate what many have said before me. This game is VERY different from EQ, from look and &quot;feel&quot; to class balance. It is not inferior, in my opinion, but if you are expecting to play EQOA just like you play EQ, you will be disappointed. The graphics alone are completely different in EQOA, which (to me) is a nice change of pace. They are simultaneously more cartoon like and realistic, in that the overall impression is very Technicolor, but many of the models are much more detailed, and “move” in a more realistic way. Birds and bats are an obvious example.<br>
<br>
Bearing in mind that when I started the beta for EQOA, the game was barely playable. We are far enough along now in the beta that the game plays very well. I was specifically looking for bugs today (as usual), in addition to exploring Click Anon, and I found only one obvious bug. Beyond that, the game “ran” better then many retail MMORPG’s. If they add a few options for interacting with some of the “less talkative” NPC’s, I will be a very happy lil’ Gnome indeed.<br>
<br>
Character creation is a breeze. I selected my race / sex and choose a class. Then I allocated my points to various stats. The nice thing about EQOA is you get more points for stat allocation as you level up, so you cannot be &quot;stuck&quot; with an impossibly low INT stat, for example. I chose to place all of my points in INT, giving me a 110 at level one. As I progressed, I added several points to STR, DEX, and STA, for obvious reasons. In EQOA, there are no skill ups for weapons. Consequently, my Wizard is free to melee between casts on even cons, and does a nice bit of damage with his staff. In fact, my Blixo can slay most dark blue cons with little or no casting from the mana pool, and without taking any serious wounds. This is great for downtime, at low levels, as you can keep exp’ing a bit, even when you are healing up from that narrow escape with the white (even) mob.<br>
<br>
I wandered around Klik' Anon for several hours, and found it to be a very functional city, with the possible exception of the drawbridge. The merchants are highly specialized however, and each carry a specific selection of items. They do not stock loot they “buy” from players at all, so don’t expect to obtain your newbie kill-quest items in town, unless you can trade with a player. Klik' Anon is very gnomish in style and design, with lots of metallic textures and rivets, as well the obligatory pump bellows, and other “tinkered” technological marvels. <br>
<br>
The political structure of the city is still lost to me however. I did not find a “king”, or other obvious ruling structure. Also conspicuously absent were the tinkered “Guides” of Ak’Anon, or the sounds of clockworks in the audio track. Outside the city proper are the stables, as well as a contingent of guards. The newbie area around Klik' Anon is quite large, and swarms with low-level beasts that are not particularly social. Picking up an “add” in the newbie zone is nearly impossible without using your AOE’s. There is a large structure built over an artificial aqueduct system, replete with windmills, and Gnomish “Engineers”. Further out from this area can be found a small camp of Gnolls, and creature’s dark blue to yellow to a 6th level character. The whole of the Gnomish lands sit in a valley, and are book ended by large riveted walls, separating the newbie zone from the higher level (and more social) mobs beyond.<br>
<br>
Of interest to all Wizards: Our spell line up is phenomenal, even at very low levels. While it is true that the root type spell (bindings?) lasts only until you “hit” the rooted mob, it makes for great crowd control or escape strategies. The bolts are generally long ranged and effective and we get a “return to home point” spell at level one. It takes about 30 seconds to cast however, so it is not a good spell for mid combat escapes. The real “meat” is the Wizard AOE line up. These spells are phenomenal, and they seem to damage all targets within a certain radius, like our PBAOE line in EQ. Moreover, great exp can be had, if you use the AOE’s to “pull” and kill multiple targets. Just remember to change to a living target if your current target falls before they all do. Casting spells during melee combat is definitely a great strategy. I generally pulled with a bolt, and nuked with an AOE, then switched to my staff until the refresh timer on my AOE elapsed, when I would stop swinging the staff, and hold down the spell button, until I channeled one thru. Note: to melee, hold the X button down continuously, letting go only to cast spells. To cast a spell, press and hold the O button until the spell casts, then resume holding the X (melee) button down, until the next cast.<br>
<br>
BTW: Wizards get their first “Concussion” spell at level 4, and there are several upgrades at later levels. Wizards get their first “Harvest” at level 12, and there are a handful of upgrades for it as well. Wizards are also the only class to get self-gates and group portals, and while transportation at higher levels should be painless anyway – this is a nice touch. The true power of the Wizard (Gnome or otherwise) is in their AE’s. It has been pointed out that there is no Mez in this game, so the strategy of killing one mob at a time will have few adherents in this game. This makes any ability to attack and damage multiple targets simultaneously highly desirable, IMHO. <br>
<br>
Do yourself a favor and complete ALL of your newbie quests, the moment you log into a new character. By the time you are ready to go out into the world, you will be 4th level, and well suited to the challenges you face, in the early levels of the game. <br>
<br>
Oh, and get a USB keyboard, chatting without one is near impossible, and being on the receiving end of a conversation with a controller only player can be painfully frustrating, to say the least.<br>
<br>
I will definitely be playing EQOA at release and after, as it is a fantastic game, with a lot of great potential. It is NOT EQ by any means, but it is not EQ light either. It is simply EQ different, and I like what I see, so far. Hope that helps a bit!<br>

<br>
Actually, thats bullshit. Every class gets the &quot;gate&quot; type spell / ability - &quot;return to home point&quot;. It takes a little over a minute to cast it.<br>
<br>
Wizards apparently are the only class to get self only &quot;gates&quot; to various &quot;spires&quot; (which by the way - are largely still under construction, in the world of EQOA - and GNOMES are often seen working with the crews in the &quot;Lead-Engineer&quot; capacity!) Wizards are purportedly the only class to get &quot;group Portal&quot; type spells as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ahh, well - I can understand your confusion my dimunitive friend. First, you are correct! EQoA does in fact take place entirely on Antonica, which is called by the people of that time, Tunaria. <br>
<br>
In fact, the *Tunar* is the foundation of all trade, as it is the only coin used throughout the realm.<br>
<br>
Now then... Many of the names used are very similar to the place names we know from *our* time in Norrath. For example, the Elves, though still technically one race, live in two distinct towns. &quot;Fayspires&quot; is the home of what you would call &quot;High Elves&quot;; Paladins, Clerics, Wizards, Enchanters, and Magicians. &quot;Telethin&quot; is the home of what you would call &quot;Wood Elves&quot;; Rogues, Rangers, Druids, Warriors. These towns are near one another geographically, separated by a stretch of road, approximately 5 miles long.<br>
<br>
Clik'Anon is very similar sounding to Ak'Anon, Halas is still Halas, Neriak is Neriak. <br>
<br>
One could argue that they didn't exactly go buck wild with creativity here, but it can also be argued that the place names we know are merely evolutions of the earlier (EQoA) place names. /shrug.<br>

How's the dwarf town near Halas? Where is it, exactly?

I rolled a Dorf Pally so that I could investigate this for you, and Mordenhiem (sp?) is an interesting city. It is well defended against the beasts of the area, with seige equipment, and a strong guard presence - giving the place a very fortress like feel. <br>
<br>
The proof for me was simple however... I journeyed to Halas, and was FORCED to cross a river.<br>
<br>
BTW: The quests, at least for a Dorf Pally are well done, and complete. I had a blast playing my little DORF while I nosed around looking for the information you requested. <br>
<br>
Of course, I only *really* care about Wizards, so my satisfaction with the DORF was likely a side effect of novelty. <br>
<br>
Your contention belief that &quot;ANON&quot; may be a Gnome word for town or city seems pretty logical. I cant support it with any proofs, as I haven't found much readable lore in EQoA yet. <br>

<br>
Iksar are NOT a playable race, and neither are Val Shir or Ogres. The Iksar continent of Kunark is unknown in the land, as it has not been discovered, yet alone explored. The Ogre's are still reeling over the lingering effects of the stupification inflicted on them by the Tribunal. I have yet to see one, though I suspect they may exist as high level mobs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There are no Val Shir, for what should be *obvious* reasons. <br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, the invoked devestation of Ro has already begun, and the desert that bears his name is creeping north across the Elven homelands even now. I have (so far) encountered no mention of the discovery of Feydwer, nor any NPC's who mention the growing desert to the south. Perhaps the Elves have yet to realize the magnitude of the coming devestation, or don't know it' happening at all, at this point.<br>
<br>
It should be fairly obvious at this point why I play the EverQuest games. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Query Gnomus?: Why did the Gnomes follow the Elves to Feydwer? Or did they abandon Klik'Anon for another reason? <br>
<br>
Also, I dimly recall that Felwithe (on Feydwer) was / is the site of the final battle in the War of the Broken Crown. Was that merely a fan-fictional &quot;touch&quot;? I ask only because the Tier'Dal have already founded the city of Neriak, in the time of EQoA, which was supposed to have happened <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>after</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the War of the Broken Crown...

<br>
Klik'Anon (and Mordheim) are clearly colonies from the homeland to the east. Why they were established and then abandoned is unknown at this time. In the case of Mordheim, we can assume it's because Lady Vox slew the dwarves. Klik'Anon was almost certainly established by gnomish mariners upon landfall on Tunaria (you said it was north along the coast from Freeport, right?), probably established before Freeport was founded. Any number of reasons could have lead to its abandonment, including King Ak'Anon calling the colonists home during the High Elven diaspora and its related turmoil on Faydwer.<br>

<br>
Aye, Klik'Anon is north along the coast above Freeport. Neriak and its environs are between the two cities (sorta), so I caution you to make that journey with stealth and in force.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Klik'Anon (and Mordheim) are clearly colonies from the homeland to the east.

<br>
Absolutely makes perfect sense to me. In fact, I would venture to guess that the *only* enemy that could breach Mordenheim's defenses would come at them from the air. Even then, Vox would still have to be careful not to draw lethal fire from the Ballista.<br>
<br>
I agree that the War of the Broken Crown lore was pre-release, and likely changed over time as the game solidified and took final shape. This doesn't preclude lore being passed down with omissions, errors or outright falsifications. As an explorer and an historian, I have learned to find the inconsistencies and then eliminate them through rigorous investigation and analysis. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
