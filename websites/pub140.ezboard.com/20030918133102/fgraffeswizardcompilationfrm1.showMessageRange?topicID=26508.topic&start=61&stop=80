You sir, are smarter than a SOE developer.  Of course my 8 year old nephew also thought of this.<br>
<br>
Actually the reasoning is simple.  First let me clarify that they *did* disable it in Time about 2 days ago.  Then, they go and make this change.  It doesn't make sense.  Anyone here remember the use of g-flux to bypass about 3 hours of boring Vex Thal content?  Bam.  Spell disabled.  No one really complained.. it was being used to bypass or make content easier.  The same thing was being done in time, only worse imo.  So fine, disable it.  We'll find other ways to pull mobs.  I'll live without being able to explore the zone.  But this change to the actual spell makes no sense other than the total lack of communication from Programmer/dev A to Programmer/dev B.  A simple &quot;Hey, I fixed the problem with FoH monks and SK's hopping over these 10-ft high, easily sploitable walls in the first five PoTimeB events.  I just disabled G-flux in the zone.&quot; is all it would have taken.  But it seems that sadly never happened and two different people were working on this &quot;problem&quot; and came up with two different solutions.  Maybe all the bosses and decision makers were at E3 and the monkeys were running the patch.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yeah after sending an eye though the graveyard wall I figured this was the reason for it! They could have just built the zone better as well! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not only can you get an eye out and see virtually the whole zone (which is empty/triggered - let's hear it for bugged ring events!), but with a little effort you and a friend can access anything you see.  I found the &quot;cazic&quot; section the coolest - there's a portal to plane of fear there.<br>

&quot;This is allegedly a role playing game (at least some people still think so and it was originally billed as one). Using what you have in creative and inventive ways is a hallmark of good role playing. A good GM is HAPPY to see the players being sneaky and smart, that means they're having fun and playing the game rather than just rolling dice and going through the motions.&quot;<br>
--<br>
/agree<br>
In real roleplays you get rewarded for finding new and better solutions to a problem...not nerfed...and if they want to adress the problem fix the zones...<br>
<br>
In my view its absurd to now call the spells gravity flux and invert gravity....there is &quot;no&quot; toss anymore...so plz rename the spells too<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>----<br>

&quot;Why don't we design the terrain with this spell in mind?&quot;<br>
<br>
I can think of a few examples where the game was designed around a few spells, and look how much creativity it left them.<br>
<br>
Give them a F'in break, they want to make new content but the amount of space/size what have you plus the distance they may have wanted to place certain mobs from each other was restrictive and not operable with this spell.<br>
<br>
If it clears the way for newer/better/more challenging content, I'll sacrifice the &quot;amusement&quot; factor of this spell I never used anyway.  Agreed concussion should be made easier but c'est la vie, it's not impossible but it's a small thing compared to the changes it may allow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jadrax>Jadrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1355<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 5:41 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> Its sadly one of thouse things, VI has never been able to figure out that if they made mobs have ranged attacks rather than all being compleatly melee based they wouldent have any of these issues.<br>

There are literally tons of games that have jump spells and dont suffer any terrain problems becuase the mobs have been programed with other options than run up and hit the bad guy.

It's because you were using your brains to get around the game content.<br>
<br>
Firstly, instead of just nerfing yet another useless spell they could design the game better and get around it this way.  Get a developer to engage his brain before going to work and think of a GOOD way of fixing problems.<br>
<br>
Secondly, getting concussion is a joke now without using some form of exploit.  Make the quest doable at the level or move the level of the spell up.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, yes they come and read the forums but do they actually listen or give a damn about what the MAJORITY of players want.  You may argue that it's only the likes of FoH that are feeling the pain, but don't you actually think that a lot of us are striving to be there as well, and hitting FoH is hitting us all in the long run.<br>
<br>
SoE are running the best possible marketing scheme for WoW, nearly everyone I know wouldn't play another SoE game after the customer service received from them yet they continually shoot themselves in the foot.  They've done how many patches since releasing Everpatch? 100's, 1000's yet they still can't estimate how long a patch will last, and ALWAYS underestimate, frustrating players  that try to log in when they told em they could. If they overestimate they may even make people happy by being able to log in a little early.<br>
<br>
I'm not bothered by the change to the spell, it's just another spell that I never use any more, what I am bothered about is their lack of interest in the playerbase and the fact that they've got absolutley no idea on how to keep the game fun for the end game player.<br>
NOOOOOO!!!! time sinks are not fun dimwits.<br>
<br>
Still what do I know, I'm only another dumb idiot that throws my money at em each month for my accounts and most probably will continue to do so until WoW comes out.<br>

If SoE ran a supermarket the first time someone shoplifted they'd remove all the food off the shelves to make sure it could never be done again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12799<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 8:18 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: emm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No need.

<br>
It's us that think just cos a spell is level X we MUST get it at level X otherwise we suck. It was a bonus spell that was not at all essential to have at lvl ~45 back in Kunark.<br>
<br>
The same thing would be true if they created 'ancient spells' as a bonus at all levels. People would whine 'this spell is too hard to get at lvl X and I neeed it!!1!', seeing the spells not as a bonus but a RIGHT. In a way concussion ended up as the first ancient spell - put in a lot of effort (actually not that much - sense undead and taunt from below will aggro it) and you can get the bonus of lower aggro earlier than your peers.<br>
<br>
Now of course they have developed code to alter the fizzle rate of spells independant of level, so if they created the spell now they'd do it at 51 or whatever with an artificially low fizzle rate built in and soooo many less people would whine 'I cant get it yet waa!'. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 5/15/03 8:35:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 7903<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 8:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: emm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think people are forgetting the reason why VI made the spell lvl 39 - it wasnt cos casters had massive aggro problems back then at that level, cos they didnt, it was so that you'd have a very low fizzle rate when you used it at lvl 51, 55 whatever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Survey says?   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT wrong.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) The designer of the spell couldn't understand why the quest was so hard and said he was trying to get it changed at a Con. (spell design and quest design are different guys)<br>
2) Your chance of fizzling a spell once you've maxed the skill for that level is very small, and changes very little as you go up levels.  Perhaps you've forgotten this at your level, but people at lower level know it.<br>
3) Verant and SOE has never said, implied, hinted, nor suggested this, it's only been used as an excuse defending the idiotic quest design <br>
4) If this was true, at least SOME other spells would be set up with this format.  Evacuates you get starting at level 29... but cannot realistically achieve until level 39 when they will fizzle 1-2% less often!<br>
<br>
There's no basis to this rumor, and I really, REALLY wish people would stop tossing it around like it's even remotely true.<br>

<br>
The fact remains that a wizard such as myself even at level 49 (yes this is my main - I've been playing this game for a total of 10 months) doesn't have a chance of getting this spell without a lot of higher level help.  When did you get this spell?  Level 44? 50? 55?  Did you use this &quot;method&quot; of getting up to the skellie?  I could really have used it last night in Kael.  Yes I know how to control my agro before you give me that lecture.  I want to be able to nuke HARDER, then concussion off my agro if necessary.<br>
<br>
It's easy to forget that there are actual NEW wizards in the &quot;pipeline&quot; to level 65.  This change makes getting this spell very tough even at level 49 WITH lots of help.<br>
<br>
Sorry if that last part sounded like a rant, I'm just frustrated at this stupid spell quest and having to listen to obviously level 65 wizards poo-pooing any below level 50's concerns or problems.   I can hear it now &quot;just level to 65 and get into the REAL game...&quot;<br>

You'd be surprised how many people don't grasp this concept.  I can remember times in places like skyplane, Veeshan's Peak, Temple of Veeshan, Kael/Skyshrine, all the way down to the Elemental Planes and now PoTime, where we complained about one part of the zone or another - helping them tune it as to loot or mob difficulty or whatever.  These 'rants' were usually public, and inevitably every time someone would pipe up with 'who cares, its only affecting the top 0.1%!' or 'you only care about YOU'.  <br>
<br>
How many have raided in those zones?  Do you like them now?  Do you like the loot progression from say, VP to ToV?  When we first got to ToV for instance, the drakes had an AE dispell and hit extremely harder than what they do now.  Because of efforts of FoH and other guilds on the same level, these zones are made playable.  Everyone who comes afterward benefits.

At least, my eye of zomm can open the door, but its got to be right next to it in order to do so, for some reason.  However, that doesn't make things any better, really<br>
<br>
I don't mind that I couldn't reasonably get the spell at 39, but at 53, it should be easier than it is.  The COM skel is inconsistent with the difficulty of the other two skels because 1) it requires charm, 2) it lies beyond a locked door requiring raid level force (if you do it without exploiting by warping the skel down or using zone geography), and 3) Has ph's meaning its not always up.<br>
<br>
Concussion should be easily accessible to a lvl 51 wizard.  Why?  Well, lets look at the other DPS classes and compare aggro reducing abilities while grouped...<br>
<br>
1.  Rogue - evade ability at lvl 10?  Can't remember when this started on mine, but it was real early.<br>
2.  Monk - FD ability at lvl 17<br>
3.  Ranger - Jolt - vendor purchased spell at lvl 51.<br>
4.  Wizard - concussion - quested lvl 39 spell<br>
5.  Necro - FD spell - lvl 16, but I doubt they use it much in this capacity.<br>
<br>
This leaves only mages out of aggro reducing spell, but they can cast judiciously and still do more dps than a like level wizard because of their pet, not to mention focus items.  At least, at my level they can.  <br>
<br>
Given this, I think concussion balances the wizard class with the other dps classes in groups.  I don't mind questing for it, but the current COM skel is out of whack with the rest of the quest.<br>

I have loved it for 4+ years, to the point of buying additional accounts, attending Fan Faires, doing my best to enjoy the end game with guild and friends, even writing positively about certain game aspects that others overwhelmingly put down.<br>
<br>
But now I'm just not enjoying the game at this point.  After experiencing the joy that is The Rathe (an encounter that was broken for as long as the players have been telling VI, me included) and beating it, and in the process, losing a half year lead on our server competition....to the Plane of Time, another zone that should have been functional and realistic within the expectations of the players that fought hard to get there, yet is not.  Plane of Time was not designed with forethought, and it showed with the G-Flux spell line.<br>
<br>
A few days after we got into Plane of Time, the G-Flux line of spells were disabled in TimeB, as was expected.  Now, VI is condeming the spell line since it is easier to nerf a very fun spell rather than fixing the appropriate zones with invisible walls, like they should have been designed with in the first place.<br>
<br>
I've always been appreciative to Verant for this game and their hard work on it, more so than most people.  But changing a spell line that is as much fun to use as G-Flux simply because it had non-conventional uses in Plane of Time goes too far in my book.  The correct fix was simple and to the point...disabling the spell in TimeB.  Changing the actual spell is wrong.<br>
<br>
I consider this change a kneejerk reaction, much like HoH summoning nerf.  Neither change adds to the fun factor of being a Wiz, or any other class for that matter...it just highlights to me the current concept in how to fix things:  Use a huge heavy blunt object to fix a china cup.<br>
<br>
Disable the spell line in the zones that you do not want it used in...that is a fix we can all appreciate.  Please leave the spell alone.<br>

Now, I confess that that's probably not what the quest designer had in mind either; but nonetheless, the quest *is* doable by a group of low 40's without Gravflux, without the flagpole, and without the taunt trick.<br>
<br>
But for sake or argument, let's say that pulling to the bottom floor isn't allowed.  I agree that a single group of low 40's won't be able to fight their way up to the ramparts.  But keep in mind that CoM is a *raid zone*.  You've got tons of reaver hunts for druids and rangers.  And up at the top, you've got epic mobs for enchanters, mages, and shamen.  The human skeleton, in fact, is just down the hall from a room that pretty much any 2nd floor CoM raid *is* going to stop in.  (You don't actually have to go into the room, but it's a good place for a med break, and if you don't clear it out you'll risk adds going up the ramp.)<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe the notion that the quest wasn't intended for level 39's.  Maybe they just made it level 39 so that if you were driven enough or lucky enough to be able to get it that early, you'd be able to scribe it right away.  But I'm not a subscriber to the idea that you're entitled to every spell the moment you ding. <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

<br>
Given the comments by GZ I suspect the quest was thought to be properly challenging for a group around level 39 by the quest designers.  There's been ample evidence in the past that not everyone working on this game is aware of what's feasible, logical and balanced.  Every other quest from Kunark is possible, if boring and long, to do at the appropriate level.  This one is very, very difficult to even attempt at this level (particularly if you don't have pre-printed maps and a heavily camped Karnor's Castle).  The quest guys screwed up, but won't fix it.  Since the stupid kludge to get around this error has been removed, it's time to fix the quest.  Even if its not related to what they call an &quot;exploit&quot; at uber level encounters.<br>
<br>
It's a sad but true fact: if you want something fixed in this game that's being ignored, the 100% best way to do so is find a way for very high level characters in uber areas to gain an advantage by using the flaw.  That's how Eye of Zomm was fixed, for example.  Hurts the characters?  Well, we'll get around to it some day.  Helps the characters?  SHUT DOWN THE GAME!!!! STAT!!!! PATCH IT!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bayler>Bayler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 11:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: emm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There's been ample evidence in the past that not everyone working on this game is aware of what's feasible, logical and balanced. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
