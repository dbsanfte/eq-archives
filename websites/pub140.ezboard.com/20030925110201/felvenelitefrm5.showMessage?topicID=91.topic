<br>
        It was told that long ago there was a staff, which held great power.  It was called The Crystal Staff.  Now, it was called so for a good reason.  The source of its power was four crystals.  The crystals were bound together.  No mortal could separate them.  These four crystals together, made an unimaginable force.  Now whether this power be good, or evil, all depended on the heart of the holder.<br>
<br>
        Legend does not tell of how this staff has come to be.  It may be written somewhere, but no one of present stature knows of its creation.  It does, however, tell of the staff’s power.  <br>
<br>
        The Kingdom of Thudro Orcsbane was once a very prosperous dwarven settlement.  Deep within the mountains of Everfrost was where this place once was.  I saw once, because no longer is it there.  <br>
<br>
        Long ago, as the dwarf’s were busy searching for their treasure, an unseen enemy snuck into the Kingdom.  This enemy was not unseen because of any special spell.  No, with the Crystal Staff in his possession, invisibility was his will.  One by one this enemy struck down the dwarves, completely unnoticed.  As the death toll grew, one dwarf saw what was happening to his friends.  Quick to finish his ale, he jumped up and alerted the<br>
rest of  the dwarves near by.  But useless it all was.  With a wave the unseen attacker shot a wall of fire, that killed every last dwarf.  The kingdom was burnt down.  The king, clutching onto his treasure chest, was buried amongst the rubble.  <br>

<br>
The town of Kelethin was a jumble as usual.  Wood Elf’s walked from place to place, talking amongst group of friends.  A wood-elf walked into one of the many taverns in Kelethin, and sat down at a bar.  The bartender glanced once at him, and a smile drew across her face.<br>
<br>
“Ah, it’s none other than Luldaas, my favorite ranger!”  Your usual, I assume, dear?” <br>
<br>
“Always.  Have you been drinking tonight? You seem a little bit tipsier than usual.” Luldaas said chuckling.<br>
<br>
“You bet.  Here you go, one fine elven wine, for your enjoyment tonight.  Am I expecting your company for long this fine night?”<br>
<br>
“No, I must be off once I finish this wine.  I’ve got an errand to run.”<br>
<br>
“What’s that?”<br>
<br>
”Ah, you know, the usual.  I have to take something up to Shadow Haven.  Busy place, it is.  But it must be done.”<br>
<br>
”Yes, yes.”  <br>
<br>
        Luldaas drank his wine down, and reached into his pouch.  He flipped a Platinum coin up on the table.  <br>
<br>
“Here you go m’lady.  Pay for the wine, and a little for yourself.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, you are too good Luldaas,” she said, as she turned and reached into her pouch for change, “Please, take your…” she reached out to give Luldaas his coin back, but he was already long gone.  <br>
<br>
Luldaas closed the tavern door, and headed down the lift.  This package he was supposed to be delivering was a mysterious one.  A stranger had come up to him, and asked him to deliver it, for a fee of course.  Luldaas, gladly, took the package and the money, part now, and part was to be paid upon completion.  <br>
<br>
Luldaas sped off down the many ramps of Kelethin, and down the lift.  He was in no hurry, the stranger had not said there was a time of completion, he just said that when he got to the tavern in Shadow Haven, that he would know who to give the package too.  The strangest part was the man disappeared before Luldaas could ask the person any questions.  Luldaas just shrugged it off though and headed for the wizard spires of Greater Faydark.  <br>
<br>
Luldaas walked down the long winding trail that lead off towards the great High Elven city of Felwithe, and towards the spires.  As Luldaas approached the spot where he would be leaving the path and taking a shortcut through the words, screams approached him from the north.  Luldaas sprinted off towards them and say a young wood elf woman running towards him down the path, she was being chased by a couple of orcs.  Luldaas pulled his bow off his shoulder and two arrows out of his quiver and took aim, he fired one arrow after the other, both hitting their marks, one orc took the arrow in the head and fell to the ground, the other orc took it in the head as well, but the arrow stuck in a tree and it was suspended in air.  <br>
<br>
“Oh, thank you sir.  I would have surely been killed had you not been here to help me, I owe thee my life!”<br>
<br>
“No, that is unnecessary.  It was my pleasure to help you.  No need of any kind of repayment.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, but here, take this coin,” said the woman, reaching into her change pouch and was reaching out to Luldaas to hand it to him.  Luldaas took the ladies hand and closed it, and left back towards the spires, leaving the woman just standing there. <br>
<br>
        Luldaas walked on and he glanced up, the wizard spires were visible far above the trees.  He was not too far off from them now.  Luldaas approached the spire and asked for his port up stone.  He sat down and had a few friendly conversations, and felt the tug as he was ported up to the moon.<br>
<br>
        Luldaas landed in The Nexus and avoided the bustle of the place as he moved in-between all the people.  Luldaas hopped onto the stone square that would teleport him to Shadow Haven.  Luldaas felt the tug of the portal as his foot touched the ground, and with that, he was standing in the center of Shadow Haven.  He looked around, the usual, there were many people hustling here, and going there. He made his way to the tavern the man had said to go to, and opened the door.<br>
