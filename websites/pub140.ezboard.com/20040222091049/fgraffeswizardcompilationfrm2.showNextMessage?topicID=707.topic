<br>
Was just wondering if anyone here had info on the updated HoH key quest?<br>
<br>
I recall something from the patch message about it being changed and have seen a few posts hinting how much easier it was since they updated it. <br>
<br>
I have looked around on a number of different sites but its all old info there. Box of souls handed in to the tormented marr followers in PoJ and the box is still quested the same.<br>
<br>
Appreciate any help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's possible the drops are also easier to obtain now.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Update!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Doing this turn in will now flag all members of the party!  Since so few are flagged for HoH it is a lonely zone and almost impossible to just zone in and find a group.  Best to flag all of your essential friends at the same time!<br>
<br>
Start out in Plane of Valor.  Your looking for Grenic Drere.  When you zone in, turn and face the hill where everyone waits to /LFG.  Now follow this wall to the right toward the caves.  Grenic Drere will be up a little high along the zone wall.<br>
<br>
you say, 'Hail, Grenic Drere'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:21 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Mortals, this far into the planes? Something that I never thought that I would see. Regardless that does not help my situation any does it?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] You say, 'what situation?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:30 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Not that it is your business, but this is where I call home. I have lost track of the years that I have spent here. This valley is my home, for I was exiled from [Mithaniel's Temple]. It is not a story that I am proud of and do not wish to share with you. So be one with you.'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] You say, 'where is Mithaniel's Temple?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:50 2002] Grenic Drere says 'Only a mortal would be as thick headed to know not when to take their leave. He and his legions call his temple The Halls of Honor. Paladins that have served him well on Norrath have the opportunity to ascend into his ranks. They are in training to make sure that they are always prepared to defend what they believe is the right and honorable thing to do. Mithaniel is an extremely proud being, and will accept any challenge that you may have to offer him. If you are willing to challenge him, I may have some [information] you will find useful.'<br>
'<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:54 2002] You say, 'what information?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:08:55 2002] Grenic Drere says 'There are other methods to enter the Halls of Honor than those that are readily apparent, and as a former soldier of Marr I can offer you access into the Halls; however as with all such arrangements there must be something [paid] for something earned.'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] You say, 'paid?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Oct 25 18:09:01 2002] Grenic Drere says 'I was not the only member of my squad that was sent into exile, my brothers in arms, were the impetus for our exile. I was but a mere pawn. They now reside in the Plane of Justice as bodiless shades. Their punishment was too lax for their actions; I want their eternal souls to be mine. Find a smith who will teach you to create a box of souls, weaken the shades, then capture their souls and return all three to me.'<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The whole conversation I had with <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/Borik.jpg" target="top">Borik Darkanvil</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> last night.  A stout dwarf and as quality of a blacksmith as I've met.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Wed Feb 26 00:27:54 2003] You say, 'Hail, Borik Darkanvil'<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:27:54 2003] Borik Darkanvil says 'Greetings, Borik Darkanvil, at your service.  I was once a planar traveler like you.  Those days are behind me, now I am content to earn my keep as a blacksmith, and to experiment with some of the [special recipes] that I have picked up in these outer planes.'<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:01 2003] You say, 'Do you know of the Box of Souls?'<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:02 2003] Borik Darkanvil's eyes grow narrow. 'So looking to capture some souls are you?  It's none of my business I suppose so don't answer.  I'm pretty sure that I don't want to know.  I paid heavily for the formula for the Box of Souls, but its not a price I would pass on to anyone else.  There isn't much to it, but it does take the hands of a skilled smith and the magic of Tanaan's forges to event attempt it.  First you will need a block of [Perilium].<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:07 2003] You say, 'What is Perilium'<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:07 2003] Borik Darkanvil says 'Perilium was once used to make clockwork machines, there are now stronger metals so it has become harder and harder to find Perilium, much less a block that is large enough to be of any use.  Then you will need to find the brain of a crystal spider, this is where the actual soul will be held.  Of course the box will need a supernatural power source, the souls are held into place by the horror of their own dreams, the heart of an agony mephit will give the device that power.  Forge these with a smithing hammer and a vial of water and you will have your box.  Of course if you have not the skill, I can [forge them for you].'<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:12 2003] You say, 'Forge them for me?'<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:28:12 2003] Borik Darkanvil says 'If you return all three items to me I will do the work for you for, a mere three thousand platinum, don't worry about the hammer, or the water, I have some that should work well.  I will not guarantee my success, but I can guarantee if you do not have the skill, you will fail.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What you need and where to find it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Crystal Spider Brain</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>POV</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Lummini Crawlers or a rare large spider)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Solid Block of Perilium</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>POI</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Seems to be random MOBs, rare)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Agony Mephit Heart</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PON</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Agony Mephites, fight through the hobgoblins, get onto plateau behind them, then find the agony mephites in the cave.  Not a common drop and they're fairly tough)<br>
<br>
Gather these 3 items and give them along with 3,000 Platinum Pieces to Borik Darkanvil.  He will attempt to combine them but even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>he isn't a 100% guarentee</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Borik Darkanvil deftly pulls out his smithing hammer and begins to bang away at the Perilium. As he tries to set the Crystal Spider's brain into the casing his hammer slips and a tiny fracture appears on the surface. Borik curses, 'By Brell's beard, I'm sorry I don't fail often with such smithing but I guess luck was not with us.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
If ya feel lucky, this combine is Blacksmithing and supposedly trivials at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>175</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If you try it, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>combine the 3 items along with a smithy hammer and a water</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  The Patch message on Dec 4th or was it the 12th, said the Vial of water no longer has to be holy or sacred, any water will work.  <br>
<br>
Again, the hammer and water are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> needed if letting Borik Darkanvil do it for you, just have to give him the 3000PP.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So when you have all three items go find him again.  I went ahead and hailed him again and ran thru the whole dialog.  Better safe than sorry!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*** This is where I handed him the 3 items and the 3,000PP ***</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:29:09 2003] You are no longer encumbered.<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:29:12 2003] Borik Darkanvil deftly pulls out his smithing hammer and bangs away at the Perilium, making a solid casing.  His hands move quickly as he produces the ingredients into a sinister looking box. 'Here you go, I don't know what you are going to do with this and I don't care, just be careful.'<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:29:12 2003] You gain experience!!<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:29:12 2003] Vicente saved.<br>
<br>
[Wed Feb 26 00:31:06 2003] You say to your guild, 'Woot!!! Box of Souls'[/quote]<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/box_of_souls.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Okay!  Got your Box of Souls and you've zoned into the Plane of Justice!  What you are hunting for are Tormented Wraiths.  To find them, enter POJ, go thru the first level, enter the hall to the second section and hang a left.  Follow that corridor until the end.  The second to last door will have your Wraiths waiting in side.  Their agro range is pretty small, but if attacked or approached all three will attack.  They are <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:lime;">green</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> at 63.  The two prisoners will not agro for attacking the wraiths.  Now if you've been killing prisoners there, that might be a different story!  The LOC of this room is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>pos 300, pos 61</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Kill the wraiths.  The odds are fair that every other time you kill a set a exiled *something* of Marr will spawn.  You are looking for three different MOBs to spawn.  They are targetable, conned <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:lime;">green</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->, do not agro, I nuked one after turning in box and still didn't agro.  They vanish after a about 2 minutes.  They look just like the wraith's corpse.  Just hand them your Box of Souls and immediately you get the box back and a Soul Sphere.  The Soul Sphere IS NOT in the Box of Souls, it just appears in your inventory.  So make sure you have at least 3 empty slots in backpacks or something.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/turn_in_box.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The three names you are looking for are:<br>
<br>
exiled soldier of Marr<br>
exiled trooper of Marr<br>
exiled officer of Marr<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/soul_sphere.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
After getting the three Soul Spheres, if you choose to identify them, they will be uniquely identified and say this:<br>
<br>
Item Lore: The soul seems calm within.<br>
Item Lore: You sense an angry presence.<br>
Item Lore: You sense the soul resisting.<br>
<br>
Now in my case, the darn exiled soldier of Marr spawned a few times.  The Officer took me a long time.  I've learned that a friend had the opposite problem, he got the exiled officer a few times and had to kill for 3 hours before the exiled soldier spawned.  Since I did see the soldier so many times, I decided I'd learn (possibly the hard way) what happens if you give him the box again?  Well he does the turn in over and over with you, each time the box reappearing in inventory and you still have the original Soul Sphere in your inventory.  Each time it says, <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">You gain experience!!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->  Well I turned experience to AA and made it 100%.  I did the turn in a good 15 times, but never saw the bar budge, so no exploit here I'm afraid.  Also, the wraiths have no loot to offer, so this is pretty boring. <br>
<br>
What to be careful about?  Well sometimes... the rats and sentries would add.  So in my case I'd leave my charmed pet to tank (some times 5 or 6 MOBs) and I'd mez them all.  I and my pet would finish killing the wraith if possible, then I'd area of effect mem blur twice and when the mezzes ran out, the damn rats would return to the halls as would the sentries.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, if you can Dire Charm, I know your tempted to get a Sentry of Justice to be your pet, but let me suggest instead, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tamyna Willowsong</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  She is in the very last room (just one more down).  She is a prisoner, when you enter her room she is laying on her bed.  She served me incredibly well, tearing the wraiths up!  Also she is a quest MOB.  If you hail her she'll tell a story.  So what more could you ask for?  A good looking DC pet that'll beat the spiff out of MOBs, tell you a story and /pet sit beside you on the bed if you ask her to while waiting for wraiths to pop.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Okay, when you have killed and killed and nearly given up hope finally the third one you need will spawn.  Hand in your box one more time and you'll have that third soul!  Now lets head to PoV!  Zone in, hang a right and stay most of the way up the wall.  Just before the cave area, you'll see Grenic Drere.  Same guy that gave you the quest.  Well now you have the weakened and captured souls of his ex-comrades.<br>
<br>
Hail him and make sure you have his attention (I risk as little as I can) then turn in all three Soul Spheres.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>EDITING OUT: He had never mentioned giving him the Box of Souls, so I decided I'd hang onto it.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->   He now asks for the box as well, so turn in the three spheres along with the box.<br>
<br>
I hit Give and he says<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/grenic_drere.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
In your inventory you'll find...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.spotlightoptical.com/eq/ring_of_marr.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah!  Now lets zone out of PoV.  You appear at the ring of stones in PoT of course.  You want to go to the stone, fourth from the left, it has the Heart with a fist on it.  Click and you'll zone into Halls of Honor!  Before you is an archway, two guards, one on each side of the entrance.  They scowled ready to attack at me <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">(conned DB at 63)</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> so I kept my distance.  I didn't try, but I understand that most MOBs in HoH can NOT see invis.  <br>
<br>
The graveyard is immediately on your left.  I tried to circle around the end of the wall there, but an invisible zone wall stops you of course.  A hedge blocks you from traveling right from the zone in.  The zone out is behind you, two tall columns with lightening flashing between them.<br>
<br>
When you zone out, take another moment to appreciate your accomplishment.  Type /key and look at the newest addition to your key chain, <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">&quot;With Marr's Symbol you may enter the Halls of Honor.&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I'm updating my instructions above, but here are other changes.<br>

The crystal spider brain also drops off Lucid Arachnae in PoV, it's the one I used to make Box of Souls.<br>
<br>
The Block of Perilium drops off Coroded Prototype or Rust Covered Model.  These are the guys with the saw hands but NOT inside the factory.  I don't know if they have PH or not, and they are rare. :S<br>
<br>
I used a Nightmare Mephit Heart.  It supposedly can drop off any mephit in the PoN caves but mine dropped off the Agony Mephit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaichin>gaichin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/29/03 12:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The complete spoiler for the HoH Key Quest.</span><hr size=1> Was trivial for me at 162 blacksmithing <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=senamar>senamar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/03 8:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The complete spoiler for the HoH Key Quest.</span><hr size=1> Borik continues to demonstrate his Blacksmithing skills.  I received another Box of Souls from him last night.  I need to work on my Dwarven language.  I tried to negotiate a frequent shopper discount but he didn't seem to understand and took my 3,000pp again.  <br>
<br>
Since I didn't turn in my first Box I was able to collect the 3 souls again and flag a whole group of guild mates.  I'm planning to flag some more when we can all gather at the same time.  Something I'll add, the drop rate of the &quot;Fallen&quot; mobs seems to have increased. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=460703" target="top">Vicente</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
