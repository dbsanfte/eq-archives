It's cool surface was a welcomed comfort in the heat that had forced itself in upon the Elven territory like some fire breathing beast of steam.  Her stubbed hands Carressed a set of rosary beads. The runes were well worn with pennance and meditations.  Her first real rest in some time, Malfi was less than enthused to hear the clanking of heavy armor comming up the steps to stop just outside her door.  Without waiting for the inevidible knock that would come, Miss Almalfia called in her most reverent and stoic voice, &quot;Either there is a calvery outside my chamber door, or Someone needs an Armor sizing.&quot;  The page poking his long narrow head,(shortly fllowed by the rest of his lanky physique) &quot;Vicar, er um Miss Almalfia umm er Miss Vicar&quot; the page began his face flustered that he had played out all but how he would address the Dwarven healer once he had gained an audience.  &quot;I bring news from Sumata.&quot;  Withdrawing a single envelope from his satchel the page flouished his practiced formal elven bow.  Almalfia's eyes flickered to focus on the envelope, wrapped or soft white feathery down and tied with soft white leather sinew.  The trademark wax stamp was embazened in usual fashion: An ivy ring with a tidal wave and and sun swirling in an endless chase. Even with the whole thing cast in the evergreen colored wax it still seemed to shift like the tides of the sea.  Almalfia plucked the letter from the young boys hands, who slipped from the room much quieter than he had entered. At least until he hit the stairs then it sounded like he fell and knocked every suit of armor over on the way down the stairs.  She chuckled to herself as she took her seat near the window where light would afford her a better view.  <br>
    &quot; So guess your wondering what all the rush was about eh?  Well remember those pegasus sightings?  I decided to check it all out.  I went out in the southern plains of Antonica, for some reason the locals think that Karana has blessed this land.  I tell you, I am not sure about blessed but it sure rains enough for a plain. Sparse of tree and the grass is always yellow but I tell you it rains more than not.  Anyways, there I was running through the plains looking for any sign in the quickly eroding paths that are left. The subtle mark of passerby disolving almost as fast as they are made.  A terrible fog had set in and my vision as good as it was, soon became challenged to make out shapes in the distance.  Then  Just as the rain was letting up the mist seemed to part for but a second and I saw something move in it's epicenter.  I blinked trying to clear my eyes of the rain to be sure that my eyes were truely seeing movement.  There it was again, white, ghostly, my vision was not deceiving me.  Her wings spread as wide as two ogres.  I could scarcely catch my breath as she seemed to just hover above the ground. Her wings creating only the smallest buffet sending swirls of mist outward the tendrils wisping off in every direction.  I crept upon her trying not to startle her before I could begin to work my spells.  I circled her slow carefully staying downwind.  She must have gotten restless, or perhaps she sensed something cause she began to move. I nearly lost her from the state of awe I was in. Watching this regal proud animal. The grace, the stature, it will be burned upon my brow for the rest of my days.  I forced myself back to my duty at hand and threw out my snare. The tendrils of swirling mist became a mire that would slow her magestic stride to a crawl.  I concentrated on my next assult with my second arsenal spell and soon a swarm had engulfed the white mare. but she was upon me. My arrows bounced off her batted harmlessly away by her theating wings. I turned my sorcery to my weapons and temporarily imbued them with the same blustery powers.  Her razor sharp hooves thrashed denting and chinking my armor but my blows too had their toll.  Soon she seemed to realize all to late she had underestimated her adversary and she turned to flee. I called her by her name.  Quillimane, I Sumata Ebbonflow call you to your fate.  The flapping stopped and the white magestic beast streaked crimson touched her hooves to the soil.  She whinnied what I can only describe as an acceptance.  Her head tossed and she said, &quot;adventurer, Sumata? You have come far and battled well this day. Am I to take it you have come to claim your treasure?  Very well then, I have a nice pair of feathered pantaloons that are nearly priceless. Take them and be on your way. Leave me to tend my wounds.&quot;   <br>
   &quot;Quillimane,&quot; I said, &quot; It is true I have traveled far and it is also true that we have given each other our best this day.  I must decline you marvelous breeches.  Instead though I must ask you to surrender something else.  You see I have a good friend and well she needs a special item.  I am told you know about this that I speak of?&quot;<br>
  A hurt look in her eye as if I had asked for her very soul croosed her face.  &quot;It takes me a very long time to make this item of which you speak. Perhaps you will come back and I will set about making one for you.  There you go now off with you there&quot;<br>
    &quot;Madam I hust emplore you. Eliani has been such a good person to so many people. She has sacrificed her well being selflessly if anyone deserves it is her.&quot;<br>
   She stood there eyeing me. THats when I noticed her fur was no longer matted with her lifes blood. Infact she didn't appear to have ever suffered a single stroke of my blade.  I began to worry that our parlay would turn ugly.<br>
Finally after some scrutiny she reared up on her hindquarters and I leveled my sword toward her underbelly and she touched the tip of my blade with her right hoof and I felt the warmest sensation slide down my blade and over my hands. I looked down to see a finely sewn cloak of pegasus feathers.  I looked back up and all I saw was the swirling of the mists and then the rain began to set in again.&quot;<br>
         Almalfia ponders the scene for a time then sets out to find ElfEliani. She folds the note into her vest dons her own wrap and sets out down the hall. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=75.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=75.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=75.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=75.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=75.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=75.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
