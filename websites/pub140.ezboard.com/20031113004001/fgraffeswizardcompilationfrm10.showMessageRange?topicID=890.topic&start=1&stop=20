I am not sure what to think about that, after Wizards and Magicians wanting slow, Magicians constantly asking for root, now we got Magicians asking for concussion.<br>
<br>
First of all: they keep on claiming about how they have become the best dps class since PoP release, through a combination of really powerfull pets and good nukes upgrade.<br>
<br>
Why would they need more, since concussion (mixed with SCS3) will allow them to push out even more damage, thus reducing Wizards value, as for Nuking is the only thing we can do (raiding wizards comes to mind, in raid you seldom or never stun or root, or evac).<br>
<br>
Or maybe they realised they arent the masters of dps, and that they would need help?<br>
In this case, this has to be proven, because thats not the trend i saw when looking at various logs from magicians.<br>
<br>
I mean, i havent seen a single thread stating that &quot;Magicians dmg is broken&quot;, especially since PoP release.<br>
<br>
My take on this: Magicians came to realise that we rival (and sometimes outdamage them) in raid situations, as for dmg on raid mobs has always been where we truly shine, and now they want the best of all worlds, xp groups and raids.<br>
<br>
This was always agreed upon that the ability to summon a powerfull pet while beeing able to cast powerfull nukes would need some trades off: namely no root and snare for Magicians.<br>
<br>
I think the trade off also includes agro, if we want to remain a desirable class with still a specific niche.<br>
<br>
The most common objection about Magicians out damaging Wizards with nukes was always Cast time/ Agro multipliers, concussion.<br>
<br>
Now they want the same agro lowering tools as ours, claiming that built-in agro in our nukes is still lower; soon they will want the same buil-in agro reduction.<br>
<br>
Wizards never even seriously considered to ask for a pet, for the simple reason we could have made a Magician when we started EQ.<br>
<br>
If you really want to nuke better, at this moment of EQ evolution, i think you should re-roll a Wizard.<br>

We already do a fair amount of DPS that generates very little agro towards us (our pet). There are two basic strategies that I use that do not involve concussion: <br>
<br>
- Send pet after tank has a little agro (sending your pet seems to generate some agro on your part) <br>
- Don't overnuke. <br>
<br>
I don't see the need for concussion. I have no trouble controlling my agro in exp groups or raids and I do decent damage.<br>

From what I saw that thread is filled with mages who don't know how to play their class very well...the quote from above has it right though.  I parsed a mage pet (rogue class) doing 80dps in BoT...the normal pets probably do about what, 50dps?  All a mage has to do is drop a nuke or two on the mob and they hit 100dps on the fight...easily.  As for the &quot;pets get eaten by rampage&quot; deal...too bad lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 3865<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/03 5:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Magicians want concussion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My take on this: Magicians came to realise that we rival (and sometimes outdamage them) in raid situations, as for dmg on raid mobs has always been where we truly shine, and now they want the best of all worlds, xp groups and raids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nope most of them aren't thinking about wizards much at all.  They only see their difficulty nuking on raids and know that the wizard spell concussion would help them.  It's overly self-centered as are most class balanced complaints.  You'll note that the posters that actually appear to demonstrate some understanding of the wizard class are either against concussion or &quot;wouldn't mind it.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's a big difference between saying &quot;sure I'd be happy with concussion&quot; and &quot;Mages need concussion&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the poll left no room for a grey area, and I think that a lot of mages who probably don't care too much either way voted &quot;need concussion&quot; just because they would like it and use it if they had it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=belarkan>Belarkan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 288<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/03 6:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> &quot;Nope most of them aren't thinking about wizards much at all&quot;.<br>

Yes, but spelling &quot;Magicians&quot;, &quot;Nukes&quot;, &quot;agro&quot; and &quot;concussion&quot; in the same sentence means automatically involving Wizards, for reasons i hope i dont need to explain; just like Beastlords, pets and DS would maybe have the same result.<br>
<br>
If there are issues in some high end PoP encounters, because you can't use your pets reliably, and therefore nuke too much in order to make if for the damage loss, then the pets need to be fixed, not the agro generated from nukes.<br>
The goal is not not turn Magicians into wizards whenever they cant use a pet.<br>
Since pets are part of the Magicians equations, they need to be brought back into it.<br>
<br>
I dont like when the line between classes is blured anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=veganus>Veganus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/03 8:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> I didn t comment on the mage bolt at 61, all the &quot;Mages maintain 250dps in exp groups&quot; threads and whatever mainly because in the way  i play a wizard, (greater) concussion is propably one of the most important spells. The differences in the DD data of mages and wizards doesn t seem very big for me, but because of the aggro issue wizards always came ahead on DDs on raid targets especially, so i still had the feeling to be master of DDs. It s sad to see for me this discussion on the mage board and some things remind on druid board discussions about being nukers or healers and to wish to be always very good at both. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141638">Veganus Vertium<br>

Most spell casting classes have some form or aggro reducing spells, some limited in what they can do. Ranger and druid harmony spells only work outdoors and the necro ones on undead.<br>
<br>
It doesn't look like shaman or beastloards have any aggro reducing spells. Wizards got a quest one with Kunark. And a quest that isn't easably done at level 39, though not impossible.<br>
<br>
Reading the thread, it seems that aggro from a pet being passed onto the mage is an issue. Some say it's never passed on, some say it is. Aggro is a tricky thing that no one understands. <br>
<br>
I doubt that aggro is ever passed on to another player. Mearly that some actions, such as healing, has it's aggro figured out like this:<br>
<br>
Melee A is fighting Mob A. Melee A has aggro, and alot of it. Healer A heals Melee A. The healing aggro is figured out based on the aggro Melee A has and some multiplier. Which means that the cleric suddenly has higher aggro then the main tank. I don't know if this is true, just my theroy, based on observations. <br>
<br>
I'm sure the same happens with mages and their pets when they heal thier pets. I wonder if a mage sent their pet in, prebuffed, and never cast a spell while the pet battled a mob, would the mage get aggro if the pet died during the battle? If they don't get aggro, then I would say no, they don't need this spell. <br>
<br>
However, mages seldom just stand by while thier pet does all the killing. Unless I'm mistaken, if the pet does all the damage, the player only gets 25% of the xp for the kill. This was a recent change over othe 50% damage/50% xp. If the mage does even a few points of damage, he gets full XP (assuming this is a mage versus 1 mob battle). So a mage seldom lets his pet do all the damage.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that a mages pet is thier aggro buff for them. But since letting the pet do all the work means they have to kill four mobs to get the XP of ones means most Mages won't do this. It's a trade off:<br>
<br>
Let pet do all the work (this means no healing pet) means slower XP (when soloing), but far safer.<br>
<br>
Helping pet kill mob is faster, but means higher risk. <br>
<br>
In the end, I don't think magicians need an aggro reducing spell. Magicians work through their pets. Earth elementals, root, air stuns. Pets also work as a buffer of HPS for the magician, unless the magician does something to out aggro thier own pet. <br>
<br>
The more we blur the lines between classes, the less reason there are to have classes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 6696<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/7/03 12:54 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> They can have a lesser version of the level 39 concussion... but anything more than that and I'll be kind of pissed off.

<br>
The harmony line is not aggro reduction. And while the memblur line is technically aggro reduction, it can cause a lot more problems than it solves in a fight, so it really doesn't count either.<br>
<br>
The only actual classes that have personal aggro reduction are Rogues (evade and escape), Wizards (Concussion), Rangers (jolt), and Bards (escape). Personal aggro reduction is what is useful in fights, memblur is much too situational.<br>
<br>
And anyways, Mages don't need it, that is what their pet is for. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

And based on the &quot;blurring class lines&quot; argument I do not think mages should be tuned with a spell like concussion.  However it's not really such an outrageous request.

<br>
It kinda works, but it doesn't clear you in a fight generally unless you do it over and over so it isn't really reliable for aggro control of the kind we are talking about here. Usually you stand up and just get smacked again.  It is real good for getting heals that won't give aggro to clerics though. And for pulling mobs because aggro clears almost all the time when the mob goes back to its spawn point. I have a monk I play sometimes, and while useful, it doesn't really rise to the same level as any of the other ones do.<br>
<br>
I do admit I forgot about Boggle though. Most enchanters don't use it to up dps though, they use it to avoid being killed in the first place since they tend to aggro anything they can see. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

There isn't a huge gap though. On the few fights you can't use pets (they are learning, it is very rare you can't use them now) your dps will suffer. But wizards have the same problem on the fights that they can't use concussion on. Usually those are not the same fights so it evens out. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Healing a player on an NPCs hate list generates hate like nuking that mob.  The amount of hate the person you are healing doesn't seem to matter.  The same goes for buffs.<br>
<br>
The Taunt and Evade abilities that tanks and rogues get depend on what other players aggro is.  A successful taunt kicks the player to the top of the hate list, which is very very useful.  A successful evade will drop you at least 1 place on the hate list, also useful.  They may have additional hate effects.<br>

If I had seen this, then I would support giving them the concussion line in a reduced form.  I say reduced because if they had the full strength, they'd be encroaching into our domain in terms of short term DPS, and unneccesarily blurring class lines.  Mages have been, and still are my favorite class to duo or group with, but I don't see the point in making them more mana focussed as a class.<br>
<br>
What I think might be more useful to mages from my own experience duoing and grouping with them is:<br>
<br>
1. The promised pathing upgrade we've seen mentioned in the fanfaires and SOE newsletter.  <br>
<br>
Read through the myriad of threads on why mages want root again.  Sure, a lot of them are from players who never bothered to learn what they can handle and now demand that they have a way out if things go wrong.  On the other hand, most of the ones I pay attention to as having some real issues are the notions of splitting mobs and having pulls take odd paths to create trains the mage can't possibly deal with.  This is a problem that affects all pet classes in some way, if SOE fixes it so mobs took direct routes, player deaths would go down, and there wouldn't be as much of an uproar about root.<br>
<br>
2.  Give pets a higher taunt skill rating.  <br>
<br>
The mages, (and by relation other pet classes), suffer from using pets because they aren't the side of the team that can take a few hits from a mob without crumbling.  If spells are causing more aggro than necessary, give the pets a higher taunt rating to compensate.  Keep the aggro where it belongs.<br>
<br>
3.  Upgrade pets so that when /pet taunt is off, pets generate less aggro than they are now.  <br>
<br>
This way, if you aren't using the pet as a solo tank, the mage doesn't take in nearly as much aggro.  This also means that pets don't end up as near to the top of rampage lists as they have been unless the mage wants them to be there.  You can't tell me that King Tormax sees a wimpy earth pet as a bigger threat than the 8 tanks with primals that are also engaging him.  Or the Sorcerer dropping giantbanes on his butt, for that matter.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna fall back on the standard line here, I don't think mages are broken.  If anything, they're fixed better than I am in certain situations.  What are broken however, are AGGRO and PATHING.  Pathing's been screwed up since release, and I have hope that the promised change will happen, since the engine and other upgrades have changed enough coding to allow these tweaks.  Aggro on the other hand, has been screwy for a while, across the board.  You only notice it more in endgame encounters because the stakes are higher.  The last Vindi raid I did, I managed to get summoned after only one spell cast, a Concussion.  I only cast that at 75 percent, and only to double check his hp before I was gonna start nuking.  With the good 20 players on him hacking away, my little aggro reduction spell shouldn't have pissed him off that much.  I've seen it happen on other mobs, both grouping and raiding, as well.  Hopefully, with the broken aggro post patch we're seeing now, SOE will more tempted to look at the coding and simplify or update it.  <br>
<br>
If changes like I suggested are looked at and implemented, and mages are still catching unfair beatdowns at the end game encounter stage, then I would support giving them some kind of concussion line.  Say 50% of our spell at lvl 55 and researchable, plus a 50% Ancient Greater at 60.  Before that level, they don't seem to need any major help beyond what other pet classes need.  If push comes to shove though, I'd be much more likely to get behind a movement to change the archaic code than mess with class balance any more than it is.<br>

We were kinda even before then and I was taking a much bigger risk running around with just Flappy to protect me.  Its only fair that they get eaten by a god or two in the end game.  P<br>
<br>
Funny story...<br>
The other day I was playing my wifes cleric and she joined up with a Mage and others to go hunt some xp.  I kept seeing comments from the mage like &quot;I would love to see a wizzy take (this) down so fast&quot; or &quot;I want to see a wizard with HPs as high as mine&quot; etc.  Shortly thereafter we ran into a named vamp wizard with Ice Comet who we never pulled but did agro once or twice (leaving some them quite dead, cleric survived to do Rez's).  &quot;How come he doesnt need line of sight?&quot; or &quot;How come he can cast around corners?&quot; and other whines could be heard from the same mage.  I just sat back and smiled.  )<br>
<br>
So remember, when a mage starts whining, tell them to eat cake... or cack... or some other four letter word that starts with c.<br>
