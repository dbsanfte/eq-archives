I can't stop thinking about her... I've tried different computer games, going out with friends, talking about it, music and I pretty much have run out of ideas and when I do those things I can't concentrate on them.<br>
<br>
It really isn't helping my cause with her because I think I scare her with my relationship talk.  It seems to come up every night.  I want to talk like normal friends first atleast but I just can't seem to anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyone have any ideas to help me here?  The sooner I get relaxed and think about her less.. The more I can be myself and not scare her with serious talk. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Yes, it's difficult but it is necessary. The more you think about her the worse the relationship between you two is likely to get and it sounds like you don't want that. Tell her you need a little time to get your head straight and then go take a breather for a week or two. When you come back to it you'll have to try your best not to think about her 24/7 and just go on with your life. Women find men who can live their life normally more attractive. At least this is my view on the subject.....especially since i've been through this same thing twice. <p>Sorceress of the Rathe<br>

If you ask someone out and they are interested in you but are busy, I think they'd respond like &quot;well I can't on Tuesday.. but I'm free on these days..&quot;<br>
<br>
If they just leave it at &quot;no sorry I have plans&quot; and you repeat the question a couple times and get the same answer.. then they aren't interested in you.<br>
<br>
You might just have a nice female friend there and might need to detox yourself and hope for better luck next time.

<br>
Otherwise, in conversation with her try to stick to non relationship subject matters.  Try for some of the deep stuff if you have to.  Life, religion, wants and needs, what is happiness, etc.  Make sure you keep an eye on yourself though.  You mentioned that the conversation normally steers to relationship talk.  So, what you're looking for here is if she turns the conversation to relationship talk or if it is just you doing it.  If she is doing it then it is a good sign.  Just you?  Might want to back off a bit. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=412636" target="top">Galamar Goldleaf</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Why don't people ever listen to me? <br>
<br>
Look, you either have a chance with her or you don't at this point. She already has a very good idea of whether or not you will ever be with her. 99.5% of her mind is made up, as is any female mind after knowing you for more than half an hour.<br>
<br>
The only way to increase your chances is to completely fucking ignore her. If you are this goddamn whimpering poodle yipping and licking at her ankles with your puffy little tail all aflutter, you could be Brad fucking Pitt and not have a chance.<br>
<br>
You have to walk into the room like you are the shitbastard king of England and act like you own the fucking place. Don't be an asshole, just be THE FUCKING MAN. Throw off a few offhand phrases that make no fucking sense if she talks to you and just walk away. Hell, get creative. Talk about Harriet Tubman or something. Give her some short little answer. Don't even barely look at her. She will not fucking know what to think and chances are, after her mind is cleared, she will find you a bit more interesting because suddenly you are a fucking man and you are not some self-defeating geekfuck.<br>
<br>
Some people will now come on here saying &quot;Well Mesmos, that is not very honest of you.&quot; Well, nature is not fucking honest now is it? Were you born good looking? If not, did you deserve to be born ugly? Poor? Stupid? Did you deserve that? Huh? Does the antelope deserve to be eaten by the big fucking lion? No? WELL THEN NATURE IS NOT FUCKING FAIR IS IT??!?! <br>
<br>
The only &quot;honest&quot; thing about nature is that those who play by nature's rules and do whatever it fucking takes to get the girl he wants is the WINNER. Even if he loses, he is the WINNER because he is FREE and not paralyzed by the opinion of ONE fucking poontang in this VAST SEA OF POONTANG FLOWING FROM ON HIGH ATOP THE GREAT MOUNTAIN OF POON!<br>
<br>
Every single fucking nanosecond you spend in your room all alone or when you are falling asleep thinking about her while not doing a jack shit worth of effort to get her is a nanosecond of youth and energy you just pissed out the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't get her out of my mind! WAHHH!&quot; Do me a fucking favor and give me your address so I can send you the first 4 seasons of Dawson's Creek. You can forget all about this girl and huddle in the corner watching it. You can feel all those &quot;woe is me I need to read some Shakespeare&quot; feelings while you whimper to yourself and suck your thumb. EXACTLY like you would be ANYWAY, except without bothering this poor girl with your 47th chromosome. Yes, look up 47 chromosomes. I'll wait..................Oh, you get it now!<br>
<br>
If you insist on being so fucking stupidly romantic then you can act like something you are not and tell her later &lt;after you are a WINNER&gt; that you acted that way because you couldn't live without her and you had to do anything it took to get her. She will probably THANK YOU! HOLY SHIT! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOMEN LIKE GUYS WITH SOME FUCKING BALLS!<br>
<br>
The asslicking dork boys will simply pine themselves away into a shell of self pity and angsty teenybopper Freddy Prinze Jr. movie bullshit. And then, and only then, will they DESERVE it, because it is their choice to be such lonely handfapping losers.<br>
<br>
That is all, now go forth and see just how right I am. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=llith>Llith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1050<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 10:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The cure for Lust.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Even if he loses, he is the WINNER because he is FREE and not paralyzed by the opinion of ONE fucking poontang in this VAST SEA OF POONTANG FLOWING FROM ON HIGH ATOP THE GREAT MOUNTAIN OF POON!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Back off, go on a mini-date with another girl that you both know is just for fun.  Get the idea in your head that spending time with a girl can just be about having a good time and not looking for your future wife.  After that you will look at things differant and you can go to the chick that's driving you mental and ask her out with out seeming like a mental stalker. <p><br><center><b>Sage <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21704">Legolos</a> Spellbynder |  <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21727">Uggliey</a> Bugger<br>LvL 65 Arcanist | LvL 56 Revenant<br>

She wants your attention?  Hell no, blow her off!  She'll get all confused, sniffle a little, but eventually come crawling to you since you're THE MAN.  <br>
<br>
Sensitive?  Fuck no.  Alpha males are not sensitive dipshit!  Alpha males are about ass and getting some poontang.  She wants to snuggle up?  Fuck that, grab her breast and show her you're THE MAN.<br>
<br>
Can't stop thinking about her?  Might as well jump off the evolutionary chain now since you'll never be an alpha male.  A proper alpha male spreads his will to multiple women.  Only the most attractive get his attention.  Can't stop thinking about her?  Go make out with her best friend.  It'll show her you're THE MAN.<br>

First is the stage women are at in thier teens and twenties, occasionally into thier thirties.<br>
<br>
This stage is the exact same for guys.  They wanna fuck thier brains out.  They want the &quot;Hot&quot; guy, they want the macho take no crap mother fucker that doesn't give two shits if she's with him or not cause she knows there's another bitch waiting to take her place at his side.<br>
<br>
A lot of times young women dont distinguish between men who just dont pay attention and complete asshole guys that are mean and deroggatory or even physically abuse them.<br>
<br>
This stage is where ladies come of age, they begin to understand, as men do, that sex is great and all but doesnt make a relationship.  How long it takes a lady to realize this really depends on the lady.  Kinda like when you see someone trying to learn in school and they keep attacking the problem from the same way, sometimes out of stupidity, sometimes sheer force of will that by god this will work this way etc.  Eventually they look at the problem from another angle and it all becomes clear but how long it takes them to step back who knows...<br>
<br>
Stage two is post-revelation, women decide what they want from a relationship, money/power, love, children etc.  At that point the guys that were always nice and trying to get the women have a shot just being themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1546<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 4:51 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The cure for Lust.</span><hr size=1> Mesmos I have no idea what the hell you said up there.....but I enjoyed it anyways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Personally, I think you need to talk with her about your feelings.  Even if you get slammed and/or ridiculed you'll be the better man for it in the long run and your friends will be better friends.<br>
<br>
Before you say anything, take some time to reflect and sit and think about your feelings.  Reflect on if they are simply 'lust' or if there really is something more, like you find her attractive as a person.  Identify your true feelings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gneumo>gneumo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 5:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The cure for Lust.</span><hr size=1> To be young(er) again... *sigh*<br>
<br>
Already been said by Mesmos &amp; plenty others, but just going to say it again. You sound obsessed, and it's time to ignore her.<br>
<br>
You get fixated on one person, and &quot;it&quot; doesn't work because you are too needy. Been there, done that. <br>
<br>
If you're around her, there's no chance that you'll be able to ignore her... you're going to fall in the same obsessive trap. If that's your only circle of friends, it's time for a new circle of friends. Cut the ties and move on for a while. What you've got isn't working, and it's only dragging you under.<br>
<br>
You're not ready for a relationship. You say &quot;lust&quot;, but I see it as a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). You're consumed with thoughts of her in order to shield yourself from the real issues in your life (career, family issues, whatever other stresses are hella bad). I fell into that trap a couple times in my younger years.<br>
<br>
Trust me, girls don't solve problems (especially in a relationship, as you claim to want). Girls just open up a wonderful world of new problems (and same with boys for the ladies)... and until you're prepared to deal with both your own and your partner's problems honestly, then you're not ready for a relationship. It sounds like you're not able to even deal with your own problems yet.<br>
<br>
Get your own house in order, figure out what's really the issue that you're trying to distract yourself with by obsessing on this girl.<br>
<br>
And, also as stated before, while you're fixated on the one, you're passing up plenty of good things along the way because you're blinded.<br>
<br>
Man, if I could go back and do things again with the benefit of hindsight. Plenty of good stuff I missed out on because I was full of self-doubt &amp; obsessed. I still kick myself over some easy s3xx0rz that I could have gotten if I weren't so stupid over another girl... but I was mentally ready for jack shit, so it's all water under the bridge.<br>
<br>
It's not lust, it's obsessive-compulsive behavior... and like germ-phobia and other OCD-type behaviors, your obsession has nothing to do with the object of your obsession. It's something totally unrelated that you're trying to ignore by fixating on this poor girl.<br>
<br>
So step back. Get your life in order, feel good about yourself. You'll have girls all over you in no time with a bit of confidence (a bit of class also helps, but is not always required for teh s3xx0rz, depending on your personal standards &amp; wants/needs).<br>
