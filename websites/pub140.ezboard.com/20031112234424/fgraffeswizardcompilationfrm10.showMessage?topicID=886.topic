Haven't done any parses, but how does wizard dps stack up to mage dps in an exp groups at different levels of the game? (Please assume zero AA-points and all spells available at each level). I'd assume that mage pet makes them put out somewhat more sustained dps in a high uptime group, Call of Archmage is sick damage at 65, I know this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Just a thought to make wizards output more damage in a high uptime group, yet not actively increasing their soloability might be adding in some long cast time, very high damage to mana ratio spells - bread and butter nukes, that yields a nice sustainable damage due to low mana cost, something along the lines of 500dd, 15 seconds for 100 mana (numbers pulled outta my @$$) - you get the idea. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370955 target=blank>Sage Aauminki Iceblade</a><br><a href=http://www.vazaelle.dk target=blank>Caer Cadarn</a></big><br>Vazaelle Server</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tehutibloodstorm>Tehuti Bloodstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Blueberry Nuker</span><br>  Posts: 1466<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 5:14 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are wizards balanced in EXP-groups?</span><hr size=1> Simple way is for us to have increased mana regen while grouped. <br>

Call it the Ethereal Blessing of Karana; make it an innate ability or something similar so it doesn't cut into our spell slots. Give it a radius check to ensure people don't group and quad around the zone.<br>

Give us a buff that adds an 'edge' to weaponry, make us war wizards.<br>

If you don't have any problem finding a group that wants a wizard in it, more power to you. But there are enough wizards out there that DO have trouble getting a group that it's an issue, whether you call it balance or not. And it's the issue that's irritated me the most in the 4 years that I've played. Obviously, to have stuck around this long, there are enough things I like.<br>
<br>
I go for weeks at a time without getting a chance to play. So when I do log on, the friends I grouped with in Luclin are now in PoV. Or the friends that I grouped with in PoV are now in BoT. It is so discouraging to spend hours in a zone /ooc'ing for a group. Or searching out a partial group, then getting rejected more often than not.<br>
<br>
You have a tight network of friends, bully for you. I haven't found the people that have the varying, unpredictable schedule that I do.

Who cares about number crunching? ALOT of people have made posts showing all manner of statistical BS. They claim it's perception, or whatever. Who the freak cares? <br>
<br>
When I log my cleric in, I can get a grp in a decent XP zone within 10-15 min. of starting to look for one.<br>
<br>
When I log my 'chanter in, I can get a grp 10 min. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>before</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I start looking for one.<br>

<br>
Actually, we just finished an expansion where offensive damage made defensive debuffs and healing nearly obsolete.  When regen gear can cancel the DPS of the best xp mobs. . .<br>
<br>

<br>
Somewhat biased.  AA is easier to get than spells at this point in the game.  Especially extremely powerful and efficient ones like HoD.<br>
<br>
How about assume no spells above L 60 and max AA?  Just as biased, but towards wizards instead of mages.<br>
<br>
Wizard AA is quite simply some of the best AA abilities in the game.  You get more benefit from fewer AA points than any class, and have more good AA to buy, with the possible exception of rangers.<br>
<br>
I've compared wizards to mages by crunching numbers.  The mage does a touch more DPS in a decent uptime group, but wizards pull out far ahead once the downtime goes up at all.  And the fast-burn edge is still with the wizard, with greater fast burn DPS than the mage, counting the pet.<br>
<br>
IMHO, they should do some normalization.  Up pre-AA damage on high quality AA classes, and up AA advantage on low quality AA classes.<br>
<br>
I still don't know what to do with druids.  Currently 60% of a cleric or 80% of a wizard, and 20% uniquely druid (overlaps with rangers).  They can't be a minicleric and a miniwizard at the same time.  How much should they pay for the ability to choose which they emulate at any one time?<br>

<br>
Lower level mobs die fast. Lower level players tend to pull slower. That means fast fights with a lot of downtime. In dungeons, taking down caster/healer mobs is critical, and they tend to go down even quicker than melee mobs do.<br>
<br>
I have a new-era Wizard twink who I levelled up almost exclusively with KEI and 2, sometimes 3 &quot;big three&quot; focus items. With a good Knight tank and maybe a cleric/enc stun or two, I almost always outdamaged everyone in the group combined, even twink Rogues with 36% haste items and 15dmg piercers. At a new spell level, 3-5 nukes would kill the  mobs we fought with no other help.<br>
<br>
Once I hit 50 that stopped. IC was fun for half-shotting mobs in Dreadlands, sure, but after that you enter the realm of High-HP mobs. I need to practically mana-dump and sit out 4 pulls to do the % of mobs HP I did in my 30's with 1bub of mana that came back in 5 ticks. I've been spending lots of time in Umbral Plains and a little bit of Kael, my primary nuke (DoF) usually only takes off 1-2% of those mobs HP.<br>
<br>
So from my perspective, it seems that lvl 50-60 is our sustained DPS gap... I know with the big crits I see you guys can keep up w/ my Rogue after that...<br>

When you login your Cleric and Enchanter do you need a group?  Or can you solo as well as you can with your Wizard?  I have a 60+ Cleric and I play a 60+ Enchanter... I can't solo nearly as well as I can with my Wizard EVEN WITH CoD.<br>
<br>
In EverQuest there are 3 different and basic situations - raid, solo, group.  Wizards SHINE in the solo and raid situations and we do reasonably well in a group situation.  Our group desirability is lower than other classes (and higher than others...) but far from nonexistant, that's just what comes with our class.  <br>

The real bottom line is that it's not broken nor does it need to be fixed.  We simply aren't a class that's meant to get it's EXP primarily from grouping <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is why we have several kick ass spells that allow us to destroy creatures through soloing.  Don't like soloing?  Then login your Cleric and Enchanter, don't know what else to tell you.<br>
<br>
Oh and for reference I grouped a ton from 1-56 after which I was in one of the first few Kunark-era Sebilis AE groups until 60.  It's not hard you just can't expect to get a group in 15 minutes.  I still group in PoValor, etc. when I'm bored and don't feel like soloing.  You just need to be willing to be patient.<br>
<br>
PS: Broken is such a poor word to use in this argument because we, by definition, are not broke.<br>
<br>
Edit: Just want to add that Grimstaff is right when he says it depends on the level range.  Before 44 we're very poor in grouping situations, but not ungroupable.  Infact, it's mostly due to the &quot;twink&quot; factor and that most of our spells aren't much better than other nukers. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:xx-small;">Officer of Triton, Member of Team Ice, Povar<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458434">Rombus, Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5702">Rommy, 61 High Priest</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A> at: 4/17/03 3:20:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bangkirai>bangkirai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 4:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Yeah wizards can solo decent, but please, stop overrating our solo capability.<br>

Ok, first you say we can solo decent, then you say we're pretty balanced for solo play and in the end, we're maybe one of the 3 better classes to solo. Seems like for you decent equals to top 3.<br>
<br>
Using same method... clerics can group decent, they're pretty balanced for group play and they are maybe one of the 3 better classes to group. Maybe.<br>
<br>
I've seen basically any class grouping, except maybe a necro/druid. Sure, the other classes need sometimes friends before they can group well, but they can do it pretty decent as well. Beside often we can't group either, if we don't get first some friends.<br>
<br>
Even before 60 there aren't classes that can really beat wizards in soloing, especially after 34. Prior to 29, pet classes and druids are stronger soloers, but levels 1 to 30 are a breeze nowadays also. And levels 29 - 65 are even easier for soloing wizard. No fear of gimp players in groups that go afk, don't know their stuff and lose your time. No time spent in searching a group and moving the whole group to spotX. No bickering about loot, drops, cash. We have it so easy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The whole idea of grinding for XP is to kill as many mobs as fast as possible. Or at least, that is how I understand it it. <br>
<br>
First, if your putting together an XP group, fill it out. You do get a bonus for having a a full group. The make up of a good XP, in my mind is this, 4 damage dealers, 1 healer, one crowd control. <br>
<br>
Wizards at the lower levels can really make a difference for a younger XP group. If you can show some friends how to do this, the XP really flies up fast. I've been able to make several levels in my 30's in one game session. <br>
<br>
We had a monk, ranger, cleric, warrior and 2 wizards. The ranger sowed up, pulled at least 3 mobs. The warrior, monk and ranger each tanked a mob, and kept them close. Me and the wizard casts AE rain spells and AE roots. This saved the ranger from having to snare each mob in turn. Generally speaking, we could take 3-5 mobs at once. The monk and warrior had never fought like this before, and when they saw how much XP they were getting, they loved it. <br>
<br>
It changes in 45 and up levels, I admit. Mobs have much much more HPs and hit so much harder. But that doesn't mean wizards don't have thier place. As long as you are increasing the DPS, your helping take down the mob. If you can get a horse, and the grind is in an outside zone, you'll hardly go OOM.<br>
<br>
Any melee that doesn't want a wizard (or mage at the higher end) isn't thinking, or is thinking in his sword arm. The common misconception with melees is that since they can't see how much damage we are doing, we aren't doing anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 6766<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 8:59 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards and XP groups</span><hr size=1> BTW, I neglected to mention this earlier, but if you're having problems finding a group you should try making one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wandork>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Warriors ph34r me!<BR>Gnomercy for Gno-one!</span><br>  Posts: 2072<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 11:35 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are wizards balanced in EXP-groups?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yeah wizards can solo decent, but please, stop overrating our solo capability.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Since the nerf to charm has slowed down uber charm soloing exp I feel pretty confident saying that there is no class in the game that can solo exp faster than a wizard. Period. It's no contest.<br>
<br>
Bard swarm kiting is good exp until the bard runs out of mana, then they are stuck with a huge downtime to regen mana. Also, there is no swarm kiting level 65+ mobs.<br>
<br>
Charm classes can still get good expeience charm killing, but they are only getting 30-40% of the exp they where getting before the patch. Where a good charm killer could get an AA in 20 minutes or so, it now takes more like 45 minutes to get an AA and the chance of death has significantly increased.<br>
<br>
Druids come close because they can snare kite almost as well as we can, but we can still get a mob (or 4x mobs) down faster than a druid can.<br>
<br>
In a VERY safe camp with very little chance of death a wizard can get an AA every 35-45 minutes. If you don't mind a bigger chance of death a wizard can get 1.26-1.68aa in about 30-40 minutes. What class can compete with that?<br>
<br>
(disclaimer: I will not reveal which camps yield this experience, they have been discusses on this board before as well as strats to pull this off. If you want the spoiler go find that thread.)<br>
<br>
That being said, to answer AAuminki's original question - I would say wizards are very balanced in an exp situation. I posted several parses a while back from exp groups when I was an app for my current guild. At the time my equipment was severly lacking compared to the groups I was in and I didnt have anywhere near the AA others in the groups had. At that time, I was pulling down around 100dps in an 60-70% uptime groups. The melees in those groups where doing along the lines of 125-180 dps (180 dps was a pali against undead mobs).<br>
<br>
Since getting a ton of upgrades and a enough AAs to compare to the same people, I can now log closer to 150-160dps in 60-70% uptime groups. It is rare that any melee does more damage than a comparably equiped wizard with similar amounts of AAs.<br>
<br>
Previous to comparing damage against the some of the best equiped melees, I also posted quite a few logs of average equipment groups (Velious + some SoL gear, 20-80aas) and the results where even better. I would generally pull down 70-100dps and the melees where clocking 50-80dps. Very rarely did any melees even come close. The exceptions were usually unique situations such as palis against undead or cases where rangers could use some archery. <p><div align="center" class="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial">

Wandor, while our soloing is superior to many, it still has limitations.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Since the nerf to charm has slowed down uber charm soloing exp I feel pretty confident saying that there is no class in the game that can solo exp faster than a wizard. Period. It's no contest. - Wandor<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Our soloing capabilities are limited to which mobs summon, are snareable, and available.  Some have no quams about full speed kiting, but I hate to trust the lack of lag and availability of a rez.  My biggest problem with soloing is availability and access, and I would prefer to have a group for safer experience, and more fun.  While currently those with elemental plane access have some very choice spots, by the time many get to that level my guess is that these exp locations will have many eager kiters.  The same can be said for other tier 2 plus PoP zones.  The days when you will find Loroks and Golems available for quading are long over on my server.  Soloers compete with other soloers and groups for spawns.<br>
<br>
Even though the charm nerf put a damper on mega farming exp from some, pet classes have many more options for soloing than wizards.  This is not to say that thier soloing ability is greater, as controlling agro makes pet soloing difficult.  I think the 'no contest' part is as overstated as 'Wizards are broken'.<br>

Some classes are much less gear dependent for their soloing capabilties, whereas wizards really can capitalize on the highly eficient nuke/mana ratio of increased MC/FT/mana regen buffs.<br>
<br>
All that aside, there may be a discrepancy that the higher end wizards tend to overlook when comparing normal wizards' performance in exp-groups, wizards without high FT count and high MC/Fury skills.<br>
<br>
What I originally suggested was a spell that was slow casting but highly powered damage/mana ratio, so wizards could get a &quot;base&quot; of damage/second so to speak without dipping into mana-pool usage, letting manapool stay for burns or other emergencies while still maintaining a respectable DPS with minimal manaregen.<br>
<br>
Wizards are highly geared manaregen is very directly tied to dps, whereas other classes such as pet classes have a base of damage that doesn't change depending on mana-regen (pet) and a lower powered linear curve for nuke efficiency. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370955 target=blank>Sage Aauminki Iceblade</a><br><a href=http://www.vazaelle.dk target=blank>Caer Cadarn</a></big><br>Vazaelle Server</center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=886.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=886.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=886.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=886.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=886.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=886.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=886.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
