Yes, I would simply sit there. I always keep both Barrier of Force and O'Keil's Levity on myself. The fire beetle would destroy itself, utterly fail to harm me, and I would waste not a whit of energy or time dealing with it. That is why Solusek Ro's reaction to the Four's plot reeks of Hatred...they should be to him what the fire beetle is to me. For some reason, they were not. Food for thought.<br>

It was simply a means to achieve his end - which was to curtail the influence of Tunare, and thus increase his own power. If his goal was to slay hundreds of thousands, he would be evil. But that wasn't his goal, his goal was to gain power - and just because you don't give a shit about what happens to hundreds of thousands of beings doesn't mean you fall on the evil end of the spectrum.<br>

It is intent that judges good or evil, not results. Innoruuk would have killed these elves simply out of malice. Solusek Ro killed them only to further his own ends. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Sure it does. That's what Tunare, Karana, the Marrs and other &quot;light&quot; deities want you to think. They're the ones who drew that line, disregarding that their own domains are every bit as &quot;evil&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot; is the ultimate realm of kill or be killed, an endless cycle of murder and death. The directionless fury of storms causes death and suffering on a huge scale. And love? Need I mention that no other single concept has brought about as much concentrated pain, misery and despair? <br>
<br>
The simple fact is that what Innoruuk represents is at least honest. No bones about it...Hate.

Nothing. No servant of Innoruuk has ever become a demigod - talk all you want of how Solusites are deluded, but I think you are the deluded one.

Your example is flawed. Fire beetles are notoriously stupid creatures. Killing any amount of them would not stop one from attacking. So it is with traitors. You do not need to act to stop those who are simply too weak to pose a threat. They will destroy themselves if manipulated to it. By removing the powers of the Four, Solusek Ro has tipped his hand in terms of what he is capable of doing to wayward followers and likely what he intends to do the the rest of his flock.<br>

He would likely die...of laughter. No one man is a threat to the Prince of Hate. I suspect it would take dozens of powerful mortals to pose a threat to his true Avatar. In any case, as an immortal, he has no cause to fear destruction or death. His essence remains aware and viable at all times and will reform another Avatar when it suits him. Plots and schemes are encouraged among the worshippers of Innoruuk. It keeps the wits and skills sharp and the mind alert. Solusek Ro would of course discourage this among his faithful. An alert mind accustomed to diabolical plots might actually see what he's planning.<br>

Innoruuk is not an influential deity by any means, surely you will agree with this. In the councils of the gods, Innoruuk is a small fry whose protests are often ignored and his opinions marginalized. Innoruuk can't afford to become any LESS influential:  if you were plotting, for example, to forcefully convert the King and Queen of Neriak to worship of Rallos Zek, he would act to stop you in the most frantically violent way possible. If you think otherwise you do not understand the mind of your god.<br>

The Prince of Hate gathers his power off one thing: an emotion.  Vanquish the emotion, and you vanquish the god.  Your weak, pathetic excuse for a god's only source of power is derived from some petty emotion and those of weak kneed mortals.  Your fine diety nearly got overthrown by his own mortal daughter.  You wish to speak of traitors?  Your entire race is filled with them, althrough known have even approached the ability of treachery as Lanys did.  Solusek Ro influenced her more than the Prince of Hate ever did.  Indeed, if your god has such an alert mind, should this not be obvious to him?

Not before the Faydark burns with the mighty fires of Solusek himself!<br>
<br>
<br>
The true path to power through magic leads through Solusek's graces. The only reason anyone would have to follow any other diety is: <br>
<br>
a) They are just pawns of their heritage, or lackeys of the Church; in which case they are impotent and irrelevant in the large scheme of things. (Innoruuk and Tunareians for example)<br>
<br>
b) They are totally devoid of any moral sense and are so self absorbed that they refuse to aknowledge the non-existance/existance of any god as superior to themselves. (agnostics)<br>
<br>
c) Are wanna-be druids. (Followers of Karana)<br>
<br>
<br>
The worst of the worst fall into section 'b'. Agnosticism is the biggest cop-out ever, especially when gods and demi-gods play such active roles in our daily lives. <br>
<br>
Even followers of Karana have the sense to realize something is greater than themselves.<br>
<br>
All agnostics are spineless.<br>

Tell me something Eamin...are you familiar with the Prophecy of Trakanon?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Origins<br>
It seems all things in Norrath ultimately seem to point back to this ancient Prophecy of Trakanon had spoken to Edril the Lancer. I do not believe that which has been fortold is the truth to the prophecy, only one elf's perception from events. The gods have been known to make allies and pacts amidst themselves. I believe Trakanon saw the end of the world long ago. His prophecy I believe was carried by the Teir'Dal of the ancient empire of Caerthiel. <br>
<br>
The meaning of the ancient Teir'Dal symbol of Caerthiel is as follows. The symbol directly in the center is Veeshan. The head of a serpent with the wings of a dragon. The symbol directly left is of Tunare, nine dots that emulate the standing stones seen throughout Norrath. The symbol in the center above that of Veeshan is the symbol of Brell, denoted by the candelabra which is often depicted worn by Brell. The symbol directly to the right of Veeshan is that of Prexus, three lines to denote the waves of the Oceanlord. Surrounding the four symbols is a great circle which depicts the veil erected by the three in their pact to keep the Wurmqueen in check. <br>
<br>
The four on the outside from left to right are as follows: Lower left hand corner is Rallos Zek, upper left is Innoruuk, upper right is Cazic Thule, and the lower right is Bertoxxulous...the four horsemen to bring about the end. <br>
<br>
The Four Horsemen<br>
There will be four Horsemen to bring about the final days of armageddon, the second war of the gods. First shall ride hate to bring the night. Then shall fear ride to cast its cloak of horror upon the lands. Plague and decay will ride thrice to spread its seed across the lands. The three shall give way to the fourth, and War will embrace the world in an icy wave of doom. The four horsemen shall ride and take their place in what will bring about the final battle for Norrath. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk who showed his hand at the Battle of Bloody Kithicor*. Cazic Thule when he corrupted the Lesser Faydark and the last unicorn, Equestrielle at the attempted summoning of Tunare's avatar*. The three fold plague of Bertoxxulous upon the Karana Plains*. Rallos Zek who sits locked within his Plane of Power, awaiting freedom that he might wreak vengeance for his imprisonment at the last war of the gods. It is said even now in the lower planes where dwells the four can be seen evidence of emissaries and fiends from the realms of all four dark gods gathering their minions for the final hour. Such is at least spoken of within the Plane of Hate where reportedly is now also found a statue of Lanys TVyl.<br>
(*GM Events) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The world is running full speed towards an apocalypse. Solusek Ro's machine will not directly destroy Norrath...it will instead free Rallos Zek from his prison in the Plane of Power, fulfilling the prophecy and unleashing the fourth and final horseman. Lanys will soon be reborn as a goddess herself(Envy). She willl likely ride at the head of the combined armies, assuring their ultimate victory. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eaminwhitefalcon@graffeswizardcompilation>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br>  Posts: 6815<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/03 5:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> HUHAHAHAHA!<br>

<br>
Rallos Zek I can see as a potential threat to the security of Norrath, for he is a powerful deity, after only Solusek Ro and Veeshan of the Norrathian gods. But he alone could not bring destruction to Norrath, which is why he has allied himself with the Great Lord. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khaymus>Khaymus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/03 11:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> Remain blind if you will.
