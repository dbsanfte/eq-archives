<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Why would a level 60 need to still do AE groups?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Few reasons would be obviously for Luclin, XPing again will gain the ability to put points in skill tress to further accentuate your wizard. Then there is also loot, dot funding, powerleveling friends and guildies. But the best factor of all, nothing beats the looks on a meatshields face when he sees 2 wizards kill 20 mobs in under 1 minute. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Who should I invite to make my AE group?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Group dynamics are very important for an AE group. You have to have at least 2 nukers and 1 enchanter. Having a healer for the puller is also highly regarded as required.<br>
<br>
For the nukers, wizards are the main players. However, mages can be substituted as well if high enough level to cast Point Blanks. Necros and Clerics can also do damage if the mobs being pulled are undead. <br>
<br>
For the Stunners, it's generally known only Enchanters will do. Their PBAE stun is the glue that holds together the group. This uses low mana and they can chain cast it. Without this, the wizards would be dead in seconds. This is also why level of mobs being pulled is key to the enchanter as resists will have them killed quite quickly. As well, having 2 enchanters is usually the safest bet for an AE group with a large appetite as spacing will have the enchanter running around to stun and will create chaos, which in a PBAE group will get everyone killed. <br>
<br>
For the healers, go with a cleric. They can AE heal during fights and will need quick small heals for the puller while he stacks. Shamans and druids can also be substituted. <br>
<br>
For the puller, the main thing you need is someone with a few things. Knowledge of the zone, testicular fortitude and be able to die and not be too concerned. Pulling quality trains is a skill not all that many meatshields have. I've used paladins the most and they seem to get the job done quite well with their skills. Rangers and SKs work well but really any melee can do it if they have the guts (and the HP/buffs). The main thing you need for the puller is for him/her to understand their role. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Uhh..well, what is the pullers role?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Grab as many as you can, bring them back to the group and stand STILL. Let them stack as neat as possible so that the enchanters can begin the stun chain. Once the stuns land and you get your baby heal, GO GET MORE. Ensure that all mobs brought to camp stay stacked neatly and you've done a perfect pull. With 2 enchanters, they can cast their PBAE stuns for roughly a minute while a second train is pulled, just another reason Enchanters are an integral part of the PBAE groups. The Puller should then sit back and engage/finish off any stragglers or out of range mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The healer just sits there like an xp sponge? WTF!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Don't they wish. A healer must always be ready when healing a PBAE group. First the puller, when the incoming is about to come, a small heal should be used (Celestial Healing I believe?) so that aggro isn't gained and the puller stays alive, once the stuns begin aggro will be lost by the puller and they can go grab part 2 of the pull. The enchanters will then most likely need some small heals as well for any mobs that resist the stuns. If the enchanter is of lower level than the mob, resists will play a large part in the healers mana consumption. The wizards shouldn't be much to worry about, while aggro will be then taken during the nuke phase, absorption skins should keep them unharmed for the chain casting of the nukes. This is dependant on the mobs engaged. Of course, clerics are needed to rez the puller who will know doubt, die a few times with too large of trains.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What do the wizards do to kill all those mobs so fast?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Around the wizard circle, it's pretty well known Al'Kabor is NOT a wizard of great merit. Namely because he is a pompous Erudite who has the crappiest line of AE spells ever created in Norrath. However, another Wizard named Jyll created a line of high level wizard spells that create a Point Blank Area Effect when cast. Now this is a wizard! This line of spells has unlimited targets available as long as their in immediate reach. General rule of thumb when casting these is, STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE MOBS. They will all be chain stunned, they won't hit you..much. <br>
<br>
I keep all these up when AEing; Jyll's Wave of Heat, Jyll's Zephyr of Ice and Jyll's Static Pulse. Because of short recast times, these can easily be chain cast just using 2. After a few casts, you will not be able to lose aggro so ensure you stay situated between all mobs so that they can stay stacked. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I got my group together, where do we go to AE?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are some very quality locations to PBAE in, but some places have little differences that can cause delays and problems for your group. I'm sure other people can give creative feedback on other hunting grounds for this so I'll list a few of my favorites. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sebillis</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Alot of people who have tried to PBAE here will have horror stories I'm sure, it's a little bit more difficult as the mix between casters/knights and the movement of the frogloks is a pain to get them to stack properly. Ensure your group knows what they're doing before attempting frogs. Loot and XP is quite good when emploring PBAE here however.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Karnors Castle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Great place to train PBAE enthusiasts. Mobs are a bit lower level so resists usually aren't an issue. With new teal con's, XP will still flow even for 60's. Recommended to either pull to VS stage room or Basement. If KC crowded, the basement is usually empty and has a ton of undead mobs. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Velketor's Labyrinth</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Only camp I have AE'ed is the Pit and the entrance. The Pit is all dogs. Really easy to pull trains down there but is a chance resists could happen. Loot isn't great but the plat payout is. Spiders are really easy if enough can be found, however remind the puller to not turn his back on 10 backstabbers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Howling Stones</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A favorite of PBAE groups for a number of reasons. The place is usually empty, groups can clean all 4 wings in a night and get great loot and even better XP. Few problems that can hamper you though. Alot of the mobs Harm Touch which will kill your puller numerous times when attempting trains. As well as traps can hamper movement. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Chardok</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Very fun place to AE. You will never run out of mobs to pull, can use other AE tricks (like Fearing one so it brings back 30 others) and the loot/plat/xp is also excellent. Can AE right down to royals as well if your group can handle it. Fast repops, some HT's and alot of named piled in the trains can cause messy CR's. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Hole</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Wouldn't recommend it. Golems can't be stunned and your chanters will be dead quite quickly attempting it. You'll always get a few golems in a train. Mages I hear, are great down here. They can make their own godamn PBAE groups then <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Plane of Fear</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This of course, would be a raid event however AE is a very easy way to clear this plane so that setup for golems or CT is nice and fast. Key to  success, stacking and informing melees not to block out the PB classes. 60 chanters and wizards are also recommended. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> City of Mist</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Never tried it myself but I'm sure it'd be possible, just don't get Reavers in your pulls!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Droga</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
With the new Chardok Ring being introduced alot of level 60s now frequent this mid level dungeon and not just for the Idol of the Thorned. Getting Chardok faction is a high priority now and this is the only way to get it. Since alot of lvl 60s will have maxed -Sarnak, they will need to kill 3000+ goblins in Droga and what better way than AE! large dungeon and some Gob's HT but since a bit lower level (30s?) any puller worth their weight shouldn't have a problem with this. Give him rune and lev and should be able to pull 30 at a time with relative ease. Of course, no Xp down here if you are 60. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LGuk/SolB</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This was a good place to learn how to train AE in Dungeons and I am sure they're still quite viable alternatives but I haven't returned to them to PBAE in ages so will let someone else give hints for these zones. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What do you mean by &quot;stacking&quot; ?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The key to a successful PBAE group hinges on this. If the mobs are spread out, they won't die and when you're OOM at the end of a fight and there is still 5 mobs left, and you remember you only have one melee in your group well...<br>
<br>
When you have undead in the trains, ENSURE that the puller stands in front of the group to stack as undead will attack whatever is closest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What about downtime?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Occasionally you'll expend your entire mana bar but since you'll have at least one enchanter there, that shouldn't be a problem should it. If it is, bring a bard to pull, thhey can do it with aggro songs and mana song you during downtime. Either way, nuke until they're all dead or you will be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> We keep dying. It's all your fault, how you gonna make it up to us!?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
PBAE groups are risky, no matter where you do it. When you have 20 mobs in camp, anything can happen. Once you learn how to execute flawlessly, you'll see downtime isn't even an issue. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> How many mobs can be pulled per train?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It matters on the puller, levels of the participants and the zone you're in. For the puller, if they can DA or have a buttload of hit points, maybe they can get enough in the first run but if not, then the strategy of enchanters stunnin for the 2nd train should be used. Remember, the more in the train the more productive your group is. But use common sense. Just because your PBAE group can kill 15 skellies in the KC basement doesn't mean you'll have the same luck with Amy Knights in Fear. So for some trains, stick to the general rule: 8 Is Enough. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/AEFear.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Can wizards pull for PBAE groups?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yup, and cutting out the melee puller actually adds more firepower to the group. I'd recommend it be an epic'ed wizard as the skin is what will keep him/her alive. As well, pull small trains and let the chanters hold it, reskinning between each pull. Don't bother with HT mobs unless you have a deathwish. Flux staff will be tough to pull so many so fast, use aggro via distance instead to cut down on the number of hits you'll absorb. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Any tricks you know of for PBAE groups?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'm sure others have found some stuff to help out with different aspects of PBAE groups. Hrmm, can't really think of many offhand. You can use your Eye of Zomm to pull random trains in dungeons by casting it through the wall, but you never know what you'll get this way and will sometimes aggro an entire dungeon and/or multiple bosses and get many people outside of your group killed. You can also use Fear spells and aggro radius spells to pull, but due to cast times, sometimes these aren't useful. <br>
<br>
There is some tricks you can use with mob paths and aggro to make them bring the entire zone to you. Who would of known how simple it was to make a train like this as a newbie<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/frogtrain.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
And of course, don't try PBAE groups in places it won't work *cough* <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/wipeout.wmv">www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/wipeout.wmv</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Anyways, hope it helps if you haven't done AE groups before and feel free to post your own hints and tricks and/or questions and remember STAND STILL! Only 3 mobs can ever hit you at a time, don't be afraid to AE!<br>

also what would be the ideal group ( notice that i am on Dark side of team vs Team so no rangers pallys, bards, or druids)<br>

also i am interested in doing it in Howling stones but it hink Harm otuch would cut puller down<br>

<br>
1. The most important thing for a wizard is to *ALWAYS* stay close to the chanter.  By AE'ing you are generating a lot of aggro and if you are in between the chanter and the mobs you will also get proximity aggro.  Even if you are within range of the chanters stuns it is possible for mobs to be on the far side of you out of range of those stuns.  They will go to town!  So stay as close as possible.  Jyll's spells actually have a good range on them so you don't have to be in the middle of the pack provided they're &quot;stacked&quot; well.<br>
<br>
2. YOU have the best tool for bringing a scattered crowd into a tight &quot;stack&quot; to make everyone's jobs easier.  The Jyll's line of spells have a built-in knockback effect that over the course of a few AE's can move mobs a good distance.  It is important to realize that they are pushed not backwards from the direction they are facing, but simply in the direction YOU are facing.  So pick a corner to pull to, jam the chanter in the corner, and face the corner when AE'ing.  F9 out if you want to look around.  This will allow you to pull mobs into the corner instead of pushing them out from it.  This packs them tighter instead of spreading them out.  It also brings them closer to you and the chanter instead of pushing them away so you don't have to chase them around or worry about mobs going out of range of stuns or AE's.  If you do not have a corner or at least a wall to push mobs against, you can balance pushes against other AE'ers and the chanter to avoid lengthy migrations.  (Chanter stuns also push, but not nearly as much as Jyll's)  <br>
<br>
3. Corners are your chanter's best friend.  If your chanter(s) can get their buttocks wedged firmly into a corner they become much more resistant to interrupts since they won't have to worry about correcting for mobs that are pushing them.  This means you can pull larger trains with a single chanter.  <br>
<br>
4. Get between the mobs and your chanter if you only have one.  This lets you take some of the proximity aggro off the chanter and effectively tank for him/her. Yes, the chanter probably has a crapload more AC and HP than you because most members of their profession concentrate on that more than mana items.  However, YOU will take much less damage tanking for a chanter that is getting constant stuns off then you will take when your chanter is getting interrupted by mobs that could be hitting you instead.  This isn't a big deal when you have 2 enchanters however.<br>
<br>
5. On group composition:<br>
Druids have okay AE's.  They're a lot slower than mages or wizards, but will do in a pinch.  Clerics actually have a okay line of AE's too that are NOT limited to undead mobs.  For example the level 59 AE does over 600 damage with just a 1 second casting time.  The recast is atrocious however.  I AE'd for many levels without ever grouping with a wizard as an enchanter so don't assume you can't get by with other classes.  The number one underestimated AE class is bards however.  They have PB AE DoT's that can actually wrack up a ton of damage if a battle lasts a while.<br>
<br>
Warriors etc. make decent pullers, but by far the best pullers are the ones with some form of invulnerability spell.  Cleric's can do this at any level and are ideal for longer pulls since they have multiple invulnerability spells they can use to do longer pulls.  Necros can also do this, but must be really agile to survive once invulnerability wears off.  Paladins get one 20 second invulnerability spell at 55 and can do the job.  Bards get a group invulnerability song at 60 which is invaluable.  An invulnerable puller can absorb HT's and make huge trains in one pull.  <br>
<br>
A lot of unlikely group combo's can AE, so don't be afraid to try things out.<br>

<br>
1. Don't start nuking untill all mobs are under enchanters stun control. Give some time for enc to chain stun and get every inc mob under control before nuking. Esepically if there're caster mobs in the pull since they will take a longer time than melee mobs to arrive. Early nukage might cause you to be oom before all pulled mobs are dead.<br>
<br>
2. Tell the healer to concentrate more on the enc in group. Yes, even though we do all the damage, the enc will still out taunt us. And beleive it or not, if enc goes down, then everything will be lost.<br>
<br>
3. If you plan to pull more 8+ mobs, then better take 2 enc instead of 1, 3 resists in a 15+ pull is enough to stun the enc and break his chain stun. And again, when enc is down with 15+ mobs, we won't even have time to cast evac.<br>
<br>
4. Bard is good not only for their AE dot but also their AE slow. This will make it easier for the pure casters when some mobs resisted stun and starts pounding on them. Also their AE slow song has snare effect, this makes them good puller in most dungeons. However, they definately need to do multiple step pulls becuase of their lower than warrior hp and no invulunary spells.<br>
<br>
5. Besides corners, tight corridors are also good for gathering and packing mobs. Just have the wiz stand at both end of the mobs after they're under chain stun and pack them to the middle with our PBAE spells.<br>
<br>
6. Be prepare to die as accidents will happen.<br>
<br>
P.S. Best experience with PBAE group that I have consists of 2 wiz, 2 enc, 1 clr, and 1 bard. Clr for their group heal, hp buffs, and res. Bard for their pulling, mana song, and AE slow. 2 enc are better than 1 to keep everything under stun cntrol, and backup even if one dies. 2 wizard of course are for grinding through mobs for exp, loots, and glory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukoveadlarhune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kovea DLarhune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/3/01 8:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AE Groups for Sorcerers</span><hr size=1> nothing in the game gives me quite the thrill of pb ae groups. for the classes that can participate its an entirely new dimesion to their class. i know a few cleric that were very skeptical about the whole idea and by the end of the night were pulling the biggest trains they could find and unleashing the 'useless' spell upheaval <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
the enchanter must have 3 stuns up ~ keeping the mobs controlled through stuns is what the ae group is built around. the level 52, 44 and i think level 20 color line of stuns seem to be the most effective. most of the ae groups that struggle seem to miss this point as the enchanter doesnt realize they need a third. from my experience (and it also depends on the level of the enchanter) one enchanter can control about 16 non summoning mobs. with the addition of a second enchanter it makes about 8 more manageable or higher level mobs. to emphasize <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENCHANTERS MUST HAVE 3 STUNS UP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or you are just going to be doing cr.<br>
<br>
pulling ~ da is very nice to have for the puller and in my favorite place for ae , howling stones, being able to absord all the ht is very important. i suppose just about any class could pull but unless its just a few mobs at a time to stack up using ae mez it isnt as effective. paladins (56?) bards (60) and clerics all are perfect for pulling. having the healer pull isnt much of a risk once they are back in camp with the enchanter permastunning the pull. if you are going to use a tank in the group make sure they get on the highest level/most dangerous mob in the pull.<br>
<br>
soloing/farming ~ with the epic rune or manaskin its a very effective way to clear greenies. even without the stun only 4 can attack at once so if you can find a spawn of 3 or 4 aggro a bunch of others and drag them into the middle of the set spawn. there will be a lot of interrupts but should be able 8 to 10 at once pretty easily if they have around 1600 hp. with the same type mob aggro shouldnt have any problem with runners as thy will stay after you unless only one is stll standing. for those of you working on faction for chardok in droga its a great way to solo but be careful with the number of mobs that ht you pull <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
one of the nice things at the time i was doing a lot of ae groups is that they are perfect for the underutized areas of high level zones. howling stones is great. and if you dont have a rogue but have a higher level exp group head to the east wing ~ gflux up onto the roof over the zone in and then levitate across. the karnors sewers are perfect for ae and with the changes to chardok i bet could do some impressive things in there. and if you really want people raving about wizards a single enchanter and wizard in a regular grind group in necropolis can easily handle the beetle traps for a nice boost on the exp bar. have fun! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umadleon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madleon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 944<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/8/01 8:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AE Groups for Sorcerers</span><hr size=1> great advice guys, keep them coming. Can never share enough tips when it comes to PBAE groups as one person on the wrong page can muck up the whole run at it. <br>
<br>
As for the new zones in SoL, I have spotted some prime real estate for PBAE groups. Haven't tested it yet but definately test out Fungal Grove and The Grey, both zones have blues to 60s with low HP mobs and plenty of mobs to train. Especially the Grey, one puller sowed could easily pull 60-80 mobs with one trip around the desert.   <p><center><font face="System" size="-1"><a href="http://www.packetlost.com" target="_blank" name="Ho'Style"><img src="http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/luclin.jpg" border="0" alt="Mad's Toons"></a><br>

<br>
A mage will not do as the 2nd caster, their spell does not recycle as fast as a wizards for AE.  They will make an excellent 3rd caster and have a score of other functions to really help out like CoH, mod rods for epic wizards, damage shields and pets.<br>
<br>
Cleric/Paladin pull.  DA/DB rule for pulling and highly recommended way of getting the mobs to camp.  Once in camp it will be hard to lose agro.<br>
<br>
Epic Wizards or Runed wizards are VITAL.  If you dont have an epic, bring lots of dots.  While the rune is up, it is considerably easier to channel through.  I have tested this extensively and unless the mob has a nasty bash you will most likely channel through.  Think of it as you are the main tank, call out AE time, control the party.<br>
<br>
If the enchanter dies you die.  Runed and fully buffed.  Aego if possible.  Do not damage shield the enchanter!!<br>
<br>
Discuss the route the puller will take.  Best way is to run to a pre determined pull spot.  Only AE on 10 or more or it is just not efficient for mana reasons.  Mez, get more and remez until you get the tight group.<br>
<br>
SOW/Jboot the puller.  Another good reason to have a mage, he can CoH the puller in after he zones and jboots/SOWs up.<br>
<br>
Advanced Techniques:<br>
<br>
Everyone in the party turn off all graphics, /showspelleffects off.  One nice Winds of Geild and you can lag yourself to death.<br>
<br>
CE the puller prior to grabbing mobs.  When the mobs come to the group, CE/Torpor/Heal over time the enchanter.<br>
<br>
If you are real confident of the pathing, send in a pet or fear a mob into a crowd.  Tricky as the worst possible thing you can do is have a staggered train.<br>
<br>
For a single mob, paladin stun &gt; enchanter stun due to the damage.  If you accidently pull a boss mob, have the paladin go to town on the boss and solo tank/ chain stun until the fray is done.  Paladins also have wave of healing as an added bonus.<br>
<br>
Decession is wonderful with a CoH mage.  Allows the puller to be anyone.  You send the puller to zone, get Sowed (spend the money on the potion) and CoH the puller back.  You dont have to depend on a druid.<br>
<br>
60 wizards and a semi staggered pull, start off with winds of geild.  The reason is HUGE damage as a taunt.  Takes a little practice in timing but 1200hps of damage single shot will keep the mobs off the enchanter everytime and the range is huge for this spell.  It is a mana hog and has no use after the inital pull due to cast time.  If you mez park all mobs open up with this spell.  It will bring the mobs closer to you and away from the enchanter.<br>
<br>
56+ wizards are key to a good group.  Supernova is not practical and if you have a 55 or under wizard just wait for the refresh static pulse.  59+ if you are AEing velk's lab as the cold AE is more resisted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luclin AE spots so far:<br>
<br>
The Grey<br>
<br>
Fungus Grove if high enough level.<br>
<br>
I will be attempting with a group of 60's and three sorcerers to AE maidens.  Umbrous Toilers seem like good targets to AE and easy to pull trains.  Substitue paladin/cleric puller for bard.  Not sure how it will work and will post results.<br>
<br>
Good luck.  Once you start AEing you will continue to find groups for nice experience and nice loot.  There is nothing like watching 20 yellow messages flying across worth of exp.<br>

Alot of times u might pull a caster... hell usually u will. Then this happens try to keep 1 alive and let it gate. Normally that'd be liek OH HELL NO TRAIN! but not in an ae group. By the time u get mr gater back with 10 + of his friends u will have enough mana to own the add's. Makes for alot of fun trains too.<br>
Also another idea is to pull around corners. Corners really stack mobs together nicely and so the chanter can stun easy and u can easily aoe them down.<br>
And always always warn ppl ur puller is pulling trains. Alot of times &quot;smart&quot; groups will try to steal ur pulls and say they were helping. Unfortunetly if you pull 1 frog from a seb train they all come with meaning that 3 melee group with no wizard is gonna die and ur gonna get blamed.<br>

We would have either my pet melee the latecomers or we'd just mez to include in the next pull.  <br>
<br>
In any case I would say that the most important things for an AE group, after knowing your roles, are being able to think on your feet, not panic when the pull doesn't go smoothly, and communication.  So long as your enchanter is alive, there is hope.<br>
<br>
Also, this should be a no brainer but unless you are absolutely positive about the strength of your connection and your system turn on all your raid settings(particle density off, server filter, 3d sky, etc.)  15-20 mobs will be framerate hell on a lot of systems, and the spell effects for PBAE's are like 100 times worse.  If you've got a bard, multiply that number again.  In any case a good PBAE pull on an unprepared system can easily lock it up to the point where you either go linkdead or are totally useless, so I suggest caution and shutting off all extraneous effects.  Honestly you won't miss them, being spammed with damage numbers is enough of a rush in itself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr align="left"  width="100%">

<br>
Thunderclap<br>
<br>
Isn't that a level 34 spell? Why yes, it is. TC is a pb AE with a 15 ft knockback and the best part is that it will take mobs from behind you and throw them forward.<br>
<br>
I do what is known as closing the gate and packing. I stand away a bit from the pull and when they all get there, swing outside the main bunch, face the chanter and cast Thunderclap. This packs them in tight and also pulls those straggling casters forward as well. Then I take 2 steps forward and go to town with Jyll's.<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun. Remember to use Thunderclap as your first cast and face the chanter in the corner.<br>

For enchanters, flux works well ONLY at the start of lock down and *maybe* after they get an interupt.  Once you have 40+ mobs being locked down flux is not a good idea because it has a very small radius and will not hit all mobs, like the ones at the edge of the pack, but flux is very good for mana conservation at the start of the pull process when only 5-15 mobs are being locked down. <p>Sond Planeshifter <BR>

If they get more than a resist or two on a cast, they throw in the low-level to cover and don't have to worry about their other 3 not refreshing in time to maintain the stun-lock.  We've been doing pulls of 10 to 20 in Seb with a single chanter and haven't had a wipeout due to stun resists yet.<br>
<br>
What we do get a lot of is puller-deaths.  Yes I know everyone says it's normal for the puller to have a few deaths, but I'd still like to reduce that number, and at the same time find a way to increase the average pull size.  If someone could post up a detailed walkthrough of pissing off a lot of mobs and still making it back to the group in Seb I'd really appreciate it.  So far, we've basically been just rune the puller (or manaskin if I'm pulling), aggro by proximity, and get our ass beat all the way back, using just Run3 to try and stay ahead somewhat.<br>

<br>
- Forget about AoE tash in XP group. It takes too long to cast and recycle, and can break the stun web, and to top it off it doesn't hit all targets. It might be useful when you have more than 2 encs in special settings such as POF clearing or Chardok royals trash clearing.<br>
<br>
- Enc stuns DO push back, albeit only a little. If you have both encs facing a corner, they will push the mobs towards it, which is Good(TM). <br>
<br>
- A mage works with another wizard if he has Scintillation, it will just take longer, just make sure Encs have enough mana and not too many resists, and it's fine. <br>
