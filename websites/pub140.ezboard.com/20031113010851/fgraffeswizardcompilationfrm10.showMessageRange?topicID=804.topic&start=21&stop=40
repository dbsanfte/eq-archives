Sorry, I actully have started to enjoy playing as a Wizard in PoP.  I don't have my epic, I don't have sunstrike either, I am not in a high end uber guild.  Mana burn still looks good, and I quad stuff all the time still.<br>
<br>
But if this game depresses you, go buy a PS2 and get EQOA when it comes out, I hear that Wizards are pretty kick arse at the beginning, pretty powerfull.  That is what you want, power, right?<br>
<br>
EQ is a social game, get use to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zegomandelbrot>Zego Mandelbrot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/16/02 9:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> uh Thanks</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the lecture.

I got to agree with ya on most points, however<br>
on these points:<br>
<br>
Point 3).   One word.. or rather spell.  Concussion.  Any wizard who doesn't have it is a fool.  Very nice to have if you've got to chose between a +3 mana regen Rune and the BST +(7-9?) mana regen spell.<br>
<br>
Point 4).  Bazaar isn't the only place to look for spells.  I've found the high-end guilds can be very sympathetic to wizards.. especially if you've helped them in the past with some of their epics.  (Particularly Cleric Epics..)<br>
<br>
Point 5).  Oh, they can bang alright.. but everything I've heard about FoT aside from it being a bolt, is that the aggro from that spell alone makes it a nightmare for any mage to use.  Add to that, Druids and Mages rarely select evocation as a speciality, making their spells that much more mana hogs.  They may be able to burn better than us for a time.. but not ALL the time.<br>
<br>
Point 6).  So.. you forsee this as a bad thing?  At lvl 62, its rather nice not to have consant streams of tells asking for TLs.  Plus, I like the added fact, that I don't get asked to go hunt some lazy LFG person.<br>
<br>
Point 7).  Okay, you (and anyone who agrees with you) are so far off on this point.  You have not spent enough time in the PoP dungeon crawls of PoD and PoI.  Most groups I know of, unless they aren't going very far from zin, will take a gater.  This allows them to continue exp'ing until the point when the group has to change hands or break up.  Also an evac'ing group has a much improved turn-around time, which can be nice if you just cleared your way to that sweet spot.  Basic Dungeon 101, man, basic Dungeon 101 on speed.<br>
<br>
Point 9).  Seems to me all the classes have this problem.<br>
<br>
Point 10).  Get SCF and SCFM.  Now that I crit alot, I find that peeps remember me.. and thus I get more groups.  SCM helps out as well. <p>Master Orakkus Mu'Hadeeb<br>

<br>
once i have more time, illl get into this thread more. though i should say your points, orakk, are pretty much all wrong/deluded.<br>
<br>
also, as far as wiz exp on raids... if you can get it, you earned it. as long as you dont ping pong/die/memblur (all which mess up the raid), you are doing the most damage. we dont get exp because we are wizards, we get it because we do the most damage. on any lesser raid mob where getting exp is an issue (i.e. mobs that dont require strats), wizards generally do more than any other class and thats why they get exp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luxum>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Dark Elf Admirer<BR>Juju Incantatrix</span><br>  Posts: 1293<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/18/02 7:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Declining Enjoyment in Playing a Wizard (10 issues)</span><hr size=1> Hello?

<br>
achieving high DPS (without gaining agro) is a skill. this is why i can KS a higher lvl wiz that me. i have to work quite hard on every mob pulled to achieve my max DPS. if i, or any other 6 people on the raid can do that job better than any other 6 people, they get the reward of exp.<br>
<br>
buffing, debuffing, and autoattacking (trash mobs) can be done half awake (which is a great benefit for people on raids =p). it takes a wizards/mages/even sometimes druids full attention to do (near) max DPS without agro.<br>
<br>
the only other jobs that require any attention are MT, MH, puller, and CC. but its ok, cause when the war, monk, chanter and cleric wake up the shammy and rog after the raid to go form an exp group, i wont feel too bad watchin them head off while i TL the raid out.<br>
<br>
plus, full raid exp sucks. i personally think its better to give the best DPSers, who will be stuck LFG after the raid, decent exp, instead of giving everyone crap exp just so the shammys can see a yellow line of text for debuffing a mob or the 5th warrior for hitting autoattack and remembering not to hit taunt.<br>
<br>
&quot;we deserve to KS an entire raid just because we did the most damage. &quot;<br>

seems like the definition of KS to me =p<br>

So the shamies don't lose xp on a raid?<br>
<br>
The problem with raid xp is that it halves the xp, then shares it out over the 30ish members of the raid.<br>
<br>
Do you want to be balanced as &quot;oh, well, is it ok for wizards to suck, after all they get raid xp&quot;?<br>

<br>
Rogues, who do constant DPS, but get less XP than this DPS should give, deserve to pickpocket mobs.  The effort involved in keeping aggro on the main tank deserves this reward.<br>
<br>
Enchanters, who die alot on raids, deserve to be able to mem blur mobs and have their group volley KS the mob.  I mean, the effort required for CC deserves this reward.<br>
<br>
I know that things benefitting you are clearly balanced, but please look beyond this.<br>
<br>
The problem with raid xp is that it doesn't just share the xp over the raid -- it destroys xp, and then shares it over the raid.<br>

<br>
1 shammy may die once slowing a big boss mob. other than that, its not too dangerous being a shammy =p. they can go root dot 4 things for half a mana bar after the raid and be good as new =p<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you want to be balanced as &quot;oh, well, is it ok for wizards to suck, after all they get raid xp&quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
you really think VI think about things when they try and balance us? =p they use a blind fold and a dart board. i say we take what we can get =p<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Rogues, who do constant DPS, but get less XP than this DPS should give, deserve to pickpocket mobs. The effort involved in keeping aggro on the main tank deserves this reward.&quot;<br>
<br>
a lot of rogs can easily KS me if im not doing above average wiz DPS and in most cases 2 rogs &gt; 1 wiz. also, an evade hotkey != effort =p. rogs can do the highest DPS for the least effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Enchanters, who die alot on raids, deserve to be able to mem blur mobs and have their group volley KS the mob. I mean, the effort required for CC deserves this reward.&quot;<br>
<br>
i agree, chanters get shafted for the work they do on some raids. though its usually just the main one that dies =p. i often request or put myself in the main chanters group just so i can get them exp and help keep them alive. i lub chanters. however exp groups lub them too, so they dont need too much lub from me =p.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The problem with raid xp is that it doesn't just share the xp over the raid -- it destroys xp, and then shares it over the raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
oh, i agree. if the full raid exp was decent, id be fine with it. but for what it is now, it takes away exp i earn from raids (and the fun of KS wars =p) in return for a yellow text message for all raiders that has no effect on their exp bars, but makes them feel all special.<br>
<br>
<br>
i dont mind decent exp for all, but if its either decent exp for me, or suck exp for all, im not gonna feel sad that the lvl 51 warrior isnt getting exp when im doing 4k+ a mob.<br>
<br>
btw, ive been up for 24+ hours and am pretty sick plus am on drowsy meds.. so things arent flowing all that well in my head atm, so lemme know if something doesnt make sense (because it very well could be the case) =p<br>

<br>
all raiders are not inherently equal =p, though i dont mind everyone getting even, decent exp. however, if its either the ones that do the most damage get all, or everyone gets crap, i think its justified that the best DPS group on the raid gets the exp.<br>
<br>
<br>
and on one of my last sane thoughts before i go to bed... were kinda derailing this thread. this was one of the more trivial of the 10 points.. of which all carry merit.<br>

This is just damn riduculous. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101939"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Atri Drumrunner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqdiva.com/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkblue;">Virtuoso</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkblue;">Erollisi Marr</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=191240"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Cameiel Stormgate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkred;">Sorcerer</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.pendragons.org/everquest/"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:darkred;">Pendragon Society</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enoah35>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/19/02 5:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wizs sigh</span><hr size=1> I agree 100% with Atri. Since its similar case myself. The guild I am in most of them are eighther Baz whore or OLS (online sleeping) when ever I log. Forces me to kite (single) in PoN for the exp. Since in PoV there are at LEAST! 5wiz lfg I hardly gonna get any kind of group at all. Forming group like people suggested is one thing but hey... all lfg are eighther Rogue, enchanter, wizards. Yes the Ks teams who cleared the trials with ease. Kiting is boring as hell... and considering PoN pathing and sudden add is riddiculous I do not enjoy much. I have tryed PoD ended up with a pull of 6 ( rooted all and evaced since no exodus : ( ) I am admitted as a fast good dpsed member in guild... yet not many people feels the same way. People who ooc are always looking for TANK, SLOWER (shaman most of the time), CLERIC, and finally ENCHANTER. Same situation when I was lfg in DL. Its sad really to see in every expantion that only the holy trinity lives, and desired much in groups.<br>
<br>
With one exception of being invited in groups was HAH trials. Thats the only tell I have EVER received. Sure I have helped them but being 63 most, if not all of the mobs in there are light blue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I like to be social so kiting is my option to get exp but gets tiresome pretty quick. Besides all my AA and lvl are obtained via groups and I am proud with that... and continue to do that way. The only group I have disliked was AoE group. Call me stupid, loser but thats what I felt.<br>

That could pretty much be said by any class that's been nerfed. Although I am finding it increasingly humorous that the same tanks that pissed, bitched and moaned about having to pay 100K for their epic pieces because of MB Wizs taking over the Kunark mobs, are now the ones pissing, bitching and moaning about wanting to roll on parchments so they can sell spells in the Bazaar for 40-60K <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway guess that's another thread.<br>
<br>
One point you make I'd like to expand on is:<br>
&quot;6) decline in usefulness of Translocates and Ports due to PoK and Nexus portals<br>
This decreases my enjoyment by... eliminating the need for a major skill upon which my class is built. I have a whole spellbook filled with TLs and gates whose value was reduced dramatically the second PoP and SoL hit the shelves. Ease of transportation was a MAJOR reason I chose to be a Wizard. If I were to start again today, it wouldn't even be a consideration. I feel duped.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately. Why you ask? Well it kind of ties in to my first little ramble. I'm L57 and have amassed not a bad, guess that's relative, amount of coin - around 60K. I've gotten all my spells thru 59 and all the vendor sold 60 ones. I've been in the bazaar looking at getting some of the 60 drop ones and when I see prices in the 20-50K range I think &quot;good lord I'll never be able to buy them let alone the 61+&quot;. I've been thinking about what it is we as Wizzys can do for money.<br>
<br>
Chanters routinely sit in Nexus and make 100pp per head for casting KEI. Wouldn't take too long, and their sure seems like enough customers, for a Chanter to afford those 20K spells.  Clerics, at least on my server, have taken up regular residence in GY of the planes and make 50-100pp or higher per rez. Mages summon a ton of focus items and sell them pretty fast and for anywhere from 10-50pp depending on the item (again at least on my server). What about Wizzys, and for that matter melees, Necs, &amp; Druids these days. What can we do to make cash?  Well it used to be ports but I'm finding more and more either people don't need them or they aren't offering much for them (we won't even talk about the folks that want a port and offer 3pp saying &quot;I could just use the PoP portals but I'm lazy).<br>
<br>
So I guess your #6 point also brings out the issue with we and Druids making good amounts by porting anymore  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This isn't class envy either. I just wonder who the geniuses are in VI/SoE that don't see the large discrepencies of having some classes with an almost innate ability to make cash quickly and the rest of the classes. /shrug just my whacky mind working overtime <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
A couple of questions regarding this statement<br>
<br>
1) Does hitting the concussion spell gem = effort then?  Have you actually played a raiding level rogue to know what all is involved in their maintaining their DPS?  Its a lot more than hitting evade every time it pops up.<br>
<br>
2) Wizards have often been heard to complain that their sustainable DPS is too low to make them desirable in exp groups.  Yet you are implying that, if you are on the ball, you outdamage a rogue, possibly even 2 of them.  So are you saying you would think it balanced if wizards did the same sustained DPS as a rogue AND could outdamage them 2 to 1 when desired?<br>

<br>
in no way is it the same and to think so is idiotic. first off, again, were talking about trash mobs, which dont require the tactics that boss mobs do, generally. secondly, on these mobs, yes, rogs stay opposite the MT and hit their hotkeys when they pop. thirdly, have you ever played a wizard? to achieve max DPS, you have to pick what spells to use and when to use them (always better to lead with a big nuke after you know the general agro limits, lead with a rain if resists and lack of adds allow it), you need to know to use concussion only when its needed based on time and raid agro (or you are wasting much DPS), and probably most importantly, you need to know your refresh time for all your spells and time the tflux/recast to as soon as possible without getting a 'didnt not refresh' message. you should always be casting something, chaining your spells as fast as possible, and you should never gain agro. one nuke can easily make the difference on exp or not, particularly if youre the only main damage dealer in your group.<br>
<br>
i just KSed a 30 person ixi raid when the cleric was purposely put in 'the exp group'. it died so fast i only had time for 4 spells. my 4 spells outdamaged a rog, 62 wiz, epic mage, monk and the MT.<br>
<br>
learn to operate at the best of your abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;2) Wizards have often been heard to complain that their sustainable DPS is too low to make them desirable in exp groups. Yet you are implying that, if you are on the ball, you outdamage a rogue, possibly even 2 of them. So are you saying you would think it balanced if wizards did the same sustained DPS as a rogue AND could outdamage them 2 to 1 when desired?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
are you saying rogues should have higher burst DPS than wizards?<br>
<br>
&quot;So are you saying you would think it balanced if wizards did the same sustained DPS as a rogue AND could outdamage them 2 to 1 when desired?&quot;<br>
<br>
when did i say that and what are you smoking?<br>
<br>
wizard burst DPS is, and should be, &gt; all. sustained rog DPS (provided not insane AC mobs) is, and should be, &gt; all.<br>
<br>
however, when did i mention balancing wizards?<br>

No one is intended to go solo trakanon, its still useful and every boss we hit we have people manaburning.<br>
<br>
2) Loss of crits on Manaburn<br>
Dunno why this was removed, I didn't/don't have a problem with manaburn crits<br>
<br>
3) Inability of epic buff to stack with BST mana regen spells<br>
Annoying I am sure, no argument here<br>
<br>
4) Inability to obtain Sunstrike, GSS, EER as well as other less desirable but useful high-end spells<br>
People get Sunstrike and EER, it may be hard for the very casual player but it is possible even if frustrating.  GSS is the only one I dont see becoming commonplace for 6 months or more.  THO drops EER and hes not all that anymore.<br>
<br>
5) Relative availability of comparable Druid nukes (Moonfire) and Mage nukes (FoT)<br>
Its all about the ratio, 95%+ of mages are conj spec'd and the FoT is a bolt...miss one and your ratio/efficency goes right out the window.  I can speak to the druid one.<br>
<br>
6) Decline in usefulness of Translocates and Ports due to PoK and Nexus portals<br>
Well this may be true, and I am not saying it is, anything that makes transportation availible to the masses is a good thing imo.  I still see people asking for TL/Ports all the time instead of waiting 15 min or so on nexus or running around looking for the right pedestal.  Its all about convienence, wiz/druid ports will always be more convienent assuming there is one near you.  But what happens to that non-porter if they are not there?  Well for the longest time they were stuck walking and taking boats.<br>
<br>
7) Decline in usefulness of Evacs in PoP due to graveyards<br>
How so...there is a zone in evac, Succor or something? (not a porting class sorry)  I havent seen anyone picked for a group specifically to be an evac since kunark era.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Nerf to quadding due to new aggro (such as in CS)<br>
I cannot comment, I could never quad =P<br>
<br>
9) Raid exp system eliminating extra Wizard exp on raids<br>
WTF lol.  That is a pure 100% selfish whine right there.  You think the other 50 people on that raid are there so you can get &quot;extra Wizard xp&quot;?<br>
<br>
10) Inability to find a role in traditional exp groups<br>
Well while I can sympathize with your case, all pure damage classes are having group issues atm.  You could also start your own or get a group of friends/guildmates to xp with regularly. <p><hr>
