Grim, I still don't remember GZ saying any such thing. I don't have any source for him saying that other than your claims, which, to be honest, I have very little faith in these days.<br>
<br>
&gt;A quest should be challenging but possible for a group of the correct level without detailed maps and a dungeon packed wall to wall by players. <br>

Why? I know of quite a few quests that requiure raid level forces in order to accomplish. There is no magic rule that says what you claim there, and there are plenty of counter-examples. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Um, Illusion: Iksar is level 20. And you have to kill level 25ish mobs in dangerous areas to complete it, probably beyond the abilities of your average level 20 enchanter solo. You have yet to prove that GZ said Concussion was intended for level 39 wizards. While it is on record that spells significantly below your level get a fizzle and channeling bonus.<br>

Are those quotes authoritative enough for you? Honestly, Concussion has been discussed many times on Graffe's, and this mythical Fanfaire statement has only cropped up in the past couple years from your mouth, after GZ had moved on from EQ to EQ2.<br>

Hmm yes, level 20 group... level 25 group... pretty close yep.<br>
<br>
Level 39 group... level 50+ group... not very close.<br>
<br>
This is just silly guys, you are clinging desparately to something with no logical or factual basis, why on earth would you do such a thing?  I've laid out clearly why the quest is a mess, why the spell is the right level, why a level 50 spell makes no sense based on their ability to lower fizzle rates and other spells that fall under the same &quot;need to cast&quot; level.<br>
<br>
And lastly, guess what the chance of fizzling is at the level you get a spell and have your skill maxed?  5%.  Thats FIVE percent.  How much difference do you believe levels above that makes?  Since nobody at Verant ever said any such thing about it being done so on purpose, why on earth do you cling to this invention? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adonborealis>Adon Borealis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1081<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/03 2:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: dispelling more rumors</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;I would guess that they wanted to foster class interdependence.

Fair enough, but none of the other quest spells from Kunark require a specific class ability to do...you only need someone to charm for the wizard spell quest. Gordon was/is a tool.  They should have fixed this quest years ago, or it should never have gone live as is.<br>

Now that g-flux is nerfed, its way past time to fix the quest.<br>

Heh, you try doing the Illusion:Iksar quest with a level 25 group.

The fact remains that Kunark introduced a questable spell for a i belive every class. Out of thouse the wizard one is considerably above the difficulty bar. (The shaman one is too, but they get an upgrade to the spell so dont bother doing it mostly, unless your saying canni 2 is aimed at 50+ charicters for channeling reasons too?)<br>

I have helped two enchanters get it and none of us were over level 25.  Oops, guess your theory of how it works is off base.  That quest is a bit harder than the reward, but lets assume you are true, and use your logic.<br>
<br>
Illusion: Iksar is so valuable and powerful that although it is a level 20 spell, the game designers made the quest intentionally too hard for an appropriate level group to get.  Why?  Because they didn't want you to fizzle the incredibly powerful and useful Illusion spell?  Or was it because they were boneheads when they did this quest?  Which makes more sense <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>to YOU</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>*knocks head against the wall*. Who the hell is clinging to things with no factual basis here? I provided references and verifiable facts, what have you provided?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What references and facts???  I just outlined how the spells work and why this is an absurd allegation, give me a break.  All you've said is &quot;I'm sure a designer said it was this way.&quot;  If you're going to just abjectly ignore my quote of what GZ said, I'll abjectly ignore your claim about this.<br>
<br>
-Concussion is a level 39 spell<br>
-Spells can be designed to have an easier or harder fizzle rate<br>
-Your Chanelling skill maxes at 200 below level 51<br>
-Quest designs are often messed up<br>
-Spell levels are NEVER messed up (although they did give Mages acumen for a while by accident).<br>
-You will only fizzle the average spell at a rate of 5%, so the bonus for being higher level is going to be incredibly minimal at best.<br>
-If it were a case of it actually mattering, and the spell was deemed so important that you should get it only many levels after 39, why isn't that true of any other spell that is useful?<br>
-If this above was true, why isn't Jolt the same way, since it has the same purpose?<br>
<br>
There's no evidence for and too much logic and evidence against the &quot;it was intentionally too hard to get&quot; theory.  Just let it go guys.<br>

<br>
OK let me help you out with some game knowledge you seem to be lacking.  Some spells are specifically designed to be more difficult to cast.  Some are designed to be easier to cast.  For example, the Atol's Spirit Shackles has a higher fizzle rate, by design.  On the other hand, the Beastlord cold blasts are designed with a lower fizzle rate.  However, the average spell, unadjusted, according to the game designers, has a 5% chance of fizzling.  That's no joke, I'm sorry if you don't particularly like it.<br>
<br>
Here's GZ on Fizzle rates:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You will learn skills much quicker with a high intelligence level compared to someone with low intelligence. Intelligence also reduces the chance of spell fizzles. Intelligence over 75 reduces fizzle rate by 1% for each point over 75. Minimum is 5%. [from GZ]<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies the chance to fizzle check is the appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, etc.), your character's Intelligence, the difficulty of the spell, and the level of the spell. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spells have a toughness rating, so that some are less difficult to cast than others.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  &lt;when he wrote this, it was before Kunark, and none were more difficult to cast at the time, since then spells have been added&gt;.<br>
<br>
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This is adjusted by your skill and INT, and the toughness rating of the spell. If your INT is greater then 75 the chance of fizzle is reduced by 1% for every point of your statistic above 75. Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (a Wizard gets 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that he had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling.<br>
<br>
Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after a caster gets Bind Affinity, he will be able to max out Alteration for that spell, and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. Higher Intelligence will also help with this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Here's GZ on Fizzle rates:<br>

<br>
Heh, I was going to use that quote to prove 5% was the minimum fizzle rate, but I chose not to use it because it's from December 1999 (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=591">reference</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->), 4 months before Kunark release, and considering the Alteration and Evocation skills do not go up after level 46, fizzle calculations have to be done differently after level 50. Anyway, yes, chance to fizzle can be reduced by your primary casting stat, but in the case of level 51+ spells it doesn't seem to work nearly as well as that quote claims.  In this case, actual in-game experience should probably be taken over quotes from GZ.<br>
<br>
As for fizzle ratings: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=752&amp;source=Live">Concussion</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has a fizzle adjust of 25, while<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1631&amp;source=Live">Atol's</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has a fizzle adjust of 5. So if Concussion was a level 51 spell like Jolt, guess what, it would fizzle <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than Atol's does. It would fizzle like <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1627&amp;source=Live">Abscond</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->!<br>

Sheesh, you're talking to me like I don't understand the spell system. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=681.topic&amp;index=7">Read this post</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

I agree, consistency makes sense.  Which is why there's no logic to your bizarre attempts to defend the position of Concussion's quest being deliberately made higher level because its so important they wanted you to fizzle less.  Illusion:Iksar hardly fits that, does it?  But that's what you'd have us believe, that they're both done that way.  There's a basic flaw with that position, I'm sure you can see.<br>

Oh, my mistake, I thought you meant &quot;facts that actually support my position&quot; not &quot;facts that I posted at some time in the past.&quot;<br>
<br>
What have you said wrong?  You mean other than &quot;Concussion and Jolt came out at the same time&quot; or &quot;...you're a big fat liar Grim.&quot;  When you were pretending that spells didn't have a base 5% fizzle rate.  Take your pick.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Concussion has a fizzle adjust of 25, the highest fizzle rating spells are ever given.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And your point here is what?  That they deliberately made it fizzle a lot then made it intentionally only available realistically at level 50+ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>so it won't fizzle as much then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->????  I mean, try to be a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>little</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> logical here.  <br>
<br>
However, you might want to look at those fizzle numbers a bit more closely: Atol's Spirit Shackles (intentionally designed to fizzle more and fizzles a LOT more) is a 5, Concussion is a 25, and the first level Frost Bolt spell is a 25.  So your interpretation is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>backwards</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, spells with a higher number cast easier.  I know that's kind of wierd, but in my experience it plays out.  I almost never fizzle concussion, and I fizzle atol's quite a bit.  Even over 5 levels past the time I got it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So the spell was intentionally built to fizzle less, like they are capable of doing with the code.  Like I've been saying they could do if they wanted you to fizzle less.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'll give you that.

<br>
That's only evidence that it hasn't been fixed yet, not that it doesn't need to be.  Some quests put in the game in beta only got fixed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this year</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  And there's problems for appropriate-leveled people to do the quest if they have to use an exploit, detailed maps, and hope that Kunark is heavily camped.<br>
<br>
But let's assume your statement is true as it stands &quot;there just doesn't seem to be a problem for appropriately-leveled people doing the quest.&quot;  Doesn't that sort of ruin your entire argument, that it was made intentionally harder?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I could bring up the magician epic here, designed for level 51-60 while being a level 46 spell....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

And it would be meaningless, since your level 59 AA abilities are level 1 spells.  Levels for effects like that are arbitrary, they aren't related to the actual spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Jolt has a fizzle rating of 0. Jolt casts faster than Concussion, plus rangers get innate spell haste on detrimental spells.

<br>
You mean a higher fizzle rate?  Yeah, that's a critical difference, but not one that helps you.  Remember our lesson from Atols above?  Lower = more fizzles.  But even if Jolt was designed to fizzle less, that only supports the truth: that to keep spells from fizzling as much, they adjust the numbers in spell design, not arbitrarily make the quest too difficult by half.  Again, why isn't Jolt done the same way?  Because Jolt is intended to be for the level they got it... just like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>every other spell in the game including Concussion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

those spells are intentionally designed to be harder to fizzle.  As noted below in GZ's explaination of how fizzle rates work.  And I have said repeatedly.

Nope thats just icing on the cake.  The evidence in the game, experience with the company, the spell system, and logic all force the issue; that and your lack of 'documentation' and lack of logic as well as game mechanics.

I've step by step pulled apart all your attempts at defending this theory, why on earth would anyone cling to it I cannot imagine.<br>

Concussion is a level 39 spell with a level 51+ quest.  Taunting through walls (assuming it works - didn't work for our SK), training guys off the 2nd floor, and Grav Flux are all frowned on exploits that allow you a chance of doing the quest at the level the spell was intended for. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/18/03 8:11:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaman>Qaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 3150<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 8:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: oops)</span><hr size=1> &gt;Concussion is a level 39 spell with a level 51+ quest.<br>

They didn't make it fizzle a lot. That's the standard fizzle rating for any non-evocation wizard spell before level 50, which is easily dealt with by being above that level, which has the added function of making the spell easier to channel.<br>

So your interpretation is backwards, spells with a higher number cast easier. I know that's kind of wierd, but in my experience it plays out. I almost never fizzle concussion, and I fizzle atol's quite a bit. Even over 5 levels past the time I got it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Um, no, exactly wrong. Higher means more fizzles. Remember the patches that lowered the fizzle difficulty of many level 51-60 spells? Because clerics and wizards were complaining about high fizzle rates despite maxed skills? The only field that changed was what Lucy calls the fizzle adjust, and they were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lowered</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

The magician epic quest results in a no-drop spell scroll, which has to be scribed to be used.

I would think that would be clear evidence that the spell was intended for higher levels than can actually scribe it. This is not an AA skill, this is a quest spell with a scroll you must scribe.

<br>
You mean a higher fizzle rate? Yeah, that's a critical difference, but not one that helps you. Remember our lesson from Atols above? Lower = more fizzles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Um, wrong again. All the level 39-49 nuke spells have lower fizzle ratings, and always have, because at the time you didn't go above 50 to get the level-based fizzle deduction.

Hmm either I'm being unclear or you're being obtuse.  I didn't say &quot;all Kunark spell quests were for level 39 spells&quot; nor even remotely imply that.  I said by your logic, Illusion: Iksar must be too hard to get for the level <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>because its so critical that it doesn't fizzle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> which is your entire argument for why Concussion is too hard to get for a level 39 spell.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Concussion and Jolt did come out at the same time, give or take a week.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So by &quot;the same time&quot; you actually meant &quot;two weeks apart&quot; then.  OK.  See, I said &quot;significantly apart&quot; which meant &quot;a separate time period of subjective time.&quot;  I thought it was longer than 2 weeks but then, at the rate of patches at that time it probably FELT longer than 2 weeks.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They didn't make it fizzle a lot.

<br>
I know they didn't, that's my entire point.  But you were making the argument that it had a higher fizzle rate than Atols (a well-known, notoriously high fizzle rate spell).  The conclusion is obvious: the number makes it fizzle more.  That makes your entire argument blow up, yet again, since they wouldn't make it fizzle extra then make it harder to get just so you wouldn't fizzle it as much.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Um, no, exactly wrong.  Higher means more fizzles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I agree that makes logical sense.  But Atols has a lower number and fizzles MUCH more than spells of the same level with higher fizzle numbers.  QED.<br>
<br>

<br>
First off, your argument is regarding higher level for fizzle rates, which has zero application here.  Second, the epic is given an arbitrary level, since you cannot begin your epic quest at level 46.  Thus, it is simliar to the AA skills, which were just assigned a level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Um, no. Here, the patch message from January 23, 2002 in which Atol's casting difficulty was reduced (the second time this happened btw, oh ye of short memory), the January 8 2002 spdat, and the January 23 2002 spdat.<br>
Open them both up with EqCaster v5.2.4 (later versions don't understand the old spdat format), see that the &quot;Fizzle Percent&quot; was changed from 15 to 5, and eat your words.[/quote]<br>
<br>
We all remember the fizzle rate got lower, but it STILL fizzles much more than other spells which list at a higher fizzle number - so we can't exactly learn anything from this can we?  There's either something else involved that isn't showing up, or the numbers aren't as simple as you are saying.<br>
<br>
Either way the argument stands: the spell wasn't made a level 39 spell and quested at 50+ just to keep you from fizzling as much.  Jolt would have been too if that were the case.<br>
<br>

<br>
Or the system isn't as simple as LUCY is giving you information about.  Which is more likely, given the evidence?  That spells don't have a minimum 5% fizzle rate any more or the fizzle information in Lucy is incomplete?  You decide.<br>
