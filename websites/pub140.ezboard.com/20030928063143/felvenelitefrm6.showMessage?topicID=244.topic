The well beaten path beneath the beautiful trees of Greater Faydark has witnessed countless travelers over the years.  Today, however, each step the half elf took towards Kelethin, brought him closer to a new tomorrow... so he hoped.  A mixture of anticipation and fear wormed into his very soul as the tree city slowly faded into view.  &quot;She better be right about this...&quot; Luldawen muttered under his breath as he approached the lift that lead to the treetops.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the monstrous platform lowered to the ground, Luldawen turned slightly to keep the Priest of Discord in his sight.  Momentarilly envisioning an arrow, crafted by his very own hands, pierce the heart of the dispicable creature, the ranger quickly shook off the idea and stepped on the platform.  After all, he would be no better than the Priest.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But I can still dream, can't I?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he chuckled to himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Activating the platform to again rise to Kelethin, he glanced at his horses and the young Feir'dal he had left them in care of.  The child still counting the mountain of coins he'd been paid quickly waved to Luldawen, assuring the ranger that his horses would be taken care of.  Luldawen nodded to himself, his instincts telling him that his horses and goods were safe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Luldawen moved quickly to the Heartwood Tavern, which was near the lift.  He passed by dozens of elves along the way, those who made eye contact greeting him with a smile.  A number of other races were present too, including a few half elves like himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon entering the tavern, the ranger quickly scanned the room and found his target.  Strolling silently to her and taking a seat, she slid a tankard of mead to him.  &quot;You're late.&quot; She said matter-of-factly as she sipped on her elven wine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grabbing the mead, Luldawen gulped it down before defending himself.  &quot;You know very well that those damned Combine Spires take their sweet time when good people like myself are in a hurry.  And no, to your next question...&quot; which had already began to form on her lips.  &quot;I didn't take the Planes books to here because I had my packhorses with me.  It would've left them behind.&quot;  And with that, he finished of the mead and signalled to the bartender for another.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;... Sorry...&quot; he began as Saelinye cut him off, &quot;You don't have to apologize.  I know how difficult it is for you to come here.&quot;  He nodded thoughtfully as she continued, &quot;There's no possible way for me to fully understand what it is that you are going through, but I do have a clue.  You are half human, not fully part of the elven race, nor part of the human race.  I am Teir'dal, although fully elven by blood, still reviled and hated because of the sins of my kind.&quot;  She paused a moment, allowing the half elf to collect his thoughts.  &quot;But there is hope, my friend.  If I can overcome these burdens,&quot; at which time she waved at Barkeep Manlawen, who amiably waved back, &quot;then I'm confident that you can as well.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Silent contemplation engulfed the ranger for a moment before he spoke.  &quot;You are right, I believe that I am strong enough to overcome these obstacles.  I didn't pack up all my belongings for nothing and I do not wish to return to Qeynos.  Too many rats as of late.&quot;  He added and smiled.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Raising his eyes to meet those of Saelinye, he said, &quot;I am truly honored to have a friend such as you.  And with Karana's blessings, I'll be deemed worthy to join you in the Elven Elite.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smiling with reassurance, she replied, &quot;Now that's the kind of conviction that I've come to respect in you, Luldawen.&quot;  She glanced behind him as the doors of the Heartwood Tavern opened.  &quot;Prepare yourself, the Officer's council approaches.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Saelinye rose to her feet and smiled a greetings.  Luldawen followed suit and dropped to one knee in submission.  &quot;Greetings, I am Luldawen Fletcher, a Ranger of 56 Seasons.  I hail from Qeynos and am an aspiring grandmaster in Fletching.  My bow is yours to command, if you'll have me.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luldawen>Luldawen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/27/03 12:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luldawen Fletcher, 56th Ranger of Karana at your service</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Greetings Mother, <br>
<br>
I hope is all well in Qeynos.  I trust this letter will find you in haste, for the Antonican Bard system is still responsible as ever.  My deepest apologies for not visiting more often, but my adventures as of late have been quite time consuming.  I know the opening of the Plane of Knowledge is reason enough for me return home from time to time but it has also given me additional places to explore.<br>
<br>
All is well here in Kelethin, I live amongst the trees and elves such as your ancestors have done for centuries before you.  I've gotten used to the day to day activities here, especially the local vermin, orcs.  However, they're just as fragile as the gnolls of Blackburrow and fall easily enough to my blades.  There's a representative from our cousins in Neriak amidst the orcs, and I've seeked out and spoken with this dark creature.  He shouldn't be harming younger adventurers for some time to come.<br>
<br>
The guild that I'm applying to has been most kind and open to me, however I'm finding difficulty in arranging outtings with them due to my untimely schedule.  However, I've been blessed to have grouped with them on two different occassions and marvel at the wonderful dynamic that this group shares.<br>
<br>
My first group was adventuring in the Plane of Nightmares, destroying Terris-Thule's perversions of Mother Tunare.  Horrible, disfigured treants, ravens, and spiders were our target and the group was extremely capable at carrying out its task.  It was a unique group, however, because there was no cleric in the group!  Instead two beastlords, a monk, and a warrior were battling the cursed creatures.  Nalitra, the highest of the two beastlords was taking the hits from our foes, as her warder, Udderly and his warderor, along with the fists of Lukmok, and the sword of Malluil aided.  I joined in, lending my blades and bow to the battles, as well as the gifts of magical healing and attack boosting that Karana has bestowed upon me.  As you have probably guessed, there are no Elven monks or Elven beastlords on Norrath, and my companions, save Malluil, were not Elven by birthright.  It's a testament to the inclusion of different races working in harmony within the Elven Elite.<br>
<br>
Weeks later, another opportunity has presented itself before me to group with members of the Elven Elite.  Opposed to last time, a larger raiding force had been gathered to slay the largest of the Storm Giants in the Plane of Storms.  As I arrived to the designated battleground, I was immediately greeted by the Elven Elite there and invited into a group with Kallren, Nanbkek, Tristairn, Udderly, and Saelinye.  Of those names, only Saelinye should sound familar, she is my sponsor and support for joining this band of adventurers.  Never before had I felt so in awe with those surrounding me.  There was so much physical and magical strength around that it could be felt in every breath I took.  A collection of priests, melee , and hybrids classes such as myself engaged the lesser giants, and finished with one of their leaders, Solnebk the Unruly.  It's absolutely amazing to see what this group can accomplish.  And what's even more astounding is that the Elven Elite is part of a larger collective, called the Gathering of Banners.  This coalition has brought many of the all powerful gods to their knees!<br>
<br>
I have still not been accepted into the Elven Elite, but my hopes are high.  I see many of their members in passing, and am still intimidated to greet them properly.  Perhaps that is a weakness I must begin to resolve.<br>
<br>
My thoughts are with you as always, and I hope this letter finds you in good health.<br>
Your son,<br>
Luldawen<br>
<br>
PS. It's been a lonely few weeks here, occasionally adventuring with complete strangers or braving unchartedlands alone.  You will be the first to hear the good news!  I've recently been graced with my 57th level.<br>
<br>
PSS. Do you remember that cursed griffon I always complain about in Iceclad?  Well, the complaints will now stop for I've put an end to his miserable existance and the gnomes of Iceclad have rewarded with me with the Eyepatch of Plunder.  I'm happy and relieved to have finished such a ridiculously long quest.  I'll never look at snow the same again!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=244.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=244.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm6>Membership Applications</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
