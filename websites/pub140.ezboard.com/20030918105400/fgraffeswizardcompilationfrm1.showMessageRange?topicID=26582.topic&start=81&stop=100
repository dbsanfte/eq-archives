I love how the mages on this thread insist that no one will mind about this pet, and then attack the people who CLEARLY FUCKING MIND.<br>
<br>
The sad thing is that the people you're attacking are generally big proponents of mages getting nice upgrades. That doesn't, and shouldn't, mean a slavish acceptance of any damn fool idea the dev team comes up with, though. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-gear.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/18/03 10:13:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zuratuli>Zuratuli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 10:08 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: thought you should hear it from a mage first</span><hr size=1> I crunched some numbers... If the new pet nukes at the same frequency as the last one its potential nuking dps is about an average of 1400% higher. Even if the pet runs oom very soon it doesn't matter because the pet will have already done 1400% more dps than it would have anyways via nukes when you factor in the damage per mana required for each spell. The dramatic increased damage of the nuke the pet got (Flame Shock was 110 damage... Now its line up for getting a 1120 damage nuke... huh??) only means it will use its mana up quicker and still more efficiently which means higher overall dps as well as burst dps.<br>

<br>
Ok, I&quot;ve *USED THESE PETS ON TEST*, ok?<br>
Right: they suck suck SUCK for sustained damage, guess I should do a log and post it. They have *NPC* AI, they will occasionally IC/Draught of Fire the hell out of a mob, blast it to bits...then spend next three mobs meleeing and rooting/snaring. It's extremely random. As a mage I find them hysterically funny, but, beside fun factor, on a raid they would *BLOW GOATS*.<br>
<br>
1) Root is bad, indescribably bad on a pet at higher lvls, its nice soloing with a true earth pet, but in a group or raid...do I need to say how *** up a pet would be casting high lvl wiz roots, hm? :/ And solo I need DEPENEDABLE roots, that an earth pet casts continually every few ticks *guaranteed*.<br>
<br>
2) mages want a *sustainably damaging pet*. I don't want to have to p-ss around so I can get it to cast *useful* spells continually, jeez!  Make the blasted pet a *MAGE* so it just casts Char, Shock of Swords and Malosi. NPC mages have restricted spell line ups unlike wizzies: Fire/Magic DD, Debuff, so they dotn root/snare.  If that's ALL it casts, either doing damage or a usefull debuff, wahooo, great!<br>
<br>
3) Fire pets have *CRAP* for hit points, the 62 water has about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&lt;=</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->3k hp, go test it see how quick it does. Then go check 63 fire..it dies even *faster*, ok? Fire pets can't tank for buttons, that's never what they are used for, up to lvl 49 pet, their huge damage shield is used to let mobs beat themselves to death on them. Unless a pet had a 200+hp Damage Shield it would be no use at high lvl because mobs would flatten the pet in about 10 seconds. The 63 fire pet WITH O'Kiels and its own innate DS that, hurray! it casts again, has a total DS of 67 hp. <br>
  So the 63 pet *cannot be used to tank*. it also melees like crap: 58 hp max damage versus 81 hp of other pets.<br>
<br>
4) Ok example of 2 of those pets killing the Seb Protector: er how many hps does Seb protector have anyway: 20k? if you had two 62 Water Pets on it's back, 90+ DPS (old world mob and pets would have proc weapons, base 70-90 DPS on Tier 2 mobs), they would do 21,600+ hp or so in those TWO MINUTES. See where I am going? Did anyone test the water 62 pets in SAME situation? maybe, perhaps...they'd kill it *faster* hm? <br>
<br>
5) This is decending to kindergarten levels <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually the fire pet was not tanking, it was a GM tanking so they could test the fire pet damage output.  Also the reference to the fire pet having near 4k hp is incorrect.  There was never actually a mention in the mage thread about pet having 3900hp.  The only quote that came close was this..<br>

I agree, it seems like the idea of IC is what is upsetting to most and I would have no problem if the nuke was replaced.  However, you need to keep in mind that this would be a lvl63 spell summoning a lvl60 pet that could cast a lvl49 spell.  Now more than likely this lvl63 mage is going to be raiding and hunting against 60+ mobs and I don't know about anyone else but I get enough resists using lvl 60 spells in BoT much less trying to land a lvl 49 spell. <br>
<br>
Now if the pet chaincasts IC and Draught of Fire nonstop(which I've never seen a pet or NPC chain cast) it would be putting out ~130dps which I think is too high and should be adjusted.  I have a feeling that when this pet is finally tuned and tested we're going to see it putting out around 80-90dps; this is about the same as the water pet damage output.  <br>
<br>
I know a lot of wizards feel that a pet who casts decent spells will be infringing on the wizard class.  If this pet is putting out the same sort of damage as any other pet, even if it is casting instead of melee, I can't possibly see it as overpowering or infringing on another class. <br>
<br>
The core issue here is that the 50+ fire pets, a supposed wizard pet, are clearly broken and have a damage output that is only a fraction of the other pets.  I think most parses of the 63 fire pet set its damage output at around 30-40dps.  If they add in spells that boost this to 80-90dps, inline with the other 60+ pets, I can't see how this is infringing on any other class.  Yes, at the moment the burst DPS of the 63 fire pet is around 130dps, but I have a feeling as more parses become available we're going to see that between melee and casting other spells its damage output is roughly the same as the rest of the mage pets.  Might the new pet need some tuning, yes; but as a mage I would like to see our 50+ fire pets made useful instead of being a waste of a spellbook slot.<br>

Wizards are known for their amazing armor class I suppose. And if your refering to our shield line of spells (like epic buff or Force Shield) then you don't know anything about them. In PoP zones epic buff lasts for 2 hits, sometimes 1. In tactics for example first hit destroys most of buff and then second hit finishes off the shield and we still take damage (depending on how hard the hit was). <br>
<br>
If we get doubled for 600 we still take around 400 damage, and when I'm getting attacked I die fast with epic buff up or not.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12921<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 10:22 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mage wizard pet</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know a lot of wizards feel that a pet who casts decent spells will be infringing on the wizard class.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Actually, I think a lot of wizards want mages to have pets cast decent spells.<br>

If the pet cast some nuke, let's call it Joojoo's Icy Dance of Death, and it did same damage as ice comet, same cast time, same re-cast time, this conversation wouldn't even be happening. But because it does, wizards have a whine for the week. Glad your happy.<br>
<br>
Now, great it casts all these nifty spells, let's look at some perks it doesn't get:<br>
<br>
- Can't choose what spells it uses. It just follows a set script and tends to be unpredictable. It might chain cast nukes, it might chain cast snares or roots, you just never know what them crazy elementals will do.<br>
<br>
- It doesn't benefit from focus effects. While you can use spells, songs, and items to increase your spells effectiveness and cost, a pet cannot.<br>
<br>
- Nukes stack well, a nuking pet also doesn't take up a group slot. So nobody is going to go looking for a pet to replace a real wizard. And you will happily conincide together blasting things into small itty bitty bits. It's not like, damn, there's a fire pet here, I CAN'T NUKE!<br>
<br>
- SOE wanted this pet to be a wizard, I dunno why they wanted it to be a wizard, but it is and has been quite awhile. I don't think we're going to sway them from this madness, but we can try to make the best of it. Now saying that, up till now, this pet has been pathetic. What is wrong with making it good ? If anything, the changes they've got listed only put it on par with our other pets and then only temporarily. This actually isn't far enough considering the pet cannot tank while our other pets can (water aint too great, but it'll last awhile if the mob is slowed). But I'll take what improvements I can get.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the arguments I've seen here sum up to: it uses our coolest looking nuke, that is sooooo unfair. That's gotta be the most shallow argument I've heard, especially considering how many folks have their spell effects turned off and messages gagged.<br>
<br>
As to the person who said it should cast spells appropriate for it's level... I totally agree! That would be awesome, then it could cast like Sunstrike, and ERR! (it's a level 60 wizard didn't ya know). No, of course I don't expect that, but then I wasn't the one suggesting it =P. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyraxis>pyraxis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 11:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: thought you should hear it from a mage first</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If we get doubled for 600 we still take around 400 damage, and when I'm getting attacked I die fast with epic buff up or not. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

When I get doubled for 600, I get doubled for 600. Weird. I'd love to have something that absorbs damage other than my *ass*. Oh wait, I do. It's called a pet. See how that works? Now, when my Ice Comet casting, 2500hp pet gets shredded in all of 8 hits (and that's just on Tier One), guess who doesnt have a (snare, root, fear, heal, mez, charm, blind, slow, paper bag over the mob's head, &quot;look what's that over there&quot;) to get away? Yeah....it ain't you. You have more than one of those things. Guess what else. Every other casting class has 2 or more also . Except a mage. We have none. And no, I don't count the &quot;use in one zone only&quot; level 63 mez or level 65 charm. 99% of all mages don't have those spells. That is not indicative of an average mage, however the average (insert your non-mage class here) does get those spells mentioned above.  <br>
<br>
I'd say that means....ZERO defense.<br>
<br>
Any non-mages bitching about this change should try playing a mage sometime. You can start at level 25 on test. I encourage everyone here to give it a try. That is if you can do more than snare...run...nuke...snare...run...nuke...<br>

<br>
First of all, this pet should not be a wizard and it should be a mage.   However, if it is going to be a wizard, I want these wizard spells and wizard attributes added to the pet.<br>
<br>
1)  It should get the naked hitpoints of a wizard of that level.  3900 hitpoints is WAY too high for a wizard of that level.  It should have the melee skills of a wizard too.<br>
<br>
2)  When summoned, it should come into the world without any mana.   When wizards get rezzed, they have no mana either.   Also, if pet get suspended -- it does not med.   Let it med up for a while before it is useable.  None of this re-claim energy re-summon tactics to get mana back for the pet.<br>
<br>
3)  I want Alter Plane Hate added to the spell list.  This alone should add some risk in using it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Go ahead and add Evac to Skyfire -- this one is popular too.<br>
<br>
4)  Remove the pillars spells and add a fire based Al-kabbor. Since it is an elemental wizard, it should not be too smart and it should use this spell.<br>
<br>
5) It can keep all the O'Keils.<br>
<br>
6)  Keep the roots and atols on it too.  This alone makes it worthless on raids.     <br>
<br>
7)  Given what just happened to Gravity flux, the pet should also cast this as often as possible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sitting aggro -- I think that if the pet is sitting and medding on a pull -- it should get the aggro just as a wizard would <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
9) Also, take off the pet restriction making it non-aggro on mobs.   Wizards don't get this benefit -- nor should they.<br>
<br>
10)  Finally -- the mana the pet uses to cast should be the MAGES mana.  And since it is using the mages mana -- the mage gets all the pets aggro to boot.<br>
<br>
I am sure, some other wizards here will have some other fun ideas to add.<br>

why is that ? <br>
<br>
its not the wizard class. we arnt getting nerfed . the pet is not casting our best nukes , its not even casting a great nuke . its casting a very old content nuke . <br>
<br>
would you feel better if it casted DoI or ISoS instead? or what if they just re named the nuke to something else. then it wouldnt be a wizard nuke and you would have no reason to complain . if you dont like it make a mage and play one.<br>
<br>

I see a much more important balance problem here.<br>
<br>
Wizards have supposedly 1 major advantage in nuking--  They can call upon Magic, Fire and Ice.  Of those, only Ice is rare among casters, being mostly the province of Shaman, Druids, and Beastlords.<br>
<br>
Wizards also hold a minor advantage with the ratio's of our spells, which is most pronounced with our Ice Nukes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Giving the Mage pet Ice comet not only gives Mages a valid solution for mobs that are resistant to Magic and Fire spells, but it also does so mana free.<br>
<br>
Observation:<br>
The last thing you want to see is a summoned Mage pet.  Every mage in the game practicaly immediatly summons a pet to help it... with a lucky set of rolls, you'd have the Mage's fire pet, the pet's fire pet, and the pet's pet's fire pet... gah, you think it through...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Solution:<br>
   Give Mage pets a set spell list that includes only the Fire based spells of wizards.  Let them Cast Draught of Fire, Pillar of Flame, and Tears of Solusk.  Let them also cast the various stuns, Atols(make sure it fizzles alot), and a Skin--leave out root, they have earth pets for this. Replace FireElemental Aura with Okeils. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And for real fun, have it TL the mage randomly and at random intervals....  <p><br>

Some of the old dinos here can confirm that people used to say it is 24 (when 20th nuke was awful), then it was 34, then it settled to 50 for about 9 months. Then Kunark came out and few months after that the rumor of 60 being the must level started. Then in Luclin it was about AA. Now with again increased cap in PoP, people are saying 65. Well, of course they are. That's how the game and population progresses.<br>
<br>
Think about it, levels+aa make characters more effective, so of course you 'need' to have them both to be most powerful.<br>
<br>
In reality, you don't need to be 50 or 60 or 65... you don't need to have AA or focus items or all high-end spells. It all depends what you compare yourself to. <br>
<br>
If you compare yourself to level 1 mage fresh out of char creation, being level 8 will make you look like machine of mass destruction. But if you are level 60 with casual gamer gear and are comparing yourself to 65th level mage with high-end gear... sure you will feel that you need those too to be more efficient than said mage. It's all about goals we set to ourselves and what we expect ourselves to compare to.<br>

That's the second time that the number of &quot;3900hp&quot; has come up and it's been shown that the fire pet has no where near this many hp.  3900hp is around what the epic pet has, and that's a lot compared to most of the other pets.

Pyraxis, look... don't complain what we got and what you don't have, you are a MAGE and we are WIZARDS thats clear enough don't ya think? Even the fact that the pet may have a small mana pool, when they go 00m they will still tank... means they STILL do some kind of dps. So if this goes live the pet can nuke significantly + they still tank if they go 00m + you can still nuke.<br>
<br>
If you really want ports + snare + root and nuke, eighther make a wizard or a druid. It will never go to mages. Thats called class difference. Repeating, the pet in test has:<br>
<br>
Tishans Discord<br>
Ice comet<br>
Atol's spectral shackels<br>
Pillar of Frost <br>
rend<br>
draught of fire<br>
root<br>
diamond skin<br>
arch shielding<br>
O'keils flickering flame<br>
ocassionally Fire elemental aura<br>
Lures<br>
<br>
And still melees (which hits the mobs btw even it has low max melee). Well I was also wondering if they cas't ice comet... they have casttime or not. Most of the time I have seen their spells were casted instantly. I will go with Rombus solution, looks very balanced and makes sence for mages having their lesser self as their companion.<br>
