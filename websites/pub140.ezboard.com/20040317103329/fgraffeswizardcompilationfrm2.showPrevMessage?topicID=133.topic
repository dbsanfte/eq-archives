I would say the CoM Skelly was the most troublesome for me.  It was quite funny, after hooking up with two other Wizards and a Bard, we kept on doing the Gravity Flux up there to the room and trying to clear it.      A couple of the times, we had to zone because there was a lot of mobs.    After that group disbanded I managed to get together a group  that consisted of a Cleric, Shaman, Enchanter.    Did learn a couple of things with them.    A lot of times when I GF'ed up to the top, I would ago a Golem or a Goo, so I began to have the Shaman cast invis on me, as soon as I began casting GF.    That way I would hopefully not ago any living mobs when I got to the top.    It worked for the most of the time.     During the whole time for the quest of the CoM skelly, I had only one death due in inability to GF up when the Skelly finally spawned.  <br>
<br>
This is what happened.    We began pulling the PH for the past 2 hours or so, and finally he spawned.   Our group was excited.      I was SoW'ed, Manaskined, Shield of the Magi, Symbol, AoF, and Resolution.     I was pretty well buffed.    I went to stand at the GF starting point, and casted.  Doh, I resisted my own GF.    I casted 4 more times, and each time I resisted my flux.    I had no MR gear on.      Group asked me to take off Manaskin, and Shield of Magi, so I did, and I was able to flux myself up on top.     The Shaman invised me while casting, and I got to the top pretty well safe.    There was 2 goo at the target landing spot.     Went by them  without any problem.    I go into the room and BAM!     Instead of 2 mobs in there there were 4.     2 of the static mobs, and a Goo and a Golem.      They were beating me down like a red-headed stepchild.      I agroed everything and jumped off the moat with only 1 bubble of health.     The ledge to the land is really short and I missed it, and had a death in the water.     I was lucky that my group did get all the mobs there and killed them all with the exception of the Human Skelly in which the Enchanter charmed.     I zoned into CoM got my jar from my body and gave it to the Skelly and completed the CoM portion of my quest.      <br>
<br>
While medding, I came up with an idea that sounded like a good idea  for the next group of people wanting to try to do the CoM Skelly.    I shared it with another Wizard that said it could work and the more he thought about it, it sounded reasonable and safe.     There is a risk/reward tradeoff.     This is what I should of done, and it probably would of saved me from dying.    I wanted to share it with you all, to see if you may be interested in trying it.<br>
<br>
If the Human Skelly is not up, only way he will spawn is to keep killing the PH.     It took us about 2 hours, and I read once that there were people here for 4 to 6 hours waiting for him to spawn.        The think that I do like is always having to GF up to the top to pull the room every time a PH would show up.     Because once I get to the top, there was no telling what I would get.     Sometimes when I had the Shaman cast invis on me there was a Undead Mob up there, and they began to beat me.    The other items it would be a Golem or a Goo.     And if you have to pull the PH that would be a lot of GFing up to the top.       My way would only have you cast GF twice.    <br>
<br>
You would start off the CoM just like it said in the Quest Section for the CoM.    You GF up, pull the room, jump off the bridge and run to the zoneline to your group.    Kill any PH or mobs that come after you.     Once the room was clear, you can GF back up there, and bind yourself into that room right where the skelly spawns.     You would risk a Death Loop, but the ability to get safer and quicker pulls I think is worth the risk.<br>
<br>
Once you bind up in the room with the Human Skelly, you jump down and  wait at the zoneline for the room to respawn.     Once the room respawns, cast levitate on yourself, make sure you get all your buffs, and if a Shaman or Cleric is there with you, get their buffs too.     Once fully buffed, just gate to the room and agro the room, run out side and just float down to the bridge since you have levitate on.      This will avoid the need to GF up there a lot of times, and hopefully reduce the chance of agroing any mobs on the upper walkway.      Then follow the rest of the quest, by letting a Bard, Enchanter, or Necro mez or charm the other mobs and handing the jar to the Skelly.  I think with this way, the Wizard should not loose a lot of HPs on the constant repulls to clear the room.     With the first couple of pulls (doing the old way) with the other Wizard, sometimes we would come out of it with nearly one bubble of life  left.   <br>
<br>
I would also say bring more people too.   Not just a partner.  If you can find a few more friends I would ask for their help too.       A couple of times, while waiting for the respawn, we would be trained by a few Druids or Shamans running to the zone.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my suggestion.   I hope that it may be put to use and maybe  be easier than to do it the old way.   :-)   If you like it, I hope it works out.    It seams logical and I don't think you should die.       Once you get your jar,  just remember to  rebind somewhere else.    :-)   <br>
