Foreword<br>
<br>
Greetings fellow wizard! You hold in your hands the collective knowledge of many great sorcerers who have traveled the many different paths of Norrath, its moon and even the alternate Planes. <br>
<br>
Our abilities or usefulness may not always be evident to our counterparts. We might not be “required” for survival in a dungeon siege, as perhaps a cleric or enchanter may be. This might make companionship hard to come by, not because of our quality of character, but because of the gross misconception of our abilities.<br>
<br>
Fret not evoker! You have huge potential to take your growth and advancement into your own hands. The powerful abilities you currently possess or are destined to obtain will aid you in greater progression than is possible in any other profession. <br>
<br>
We, as wizards have the potential for enormous power and the key to that achievement is primarily obtained via the knowledge we possess. Better knowledge enables us to attain tremendous power. <br>
<br>
Through the difficult yet profitable technique of “quad-kiting” you can empower yourself with growth at a rate staggering to most of your companions. The time you take to seek this knowledge and master its technique will pay you back tenfold.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the single most challenging aspect of “quad-kiting” to master is the understanding of where it is most lucrative to engage in. Here we present you with that knowledge . . .all in one handy printed and bound volume. The collective experience of the Sorcerers united by Graffe.  We offer you here the wisdom we have acquired in the quest to perfect the art of quad kiting.<br>
<br>
Use it well brothers. Be courteous to each other and good journeys.<br>
<br>
Respectfully Submitted,<br>
<br>

24-31, Lake of Ill Omen<br>
Minimum Level: 24<br>
Maximum Level: 31<br>
Zone Name: Lake of Ill Omen<br>
Camp Area/LOC: Northwest Ruins by the lake shore<br>
Mob List (HP): Goblins<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 8 (popular for low level wizards)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (must have SoW, a little difficult w/o BoF)<br>
Faction Affected: Goblins decreased, Iksar increased<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: I learned to quad here, it's extremely simple and a pre-packaged quad-kite. I had a hotkey to tell the zone, given the idiot ratio in LoIO, when I was quadding. Plus OT and FM are right nearby, and you can sometimes get into a Sarnak group<br>
<br>
I suggest binding at the mill; it's a bit of a run to the ruins, but it makes it easier when your SoW/clarity runs out, or when a pull goes bad. Keep root and gate up at all times, and watch for roamers.<br>

Zone Name: Great Divide<br>
Camp Area/LOC: Tizmak Caves #1-#3, (Left on the wall from the waterfall)<br>
Mob List (HP): Tizmaks of all Shapes and Sizes<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 10<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4 <br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 <br>
Faction Affected: Lowers Tizmak faction, which cannot be re-raised, but serves no useful purpose other than keeping them from agro-ing you if you run by them later.<br>
<br>
Fairly good place to learn to quad as there is very little chance of getting an add unless you've hosed your Coldain faction somehow by this level. You usually have to pull them down off the hill to the flatter land otherwise you get targeting issues. I use Column of Lightning and drop them in about five casts. Cave #1 has a LOT of Tizzies. You can usually pull the four at the entrance with no problem though. Cave 2 only has two spawns at the entrance so it's good, safe, steady kiting. Cave 3 has from 3-4 mobs, depending on where the runner is.<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I've never had a problem getting one of the three caves. One of them is almost always open.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They sometimes drop velium weapons that will sell for 3-6 plat in Shadowhaven. No coin, though.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They run fast. Will also get a caster sometimes that can ruin a quad. <br>

NOTES: Great Divide, wolves around the Luclin spires are very doable. Avoid giants. I was doing this in the mid and upper 40's before I learned about spirocs. Low loot, medium difficulty. XP isn't great, but includes useful faction.<br>

*Stonegrabbers also, if you feel especially brave, but there are a lot of stonegrabbers and they are very social. I have not tried because it does not seem worth the effort with so many other easier things to pick on. But the looting would be better--they drop gold earrings occasionally. If you are careful you can avoid all the extras that would agro. They also drop armor dying materials. The stonegrabbers are still dark blue with the occasional light blue at level 34, so I imagine the area is viable through 35, but probably not worth it with Overthere and other areas listed that are, in my humble opinion, better.)<br>
<br>
My main interest in quad-kiting here is because I was a master tailor before I took my long break, and wanted an easy place to collect pelts to take me to a moderate level again without spending too much plat. The greyhoppers drop low quality hides frequently and regular hides almost as frequently. My tailor skill went from about 20 to 88ish here over the course my XP'ing.<br>
<br>
These critters start to turn light blue at 30 (but I'm currently 31 and have not yet found a green hopper or lightcrawler; some green zelniaks), so XP wise it may not be terribly worth it to you.<br>
<br>
The camp area is very wide open though, with hills around the edges (that you should avoid because of the usual pathing and line-of-sight issues). Very minimal danger of adds if you pay attention and rarely will you have people complaining about you.<br>
<br>
I tried north of the Neth Lair entrance a lot, but there is too much hilly terrain and too many chances for adds there for my taste. <br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For newbie quadkiters the long agro range of zelniaks can be difficult to get used to. (EDIT: a &quot;gigantic lightcrawler&quot; that cannot be rooted and runs faster than blood of the wolf SoW occasionally spawns here, too.) For people like me, returned from a long break and starting over, it shouldn't be too difficult.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are so many mobs and so few people here (on my server, at least) that availability has never been an issue for me.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No coin or &quot;interesting&quot; items in my experience. Various caster research items (runes, pages, and such), pelts, and hides.<br>

<br>
As long as you can find it open, Paw is a very easy place to kite. If you can, get the center or north spire, as there are multiple pops there. If the whole of Paw is uncamped (I get lucky in off-hours sometimes) then it's an xp goldmine, not to mention you can make some fairly decent cash as well.<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Usually pretty heavily camped.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They can drop Fine Steel weapons plus 2-3 plat and change.<br>

Maximum Level: 43<br>
Zone Name: Eastern Wastes<br>
Camp Area/LOC: The shore north of the bridge<br>
Mob List (HP): Walruses, Uthork Hunters, Uthork Warriors <br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 5 <br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 <br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 2 <br>
Faction Affected: Othmir increased, Uthorks/Bulthars decreased<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Avoid the rhinos, they run very fast, and are quite resistant to spells. Begin with the walruses, and as they become light blue, move up to Uthork Hunters and then Uthork Warriors. If you can only find two (2) dark blue mobs, you might as well mix in a couple light blue or greens to keep the spawns cycling and you'll be using the mana anyway, so it's extra kills for free. Have something to make you run fast, and use Bonds of Force (level 29) to snare and the researched Circle of Force (level 34) to nuke.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Great place to learn how to quad, plenty of room, easy to avoid adds.<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes hard to find four (4) mobs due to other quadders.<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tusks can be traded in Cobalt Scar for gems, occasional research drops.<br>
<br>

<br>
NOTE: I was told by another Wizzie that the Wooly Rhino's in EW are *not* that fast and could be included in a quad. Can't confirm this, might go check this myself. <br>
<br>
Submitted by: Traxam<br>
<br>
NOTE: EW was good as early as 34 on walrus up to 44 or so. Rhinos run exactly as fast as ulthorks and you can mix the quads. They are not social in the same way, so you will need to finish them a little differently. For walrus, there's another/better location south of Kael entrance. Many walrus, plenty of space. Avoid man-o-war. Less space than north shore, but less competition and all walrus. No waiting for spawns.<br>

Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 5<br>
Faction Affected: None<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Good place to learn to quad. The small Zelniaks just north of the Sseru zone line are easy and non-social. You can spread out to the middle of the zone as you approach level 40.<br>
<br>
The non-social nature of the Zelniak tends to make finishing a quad annoying.<br>

34-42, The Overthere<br>
Minimum Level: 34<br>
Maximum Level: 42 <br>
Zone Name: The Overthere<br>
Camp Area/LOC: West and South sides<br>
Mob List (HP): Sarnaks, Succulant, Cockatrice<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 6 (depends on pull groups)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 6 (Rhinos/Cats/SoW'd Sarnaks)<br>
Faction Affected: Sarnaks<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great zone to learn to quad in. The mobs are plentiful and the spawn times high. The easiest things to quad are Sarnaks; start with berserkers and move up to knights.<br>
<br>
Sarnaks - Social; if there is more than one (1) they will chase you forever, if there's only one and it is snared it will freeze.<br>
<br>
Succulants - Non-social; if they are close and low and snared they will stand still. These will wander off if you leave a certain radius so keep them close when you're finishing a quad. Get them all low and the same time and they will all freeze in a group giving you an easy finish.<br>
<br>
Cockatrice - See Succulants<br>
<br>
The main dangers here are the adds. Rhinos and cats are SoW speed. If you pick one up, dart up a hill/rock and Shadow Step then gate or root it fast and zone out. There are a ton of wandering mobs as well, so keep your eyes open. You can quad along the southern hillside with few wanderers between the Frontier Mountain zone line (ledge) and the SE corner. Another great line is along the gorge running north and south since it is almost devoid of wanderers.<br>
<br>
I have found that grabbing a mob then running ahead, invising up and then looking for more worked great. It kept down the adds until I chose to break invis and the tagged mobs continued to follow. Only Sarnaks will add on their friends, so it greatly minimizes your risk while tagging mobs. <br>
<br>
Submitted by: Chifiir <br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: There's another danger here; sometimes the Sarnaks are SoWed here. To make sure one isn't *don't* pull it while it's standing still but look at it walk. <br>

34-43, Iceclad (near Dragon Bridge)<br>

Zone Name: Iceclad<br>
Camp Area/LOC: By the Eastern Wastes Dragon Bridge<br>
Mob List (HP): Dire Wolves, Snow Dervishes<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 9 (I’ve only &quot;competed&quot; for quads once)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 2 (easy quadding, only real problem is pulling if you've got bad giant faction)<br>
Faction Affected: None<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: I learned to quad here, and made it my home from 35 to 42. The southwestern side of the EW Bridge island is fairly flat and free of trees, which lets you learn how to wrap pretty well. Just don't get spoiled on the vast, wide-open spaces! There are some nice ice floes way down south you can sit and med on (and practice your fishing, too.) Just don't annoy any turtles you see spinning around down there.<br>
<br>
You may have difficulty with your first few pulls if you've already tarnished your giant faction; roaming Frost Giant Scouts will force you to weave and bob as you try to snag that fourth Dire Wolf. JBoots or some form of SoW a must. Just remember that safety is just over that bridge!<br>
<br>
Beware of the Dire Wolf Stalker, a higher-level wolf than the others that can throw off your quad, and a pack of Kromrif tracking wolves (who appear by the bridge when someone's doing the eighth shawl quest), which will be very, very red to you.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Bind at the doggy camp, to TP easily to get SoWs and so on.<br>
<br>
Don't go Anon...People stuck in this zone usually are ready to pay a good price to get TP’ed/TL’ed out. <br>
<br>
Pull with the taunt stick (tflux), get them rounded up on the clear area right between ToFS, the doggy camp and the shore watch out for a named shadow, Blizzard or something, the thingy DDs from afar, very annoying. Not a big DD, but since quadding takes time, you get dead fast. Never seen levels pass this fast, the XP there is insane.<br>
<br>
May I add I never got any competition at this spot? Paradise it is, my fellow wizards, believe me.<br>
<br>
Submitted by: Sastiss<br>
<br>
NOTE: Iceclad, panthers. I taught myself to kite on these guys in the low 30's before moving on to dervishes. Camp site is the pirate island. Low loot, low-medium difficulty. Pull them to the island's edge and kite along it to avoid wanderers. You can quad them at 34, or dervishes, but you get better loot &amp; exp from EW walrus at that level.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: There are 4 spectres on the island on each corner. Just grab levitate and tflux them and run around in circles. Once they are snared you can quad them on the island, but if you are nervous just run them to the south shore and quad there. I have never had a spectre agro someone else during a pull and it impresses the hell out of some people.<br>
<br>
There are four (4) more spectres in the tower, one (1) on the bottom and three (3) up top. You can target and pull the spectres up top through the walls, since you can see them sticking out through the walls. Just tflux them and keep running. Mostly light blue to 49, but before that its all dark blue.<br>
<br>
Two (2) quads per 15 minute respawn, can sell/buy bandages at gypsies or the inn depending if you are evil and good. Oasis is a fun zone too. If you get bored you can slay a Sand Giant for some pp. Nice camp!<br>

NOTE: Spectres, from my xperience, are not quaddable after the PoP patches. The range on their life-tap is now very large, making it impossible to keep them grouped as they keep life-tapping you. While the life tap is only 30 some odd points, having 4 specs constantly life-tapping you from afar makes you dead quick.<br>

NOTE: Same mobs and strategies can be applied to the specters in Ocean of Tears. What makes these an attractive camp is that they are the highest level monsters in the area which leads to very few adds. The OOT is exactly four (4) spectres, so there might be down-time in between runs (about a 15-20 minute respawn)<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is an awesome camp, great money, and awesome XP. Now granted, when I did this camp from 44-48, there was no KEI in the game, so perhaps now its faster elsewhere, but without KEI, you can med up to full just in time for these guys to repop. I imagine with KEI you could quad these dwarves, then go quad the dwarves up by the docs as well, and still get back before a re-pop. The money here is excellent and really, do you even want dwarf faction? Heck no.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Often camped, but not so much anymore as people don't want to ruin faction.<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amazing plat making possibilities. Each dwarf drops 1-2pp in coins, and items worth between 3-15pp, and there is a druid vendor right near where you kite them. Can easily make several hundred plat an hour here.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Alrighty, not sure if anyone is still keeping this a secret or whatever since PoP came out ...but I'm done with it and going to spill the beans. First off to any naysayers, this is perfectly doable, did it for probably 40 or so AA points. I'm going to assume whoever tries this knows a thing or two about quadding and such. It took a little time to find the non-warping path to quad down there but since that is probably all you need to know if you're reading this here it is. Go to the main area where the ladder is, start off by pulling and killing the Ice Witch solo, stay away from directly near the ladder as there are two (2) quad mobs there that will assist if you get too close, but as long as your level is sufficient single pulling is easy. Finish Ice Witch<br>
Now go to the safe corner, the little indented corner where the big rock is in the ground ..the one opposite the side of this big area that the ladder is on. That it the safe spot down there. Snare pull the 2 mobs near the ladder, then the 2 in front of the dire wolf cubby hole. Round them up by making circles around the 2 large rocks, go from the safe corner, to the corner a bit to left of the rock opposite, you'll see it's as far as you can get on that wall. Snare them then start the quad. You have just a little more time than you need to go to one corner, Pillar, run around one rock to next corner, Pillar, and so on. Circle should be clockwise, big rock on your right each time you run around it.<br>
<br>
Successive pulls can be determined by any experienced quadder as to what is to your liking. I always then pulled the the dire wolf cubby if four (4) in there, if not ..pulled they and polar bears at ramp down. Once you are pulling the bears on lower level, go to middle of the wall with no bears on it to snare the ones at bottom of ramp, and then grab another two (2) down there, or vice versa.<br>
<br>
Epic is a huge help down here but not necessary, and manastone is lovely, but this is still a viable option for those lacking either that are after great XP level 60 and below for a little risk. Do not to try to quad elsewhere down there though aside from around those two (2) big rocks, corner to corner, or they will warp onto you and make things go all ugly.<br>
Hope this helps some people and is as productive for you as it was for me.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: 200 swimming and steelskin recommended to minimize damage on close pulls. Enduring Breath not required but handy while scouting invis. Levitate up at all times, staff of tflux a must! There are two (2) Bloodgill Goblins at each pillar (four (4) total), you can pull one pair, swim up and make some distance levitating on the water with JBoots/SoW before pulling the second pair. Once complete head towards the beach for roundup, snare and AE's (if SoWed, zigzag or you may lose them). Middle underwater building can also be pulled but are down deeper - hard to make a quad of this without taking a beating though, unless Marauder is up: in the doorway and hard to spot underwater, not having the blue skin that the Bloodgill Goblins have nowadays. Social, low aggro range underwater (might force you to tflux both goblins for each pair). <br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pretty remote, not much competition.<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some pp, research stuff, sometimes a Harpoon of the Depths.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: One of the best camps at 51, these are quaddable with a large mana pool from 46 or so if you stick to the smaller ones.

<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: You need Pillar of Frost (level 51) and SOW to quad the Drovlargs. Pull them from the southeast ruins area and quad them along the south side of KC. There is hardly anyone along the south side. In case of problems, such as a spider &quot;add&quot;, you can zone into KC to clear aggro. With KEI, you can get serious non-stop XP quadding the doggies, and you also impress the lower levels when you run by with four angry Drovlargs behind you. It helps to have the tflux for pulling. This is a great spot for someone to go 100% AA to pick up three easy points for Runspeed3. Once you hit 51, get your spells, go 100% AA, and start quadding your first 3 AA's.<br>
<br>
Keep your wizzy familiar up and do not turn anon or roleplay on. I made about 600pp+ a night between loot drops and TL requests.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great quadding spot, as it is nearly never camped. It is a great alternative to the usually camped Cobalt Scar, but is slightly more challenging. The biggest warning is to try to avoid most Sarnaks, which are plentiful here. They are typically SoW’ed and can provide some difficulty there. The best area to pull and rest is the burned out area down the hill from the nest. None of the hornets see invis (skeletons and gorillas do though). It can be a challenge to get a hang of where the good mobs spawn and you might have to mix in some gorillas and skeletons. They are pretty safe to add in though some of the higher-level ones have more HP than the hornets and will require a finishing off nuke. The Scoriae hornets also have a lot of HP and will require the same. <br>
<br>
NOTE: Reminder that sometimes the Sarnaks are SoWed here. To make sure one isn't *don't* pull it while it's standing still but look at it walk.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Often camped but very easy, Wyverns will not agro if you have a good faction with Claws of Veeshan, except for Yvolcarm and Azureake (the named Cobalt Drake). So stay away from them when they are up, they are not snarable neither rootable. Killing them will decrease your CoV faction. If you aggro, just run and then gate. Need to be Dubious to CoV to travel safely here. <br>

NOTE: With KEI, I already did Wyverns at level 49 using BoF and CoF. Sure it takes longer and you have to re-snare once or twice, but it's very doable. <br>
<br>
Submitted by: Traxam<br>
<br>
NOTE: Wyverns begin to go light blue at level 52 and the XP plummets. They are quite doable when Eastern Wastes begins to go green. Wyverns are not casters. Drakes are. Drakes also dispell. You can take them by singling, rooting, and nuking from max range. Also beware Yvolcarn. He looks like a wyvern, spawns like a wyvern, but is immune to run speed changes like root/shackle. Know where he is before you pull.<br>
<br>
Also, you can pull from the tower if you either run up it, or target through the window and t-flux while near. Be careful of the bulgar (or whatever they are called, leader is immune to run speed changes and will aggro nearest.)<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Despite the changes to the Chromadracs dispell, SF is still a spot we can quad in. It takes some time and skill but it is doable. With the Changes to Chromadracs I seriously advise getting Run3 before making SF your home for quadding. You get your SoW dispelled and you are in trouble here and will be dead pretty quick. Also try to keep a skin up at all times, mobs hit pretty hard here. <br>
<br>
The edges of the zone tend to have a few spots that are not filled with wanderers and tend to be flat without a lot of big boulders in the way. Find these spots and do your quadding runs here. I've done multiple quads with various mobs thrown together and am able to get them all snared with no problem.<br>
<br>
If you get a resist or miss a snare on a mob, simply run ahead a little, root it, and then break root by tapping mob with Shock of Ice. Proceed to round up the quad from there, you may or may not have to resnare before all of the mobs drop (I do at 50% health just to be safe)<br>
<br>
A note on Chromadracs: While Verant gave them the ability to dispell at casting range this has merely taken them out of the lineup as quadding targets. The agro on Chromas seems to be a very small area. I run over the top of a hill and stop right in front of them all of the time, just be sure to turn tail and run like the wind in the opposite direction.<br>
Make sure you put your important buffs like SoW, C3, Ageo, etc behind as many dummy buffs as possible. This reduces the chance of accidentally losing them if you aggro a Chroma. If anything, quadding in SF while teach you how to really drive a quad with finesse. What I mean by this is that I prefer to have a full quad when I am kiting so I end up running around a bit tagging mobs here and there to make a full quad. Dodging Chromas and steering my unsnared quad around Chromas has taken quadding to a whole new level for me. Quadding in CS made me complacent, quadding in SF honed my skills to a sharp edge.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, one final note... if you happen to see Talendor and are in the middle of a quad, take you quad away from him and with a quickness. His aggro range is a tad large and you can aggro him by pulling near him.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spell drops and an average of 8pp or so from each mob, occasional gem. Do not go /role or /anon, lots of individuals will pay nicely for TLs here.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Just south of the chessboard isle in Timorous Deep is the Raptor Isles. There are two; widely known as large and small (due to their size naturally). They are very close to each other. The easiest way into TD is to go to Firiona Vie (or Overthere) and talk to the Translocator. He will pop you into the Timorous Deep zone and you can levitate, SoW and hike it to the isles. Assuming they are not camped you have your choice of the two isles.<br>
<br>
Small- Easier to &quot;break&quot; as the sets of mobs are farther apart from eachother. There are a total of seven mobs for this island. Four on the &quot;beach&quot; side make set#1. Two on the north side of the island + 1 spare from large island make set#2. This is acceptable and xpected to pull this straggler across the water to the small isle. He is on the northern part of the large isle and is all by himself. Simply pull one set of mobs, wrap and kite. Then you have a good 12 mins. to use that side of the island to med. All raptors are on a 12 min. timer. Get in the habit of timing them and be ready for the next spawn. If you spend the time breaking the spawn up you don't wan to get caught off-guard by another set spawning while you're kiting the other half of the island. Downside of this isle is you need levitate at all times to grab the straggler and you only get seven (7) spawns (as opposed to &quot;large&quot; where you get eight (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  for the same mana output).<br>
<br>
Large- Harder to break as the mobs aren't as separate. You need to get four and exactly four in your first pull to break the spawn. I don't have any good advice here except to be careful and scope out your pull before you do it. Levitate and use the water to your advantage. Try to kite in a tight area on one side of the island. Then you've got your 5-6 mins. to do the other side. Once the spawn is broken up you will be quadding every few minutes and should see some excellent XP!<br>
<br>
NOTE: Careful when pulling Dinus, he's got a lot more HP than the others and you might need to sit-med-nuke a few times to finish him off. This has caused problems a few times as it screws up the timing of the spawns if you take too long to kill him. If you see Dinus up you are best to wait till you are full mana before pulling the whole quad so you can finish him quickly after the first three go down. This will keep the spawning/killing times consistent.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Breaking the large isle is tough, but then it's simple after that.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Raptors are probably the best XP anywhere from 54-58. Even after 58 with KEI you can hold both islands and still make darn good XP. With a little practice you can kite right on the isles, and with KEI you'll be right back at full for the next spawn. Finding an isle open can be tough though, I would recommend binding here and checking the spawn when you log in, then asking the person to send you a tell when they leave. Seems to work pretty well.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone comes here. Expect to have to get on a list.<br>

NOTE: I've seen the first light blues here at 56 (perhaps even 55, not sure) already, so I'm not sure if they're still worth it at 57. Aside from figuring out how to split the island, it's quite easy. Just watch the huge aggro at first, but once you're used to it, it's in your advantage as it makes it easy to pull them. <br>

NOTE: With kei, I could hold large raptor island without trouble at 52. I did 3aa, then 53 there. I'm killing them as fast as they spawn and maintaining mana. At 52, manaskin helped. At 53, with regen3, I think it's cheaper to take a few hits and I'm not having any trouble with mana.<br>

<br>
The XP is not that great because they have 8000+ HP's. It takes a ton of mana to finish them off, and that means lots of med time. But there are two nifty things about quadding here: Camp is always available, and loot is great. C3 and lots of +int/+mana gear is a must. Only Pillar of Lightning works reliably. Special care must be taken not to path them through a tree, as that will scatter the pack. The terrain has a rough learning curve. <br>

Faction Affected: No faction hits<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Have Run 3. These are pretty much your last hurrah at quadding in pre-pop zones. The mobs are not social, so if you are resist or crit too much of a difference in HP some will turn while the others still chase you. You can generally just make a loop until the unturned mob or mobs join back in (they have insane regen) and then nuke them all turned at once.<br>
<br>
Velium hounds are harder to spot, but if you see several of them up there is no reason they would not be quaddable similarly.<br>
<br>
If you get a velium hound add and you are not sowed, it WILL be faster than you. Run far enough that your quad does not beat on you (4 of these mobs hitting you is unpleasant briefly), then root and snare the dog. Abandon quad if necessary, but unless you are marginal on mana, it should not really be necessary. If you are sowed you can outrun the dog, but they are fast enough that you will have to generate a lot of distance from your quad to do so. Better generally to take the hits and root/snare them, kill them, and resume your quad.<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mastodon Furs can be worthwhile for tailoring or selling, as can Velium Hound Furs.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rare resists, but the mobs are not social; Primarly risk is Velium Hound adds.<br>

Pull with Atol's. You need the time on the snare and the resist bonus and you don't want them after you at full speed.<br>
<br>
Pop traps invised, swarming beatles see invis though so avoid that trap (second ramp corner)<br>
<br>
When a spider hits you that you weren't expecting, cast Atol's on it while it is hitting you. Their melee range is such that they will start hitting you while you are still out of the range of Atol's. I've only hit myself with snare once doing this and I was dealing with multiple spiders at the time (/hug exodus).<br>
<br>
The spiders proc a phase shift (Yonder) on you. This can be disorienting. If you get confused, bail and try again. If you get ported mid-cast duck immediately and recast. Getting phase shifted is counted as a (long) movement so your cast is already blown. You can also get ported onto the bones, which hold Dragon Construct traps. Dragon Constructs stay up for days and like any dragonish thing, require melee range to cast on making them essentially un-killable by you solo.<br>
<br>
The spiders are fairly resistant so you may have to snare several times. This can be problematic with a full quad when you keep seeing one or two resist messages. <br>
<br>
Even snared these things are fast. Run the lot of them back to the zone in and in a big loop around it as you burn.<br>
<br>
Pathing when you pull is FUBAR (particularly past the first ramp) so watch and make sure they are following, you may have to back track a bit. <br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes drop Phase Spider Blood (nice for non casters) and about every 30th one or so drops a PSC.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I do not generally quad these intentionally, I go for two or three, and if I get an add, snare it and quad then. They run fast, hit hard, proc yonder on you, spring from traps, warp on you, warp unexpectedly in front of you while pulling others, etc. Learn where the traps are so you can pop and pull them.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: These have a lot of HP, KEI, flappy, PotC, and a pretty good size mana pool is nice unless you like to med kite. Run3 is fast enough to stay ahead of them unsnared, just give yourself lots of room to snare. There are about a dozen spawns and they have a fairly large agro assist range. Take some time to figure out how to break the camp or you will find yourself with six (6) to eight (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  mobs per pull. They can drop diamonds, blue diamonds, and raw diamonds. They start to turn light blue at 63.<br>

Tagging them with flux staff they'll chase you to a certain point then wander back. You'll still have agro when you run back.<br>

The only feasible way I discovered to ensure they chase you across their 'boundaries' is to have nuked them at least once for serious damage.<br>

<br>
A Brontotherium,  A Velium Hound, and  A Glacier Mastadon all have different running speeds when snared.  THis makes mixing a quad a waste of time and mana.<br>
<br>
Also finding 4 mobs of the same up and not being killed is still a dream of mine.  Only after a patch or crash is this maybe possible but with the hounds add's not very wise.<br>
<br>
Hound agro is bigger than normal casting range. I have extended range 2 and still get agro sometimes before spell lands.<br>
<br>
Snared wolfs still run jboot or inate running 3 speed.<br>
<br>
If you do not have sow or 65k horse or faster, or a cleric for buffs this is not the zone for you. Unless you like dying every 3 or 4th kite.<br>
<br>
Also there are ice burrows there  level 61 to 62. High resist but at 60 am able to get them down to 20 life before OOM, thus higher levels may be able to kite these for decent exp and i have never seen these not up, most time there is enough for a 4 quads. <br>

<br>
The tower spectres have the tenacious custom to airdrop on top of you, if they get stuck in the tower. They will do this usually when you're about to clear the water.<br>
<br>
Learn to octa-kite. You will almost always get at least 1 of the spectres from the tower itself as well, and I have managed all 8 when one of the corner spectres climbed the tower.<br>
<br>
I always have O'Keils Levity up, and am using a horse and C3 or better. Tflux one of the corner specs, and run in circles around the edges of the island, tfluxing the tower specs if they won't add. This will group them nicely, ready for 2 nicely packaged BoF casts, when you pull them to the flat areas near SRo. Both groups can stay within cast range, so BoF the 2nd group occasionally, and switch your attention on them when making a half-circle, or they'll lose interest and suddenly vanish....<br>
<br>
After this, the spectres should spawn in quads again, unless you killed all 8 within a short timeframe. This can give you 50-100pp, and about 10pct exp on lvl 43.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=braellaendressari>Braellaen Dressari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 2:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bump</span><hr size=1> Bump, why not sticky it too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ziggyholiday>ziggyholiday</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/03 6:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bump</span><hr size=1> IMO I would stop quadding spirocs at 51, and even at 51 exp is crap...head to CS or just group for a bit /shrug<br>

Notes...<br>
<br>
Basement- quadding this one is easy, dont fall asleep while you do it! grab the mobs and quad them to the side of the room, away from the picture-thingy on the floor. turning around will slow down the quad(slowing xp) so I recommend that you try to zig zag back and forth. mobs walking along the hypotenuse of an isoscolese right triangle as opposed to just going straight when you zig zag must spend 40% more time just to get to the same place! that's 40% more damage you can do before you must engage yourself in another time consuming turn.<br>

Clear area with a tree(ent)- you can pull mobs from here and quad it in the area that has the solitary tree in it, which ill call the courtyard. when you have the mobs, quad them in a pentagonal pattern in order to kill them without having to turn. chain nuke pol/pof power! pulling them is a bit more difficult than the valorians, so I'd give the difficulty of this camp a '2', rather 1.2 (no adds or anything!). you can get mobs from deeper in easily, but it can depend on your load time. if its fast, run the 2 mobs at ent to the back of the courtyard and snare them. when theyre at the back of the wall you can abscond, get 2 more and reaggro the stationary guards.<br>

hope this one helped :P. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mtw333>mtw333</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 1:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Flies in PoD</span><hr size=1> Just a quick tag:<br>

<br>
There are 2 wandering and 6 static on the island, go to the &quot;safe island&quot;, sit there.<br>
<br>
Sooner or later you'll be able to see both wanderers, just grab them, and the closest 2 static spawns, then only quad on that side of the island.  I wrapped them up over the water, ran straight back to the cliff base, snared, and quadded.<br>
<br>
That is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hard part.  Just med up, and there are 4 left on the island, quad using the whole island, and broken. Depending on mana/regen you should see them respawn sometime close to when you're very close to being ready for them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=753.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=753.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.threadControl?topicID=753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19>Soloing and Quad-Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
