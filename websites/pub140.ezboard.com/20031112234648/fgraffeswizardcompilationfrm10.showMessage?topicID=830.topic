I DO feel we need some changes to make us more group desirable.  As mentioned in another post &quot;Verant has already stated that balancing involves 3 things. A) Soloing B) Grouping C) Raiding.&quot;  The problem clearly is how do we fix one without making all catagories more powerful.  We are already one of the top two or three soloing classes.  We are one of the top raiding classes and stack endlessly.  The only place we could use some work is group desirablity (please note that I said desirability, not utility).  To be honest being one of the best in two out of three catagories is not so bad in the grand scheme of things (what do rogues do when LFG?).<br>
<br>
As far as group disirability is concerned, as many have said before the problem is perception.  People simply don't notice the damage we do.  I don't blame them.  I play a mid 50s chanter and several other alts, and when I have a wiz in my group I barely notice the damage he is doing even though I play a wiz as my main.  When I am playing my wiz I am watching that mobs lifebar drop with every cast and I can't imagine the rest of the group not noticing, but sure enough, when I am playing an alt with a wiz in my group even I barely notice.  I am usually too concerned doing my job to worry about anyone else's.  A tank that simply hits autoattack with the occational kick and bash might take more notice but after playing a cleric and a chanter I know I barely do.  Also any character that is not toe to toe with the mob will have mob lifebar lag and it is hard to associate lifebar drops with anyone's specific action.<br>
<br>
The simpliest solution would be to display wizard damage.  Would be nice but its not gonna happen.  At this stage in the game if that change has not been made it most likely never will.  With most of 'the vision' gone goodbye I don't know why this outdated philosophy is still in play, but it is unlikely to change after all this time.  It is a shame too, it would be the easist fix to the class to implement and create no balance issues.<br>
<br>
So how do we fix it?<br>
<br>
More damage?  I do not think we need better, bigger, or more efficient nukes.  I think our balance in this regard is fine.  To be frank although I specified group disirablity I am satisfied with what we bring to a group right now as far as damage is concerned, despite the extensive number crunching on DPS that has been done by many posters.  Even those parser logs show an 'uber' wizard outdamages almost anyone in an exp group limited only by agro.  The only area where we seriously lag is level 1-50 and to a much lesser extent 51 to 59.  This is mostly do to mudflation and the melee twinks it creates, in the early game I am sure it was more balanced.  Since there are very few low level wizzies left and those that do exist are leveling fast thanks to KEI (our version of twinkage) I will not address the lower level damage problem here.  Bottom line...Any increase in damage or efficiency makes us better soloers and better raiders.  SOE/VI will do nothing to our class that will improve our enviable standing in those catagories<br>
<br>
Pets? Nope.  Unbalancing and almost all wizards agree we dont want 'em.  We don't want to be mages and this would make us even better soloers.  I don't think Xuzl needs to be changed and I don't think the useless pet buff spells need to be revived.  I am just glad VI/SOE realized the penalty for familiar deaths was a mistake and got rid of it; if we end up with some useless spells in our book because of it, so be it.  Bottom line...Pets=More damage, and not gonna happen for the same reasons stated above concerning more damage.<br>
<br>
Buffs? Nope.  Unbalancing and almost all wizards agree we dont want 'em.  Any buffs we get could be used as self buffs and make us even better soloers.  Besides, we just dont want to be buffers.  Bottom line...That is not what we signed on for, we do damage.<br>
<br>
Utility spells?  There have been some imaginative suggestions in this catagory, and I have liked quite a few of them, but this is a no too.  The wizzie community wants to blow things up.  Period.  I personally think we got screwed with the nexus spires and PoK books because our TPs we considered a balancing aspect of our class.  They still serve a purpose on occasion but I miss having something to offer besides damage.  We still have our evac line which serves a use (less so with GYs), and I am happy having this as the sole 'utility' I offer.  So many classes can root and snare I won't include these here.  Bottom line...To many wizards this falls into the buffs catagory and they don't want to be a buffers.<br>
<br>
So what is left?  There was an interesting suggestion made in another thread about increasing group efficiency just by having a wizzie in it.  A correlation was made to the system used by Earth and Beyond where each class adds something to the entire group when they are a member.<br>
<br>
At first I thought it was a silly idea.  Every other class would be up in arms that we were getting unfair favoritism by adding group efficiency just by having a wizzie in it.  But then I thought about it more.  Besides the unversal int caster buffs and the O'Kiel's line of questionable utility (love the levity though) what is the one buff that wizzies have?  Our familiar line of spells.  What if when we joined a group our familiar effected all group members?<br>
<br>
This addresses several problems.  Our class group disirability is upgraded with ABSOLUTELY NO upgrade to our soloing or raiding ability.  We get to have a tangable benefit to members of our group WITHOUT becoming buff whores.  We add utility to a group via fewer fizzles and an upgrade to resists WITHOUT adding any utility spells.<br>
<br>
The mana regen effect scales nicely with level.  A low level wizzie merely adds resists and fewer fizzles.  Then starts to add mana regen at level 49 at one per tic.  That is half of breeze and certainly not overpowering.  This goes to two per tic at 54, 4 per tic at 60, 6 per tic with IF, and up to 8 per tic with AF.  These are not huge numbers by any means (especially when you consider the effort required for attaining the AA abilities) but our familiar stacks with EVERYTHING.<br>
<br>
To be honest I dont think VI/SOE would have a problem with the mana regen numbers, they are a fraction of what chanters, bards, and beastlords bring to the table.  The resists may be a stickling point.  That is a pretty powerful buff as far as resists go.  I would still be happy just adding the mana regen to the group because groups can't get enought of that.<br>
<br>

And I gave credit to that post in paragraph eight.  My solution, on the other hand, does not require redesigning EQ entirely.  Just allowing a self only buff to effect other characters in the group.  I don't wan't to add bonuses for each class.  I just used his idea as a catalyst for the idea of applying the familiar buff to your group.  The beauty of my approach is the ease of incorporation into the existing game system.  The only obstacle may be the potential requirement to re-cast your familiar once in a new group (you worked up Conj, right?).<br>
<br>
My solution also quantifies in tangible mana regen numbers the benefit a wizzies brings to the group besides the obvious damage.  The problem I was trying to address here was group disirability not actual balance issues.  Even though this solution does add to group efficiency, it is really not that much.  It would be perceived to be allot because of flawed player perceptions (players worship mana regen).  If player perceptions are wrong (group desirability) lets use it to our advantage.  I don't wan't to add bonuses for each and every class.  I just used that idea as a catalyst for the idea of applying the familiar buff to your group.<br>
<br>
Although I like the concept of what Jarnin adapted from E&amp;B for EQ I feel the changes are too sweeping to have any chance of coming into play.  The potential balance issues are astronomical.<br>
<br>
VI/SOE is afraid of change.  They are always worried that any new ability added to any character might effect balance.  They would like to do as little as possible ant not mess with the precarious balance (if it is balanced) that exists today.  They have made many mistakes in the past, I can't say whether they have learned from them, but I can say they have learned that any change they make will have effects they did not anticipate.  They will not make changes that are drastic unless they REALLY have to.<br>
<br>
(please lets not get into a debate on what is drastic and what is not.  We can also skip the debate on whether they will make changes on minor things.  /agree Some descisions seem arbitrary, lets move on.)<br>
<br>
The point is, the more minimal the fix is the more likely it is to be implemented.  The less likely it will effect class balance the more likely it is to be implemented.  The easier it is to code, the more likely it is to be implemted.<br>
<br>
Wow, that was a kinda long response to an innocent reply.  I guess I hadn't said my fill in my fist post.<br>

I like your points about what we cannot have in order to be balanced. Its exactly how I feel. The only think is that I don't particularly know how easy coding this idea would be. It seems impossible to me considering people NEED a buff on them wether it takes a buff slot or acts like the group only mana regen song bards get... They would have to change the familiar to be like a bard song then we wouldn't be able to cast with the buff going... Seems rather difficult but a good idea. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faithkills>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1305<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/16/02 12:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My solution</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The simpliest solution would be to display wizard damage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Bad idea. Then everyone would parse us compared to other damage classses. If they measure 5 minutes (and tell us which 5) sure we'll win, but if they measure an hour it will be bad for Wizards. As it stands the pretty crits are saving our PR bacon. (tho FoT crits hurt mitigate that as well)<br>
<br>
The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fear</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is that increasing Wizard damage would make us too good in raids. The solution is a line of spells that compromise burst damage for sustained damage. Without compromising what's left of the vision of Wizards.<br>
<br>
Yes this can be done and in clever and interesting ways but I won't enumerate any, I'll leave that as an excercise for the reader. Be sure not to ignore aggro in your solution. You have 50 minutes.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fear</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a big boogieman. Our burst DPS only applies, by definition, for a fight that lasts less time than it takes to get from OOM to FM. These are a realtively small proportion of encounters. Yes they exist and several are notable. But they don't form the bulk of encounters.<br>
