In the battles where our presence matters the most - large nasty battles (or when killing something very fast matters), nobody can touch us: IF you are a properly trained up Wizard.<br>
<br>
You must have concussion, and you should have subtlety for this disparity to close.  With these two abilities we can manage our agro better than anyone else - and this alone will let you do more damage (with nukes) than any mage.<br>
<br>
Add in our natural resistance decreases (-10 for most nukes, -50 for the new draughts, and -300 for lures during those irritating times), and the simple fact that we have Ice, Fire and Magic to choose from at any time, we are just more flexible and useful when it really counts.<br>
<br>
So what if mages do more damage now in certain situations.  Suck it up and stop being a pussy.  If they are so much better, go play one, then you'll realize - i suck.<br>

<br>
- Randomly poofs as soon as it's summoned (bolts get blocked)<br>
- Has a variable max hit damage, ranging from harder than our best pet to 1 (bolts get resisted)<br>
- Costs substantially more mana than their &quot;normal&quot; pet. (bolts are more expensive)<br>
- Is based on whatever spell skill necros don't usually specialize in. (bolts are evocation, the majority of mages spec in conjuration)<br>
- Can only be used against mobs of a certain type, with little options otherwise.  (FoT is fire based, we have no ice nuke.  Our magic is often much weaker than our fire.)<br>
- Is only superior for about 3 levels or so (you do know you get nukes better than FoT)<br>
<br>
Well, yes, I'd imagine that there would be some mages who would still complain.  Of course, they'd be ignoring their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>obvious overall superiority</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, both in efficiency and variety, in the pet area, just like wizards are doing so regarding their nukes.  <br>

As is CLEARLY evident, the mages BIGGEST BOOM is a 61.  They are then all downhill.  So next time anyone tries to make a comparison, simply state that that is as good as they will EVER get in the BOOM category.  So what if they can buy it.  Verant says, &quot;Hello Magician, have you seen 'the biggest boom of a nuke you'll ever get' that I just got in.&quot;<br>
<br>
You want to play the rest of your EQ life at 61 be my guest, I'm on my way to the top floor.<br>

My last post on the topic because people around here seem determined to take anything regarding this topic into a flame war.<br>
<br>
<br>
Milaru, read what I said; read what Goladus said.  You didn't even follow the freaking link.  He said he's not, but he suspects that there may be some people changing.  You asked for a mages perspective, that supported specialization change, I posted it.  You asked where 'the hell you come up with this shit?' there it is.  I certainly put more value in a regular member of this community (Goladus) than a bunch of mages that come here to make sure their spell doesn't get nerfed.  I guess I missed the part where you asked for twelve+ independent mage opinions supporting it.  Apparently if I only happen to hear that from one highly respected mage that he suspects some may change specialization, then that is worthless.  Apparently anyone who says that there could be some specization switches is talking out of their ass?<br>
<br>
Ya'll are certainly entitled to your opinion on whether or not a mage can outdamage us with the spell.  I also am entitled to mine.  However it gets tiring come here only to find lame insults instead of a healthy lively debate.  I was listening to the debates on the war in Iraq a while back, and even Senators have more respect.  The started with My dear friend from X state said this, which I... bla bla bla&quot;  and ended with the point.  Around here if you disagree, you start with the insult like &quot;You pig headed idiot I can't believe you disagree with me&quot;, and end with the classic &quot;go play X class since you are such an idiot&quot; nonsense.   Real style there.  Damn you're right I'm a complete idiot 61 wizard who hasn't played any other classes...  Oh wait.. maybe you should check my sig?  Oh and I'm real sure that by insulting people you are bound to convince them you have some valid points..  right?  Or are you just here to insult?  If you are.. go away troll.<br>
  <br>
Personally I have Sunstrike, I will level fairly fast, and I will get the better spells.  Not every wizard is so fortunate, or has the time.  Casual players _are_ 60/61 now.  That's why I choose to be involved in this.  I challenge all of you to live for a week without sunstrike, eer, gss or any other 61+ spells asside from lure of thunder, and play with mages using this bolt and see how you feel.  I can damn well see how some wizards are fit to be tied over the whole thing.<br>
<br>
So get your last word in, I have no doubt you will.  I have not the desire to continue to debate what has come down to a matter of opinion.  I certainly have no desire to debate with those of you who have nothing better to do then insult anyone who doesn't agree with you.<br>
<br>
PS:  For the record I felt Milaru and I had a decent reasonable debate going.<br>
<br>
PSS:  Oh I have the 61 rain, and so far, it resists like hell, just like every other rain, and therefore in my opinion, is not worth memming.  Sunstrike is so much more consistent it's not even funny.<br>

<br>
actually I did, I read it when he first posted it, a few times after that and again when you did.  One mage saying that a few may switch even if he would not, then a larger number claiming they wouldn't.    I asked where Oxoxo was coming up with the claims that they are, as I haven't seen one mage post, here or on mages tower, that the spell is a big enough deal that it is worth changing specs over.  I didn't ask for 12 mages saying I won't, one saying &quot;I did&quot; would be sufficent, one saying &quot;a few may&quot; no matter how respected (Goladus is the man, I give him that) still isn't.<br>
<br>
The only mage I know that still has an evoc spec hasn't been played since luclin came out, all the others I have talked to have been Conjuration and planned to stay that way due to the other spells that were coming later in levels.<br>

When my own guild mages are telling me they believe its overpowered, guess what?  it probably is.  Mages bitching about resists?  Laugh.  My wizard has a hard time outdamaging my warrior w/o debuffs in PoP.  Oh thats right, mages can debuff too.<br>
<br>
Bolt aggro?  Gimmie a break.  You don't think our spells aggro just as much?  Aggro is THE biggest reason why wizards are gimped in this expansion.  Its sad when I CAN'T USE MY MANA AS FAST AS I REGEN IT.  Concussion doesn't even cover the hate for one nuke and it kills my dps.<br>
<br>
What I would personaly love to see us get is a 2 second cast concussion item, and to make concussion UNRESISTABLE.  Concussion in spell form just KILLS our dps.  Rogue version of concussion does not effect their dps, and it has no resist check-- a failed evade still lowers hate.  Concussion in item form would help a ton.  Also, spell casting subtlety should be increased to 30%, and I would love some sort of confirmation that it works...<br>
<br>
Also put -10 resist on all MR nukes that don't have it, like they should have had in the first place.<br>
<br>
Even with these changes, the ONLY reasons to pick a wizard over a mage is snare and evac, but at least we can do lots of damage in spurts like we're supposed to, and pretend its worth a damn.<br>

try casting nukes or leveling above 30, hitting autoattack won't do much as a wizard.<br>
<br>
a failed evade lowers hate because they shut off autoattack, a resisted concussion still has an effect because its a break in nuking.<br>
<br>
if you think SCS needs to be increased and concussion should be made unresistable, you have more problems than FoT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harvestofsouls>Harvest of Souls</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/2/02 12:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> lvl 60<br>

cheapest sunstrike i've seen for sale is 50k , i'll never see luclin DD's or the such, the only 60's i've gotten were both bought.. greater familiar for 5k and ice spear for 2k and that is it. There is no reason what so ever to get PoP when there's stoopid KUNARK spells you'll never see. <br>
<br>
Manaburn is shot to hell. Our hook with eq in being the gatekeepers to the planes was killed long ago with velious. Wizards rely only on our spells.. that these arn't vendor bought leaving us with nothing and no alternatives what so ever is just insane. <br>
<br>
Add that to the continued improvments to other nook vs damage vs availability spells of other classes and you cannot reasonably argue that there isn't a serious problem with it. <br>
<br>
if your good enough to lvl your mage to that lvl to get the spell from the vendor then your smart enough to get your stoopid bolt to work.. i know i would.<br>

 I am only distressed that a fellow wizard is 60 and embarrassed to get 61 cause he dosent have SS yet, even though hes got Iceflame, he would trade it straight out for sunstrike, yet mages buy up that nuke like its nuthing, also I am struggling to get 63 to scribe AT but I will never see GSS or EER .. what mage spells are hiddin from them so carefuly as those?<br>
<br>
 It is all rather lame, I roll against a pally for a parch drop yet I cannot sport a sword, a mage gets his glorious nuke at 61 and its vendor bought. .and its very close to equivilant to ours yet they still have pets to add to that. Wheres is the uberness of all this as a wizard . .we should never be behind anyone in nukes, and this nuke they get should be that gift like GSS or EER and drop offa super uber boss . . sure ratio is nice to add in but PoP is all about fast encounters, and DPS, if mages have that better then us with pets and their nukes . .all we are is mages without pets and a little better chance of landing a spell and praying that we even get to scribe new spells while they buy em.<br>
<br>
 I want to summon some bandaids plzktnx<br>
<br>
 Fact: we have one spell that is 300 more (un aa un focussed) dmg then mages that we all have a shot at.<br>
<br>
 Mages can purchase their big boom, we cannot<br>
<br>
 Mages have better DPS then us<br>
<br>
 Mages can have a pet and we cannot<br>
<br>
 Wizards ports are damn near obsolete<br>
<br>
 95% of wizards will never see GSS or EER<br>
 <br>
 We are the masters of what ..  screw your &quot;but its a bolt&quot; deal, they now keep up with us nuking.<br>
<br>
 There should be a seperation between wizards and mages as far as ANY (bolt or not) nuke goes and it should be just as hard for them to get this nuke as it is for me to get EER  SS or GSS IMO.<br>
<br>
 With the release of PoP we all will see AT nuthing else is for sure as far as big dmg, so at a raid, if I was making one up to kill a single boss mob that needed downed fast, I would take a mage first for their DPS and nukes . . but i though we were the masters of DMG?<br>

Now with PoP, i really dont see any reason to have a wizard in a group. It's very evident in valor and other pop zones where dps is crucial to exp farming efficiency.  One of our supposely best spells, the icespear buff is a major disappointment too.<br>
<br>
Just answer this, with enc/clr/tank as a must for the first 3 spots in pop, why would a group take a wizard over a mage? a rogue? a necro?  I cant think of any....<br>

This is the same debate thats been raging between mages and wizards since the beginning of EQ. Wizards insist they are supposed to be the Masters of Damage but thats not entirely true. Verant has said time and time again Wizards are masters of Direct Damage and that is true you have the largest selection of direct damage from the big boom to the low resist nukes and have innate crits and an innate lowering of a chance to be resisted. That is your advantage in nuking. <br>
<br>
Now most mages would agree that the bolt shouldnt of been vendor sold. Unfortunately its too late to change that so some wizards want to get it nerfed and believe me after the crap mages have gone through the last thing we want to hear is the word nerf again so of course we are going to defend it as much as we can.<br>
<br>
Instead of trying to get another class nerfed why not work towards making GSS more attainable. <br>
<br>
  I think a lot of wizards have gotten too comfortable in their positions since kunark if you all remember correctly Mages outdamaged you by a large margin Pre kunark and that changed with kunark. .<br>
<br>
 Look back pre 50 at your spells and magicians spells and imagine if you will what you would be in comparison to magicians if 50 was as high as you could go. That is essentially where we are headed once again to a more pre kunark ranking of casters. Honestly where would Magicians be right now if we had an increase such as we had in the other expansions. Whether you agree or not Magicians got bent over at just about every expansion that we had. We were thrown a single spell that made us needed only to have it nerfed later on for being unbalancing. Lets take a walk down memory lane in more detail.<br>
<br>
Kunark: Magicians didnt scale we almost essentially stayed at the same power level that we were in the old game only just a little bit better our top nuke pre kunark 810 our top nuke post kunark 1024 only a little over a 200 pt nuke increase which was rather pathetic. While melees got a huge increase in power in the forms of equip. We were given a spell that ensured us a spot in raids and groups in the form of Coth.<br>
 <br>
Velious: This expansion was pretty much a big FU to magicians, the mobs had insane resists our new spells were nothing short of pure crap. Once again 0 power increases to mages and then to top it all off they nerfed our only good spell Coth. Magicians became the gimps of Eq following this expansion and many people abandoned their mage to start another classe and the only time they were online was to be a ferry to other classes.<br>
<br>
Luclin: This expansion made people dust off their previously unused mages because of Trods. Of course that was the only true bright spot of this expansion at the beginning but eventually Verant got their heads out of their asses for a change and realized that Mages werent anything without their pet so they made some changes to them and we were happy for a time. Then came the infamous Trod nerf right before the next expansion which had mages fingers on bringing out their alts again.<br>
<br>
PoP: OMG magicians finally get a true power increase in this expansion yet we did lose our ability to efficently solo due to the new exp caps. While other classes can still use their kiting tricks very well in the new expansion we cant the mobs have lower hps than in luclin but tear our pets up pretty fast if we try to solo. We gave up soloing for damage and all is well in mage land for the most part.<br>
<br>
I understand your hatred towards us because of Firebolt of Tallon but believe me eventually spells will become more and more available and the fact that this is a vendor sold spell will no longer be an issue. Yes alot mages are thinking short term and wondering if they should change specs and if sun vortex stayed evoc then yes many mages would of changed specs to evoc, Im sure, but since our DDs, which we use much more often than our bolts, are conj it will make most mages stick with conjuration once they start using them.<br>
<br>
I used to be guilty of the grass is greener thing but would you really start a mage over a wizard at this point. Its one thing to see spell lists and see a person play a Mage and its a whole other thing to actually play a Mage. I can almost guarantee you that after getting to lev 51 you would be about ready to give it up and just say screw it.<br>
