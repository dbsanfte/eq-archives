<br>
Actually, why didn't the GM just log in using a normal character?<br>
<br>
It would be funny if the GMs could rearrange the vendor's inventory. Instead of buying the components for the tradeskill item, they'd buy expensive components that they can't use. I suppose a good macro would detect this and possibly continue working fine.<br>
<br>
What SOE should do is log unusual transactions. If a player's platinum increases more than a certain amount each time their player is saved, flag it. Flag them with a higher value as the plat intake proportionately exceeds the norm or if they exceed the &quot;plat intake threshold&quot; several times within a short period of time. Sort the list and go investigate those who have the highest flag alert values.<br>
<br>
Same thing for items. If you acquire an unusually large number of items within a time period, flag them. The threshold of course would be based on how rare the items are (or how hard they are for skilled players to find).<br>
<br>
Of course there are hundreds of other methods to make it tough for players to cheat/exploit or to control undesirable behaviors of players (such as spamming or harassing). Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be a high priority at SOE. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
My understanding is that there is a very limited window between performing the hack and being banned; though EverQuest's Customer Service is often times (and rightly so) ridiculed for its crawling pace in customer arbitration and request resolution, the one thing that they have proven themselves to be notoriously efficient at is banning and suspending accounts for even suspected cheating. Hackers perform most of their hacks, from what I have read, using memory offsets client-side to fool the server. The problem with this, recently, has been that SOE has kept server-side checks that now automatically suspend accounts that are flagged as memory-triggered. The speed with which this is done has been amazing, and many times, to the unfortunate detriment of an innocent player who was victim to nothing more than client/server desync. (I'm sure that many of you recall vividly the spate of erroneous suspensions and bannings a while ago, and it was something that Abashi attributed to new anti-hacking security measures.) <br>
<br>
Given this reality, the window of opportunity between having performed a platinum hack and successfully transferring the platinum to a mule or a willing customer, is greatly reduced, and most often times unsuccessful. There are, of course, exceptions. But from what I know, the most common way to generate insane amounts of platinum by cheating the system is through the use of macro'ing and trade skills. Thusly, the problem is not really cheaters using false accounts to generate their platinum -- it's the fact that cheaters can use accounts that they have had for years, face little chance of getting caught in their scheme, and end up profitting disproportionately, while at the same time sending the game economy periodically skewed when they participate in it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pickkpockket999>Pickk Pockket999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hacking</span><hr size=1> The trick is to write a program that hooks the dll's themselves. Have the program report back on some high odd numbered port (like the 11k+ range). This prevents almost all remotely performed memory checks from discovering your program (as a bonus it also will not show up in the process list if you do things correctly). I do a lot of programming for my job but I am afraid to say this is one area I am very weak in so I am not 100% sure how it works. I had someone explain it to me a few weeks ago and I got the general gist of it.<br>
<br>
Of course once you are getting this crafty there is really no need for you to be wasting your time programming hacks for EQ, you could make more money doing it for some company.<br>
<br>
There are a number of less obvious money making schemes as well. For instance you can write a program to hunt hill giants in Rathe Mountains for you (there is one out there that already does this). If you are the appropriate class it will track and hunt them down (you don't need track for this to work), it will kill them via fear kiting or snare kiting and then loot the platinum. You can even have it port to PoK and bank then gate back when overencumbered. To avoid detection if someone sends you a tell have a response generated in a rare foregin language saying that you do not understand what they are saying (something like Swahili is good). This will bypass 99.9% of detection checks by GMs and other players.<br>
<br>
I know this sounds incredibly intricate but believe me macros exactly like this are out there. Xylobot has one macro that plays your two boxed character for you. Typically it is a shaman and it follows you around, slows the mobs, sticks a dot or two on and heals you when you are low on life. You can send it group tells &quot;Shaman give me focus please&quot; and it responds with the appropriate buff. Really powerful stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ezelenvheknar>Ezelen VhekNar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/22/03 9:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hacking</span><hr size=1> basically, making your second character into an npc instead?<br>

nifty idea. i mean, its just coding NPC AI, taking input from the computers memory (oh, and if its just reading information from the memory, there are no traces for serverside checksums to find, just as long as it doesnt modify) and you could use hooked mouse/keyboard drivers to input.<br>
<br>
or, so that you dont lose functionality of your computer, you could just have a front end type program to send mouse/keyboard input to everquest, that was being genearted by the AI program instead of the actual keyboard/mouse.<br>

But, ultimately, a GM takes the decision to ban someone and it can take a while for them to gather evidence that overturns the 'innocent until proved guilty' stance they have now (verses the 'guilty until proved innocent' VI had, which many complained about but yet people here are hinting SOE should be taking).
