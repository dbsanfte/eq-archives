A lot of people are really rich on Mith Marr... 100K plat is nothing, honestly.<br>

STandard melee weapons are going for very little plat.<br>
Zlandicars heart going for 40K, an hierophant cloak going for 20K and less.<br>

<br>
Well, first Mith Marr is indeed a server with the majority of players beeing level 51 plus, to be more accurate 55 plus. (90% of the server i would assume. Sure,there are some level 40ish as well, but those are the minority. And i didn't count in low level twinks here. Was talking about mains.)<br>
<br>
Uberguilds... hm well depends upon definition.<br>
<br>
Afterlife is for sure the classic uberguild on Mith Marr.<br>
<br>
Then comes Forsaken Realm and a japanese Guild (with more than 150 active players, all level 59, 60) and a bunch of other 'uberguilds'.<br>
I would guess there are about 10 level 55 plus guild out. (With an average active membership of 70 people and more.)<br>
<br>
People getting tired of their mains. They play a lot of twinks. Even casters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Tboots are really avaiable for most players, Goladus. This 5 to 7K are no big deal. Only a few poor individuals, mostly casual players, can't afford them with theirmains beeing in the 40ish range. But those are, as i said the minority.<br>
<br>
So, please don't say it is so off that melee twinks running around in Velious quest armor.<br>
In fact, the first destination where you head to, is one of those places to get your meleer some nice quest armor.<br>
<br>
Guilds are fighting over high level zones, that's incredible allmost on this server.<br>
Keep in mind, it's a really old server with one of the oldest 'uber guilds'.<br>

It seems like what some of you are saying that if there were items available that could twink a wizard as effectively as a warrior you would consider yourselves balanced.  I don't know that I don't agree, but there is another issue no one is addressing that did not become apparent until I started playing a warrior.  <br>
<br>
There is value in utility spells.  Verant has mentioned utility spells more than once as a reason not to upgrade caster damage, and why they think balancing casters is harder than melee.  I'm starting to agree with them.  What value do you place on an invisibility spell, or sow?  They might both save your bacon, in any given situation.  They obviously have some value, but how much?  Can you really negate that value and call a warrior balanced if their is an item in the game that has a right click invis effect?  I don't have that item!  What about me?  How do you balance the game with items?  Especially in a game where some items are so hard to get, requiring inordinate amounts of time and effort.  Time might just be the only measurement we have to apply to utility spells.  Then must we convert our time value into part of the damage balance equation?<br>
<br>
How much time does having sow save you, or teleport?  Compare that to the downtime a warrior experiences by not having these things.  How much would a warrior pay for a teleport across norrath saving him an hour long CR, or the invis to reach his corpse in a dungeon?  It's pretty much a given that a warrior is practically defenseless without his gear.  How much time does having your spells back right away save you on a CR?  Should that, and utility spells be taken into account when discussing balance?  I think it should.  To what degree do utility spells factor into the balance equation?  To what degree does gettting your spells back right away upon death factor in?  The ability to bind anywhere saving you a long CR?  I know that warriors also benefit from these spells, but only when they are given to them.  Perhaps that lessens the value we should place on them considering balance between casters and melee.  <br>
<br>
Then we could take it a step further and consider AC.  If a Wizard gets aggro he's dead meat.  Wizards give up a lot of defense for the offense they are supposed to have.  Do they have it?  Perhaps not, but then they aren't supposed to take hits from a mob, so how much damage is appropriate?  It's a hard question to answer.  Should it be more than a warrior?  Well you can read above, and see that there appear to be a lot of variables to consider.  I guess you just have to go with what feels right.<br>
<br>
Balance can also be viewed from several perspectives.  There's PvP, group desirability, and soloability.  I think nobody would argue the wizard is a far better solo class at higher levels.  Should this also factor into the balance equation, or should it be dismissed, since this is a grouping game?  Do you approach balance from all three angles and then take the average, or do you weight one more heavily than the other?  The more I think about it the more I am awed by the tremendous undertaking that is class balance!  Perhaps Verant isn't doing such a bad job after all.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 3581<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 3:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> &quot;It seems like what some of you are saying that if there were items available that could twink a wizard as effectively as a warrior you would consider yourselves balanced.&quot;<br>

How often do you actualy see a low level ubar twink character activily fighting with other people of the same level range?  Hardly ever. A majority of them are powerleveled to the 50+ range very very quickly. Granted, you will see the higher end kunark gear on low-mid range level characters, but the guys with Velious quest armor and weapons? I just don't see a level 10 war carrying a primal wep compeating for spawns in Crushbone.<br>
<br>
 The people that have that kind of gear have the resourses to level to 50+ in under 2 weeks, so they are not as big a problem as you might think. <p>Nalonius Istari <BR> Knights of the Iron Cross <BR> 58 Evoker <BR> The Rathe

<br>
The items available to twinks and at high levels severly overpower this though.<br>
<br>
Luclin is supposed to address this issue by giving caster items that give power to the casters that scales (more mana regen items, faster casting nukes, damage boosting items, etc.)<br>
<br>
This should allow:<br>
<br>
1.) Wizards on the ultra-high end to compete with uber equipped melee for damage output (obviously the uber dragon will drop a 40 % (or whatever) spell haste as opposed to the 25 % spell haste item that drops out of Guk version 4.0: Frogs in space).<br>
<br>
2.) Pre-50 wizards to be &quot;twinked&quot; as effectively as melee classes. Imagine dropping a 500 damage shock of frost (or ice, or whatever the hell the level 34 nuke was) instead of the 300 odd that it currently does. <br>

Start on some random server of adequate age.  Start your favorite melee character (disctinction between the warrior and hybrids doesn't start to matter until much later).  Hunt skeletons, bats, and spiders to get plat, then buy the best weapon you can.  Find an aspiring tailor to outfit you in leather for peanuts, and *boom* a moderately twinked character.<br>
<br>
These sorts of characters *are* appearing in experience groups, and players notice the difference another tank makes versus a wizard. Note that I have done the above, and it wasn't very hard.  Note also that because of all the time I'd played the game on Povar, I had a much better idea about which weapons to get and how much to pay for them, etc.<br>

A non-twink warrior dies when looked at by a non-twink wizard. <br>
Thats just the truth<br>
More truth is the wizard can get his skills up by siting(figurativaly) and casting spells on himself for a long time with no risk, whereas the lvl 40 warrior who cant hit anything and gets hit alot because his skill is shit, whell, he just has to grin and bear it because there is no magic(litarally) way to bust his skills up.  And when his equip is right for his lvl he is just a guy with shit skills.  <br>
<br>
I started non-twink and i got angry at twinks, but then i found them just bitter because they only get change to themselves with new equip and with no better equip until 50s he is angry.  A caster gets new spells every 4 or so lvls. <br>
<br>
its all personal preferance.<br>

<br>
It's not twinking, it's an artifact of MUDflation.<br>
<br>
And, yes, a canny/research-oriented newbie could indeed thrive as a tank that way on any server. And for an older player, it's even easier: They've had to get draconian with tradeskills because people were in plate armor on Sullon Zek within a week, and in banded on FV (non-PVP, so the push wasn't quite the same) in about the same time.<br>
<br>
I think VI has indeed gotten caught halfway between designing for a new server and trying to meet the demands of an older populace. And the needs conflict, strongly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1321<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/30/01 4:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My eyes have been opened!</span><hr size=1> Moving this to class Balance.

<br>
I think it takes a special sort of person to subject themself to that sort of play. As I said before, I just dont get it. So I will never be able to compare the two. <br>

<br>
The game is not entirely about walking through a zone alone where a green mob may attack you. It is also about grouping and dungeon crawling where all the useful loot drops and better xp is had. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=598.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=598.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=598.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=598.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=598.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=598.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=598.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=598.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
