I was able to create a model I could use to tweak values and see the effect on a wizard in a group setting. I will first provide a very brief summary of the problem, present my proposed changes, show the effect graphically, and then follow up with a lengthy FAQ that attempt to address all questions and objections. Please feel free to poke holes in this proposal before I package it up and send it off to Verant.<br>
<br>
1. The Problem<br>
Wizards have reported difficulty in getting spots in conventional experience groups at all levels. The main reason for this is an inherent inability have a sustained damage output which matches that of a melee class of the same level. This is due primarily to &quot;mudflation&quot; with the influx of higher quality melee equipment especially at the lower levels. Since there is a severe lack of wizard equipment which will adjust wizard damage output in any meaningful way, especially at the lower levels, this creates an environment where players level up seeing wizards poor performance and so acquire a bias against them. There is a bubble from 49-52 where wizards actually perform fairly well, but by then the bias is so well ingrained that players don't notice.<br>
<br>
The following chart presents the situation as it is currently, comparing a wizard from levels 4-60 with the main offensive melee classes: warrior, monk, and rogue. I've also added data for a wizard using a right click nuke -- solist's Wand for levels 4-57 (!!), Robe of Torrefaction for levels 58-59, and a Robe of Invocation at level 60:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~dmoen/wizdps.htm">home.attbi.com/~dmoen/wizdps.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Pay particular attention to the 25/60 and 30/60 charts, which reflects the range where most experience groups lie. (25/60 means the group is actually engaged in combat for 25 minutes out of every 60, etc.)<br>
<br>
2. The Solution<br>
There are only a couple things that need to be done:<br>
a) Reduce casting cost of all DDs by 25%<br>
b) Add a new droppable right click nuking item, usable starting at level 20, which does 135 dmg with an 8 second casting time. In the chart this is called the &quot;Robe of Mystery.&quot; This item should be about as hard to acquire as a Lamentation or Jade Mace.<br>
c) Make the Orb of Torrefaction (from Velk) droppable... also, move it to a mob that doesn't require a semi-uber guild to kill. This is the wizard version of the JBB, and it should be about as common. As long as it is only usable at levels 51+, balance is maintained.<br>
d) Decrease the cast time on the Robe of Invocation to 11 seconds.<br>
<br>
In addition, there are a few things that *should* be done:<br>
e) Eliminate the level cap for landing spells on mobs (at least for landing DDs).<br>
f) Reduce agro from DD spells across the board.<br>
g) Allow all classes to meditate while standing (see below for discussion of details on this).<br>
h) Reduce the cast time on the Velious Robes to somewhere around 15-18 seconds.<br>
<br>
Below is a link to the chart which shows the effects of the above changes:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~dmoen/fixwiz.htm">home.attbi.com/~dmoen/fixwiz.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
3. Discussion<br>
This proposal would not overpower wizards. For 25/60, an item equipped wizard does a little better than a monk, and at 30/60, an item equipped wizard generally does worse than a monk, but better than a warrior. Note that an itemless wizard performs worse than a warrior at all levels but 49-51 at 30/60.  Wizards do very well in slow pull groups (20/60) but really start to lag in groups that have more than 50% uptime.<br>
<br>
The most important change is the reduction in mana cost by 25%. In general, it will increase the damage over time by wizards in groups (and on raids) by 33%. It will magnify the effects of any mana regeneration effects by the same amount. This change would do absolutely nothing for the maximum full burn damage rate for wizards. Note that full burn damage could use some adjustment as well, given that full burn rate for a wizard at 60 is 150 dps, while a well equipped rogue doing backstab can approach that. You could achieve the same shape to the graph by increasing damage for all DDs by 33% as by reducing their cost by 25%, and this would have the side effect of increasing a wizard's maximum full burn damage rate. Perhaps the best solution is a mix of the two effects which result in the same 33% efficiency boost.  As for why one number is 25% and the other is 33%, well, that's simply math. For a damage multiplier we apply 4/3, while for spell cost we apply 3/4 -- same multipliers, but in one case we are modifying the multiplier (damage) while in the other we are affecting the divisor (mana cost), hence the inversion of the factors.<br>
<br>
Adding and modifying right click nukes is probably the best way to combat the social effects that twinking and mudflation are having on wizards. The proposals above are samples that made the shape of the curve look good. There is a serious dearth of right click nukes for wizards, and even the Solist's Wand, though very good for lower levels, is rare and does not completely close the gap with today's twinks. The item suggestions made in this document are merely examples and should not be construed as literal solutions. The best item solution is likely to add around 20 or so different right click nukes at various power levels to make them more common and give players more options and flexibility in customizing their character.<br>
<br>
Recommendations 2e-2h are not reflected in the chart, because they would not actually have any effect on it.<br>
<br>
Eliminating the level cap for DDs gets rid of a severe drawback for wizards in pickup groups, especially at lower levels, where melee in higher level gear can pull and sucessfully tackle deep red cons, while wizards in the group can literally do nothing but try to exercise their feeble melee skills. At a minimum, the range for automatic resists should be the same as the formula used for determining when a groupmate is too low level to gain experience (1.5 * level). That would prevent the situation where higher level groupmates are pulling even or blue cons that wizards cannot affect with spells because of the level cap.<br>
<br>
Reduction in agro is needed because int casters have the lowest defense and wizards are already riding the agro line. Reducing it by the same amount as the reduction in mana cost (25%) would keep the line in the same relative place and so keep the agro gameplay dynamics very similar to their current levels.<br>
<br>
Allowing casters to meditate while standing will eliminate the distinction from a wizard on a horse and a wizard without a horse -- currently a very odd distinction indeed. I've long thought that sit agro is stupid, though I understand that there is a good reason to have it when players are camping out to hasten a CR... this is a silly meta-gaming concept that really breaks the immersion, so I can understand leaving sit agro in to at least make camping out a more challenging endeavor. Allowing casters to regain mana at meditation rates while standing would remove my objection to sit agro. Implement this by allowing players to click the meditate button (or type /meditate) while standing. Use the same rules for breaking hide for determining when meditate automatically goes off (moving, casting, or attacking). If there is still a desire to keep the open spellbook requirement for lower levels, then don't allow use of this ability until level 35. Finally, implement horse meditation in the same fashion. While this would be a &quot;nerf,&quot; I'm not entirely certain that the current horse meditation rules make a lot of sense, and would feel better about a more consistent set of rules.<br>
<br>
As for reduction on the cast times on the Velious Quest robes... this is sort of a &quot;well, duh!&quot; kind of suggestion. As it is, for almost all circumstances, the velious robes are actually inferior to little Solist's Wand. Reducing the cast time to the 15-18 second level would make them somewhat useful, but not in an unbalanced fashion.<br>
<br>
4. Methodology<br>
I will just briefly cover my methodology and the main formulas in my model here. For a more complete discussion, please visit the following thread on graffe.com:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=603.topic">pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffe...=603.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Comparing mana to melee is a challenging task, in part because mana classes need downtime to recharge while melee classes can keep going as long as a healer keeps them propped up. Melee are fond of parsing their damage output and citing their dps numbers. However, no group is able to keep a constant stream of foes to allow melee to actually achieve their theorhetical numbers. This introduced the first variable... uptime. I took a few logs and paid attention to how active it &quot;felt.&quot; I determined that fighting 1/3 of the time was fairly common, led to some idle downtime (when fm and searching for a pull). I also took a few logs where we were engaged in combat 50% of the time, and these groups felt rather frantic, like I hardly had a chance to catch my breath. The fact that a fast group was only engaged 50% of the time surprised me, but there were short spurts in such groups where we were fighting 60+% of the time. Some players have claimed uptimes of 95% or higher, but based on my research, I dismiss such claims as absurd. I will note, however, that multi group engagements (such as trash clearing for a raid) tend to have much more measurable uptime, but in these cases you can have multiple pullers, mezzers, and healers, so it really is not a very useful measurement of sustainable output in a group environment.<br>
<br>
Once you break down the uptime into separate categories, it is relatively trivial to predict melee damage output. Simply multiply the melee raw dps rate by the uptime, and you get what I've termed &quot;Total Damage Per Second&quot;, or tdps. This will also allow comparison to mana damage output, as you can assume that wizards are meditating during downtime. I also determined that some meditation occured during combat, but not during the entire combat. I assumed that in most cases, wizards would be able to meditate half of the time engaged, and that gave a fairly good approximation we could use for mana regen over the course of a standard camp. It turns out that more uptime leads to less meditation, and hence lower raw damage output because the wizard will have less mana total to use for the entire session (and hence less overall damage). The mana damage model does not take into account cast time, but I found that not to be a factor we needed to control for.<br>
<br>
Accounting for right click nukes was the second, and more difficult challenge. The problem is that with the longer cast time, the length of the fight started to become a big issue. It is very difficult to predict whether the nuke will be needed by the time it lands, or even if the mob will still be alive. This tends to vary with the average length of the fight, so I had to derive a formula which would model this, and then add another variable which accounted for the average length of the fight. Adding this to the graph would add a 4th dimention, and make it extremely difficult to comprehend, so I just added a knob for it at the beginning, set it at 45 seconds (which is on the long side for experience groups) and left it at that. The other main change in the formula is that the right clicking wizard will generally not be meditating at all in combat, so in combat meditation was factored out. Finally, for all right click nukes, I added a second to the cast time to account for control delay. For more details of this formula, please visit the thread listed at the top of this section.<br>
<br>
There are many other variables that control damage output of a group. For melees this is the primarily the weapons used and presense of haste items and buffs.  For my data points I used melee data taken from players in their low 50s, and a few at level 60 (members of my guild). I also took some samples from my warrior at level 18 and 20 using moderate twink items (FBSS, blackjack (7/21), light velium warsword (10/23), and a 33/51 2hs at level 20). All of these items are attainable for 5k or less on Povar, which means a level 50 player could twink a lowbie with these items easily. I also added a control for the presense of an enchanter, and assumed that the enchanter would be using their best haste for the level. Note that the level 50 characters were likely in &quot;normal&quot; gear rather than &quot;uber&quot; gear, so their numbers might be a bit on the low side. For the graphs presented above, I assumed the presense of an enchanter for both melee and wizard, using their best buffs for the level. I also gave the melee a good haste item at fairly low levels (making them &quot;twinks&quot;), but this can be changed on the controls on the first screen to more reasonable levels. Other melee values are acquired by doing a linear interpolation between the set points.<br>
<br>
In general, the values used for melee are conservative assuming high end, but attainable, gear for the level. This means that, in general, equalling or exceeding the predicted melee value with a mana class does not necessarily mean that you are &quot;better&quot; than that class. It is used primarily as a balancing benchmark, and some melee with &quot;good&quot; gear will perform better or worse than the metric provided, but should average somewhere near the predicted value assuming that it is against blue or light blue cons.<br>
<br>
For wizard damage, the numbers are fairly agressive, meaning that exceeding the predicted value is attainable, but will occur rarely. It already takes into account specialization, resists, partial resists, fizzles, concussion casts, and mana wasted on a corpse. If you always wait for resist debuffs, never nuke a corpse, watch your agro better (so don't cast concussion), and meditate more effectively, your average numbers might be a bit better than the predicted values, but not by more than 5% or so.  I used 90% effectiveness for spells, and assumed that the wizard was using their most efficient spell line for the level. Note that this may not be practical in some situations (for example, our most effective spells at 60 are cold based, but are fairly useless in most of Velious). Also, at levels below 60, 90% effectiveness is probably very optimistic. I added a control on the first page so this can be tuned.<br>
<br>
For all calculations, I assumed that the wizard was using only their best DD, and was not responsible for snare, stun, or evac. This also makes the wizard numbers look a little better, but is the best configuration to use for comparing melee to mana.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet I used is downloadable (zipped excel format). It can be found at the following URL:<br>

<br>
5. FAQ<br>
a) Why doesn't this take into account wizard utility spells like snare and evac?<br>
Snare and evac don't enter into the equation at all until level 29.  Also, when a wizard is on snare duty, mana spent on snare and managing the extra agro generated will reduce wizard damage output by around 20%. Evacuate is a nice skill for some sitations. These skills do add to a wizard's utility in a group, but players always neglect to mention the ability that melee classes bring to a group because it is taken for granted: the ability to tank. This ability is more important than snare and evac for conventional groups, so comparing damage straight up between the offensive casters (wizards) and offensive tanks seems to make sense.<br>
<br>
b) You say wizards can't get into groups, but I've never had any trouble. Maybe it's you.<br>
Everquest is primarily a social game. Players will always prefer to group with friends over strangers, so it's not surprising that some players never have trouble getting a group. Some players could play the jester class and still have no trouble getting groups. What we are addressing here is the ability to get into a pickup group, and the numbers support what some players have been reporting: wizard damage output doesn't keep up with today's tanks.<br>
<br>
c) What about ports?<br>
Ports are a nice class ability, but do very little to help a wizard get into groups, other than being able to advertise nuking services in multiple zones. Foraging is a nice class ability too, but it won't help you get a group.<br>
<br>
d) Won't this unbalance wizards for soloing?<br>
It will make wizards more effective when soloing singles, but where wizards excel is when quad kiting, and these proposed changes have zero effect on that.  Spell cost reductions apply to DDs only, and not AE spells or snares.<br>
<br>
e) But aren't wizards supposed to do worse in groups? After all, they are the kings of quadding!<br>
Quadding can't be done effectively until level 29 (34 really). Also, this is a social game. Saying that a class is fine and balanced because they can do solo play works at odds with the social goals of the game. Make grouping more viable for wizards is a good thing all around. Also, high end melee are finding that they can solo as well or better than quadding wizards.<br>
<br>
f) Ah, but wizards can do AE groups! That alone balances them!<br>
Ok, I'll be the first to admit that AE groups are a ton of fun, but the kill rate for an AE group is somewhere around 16/person/hour, about the same as a soloing wizard or melee. They are better than conventional groups, and there is more demand for wizards than melee in them.  Just three cautionary words on this however: &quot;Remember The Grey.&quot;<br>
<br>
g) Why didn't you use rains?<br>
Rain spells theorhetically have better performance than DDs, but my personal feeling is that the higher resists makes them a wash when compared against DDs.  Some have done logs which bore this out, but I did not do the measurements myself. In addition, they are more challenging to use, especially when working around a chanter's mezzed mobs. There is a time and place when these spells are by far the best tool for the job (mostly when trying to do fast damage), but grind grouping is not one of them.<br>
<br>
h) Ah that reminds me. Wizards are the best at *fast damage*. Does your model account for that?<br>
Well, no. I do have two points to make on this however: First, melee weapons have advanced to the point where they are able to achieve 50% or better of the damage rate of a wizard on full burn, which means 2 tanks will &quot;burn down&quot; a mob as well or better than a wizard. Second, the value of this skill is really reduced by the mezmerize skill. Burning down adds with fast damage or AE would seem to be the obvious case where variable damage is needed, but when you are engaging mobs one at a time, the difference in the damage rate becomes a much less useful skill. Also, a wizard on full burn who does outdamage everyone else will almost always acquire agro, where our low defense erm, reduces our damage output in short order. Concussion helps, but it's value diminishes as we level, and it's use automatically reduces our damage rate by virtue of the need to interleave Concussion and DDs. Make this skill more useful in more circumstances, then we can talk.<br>
<br>
i) What happens if you add bard mana regen and Protection of the Glades?<br>
I did a spreadsheet that takes this into account. Using best bard song and glades at level 60. This is with the current values, and you can see that the balance picture looks a lot better with these buffs up. However, a group of 6 that has 3 members casting mana regen buffs on the wizard is rather extreme and isn't a practical metric to use for comparison:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~dmoen/maxwiz.htm">home.attbi.com/~dmoen/maxwiz.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
j) Do you assume that FT items stack?<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
k) Does this take the Luclin AA skills into account?<br>
I added controls for spell casting fury and mental clarity on the first page, but did not turn them on. Remember that melee classes get AA skills that improve their damage output also. Apples and apples please. Finally, AA skills really only come into play post 60, and most of the wizard balance issues occur before then.<br>
<br>
l) Won't this make wizards even better in raids, where they don't need any help?<br>
Well, yes. I haven't done a full analysis on this, but preliminary analysis has seemed to indicate that while wizards do very well against boss mobs currently, the performance gap is not as great as most believe. Also, adjusting the mana cost will not allow wizards to nuke harder, but they will be able to nuke longer.<br>
<br>
m) Hey, what about mages, necros, and enchanters?<br>
These classes all have valid issues as well, but hey, I'm only one elf! Gimme a break here!<br>
<br>
n) Are you single? Are you available? Will you cyber me?<br>
Yes, Yes, and No <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

I like it. Well written with a lot of facts to support your conclussions. I would recommend sending in the logs you parsed as well, let them do their own math. One interesting thing I have found after parsing my own logs is that even in an uncontrolled environment I have achieved similar results. I think it would be very easy to reproduce your findings to bear out the numbers you have come up with.<br>

Reducing mana cost of spells by 25% would allow a wizard to do more damage on a full bar of mana, but it would take him about 33% longer to empty that bar. The *rate* of damage (commonly called dps, or in my case, raw dps) would remain the same.<br>

Time and again, Verants response was the same. We feel the wizard class is balanced, while nothing is perfect and slight twinks one way or the another might occur, the wizard fits the vision. This is especially true in terms of damage output.<br>

Haven't seen as many, as some of the older wizards here. But that is damn well argued and very well balanced in its advocacy of wizards. You manage to be critical without coming off as an idealogical zealot. What's more is I think Whiz is right about the charts and the relative brevity.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I think--should you decide to send this off to VI--you will get some good criticism from some of the serious EQ intellectuals on this board. As a writer, I can not overemphasize how important peer criticism is when shaping a document. You don't have to get involved in any sort of back and forth with people on the board. Incorporate the criticism that you believe to be valid, and politely decline the rest.<br>
<br>
One suggestion, I think that FAQ section works really well because you get to do the anticipitory rebuttal thing that shows you arent evidence that may seem to counter your argument. This is another place that even seemingly invalid criticism can help. Even if you don't agree with a paticular argument against your document, you can still throw it in that FAQ, if you can see how someone would come to believe it.<br>

Armok starts off the whole thread comparing wizard damage to melee damage in sustained damage scenarios. If It had been my post, I would have also shown that its not just melees who smoke us, its also mages and necros, putting us at near the bottom of the list for getting spaces in conventional exp groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
EQ doesnt suck for casters, Ive never said anything even close to that. Much to the contrary, EQ is a game ruled by Druids and Necros for the most part.<br>
<br>
My point is simple ~ Wizards were broken for a long long time, the main point of the author's post has been metioned, documented and explained to death by previous wizards, and dismissed by Verant repeatedly.<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s.<br>
<br>
I think the most hopeful point mentioned thus far is like whizbang says, times change.<br>
<br>
At the root of this issue is one simple point:<br>
<br>
Verant said:<br>
&quot;When it comes to dishing out damage, wizards have no rival.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was never true, not under anything but the most limited and extreme circumstance. While maybe its becoming arguably more accurate with luclin, its still not true, and the longer the fight goes, the more obvious that becomes.<br>
<br>
Abashi once tried to explain that description (note, verant changed that description at least 3 times prior to the most recent revamp of their webpage) by stating the following (rough translation, i cant find the post atm)<br>
<br>
&quot;That means wizards can do the most damage in X amount of time. It never meant that wizards could do more damage in a full bar of mana than other casters, in fact, almost all other casters can outdamage wizards.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's the vision apparently. In terms of a single shot nuke, not counting debuffs or pet damage in the same amount of time, apparently wizards meet the vision. (Of course, thats not even true either, because there are level gaps during which mages can out nuke us, etc).<br>
<br>
But, if you take a level 60 wizard, and stand them up against other casters, yes they have a bigger nuke and in the time it takes to cast that nuke, they can outdamage other casters (discounting pets and resists, etc).<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
Yeah, I can get behind this post, but dont let your panties get tied in a knot when I lay out some truth ~ its all been said before, there is nothing new here, its just packaged differently. Maybe Verant's position will change with time, but thats what we have to expect. <br>
<br>
All im saying is, dont lose grasp of reality in getting excited about a very well written post ~ there have been others and those have been dismissed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umezmoriah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mezmoriah</A> at: 1/3/02 5:33:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uetnu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>etnu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1080<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/3/02 7:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> Nice post Armok (not that I read the whole thing mind you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

It just wasn't worth it. Casters need nice clicky items at the mid-levels in my opinion, it's nice to get some toys to encourage you to keep playing.<br>

So far, I think this is a fantastic piece of work. I think Item Drops could do a lot to balance mudflation.<br>
<br>
The groups thing is dead on. I tried to get a group for a week in DL - sans extensive friend and guild support, because I wanted to see the cart from the other (pick up group) end. Needless to say - my apolgies and condolences all around. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I too am a very social person, and I met a few new people that I had a lot of fun with, but by in large it was an experiment of frustration.<br>

Not scientific of course, but there it is none the less. <p><center>
