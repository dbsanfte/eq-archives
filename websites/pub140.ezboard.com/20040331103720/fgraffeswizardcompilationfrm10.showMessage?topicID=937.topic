Really this is a vent that I, as a 55th level Wizard feel I can sustain less damage than many other damage dealing classes)<br>
<br>
I've been playing EQ now only since November 2002.  I'm have reached 55 levels of experience and should reach the 56th soon (no AA's yet).  I have spent much time reading these boards in learning my place as a Wizard as I am solo, grouped, or in a raid.<br>
<br>
Before playing EQ I beat the single player campaign of Neverwinter Nights (based off of AD&amp;D rules).  I played it through as a Fighter.  After beating Neverwinter I played around with other classed besides Fighter and discovered I really enjoyed the Wizard class.  I could cast the all but legendary magic missle, freeze time, morph myself into a dragon, hasten others and/or myself (haste in D&amp;D is movement and attack speed), unlock doors, summon monsters, and have my familiar fight beside me.  Also, depending on the type of familiar I chose, the familiar could fight like a warrior (if a panther) or disarm traps (if a pixie).  <br>
<br>
I jumped into EQ eager to play and chose the class of Wizard based off of my past experience as a Wizard.  I remember hunting outside Felwithe and seeing a caster like myself running by with a sword and shield animation thinking to myself, &quot;I must find that spell!  How cool would that be?&quot;  However, after spending a little more time reading castersrealm and Graffe's I realized I was not an enchanter and I would never have a sword and shield running around to protect me.<br>
<br>
The versatility of the Wizard I enjoyed from D&amp;D does not exist.  I am student of the Arcane, but yet the class has the mentality of Beavis (Heh heh, heh heh, fire is cool.  I like blowing up stuff though, so that mentality is not all bad)  It seems what I so enjoyed about being a D&amp;D Wizard is now broken up into Enchanter, Magician, and Wizard.  I don't know why these 3 classes were not just left alone as what lore leaves as the traditional sorcerer/wizard/caster.  But, what is done is done (D&amp;D characters don't fit into EQ, for instance, the god-like high level Monk can solo all but the mightiest dragons).<br>
<br>
I now understand my roll of causing damage, and that I am not a &quot;pet class&quot; or a &quot;buffing class&quot;.  I do not want to be another class: druid, cleric, enchanter, shaman, etc.  There is always something good any of those classes can do in a group.  I love having a druid in my group as the cleric can focus on the main tank, and the druid can bail me out with a heal if I get agro.  I like the idea of playing a wizard as they exist in EQ.  It is not quite as rewarding these days though.  The pennacle of my wizardry was 49 when I got ice comet.  I could go and hunt with a group just inside Kanor's Castle and watch with glee as my ice comet landed and remove about a quarter of a given mobs hit points.  Now, I can be in Plane of Nightmare; cast two draughts of fire on a mob and wonder if I actually saw damage done or if that was just the health bar of the mob going down from the melees pounding on it (maybe it would seem more pronounced with 1320 dmg happening at once instead of two 660 nukes back to back).<br>
<br>
I know good and well that a wizard can do more than nuke.  We can stun, evac, crowd control with roots, snare, cast my level 34 damage shield, port, and the only class that can transolcate.  Maybe it is just Planes of Power that make me feel less useful than before.  Many things can not be stunned, evacs lose much of their importance due of graveyards (I love GYs, BTW), and there are no ports in PoP except to the Plane of Knowledge.  Snare is still useful, but there are five classes I can think of with that ability (maybe 6 with Bards).  My ability to cause damage seems much less pronounced since my pre-50 days.<br>
<br>
Couple my perceived lessened damage ability with the durability of any of the int casters.  It takes mere seconds of any planar mob to beat me down to death (I have around 1200hps with only self-buffs).  If I shall have the weakest defense of any character in the game, and my speciality is causing damage through evocation, then I believe my wizard should outdamage any other class.  I expect the wizard to be the mirror of the cleric, who heals like no other class.  Basically, my ability to cause damage needs to compensate for the fact I can not haste the meleers, or heal them, or slow the mob they fight, etc.  (side-note:  The wizard only ability to Translocate and send people home is HUGE in raids.  This is a non-combat ability though, so I don't see it having much relevance on the damage I should be doing) <br>
<br>
Now rather or not the wizard does enough damage to justify their existence is the quesion of class balance.  I don't know if wizards are balanced or not.  I feel at level 55 my wizard is below the melees I group with.  I hear that at 60+ and particularly 63+ I may feel my damage is more respectable.<br>
<br>
I see that balancing the wizards damage is problematic.  If you have 6 warriors in a group, similar level, similar gear; each warrior will have dealt with about 1/6th of a mobs health.  Throw in a wizard, so 5 warriors and 1 wizard.  The warriors strike throught the battle.  I will cast once or twice on a mob and take off some amount of health.  Now put the wizard in a group of enchanter, cleric, wizard, rogue, monk, warrior.  There are really now only 4 people causing damage to the mob, but I will still probably cast the same two spells.  My percent damage done to a mob, dosen't scale as nicely as a melee's damage.  Also, my damage is burst, but in a group encounter, I don't see that is any better or worse than having the damage done slowly; unless the need arises to burn down a mob quickly.<br>
<br>
I think it fair my wizard take down about 1/5 the hitpoints of a given dark blue con mob.  In PoP, if a mob has 10,000 hitpoints, I would like to do 2,000 hitpoints of damage.  It takes me 4 casts of draught of fire to reach that mark (3 is too little, 4 too much).  That's 860 mana or roughly 32% of my 2,700 mana pool.  I can not sustain that on a group that has little down time. Now, the picture can be a little less bleak if rains are landing 2/3 times, but I feel I should be able to do respectable damage with my direct damage spells.  I don't see how my wizard can sustain respectable damage.  Also, there are dark blue cons that have more hitpoints than I can dish out with my most effecient nuke.<br>
<br>
I put up with the difficulties of the class.  Lousy hitpoints and AC, not being able to do what priest classes can do (heal, movement buffs, heck...buffing in general).  All of what sucks about a wizard is supposed to be offset by what they are good at.  With the way the game is right now, and the character that I have, I feel my wizard is a little short changed in the damage department.  Not a lot, just a little.  I am a bit consoled by our ability to gate/port/transolcate/evac, but I don't feel consoled by having the the Al'Kabor line of spells or the best line of self-vision buffs in the game.  I hope I feel like more of a damage contributor later as levels increase and gear gets better.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the people who post to Graffe for sharing their wisdom and thanks in general for letting me vent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azzitay>Azzitay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 1:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ramblings on the masters of evocation</span><hr size=1> A lot of Wizards feel that way ... without Uba Items (FT and Focus) we are really not the Best Damagedealers.<br>
<br>
Sadly i have to say , as a NonRaidguild Wizard you have to<br>
get a Horse and a ID 3 Item to get your Damage in Line.<br>
<br>
Try to make the best out of yourself ... be the best Wizard there is ... and try to find maybe a PBAE Group =P<br>

<br>

<br>
A few tips then to weather out the storm<br>
1- get mage summoned stuff (bracer and earring are very nice) <br>
2- C3 and protection of the glades help out nicely<br>
3- Use tears of solusek to help do dmg for less mana (guess Ill take some flak from this one) but you can do more dmg (1800+)with them for 400mana<br>
<br>
hang in there, youlll make it.<br>
