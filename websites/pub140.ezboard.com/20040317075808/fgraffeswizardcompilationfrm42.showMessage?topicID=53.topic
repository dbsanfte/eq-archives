He had always hated guard duty; nothing to do but watch the forest drakes swoop past and menace the occasional elfie thing that got to close. Nothing to do but wait and go through what in Krog could be considered thinking. So boring, must not fall asleep, then Krog would get bashed by the Captain, yes, must….not…fall….<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So, are you the door guard, or should I just let myself in?” Krog jumped awake, startled by the voice. In front of him stood a tall figure dressed in dark forest green. His hood shadowed his face, and his hand grasped a long wooden stick. Krog snarled.<br>
<br>
“Nasty tall human! Fall before the might of Crushbone!” The orc yelled, raising his club. To his surprise, the figure just chuckled and glowed suddenly blue. Krog felt his feet go numb as his body froze to the ground. His central nervous system at last got the hint, and he blacked out.<br>
<br>
Atelen moved past him and into the tunnel leading to the barricaded glade that the Crushbone Clan called home. The clashing of steel on steel met his ears as he exited the other end of the tunnel, and he emerged right into the middle of a chaotic frenzy. A group of young travelers, mainly wood elves but Atelen recognized the high stature of a Koada’Dal and as if by contrast the balding head of a gnome. They were battling fiercely against the hulking brutes Emperor Crush employed as legionnaires, but were losing ground. Atelen’s shielding spell shimmered as a miss-aimed Frost Bolt slammed into it. Concentrating, he felt the rush of mana through his viens as he wove a complicated gesture. With a deafening crack the sky opened up, pelting hail and ice down on the orcs closest to the group of fighters. “Looked like you could use a little help,” he said, striding forward. The young group stared at him in shock, while the orcs blinked and tried to take in this new turn of events. “I was on my way to speak with D’vinn, and thought I’d lend a ice storm or two. Atelen, by the way.” One of the young travelers screamed as though she’d been stabbed. “Well, I didn’t quite expect that,” Atelen said, frowning.<br>
<br>
“No, behind you!” <br>
<br>
“Oh, I get it.” Atelen twirled and spun his staff right into the face of the orc that was about to hit him, sending it realing. He sighed and waved a hand, sending rippling lightning bolts into the mass of slavers. Why couldn't they ever make this easy? He had visited the place often enough, you'd think they would know that the glowing aura around him didn't mean &quot;Come bash the shiney thing!&quot; <br>
<br>
He turned back to the group. “Anyway, I really must be going. Do tell Tearis that Celeb’nar sends his greetings, will you? He strode away, leaving the group silent behind him. <br>
<br>
Striding up the steps to the castle, he sent a guard over the edge of the drawbridge into the moat and flung open the doors. Grunts, growls, and other rude orcish noises stopped abruptly as he made his way into the throne room, although the shimmering gleam of magic kept the guards back. Hey, at least these are smarter… Atelen stopped before the throne, on which lounged the portly “Emperor” Crush. He started to get to his feet, but Atelen waved him down, his silver eyes making even the leader of the orcs quail.<br>
<br>
“D’vinn! I know you’re back there, so come out where I can see whether or not you’re going to put a dagger in my back.” A shadow detached itself from behind the throne and moved forward, resolving into a Tier’Dal wearing tarnished silver mail.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Silver Flame? It’s not often you visit these parts, although I remember seeing you with one of those blasted elvish raiding parties many times a few years past.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, and I also recall beating up on your lackeys quite often and then laughing over it over a bottle of good kalish back in Kelethin.” Crush growled and started to rise, but the aura around Atelen brightened and flames danced on the end of his staff. “Anyway, I’m certainly not here for the sights,” he glanced at the dusty room. “I need some Tier’Dal steel for my research, and since I was in the area I thought I’d ask.”<br>
<br>
“Oh? And you just…assumed I’d give you my dagger?”<br>
<br>
“Actually, yes, yes I did. Otherwise I might need to help you redecorate a bit.” With these words he waved a hand and the curtains leapt up in flame, and snow began to swirl around the throne, giving Crush a worried look.<br>
<br>
“Do as he asks, D’Vinn; I’d rather not have to air out the stench of burned flesh yet again.” D’Vinn grimaced, but reaching down, withdrew a dagger and tossed it across the room. Atelen caught it by the handle and in a flash it disappeared into his robe. Grinning, he wove threads of mana into the air, and a glowing portal opened next to him. He took one step through. “Thanks D’Vinn, this will be most helpful. Oh, and here, nearly forgot. In the spirit of gift-giving.” Atelen pulled a bottle from his pack and tossed it to D’Vinn, who caught it by reflex as Atelen disappeared. With a growl, he smashed the bottle against the wall and watched the kalish splash and drip down the stone.<br>
<br>
~                                                                      ~                                                                  ~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Walking through the busy underground avenues of Ak’Anon, Atelen nodded to gnomes he knew as he passed, offering a good day to several of his friends in the Eldritch Collective. Passing by the roaring waterfall, he grimaced at its glowing green color before moving on, past the stalls and shops of the city. Climbing a winding path up the cavern wall, he reached the Library Mechanimagica. Ducking to enter, he stopped in order to let a tiny robed figure whose arms were filled with scrolls get by. “Morning to you, Farantha, is Whizbang about?”<br>
<br>
“Oye, g’mornin to ya, Atelen. He should be, eitha in his study o' the workshop. I tink I 'eard an explosion earlier, so probably the workshop. Now, I must get these scrolls over to the guild 'ouse.” She hurried out, leaving Atelen to walk straight into the wall.<br>
<br>
Amazingly, he passed straight through it, and wound up in a room stacked floor to ceiling with bookshelves. Odds and ends and curiosities littered every surface; Atelen saw unused fireworks and a velium orb floating nearby, and strange skulls arranged on the top of one of the shorter shelves. Two glowing eyes grew into existance from the darker corners of the interior, and a small familiar swooped out of the gloom to land on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Hello there Sparkplug, where’s Whizbang got to?” Atelen said, stroking the wings of the dragon. Just as a picture of a bright light formed in his mind, an explosion rocked the walls, coming from the door at the other end of the study. Laughing, Atelen moved around the desk, Sparkplug swooping in front of him, and stuck his head into the workshop. “Having a bit of trouble, Whiz?” he said into the cloud of smoke. He was answered by a coughing and spluttering, and a slightly singed gnome emerged from the cloud.<br>
<br>
“Not at all, not at all Atelen,” Whizbang replied, grabbing a cloth and wiping the soot off his forehead. “Just a short in the primary phase conductors, and then the mana battery went haywire, and, well, you know these Rebreathers.” He grimaced and jumped up on a stool to be a bit closer to eye level. “So, what brings you here? In the neighborhood, I suppose, and just wanted to stop by?”<br>
<br>
“That’s the short of it, I guess,” chuckled Atelen, setting his pack on the floor and taking a seat. “Stopped by Crushbone on my way over, since you mentioned you needed that steel.” He took the dagger from his cloak and tossed it to Whizbang, who caught it deftly and pocketed it. “Had a talk with D’Vinn as well, although he didn’t seem at all inclined to exchange pleasantaries. So, what are you up to? There must be something; you’re not one to be sitting around your office for long periods of time.”<br>
<br>
“Of course not, of course not, no…” mused Whizbang thoughtfully. “Actually, I meant to send you a message, some friends and I were planning on heading over to Velious; the King needs word from the outpost near Iceclad, and we thought we’d have some fun with the giants while we were there, stop by Thurg and have a pint or two. You want to join us?”<br>
<br>
“Suits me, not like I have anything better to do, what with my place in a shambles until the construction is finished. Meet you by the spires sometime around noon tomorrow then?”<br>
<br>
“That’d be fine, fine. Now here,” Whizbang tossed him a small metal cube, “that ought to keep you busy. Collapsible spit, go make some brownies or something. If you can open it, that is.” He grinned mischievously and disappeared back into his workshop. Atelen sighed good naturedly and fiddled with the cube a moment, testing to see if Whiz had forgotten to install a magic nullifier (which he hadn’t), before picking up his pack and wandering out the door, still puzzling over the cube.<br>

I myself have had many a splendid evening there, away from the political struggles of Neriak and the Church of Innoruuk. Once you are on good terms with the Orcs, it is really a quite relaxing place to visit. The Orcs keep suprisingly good stocks of fresh livestock; the Elven Veal is especially tender here.<br>
<br>
As for Dvinn, he acts as though he has some significance but truly he is but a servant. Being Crush's &quot;right hand&quot; is not what you would consider a high station in Neriak, somewhere under having to guard the bridge in Nektulos. Word among the Spurned is that he was caught sneaking a peek under High Priestess Alexandrian's armor. Though I do not know what would be a worse fate; his current situation, or having to back-up his insinuations to the High Priestess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=333828" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:Red;font-family:Matura MT Script Capitals;font-size:medium;">Vdou Quel'Anon</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> participate in many elvish raiding parties, which was immense fun, especially trashing the throne room as Crush hid up in his tower.

D'vinn wanting to sell them in Tunaria or some such. Anyway, I blasted a mob of orcs and found myself with a new surname. Tearis and I exchange messages on occasion.<br>

I am glad you have told me of this, Queen Cristianos will not be pleased that he chooses to profit selling off our livestock.
