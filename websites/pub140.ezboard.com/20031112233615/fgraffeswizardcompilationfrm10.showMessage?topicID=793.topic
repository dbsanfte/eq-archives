In that game, they had many reasons to group, which included grouping experience bonuses for each party member, but one thing they did have was a class grouping bonus.<br>
<br>
When you grouped with a class, they would add a 5% modifier to specific skills or abilities that you had. Each class had a different group bonus which all members of a group gained just for grouping with them. Of course these grouping bonuses only applied when a player was grouped, and had no effect on solo players at all.<br>
Some of these bonuses would be things like  reduced damage, increased reactor regeneration, or reduced ship signature. In EQ terms, these things would be like higher damage mitigation, increased meditation rates, or reduced aggro range.<br>
<br>
For each instance of a class in a group, their bonuses would deminish, so if you had a full group of one class, the maximum class bonus would peak at 15%. This allowed for specialized groups to do very well, but also added bonuses to well balanced groups.<br>
<br>
I believe adding these types of class bonuses to grouping would help many classes in finding and keeping groups, as well as offering all groups some advantage for inviting them.<br>
<br>
So what could these bonuses be for EQ classes? Well, here's a rundown of what I think would be a fitting class grouping bonus for each class:<br>
<br>
Bard: -5% Magical Damage Taken <br>
Beastlord: +5% Disease and Poison Resistances<br>
Cleric: +5% Hitpoint Pool<br>
Druid: +5% Hitpoint Regeneration<br>
Enchanter: +5% Mana Regeneration<br>
Magician: +5% Fire and Cold Resistances<br>
Monk: -5% Melee Damage Taken<br>
Necromancer: +5% Duration for Damage Over Time Spells <br>
Paladin: +5% 2 Handed Weapon Skills<br>
Ranger: +5% 1 Handed Weapon Skills<br>
Rogue: +5% Piercing Weapon Skills<br>
Shadowknight: +5% Attack Rating<br>
Shaman: +5% Duration for Beneficial Spells<br>
Warrior: +5% Armor Class<br>
Wizard: +5% Direct Damage Spells<br>
<br>
In the examples above, a Group of 5 Warriors and 1 Cleric would gain +15% to Armor Class, as well as +5% to Total Hitpoints.<br>
A group of 5 Wizards and an Enchanter would gain 15% to Direct Damage, and +5% to Mana Regen.<br>
<br>
Remember, these bonuses only come from grouping, and solo players wouldn't receive any bonuses.<br>

By the way you have some of it layed out, it would seem to promote class segregation based on the min/max gaming attitude (somewhat mitigated by diminishing returns).  Perhaps adjusting slightly to give bonuses based not on specific class, but on a combination of two or more factors each of which would yield smaller bonuses but more overall redundency and overlap?<br>
<br>
Example<br>
Factor A:<br>
Melee - group attack bonus<br>
Priest - group hp bonus<br>
Caster - group mana pool bonus<br>
<br>
Factor B:<br>
Plate Class - group AC bonus<br>
Chain Class - group damage bonus<br>
Leather Class - group dodge bonus (every class get dodge?)<br>
Cloth Class - group mana regen bonus<br>
<br>
And possibilities for other types of group bonuses (specific class bonuses?):  From the example then, a group consisting of a Warrior, Ranger, Cleric, and Wizard would get two attack bonuses, one hp bonus, one mana pool bonus, two AC bonuses, a damage bonus, and a mana regen bonus.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just some thought and another suggestion based on yours.<br>

This could solve some class being non invited in groups. Right now adding benefits to a group was mostly via spells that they offered and the role they played.

<br>
The diminishing return basically keeps single class groups from gaining two much of an advantage by grouping together. It works like this:<br>
<br>
1st Class X gives +5% to a group<br>
2nd Class X gives +4% to a group for a total of +9%<br>
3rd Class X gives +3% to a group for a total of +12%<br>
4th Class X gives +2% to a group for a total of +14%<br>
5th Class X gives +1% to a group for a total of +15%<br>
6th Class X gives 0% to a group for a total of 15%<br>
<br>
The reason it's set up like this is to keep the class grouping bonus a nice round number, as well as keeping single class groups from being a regular event due to the class bonuses.<br>
<br>
The grouping bonuses listed in my port above are just examples, and could be changed or modified depending on how SOE would see them. Some may be too much, some might not be enough.<br>
<br>
Also, I didn't come up with this system. I just adapted it from another game that I enjoyed to fit in EQ's grouping system for an added reason to group with specific classes.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you guys like this by the way. Hopefully this post can get some attention with other classes, and maybe we'll see this in the game one day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 816<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/6/02 8:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping bonuses for all classes</span><hr size=1> It's a good idea, but it won't really help, in the end.<br>
<br>
With those rules, a new 6 person ultimate combo will be discovered and then only those classes (at MOST 6 classes, probably less).  Out of 15 classes.<br>
<br>
Honestly I wish VI would look at it and go &quot;you know, why don't we encourage certain groups?&quot;<br>
<br>
Is an AE group not an actual group?  Why do they keep nerfing the xp in the way that they do?<br>
<br>
Create spawnable private mini dungeon's with an area to pull like 20-30 mobs.  Make it really nice XP to encourage people to do it.  And then modify the spawn rate to make sure the xp is relatively consistant with a similar risky melee camp.<br>
<br>
For Solo'ers, do something similar, create an area which allows 2-3 people into it that can be quad-kited by all 3 of them (seperately) but which would completely monopolize the spawns.<br>
<br>
Honestly, what does it matter if someone has a class that can solo and is using them to solo?  Instead of making it impossible for them to solo their targets, change the xp/spawn times.<br>
<br>
Think of this: a zone where you were in lush vegitation, and there were some high plateau's you couldn't reach, but there were NPC's that could send you to the top.  It ports you to a generic plateau and when you jump off you fall into some tree's and get ported to the entrance.<br>
<br>
Honestly, soloing classes should all have these available to them.<br>
<br>
I know this is a multiplayer game, but there are a LOT of people who play that don't have time to actually do a group.  If they worked on it, they could even create zones for 3 or 4 member groups.<br>
<br>
NOTE: also, I didn't say anything about xp bonuses.  I.e. in a 6 person group, there is 115% xp give  per mob or something right?  When balanced it should come up to<br>
<br>
Also, this would be a stupid idea for an expansion, just add them as free zone's.<br>
<br>
Of course, I would be a real jerk and make these zones 'keyed'.  To get the Key flag you have to kill something requiring groups.  (Think PoV flag or harder).<br>
<br>
Not having time for grouping, and being a loner who doesn't want to make friends are 2 different things.  I can normally get a group, it's having time to contrinute to a group that I lack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2539<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/8/02 4:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping bonuses for all classes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's a good idea, but it won't really help, in the end.<br>

<br>
That's like saying focus items would make ultimate caster combos, or weapons would make ultimate melee combos. They don't. What the above would do is offer a reason to invite a specific class to a group: in order to gain a slight advantage.<br>
15% max on class grouping bonuses wouldn't make a group of tanks any better than they currently are already, but a tanks class grouping ability would offer something more to the members of their group.<br>
Just as adding a wizard to a group would add more direct damage to a group. That means if the group already consists of classes that are nuking, they'd gain an additional bonus to their nukes for having a wizard along.<br>
<br>
That helps everybody in the group, it wouldn't allow them to solo any better, and it doesn't require the classes to have to take time out to &quot;buff&quot; the group. <br>
In essence, it's yet another reason for people to group, which in my opinion is what EQ needs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Honestly I wish VI would look at it and go &quot;you know, why don't we encourage certain groups?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
They already do. Think &quot;holy trinity&quot; groups. You need a chanter, a warrior and a cleric. The rest of the slots can be filled up with just about any class, and the only thing you gain is some added insurance and utility buffs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Is an AE group not an actual group? Why do they keep nerfing the xp in the way that they do?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because AE groups have the potential to allow a group of specific players to gain a huge amount of exp in a short amount of time. Because time is what SOE makes their money from, AE groups is a loss of money if they become too widely used.<br>
Remember, if you're paying 13 bucks a month, and you get twice as much exp as someone that doesn't AE group, SOE is quite possibly losing money on you. They see it as advancing too fast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Honestly, what does it matter if someone has a class that can solo and is using them to solo?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The game was designed around groups. Why play an online game if you want to do it all by yourself? Sure, they allow soloing to an extent, but they'll never make soloing a major design point. They want people to get together and group for fun. That was why I bought the damn game, and that's why pretty much everybody else bought the game also.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Honestly, soloing classes should all have these available to them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There is no such thing as a solo class in EQ. There are classes that can solo, and some do better than others, but SOE will never ever create a class that is designed to solo exclusively.<br>

Grouping takes no time if you have friends, or if you're in a place where pick-up groups frequent. I think what you're saying is grouping takes effort, and alot of players aren't willing to put forth any effort. It's called laziness.<br>
<br>
By the way, you can group in just about any zone with 2-4 players now. Why would they have to design more areas for those groups? They already exist.<br>
If I'm not in an AE group when I'm playing, I'm always in a 3-4 person group. We have no problems getting exp with the current zones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, this would be a stupid idea for an expansion, just add them as free zone's<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You understand that SOE makes 0 money adding in free zones, right? They actually lose money making free zones, which is why they only add free zones in about once every 5 or 6 months. SOE is a company, and they want to make money. That's why you'd never see them adding in a bunch of free zones at a time.<br>
<br>

So your free zones now only cater to high level players, and all the lowbies can just forget about it? Nice.<br>
And keyed dungeons, what a novel concept. Explain why these awesome soloing and mini-group dungeons should require a key to get in please. It makes no sense to me.<br>

I'm not exactly sure what you mean. You can get into groups, but you don't contribute? You mean you never nuke mobs? If you're not nuking mobs, what exactly are you doing?<br>

See, the class grouping bonus I was talking about above would fix your problem. If you can't nuke as much as you want, you'd add to other nukers damage in your group.<br>

Nadiar, this post really doesn't belong in this topic, because you didn't add or contribute anything to the topic at hand.

It means I can normally only be online for an hour at a time, and often get randomly pulled away with little notice.  Thats why I chose a wizard, because it can solo.<br>

You haven't seen people reject a cleric because they didnt have Mana Preservation items?  You haven't been in a group that was complaining because the shaman/enchanter/cleric didnt have enough mana and they wanted a different one?  I have seen it happen all the time.  How about AE groups that refuse anyone without RS3? In a group, mobs don't have to die fast.  They just have to go down easily enough that they can be chain killed.  Wizards have no utility. In a world of 96% resses and graveyards, evacs are pointless except to teleport people to the entrance.  <br>
<br>

<br>
I thought you would recognize the example, hopefully the above was more blunt.<br>
<br>
I did give an example. Look at the trinity groups.  I have seen Paladins get into groups over wizards.  Now, what would happen if a class that could offer sustained damage would also offer a bonus to them in other ways?  In your example, as a Trinity group I would rather have a couple warriors than a wizard.  <br>
<br>
If you want wizards in XP groups they have to give us an efficiency increase that does not affect our ability to solo.  Which is why Rains have been repeatedly suggested.  You mention the exploits that are doable with rains, and I point out the numerous times it has been suggested that those are fixed BEFORE the rains are fixed.  Verant worked on Pet pathing to fix mages, I don't see why they couldn't fix rains to fix wizards in groups. To me it seems as if you oppose rains simply because they don't work on PvP servers, but even that is a relatively easy fix--if your target is an NPC, it cannot hit players (other than the caster). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2540<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/8/02 11:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping bonuses for all classes</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You haven't seen people reject a cleric because they didnt have Mana Preservation items?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nope. <br>

Sounds like the blue servers have more assholes on them than the red servers...<br>

Um, nope.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I did give an example. Look at the trinity groups. I have seen Paladins get into groups over wizards.

But you're a wizard, so with the class grouping system, you'd want mana regen (chanter) and more damage for your nukes (wizards).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you want wizards in XP groups they have to give us an efficiency increase that does not affect our ability to solo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Which is impossible. More mana regen makes us solo better. Better mana ratios make us solo better. If you don't see that, then you have other issues that need to be dealt with.<br>

I haven't mentioned exploits with rains in this post. Not to mention, the fact that fixing rain spells will do me NO good, which I mentioned in another post. Lets try to keep the common discussions together, please.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Verant worked on Pet pathing to fix mages, I don't see why they couldn't fix rains to fix wizards in groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Fixing rains wouldn't fix wizards in groups. Wizards would use them to gain better mana ratios and efficiency, which will allow them to solo better. That's not a grouping fix. It's a general fix, which is not what my initial post was about: Giving more to grouping which is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>incapable</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of helping solo play.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To me it seems as if you oppose rains simply because they don't work on PvP servers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't oppose fixes to rains. I just don't think it'll ever happen. <br>
&quot;Fixing&quot; rains would allow us to solo better, wether you want to admit it or not. According to SOE, rains aren't broken anyway. <br>

See this thread for how I'd fix rain spells, and all other AoEs on PvP servers, specifically Rallos Zek: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=787.topic">PvP issues (Rallos Zek)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If you want to continue this futile rain arguement, bring it up in one of these threads that are dealing with that subject, like this one: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=794.topic">Rain spell issues and solutions</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If you don't like my ideas, fine. Say so and leave. No need to change the subject, or derail an idea because you can't stay on topic.<br>
