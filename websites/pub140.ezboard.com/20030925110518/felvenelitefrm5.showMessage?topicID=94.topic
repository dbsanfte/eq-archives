<br>
Galain's moment of clarity had befallen him. Now he stood at the river's edge holding on to the balcony, the water flowing freely past below. Candra stood facing him, her picture one of beauty and radiance. The pair had been talking together most of the morning. Their recent time apart had bonded them closer now than they had ever been.<br>
<br>
He moved close wrapping his arms around her waist, pulling her close to him. lost in the warmth of his wife’s embrace Galain's mind felt free of everything. He slowly opened his eyes.<br>
<br>
It was then that he saw something. The warm caress had cleared his thoughts and now he stood looking at the light reflecting off the passing water to the banks of the other side of the stream. He strained to see what it was that he glimpsed through the movement, but the harder he tried to grasp that sense the more distant it became.<br>
<br>
A wash of dread came over Galain, sending the magician's mind reeling. The moment it came it was gone. He stood there with his beloved wife in his arms his mind searching for that elusive thought which so quickly left.<br>
<br>
His heart was pounding in his ears. All he could see was Candra's violet eyes.<br>
<br>
“Galain! Are you alright”. The enchantress' words at first distant becoming clearer as he came crashing back against the present moment.<br>
<br>
Galain stood facing her, The look on her face betraying her worry. With a reassuring smile on his face, he nodded,“I am fine my love.”<br>
<br>
His smiling countenance hid the worry streaming through his mind and the chilling feeling of Dread and fear at what he had glimpsed. Now, he stood silent as he chose his words. From the look on Candra's face he knew the attempt at easing his wife's worries had failed. “She knows me too well,&quot; he thought.<br>
<br>
Galain paused to reorganize his thoughts and started to speak but stopped then he caught Candra’s expression. The woman's unbelievably violet eyes followed something behind him.<br>
<br>
Galain turned to catch a look at what had stolen his love's attention. He followed her gaze to a young Elf who was walking purposely along. The youth's face was slightly turned in a way that brought shadows against his features, defeating Galain's effort to gauge his intentions.<br>
<br>
The flow of time slowed to a crawl as Galain took in the scene. A heavy blanket of silence fell over the world. All his senses were siezed by the actions of the young elf moving ever closer. Galain felt the pounding of the young elf’s feet against the pavement as he walked. <br>
<br>
Young men had a way of carrying themselves. There was typically a hint of uncertainty to their actions. This one lacked such traits. The unsur footing of one so young was gone. The grace of his every step seemed something unnatural. No measure of energy seemed wasted, his every motion spoke of an assurance that belied his age. <br>
<br>
Galain observed the confidence that exuded off the boy's posture, then looked up along the lines of his body in effort to catch the face that seemed purposely hidden away. <br>
<br>
Something cruel and wicked stared back into Galain's face. Something in the magician's mind clicked, warning him that this was no youth - failing to name what &quot;It&quot; was.<br>
<br>
A sudden Dread overwhelmed Galain as he looked into the lifeless eyes of what he had thought was a young Elf. The elusive thought from before was returning. Though to call it a thought was to demean it. This was something more subtle and still more powerful than any mere thought. It was something primal and unsconscious, but stronger than any instinct Galain had known before.<br>
<br>
A voice could be heard, distant and echoing. It's shape was feminine and assertive. The voice of a woman. It was Candra shouting something behind him, but he couldn’t make out what it was. He was too enrapt by the thing that approached him; transfixed by the Dread thing slowly drawing a sword.<br>
<br>
It was the Guards behind skidding to a stop that brought Galain back to his senses. He saw them clawing their way to their feet, distancing themselves from this terror. They had come upon the scene after hearing Candra's shouts, but fear had stopped them in their tracks.<br>
<br>
Looking back to the advancing elf shell, Galain felt panicked. It was almost upon him. He closed his eyes and then his mind off from the thing, freeing himself of its mesmerising effect. The magician focused his thoughts and started to incant.<br>
<br>
Galain's eyes snapped open as the last words trailed from his mouth. He saw the advancing figure stop, its dead eyes staring intently at him. Its face contorted and stretched.<br>
A screaming cry came from its lips as Fire poured from the sky, the heat blistering and tearing at its skin.<br>
<br>
The closeness of the burning form made Galain wince through the heat and the sickening smell of burning flesh. Still, he couldn’t tear his eyes away.<br>
<br>
Dread turned to fear as he stared into the eyes of the monster before him. The world had gone mad, or so Galain hoped. His gut told him it wasn't so, that it was just him. Galain's head shook from side to side and his stomach became queazy. Standing front of him screaming wasn’t a nameless terror, but a simple elf boy. Fear writhed across his face as his skin started to peal and blister. His eyes rolled back into his head as the burning corpse fell to the floor with a sickening thud.<br>
<br>
No one moved, none could speak. The smell of burning flesh assaulted everyone senses. The charred mass lay there, Its hairless head blackened, skin stretched back showing his teeth in a mocking grin.<br>
<br>

<br>
As nightfall neared Galain found himself resting on a bench not far from where the whole horrible scene had played out before. He sat with his face in his hands as he spoke quietly with General Jyleel. The two elves had been friends for the better part of two centuries; since they were just a pair of boys touring the woods of Kelethin in search of adventure. Their friendship endured over the years, but to a lesser extent as each pursued his own destiny. For the very first time, their paths crossed in a way that could potentially pit one against the other.<br>
<br>
Jyleel was a proud Paladin with a powerful respect for justice, but not the patience that Galain had expected of a man of his station. Jyleel knew the boy that lay dead only a few feet away. He named him for Galain, &quot;I'm a friend to Yadien's family. The lad had hopes of becoming a paladin of my order. I had high hopes for this one, Galain...that he would one day grow enough in power to be worthy of joining the guard and taking up the defense of Felwithe.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was hard to ignore the intense emotions that shaped the general's features. He had taken the news badly, but with reports from the Guards that had witnessed the event he had calmed enough to listen to the full story before speaking. &quot;This was not the boy's way Galain. Yadien is...was...he was a good boy. He would not stoop this way. His family is one of honor! He would have...” The general's grief overwhelmed him. He choked back tears and lowered his head.<br>
<br>
Galain placed his hand on the General's shoulder as a comfort and nodded, &quot;I understand, my friend. The events as reported sustain my opinion that it was not the boy that attacked me. It was something else. Something I cannot explain at this time”.<br>
<br>
Candra sat talking with Seria Woodwind, who frequently held audience with the General. From a short distance away she listened to Galain try and explain what he had felt and seen. She could &quot;feel&quot; the guilt and sense of betrayal that wracked her love's mind for slaying one so young. It was more than she could bear. Seeing that words no longer furthered anything between the Mage and Paladin, she excused herself from Seria's company and rose from her seat. <br>
<br>
She moved towards bench the two elves shared and gently dropped her hand upon Galain's shoulder. Alerted to her presence, Galain looked over his shoulder to find the enchantress' expression dressed by a smile he found immediately comforting. Her voice moved through his ears with a soft touch, like feathers. &quot;Time to go, my love. We should let the General tend to his duties.&quot;<br>
<br>
Galain watched Candra's face with certain curiosity. He sensed meaning in the words she spoke. He could hear something more than just a desire to comfort, but a subtle warning as well. He searched her violet eyes, pleading for a more direct message, but received none. He turned to the Jyleel without meaning to and found the elf completely crest-fallen. The two keeping him company seemed to be in on something that he had clearly overlooked. <br>
<br>
Galain averted his face to not seem so dumbfounded. The action put his gaze on a pair of clerics attending to young Yadien's remains. His mind wandered a bit, speculating on the unfulfilled potential of that life lost. He wondered about the friends and family that would miss his presence in their lives. <br>
<br>
Comprehension dawned suddenly, blinding Galain's mind's eye. He realized now the duty which Candra alluded to earlier. Jyleel would be going now to speak with Yadien's parents. He figured he must have looked distraught as Candra settled beside him to comfort him with a warm hug.<br>
<br>
A silence came over them all. It was so heavy and saturating that it made everything surreal. Finally the General broke that quiet, “Go Galain. Leave it with me. I will speak of this to them. It is not the first time I have done so, and am certain it wont be the last.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing to them both Jyleel turned and left, leaving the pair to their grief and the comforts of each others' arms.<br>

<br>
The dwarven warrior Hardolar stood near the Tiger's Roar musing over the events of the day when a strange event unfolded before him. A strange hum filled the very air around him. A point of space not far from him stirred, the air rippling wildly like waves of heat. He frowned deeply and reached for his sword, muttering, &quot;Magic..&quot;<br>
<br>
Hardolar had been walking the two thin valleys that led to the Tigers Roar. The layout of the area was such that a huge host could be stopped by a very small force and more so now that archery stations had been placed upon the upper most reaches.<br>
<br>
He had been musing over the recent accident that had taken the life of Karthanon. A boulder had slipped from its place, leaving tragedy in its wake. Gilber was killed instantly and Karthanons legs were crushed - leading to his subsequent demise. The very same defenses now built and manned by men and women at arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay your hand Hardolar&quot; came a voice.<br>
<br>
The dwarf relaxed visibly and shot an unfriendly smile at the familiar voice that moved through the event. A moment later that same smile was given to the magician, Galain Whitegloves, who simply appeared in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye gads it be about time ya arrived back here, Whitegloves! Typical that ya come when all the hard work be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling, Galain placed his hand on the old Dwarfs shoulder, &quot;Good to see you too, my old friend? Such a wonderful warm greeting.&quot; A light smirk put his mouth in motion. The magician then stepped aside to reveal the rather alluring creature who accompanied him.<br>
<br>
Candra stood there, serene and exotic. With her sun-kissed complexion, dark hair and unbelievably violet eyes, Galain considered his bride easily beautiful and knew in fact that most others agreed. As did she. Some were put off by her confident, cool manner. Galain knew a different side of the human echantress that few were privy to. She was a woman of incredible passion. He'd seen it explode many times, in both temper and joy; and in private moments. Candra's passion was the quality he most admired.<br>
<br>
The enchantress smiled at the awkwardness of the Dwarf as he stammered an apology for his brisk greeting. She graciously bowed when the Dwarf eventually regained enough composure to correct the slight with a warmed smile and a proper salute.<br>
<br>
Galain's missive sent to Hardolar had arrived two weeks before his arrival. It simply read, <br>
<br>
&quot;Possible attack by ReaMorda.<br>
Fortify and prepare for all out defense of the Tigers Roar.&quot;<br>
-Galain<br>
<br>
Much of the defenses had been completed. Now, only the odd workman meandered around on the various tasks still nearing finish.<br>
<br>
Galain inspected them as he walked towards the Tigers Roar. Hardolar pointed out special emplacements of archery stations and their positioning. “Karth started the work before the accident, the two stations upon the ridge there was his idea,” The warrior pointed to the high ridges where the two valleys came together.<br>
<br>
“Any host has ta come through one o' them there passes, or both! They come together here and as they do these two stations will hit that force on both flanks. Be bloody murder to any that tries, it will,”<br>
<br>
The trio continued round to the Tiger's Roar's exterior, Hardolar pointing out various other traps and emplacements forming the outer defenses.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the inn Galain was met with a sight he wasn’t quite prepared for. The friendly sight of the inn had gone. What was once a picturesque setting of tranquility and beauty now stood as a fortress.<br>
<br>
Archery stations adorned the roof; the path leading up to a wall of sharpened pikes and sentry posts now staggered the main entrance. They weaned their way down the lines of pikes and defenses, fashioned to hinder a straight path to the doors to slow any advancing horde down to a snails pace allowing arrows to be rained down from the emplacements above.<br>
<br>
The going was slow for the three as they wound their way down the path. Candra spoke very little, but quietly communicated her thoughts to Galain with subtle looks and slight gestures. After the long tour, she darted a look at Galain that hinted of weariness. Galain quietly nodded a reply to her.<br>
<br>
“My thanks go to you Hardolar for seeing the work started by Karthanon finished. It is a sad loss for us, his demise. His swords will be missed, especially in these darkening times,”<br>
<br>
The Dwarf puffed visibly, giving one of his infectious smiles. With a crisp salute, he excused himself from his company and turned about, barking out orders with renewed vigor.<br>
<br>
Eventually the day passed, as days are known to do. Galain had spent most of the day in his office, pouring over plans and maps and missives. The Enchantress quietly kept him company while he worked. She lay across the long chair that sat in his private room. Galain had originally requested the seat appointed to the room for private meetings, but Candra had taken to using it. All who came in knew that it was her place. <br>
<br>
The chair was fashioned from the softest hides and dyed the deepest mauve; almost to the point of being black. Its legs were fashioned from the hardest of oaks.It was designed for comfort and Candra often used it to full advantage when wanting her way.<br>
<br>
Few could persuade Galain as his enchantress could and often did. She could lighten the foulest of his moods with just a look. A small ache formed in his chest as considered how close he recently came to losing her love, their very marriage. He was glad now that those rough times were behind them and had endeavored with every passing moment to make sure he never risked it again.<br>
<br>
Indeed, it gave Galain certain comfort to have his wife nearby. Throughout the day he had looked up from his toilings to see her lounged laguorously over &quot;her&quot; chair, comfortable and without any obvious worry.<br>
<br>
His work behind him, Galain looked on still. Candra's soft face glowed for the candle at her side. The odd breeze caused that small, but brilliant flame to flicker - causing shadows to move over her features. It was that contrast Galain loved in her. He knew she hosted hidden depths. He'd only glimpsed before. Maybe one day he would delve into those mysteries, but then again perhaps not. Regardless, his love for the enchantress was complete and unconditional. He was happy just to know she loved him and that was all he needed.<br>
<br>
Galain made his way over to Candra hoping to share the seat. She smiled up at him without speaking and made room to accomodate him. They laid against each other, her head on his chest and an arm draped over his belly. He in turn stroked a hand gently over her dark hair, occasionally catching the silky threads between his fingers. A glass of brandy occupied his other hand. They passed the time talking through the night about the events unfolding; briefly discussing the fortress that now surrounded them.<br>
<br>
Galain sipped at his drink and smiled down along the length of his body at Candra. No more words came from her lips. She'd fallen into a peaceful sleep. He idly wondered about the dreams of an enchantress. &quot;What a wonderland it must be, Candra,&quot; muttered softly as he pulled the hair from her face.<br>
<br>
Even in slumber, her cherry colored and often flavored lips, still held a softly shaped, reassuring smile. It brought little comfort, for he knew that the possible attack by House ReaMorda was just a hint at the Dread that both could feel fast approaching. He clung to his love for warmth and closed his eyes in hopes of joining her in Wonderland.<br>

<br>
Candra found herself moving swiftly through the night. She was searching for something, though she was not at all sure what that something was. There was a certain urgency to the steps that propelled her onward. Energy drawn from the anxiety that threatened to overwhelm the enchantress fueled her quickening pace.<br>
<br>
She seemed outside of herself, detached from the world she found herself running through. Currently, she was utterly and hopelessly lost. She panned her gaze over the scene laid out before her hoping to land her sights on something that might reveal where she was and why she was there.<br>
<br>
Whatever city this was, Candra could see that it had been great once upon a time. The ruined architecture still boasted some amazing details; grand archways, handsome columns. There was an inherent grace about the structures that had endured in spite of the entropy and decay that was so rampant.<br>
<br>
Candra marveled silently as she pressed forward through the littered avenues. &quot;This is not the effect of time..&quot; she whispered to no one at all. Indeed, there seemed to be no one about at all save the enchantress. Despite the empty streets and lack of life signs anywhere, she had the distinct sense that she was not alone.<br>
<br>
A chill breeze tickled the back of her neck causing her skin to prickle. That sense of someone watching her intensified tenfold. Fear spurred her to action and she turned about to see what had come upon her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome home, Candra.&quot; Yadien greeted the enchantress with a life-mocking smile. His cindered mouth curled back into an impossible grin that caused what remained of his lips to crack and fall away. His burnt and blistered skin filled the gap between the two with a putrid smell that tested the strength of Candra's stomach.<br>
<br>
The enchantress' mind was reeling. She wanted to turn away from the horrible sight of Yadien, but could not as she was so caught up in the dreadful effect of its power.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is not my home.&quot; she heard herself say in reply. Candra couldn't remember speaking, but it was certainly her voice as she knew it in her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, it is milady. Have a look around. See the amazing sights and splendor of the famed city of the High Elves!&quot; The burnt elf gestured with dramatic flair, causing his charred skin to crackle and flake. Candra thought him a little over the top, but couldn't argue with his success. She was very afraid.<br>
<br>
She followed his direction, so mezmerized that she could not stop herself. Ghosts appeared in her vision, faintly shaped things that seemed imposed over the gloom of the ruined city. Candra watched in horror as the ghosts of herself and a young elf sat on the banks of the pond where both shared their first kiss. Her vision shifted suddenly and she could see the ghost of her grandmother standing outside the Keepers of the Art building debating her fellows. Candra's vision blurred for a moment. When it cleared she saw Galain's ghost kneeling before hers as he presented a ring.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that was a lovely moment,&quot; the corpse said mockingly. He breathed a rancid breath against Candra's skin as he laughed. The enchantress just stood there, frozen and silent as the moment unfolded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then again, why should you care about this ruined place, my 'Lady of Mysteries'? Felwithe was never your home to begin with, was it.&quot; Yadien's words had the structure of a question, but he made it a flat statement; something to be agreed with. &quot;How could something so common as Freeport's human trash ever hope to find a home here? But then, you've always been the ambitious sort. You've an interesting pedigree, but many pets do, love.&quot;<br>
<br>
The familiar sting of tears reddened Candra's violet eyes. She could feel the tears tumbling down her cheeks despite her best efforts to dam her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm left to wonder what the Tears of Veeshan would think if they knew about what's hidden in that oh so blue blood of yours.&quot; Yadien came in close, she could feel the heat that radiated off his still smoldering flesh. &quot;Methinks they might just declare a hunt...&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Candra had had enough. She closed her eyes tight and willed herself away from the ruins of Felwithe and the dark thing she knew was not Yadien.<br>
<br>
When finally she opened her eyes, Candra found herself in Galain's slumbering arms. She was trembling despite the warmth that came off her love's body. Desperate for comfort, she moved herself to be even closer against him, waking the magician in the process.<br>
<br>
Galain caught sight of the tears that glittered in her eyes and instictively drew her against him. &quot;What's wrong, love?&quot;<br>
<br>
Candra said nothing in reply, which was fine with Galain. He was there for her as she needed without condition. He would simply hold her until whatever sadness or fear that had gripped her relented and allowed sleep to claim her once again. <br>
<br>

<br>
The enchantress spent the better part of three days searching for clues to the identity of the new “Enemy” to rise from the darkness. To that end she’d dedicated considerable time to pouring over the ancient tomes and scrolls that lined the walls of the castle’s library. She’d consulted with sages and mystics, even a few inhabitants of the planes bordering Norrath. Every lead brought the enchantress to a dead end and now found herself in the same square where she’d started.<br>
<br>
Frustration crept along the edges of Candra’s mind. She was very aware of the tension that was settling into her muscles. <br>
<br>
With great determination, the enchantress moved through halls of the keep. She would speak with Yazmine, another enchantress pledged to the guild. An Erudite, Yazmine demonstrated the amazing intellect for which her people were famed. For her voracious intellect she entitled with the role of Chief Librarian and Researcher.<br>
<br>
Candra would tap into the resource that Yazmine presented and hopefully find a few clues about the unseen Enemy at High Castle’s gate.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Eastern Plains of Karana is a rough, hilly area on the eastern edge of the Plains of Karana. The area is frequented by many of the rarest and most dangerous creatures in all of Antonica, and is connected to the rest of the world only by two narrow mountain passes and one massive bridge. <br>
<br>
“And to think some intrepid souls make their homes out here amidst these creatures,” Candra mused quietly. She’d hunted the region back in her days as a journeyman among the Champions of the Light. Back then, she had not been ready for the dangers lying in wait and was forced to adapt quickly or face certain death. <br>
<br>
Having survived and surpassed those times by many seasons, she now idly considered the very dangerous and aggressive creatures that roamed the land; many of which were similar to other areas of the Plains of Karana, such hill giants and griffawns; and many more which were unique to the East Karana, such as the gnoll and undead reavers, gorge hounds and war wolves, evil eyes, lion and lioness royalty. She accepted there was a lot of good hunting in the area, but it came at the price of being very dangerous.<br>
<br>
The enchantress stood just a few feet beyond the great bridge of East Karana. A slave to fashion, Candra was dressed for traveling. She left behind her ornately designed robe for a simpler look; a dark leather tunic and matching leggings, with boots gloves and a cloak that caught the wind blowing about her. Choosing the proper attire was one of the lessons learned so many years ago. <br>
<br>
With care, Candra moved away from the bridge and made her way to the riverbank. A cool breeze gusted from the north. It surged over her face and played brusquely through her raven hair. Powerful enchantments cast on her person took the chill out of the wind. Despite its rough play Candra considered the wind a small pleasure. Karana’s firm caress gave her a measure of comfort as she moved towards a meeting that would surely test her resolve to master the mystery of the wicked thing that had recently touched her mind. <br>
<br>
In hope of finding some shred of a clue about that dark power, Candra tasked two lesser enchantresses sworn the Champions’ to join her in High Castle’s vast library. The Erudite, Yazmine and High Elf, Sandianya willingly lent their able minds to the cause. Their coven spent days toiling over the many tomes, scrolls and maps that lined its expansive walls. For all the time invested there was little information to be found.<br>
<br>
It was Yazmine who was able to connect a fragile thread of folktales to the dark power that haunted Candra’s dreams. It was Sandianya who connected those tales to an ancient order of explorers and adventurers known as the Immaculate Order of Dragons. According to those tales, the “Dragons” had warred with an entity bent on the ruin of all creation. It had the power to invade minds and possess bodies, thus making it a difficult force to confront. However, as the tales explained it, the Dragons’ dedication eventually led to the destruction of that dark power.<br>
<br>
In Candra’s mind there was no doubt that all their research was pointing in the right direction. Whatever the Dragons’ had done to destroy the force had not been sufficient, if the stories were at all accurate. There was only one way to know for sure.<br>
<br>
Candra left her two aids to their rest and fled High Castle in search of more answers. The threads they had gathered weren’t so fragile in the end. In fact, the eldest of the enchanters left their research with a solid lead that could very well put a name to the force at large.<br>
<br>
So, now she found herself in East Karana seeking out the one man who could give the missing pieces to the puzzle she sought to solve. It was no great feat for her to learn his whereabouts. Candra simply asked her mirror to show him to her. She then turned to her guildmate, the druidess Nivya, for transport. It all happened so fast that Candra hadn’t actually formed a plan for her approach. She simply moved towards his general direction, hoping the way would become clear with each step.<br>
<br>
Candra’s violet gaze lighted on a small boat afloat towards the center of the waterway. She was suddenly uneasy and nervous, but still determined to meet with him. She closed her eyes for a moment and sucked in a breath, then released it slowly to steady her nerves. She walked over to the water’s edge and incanted in a gentle voice. Rings of magic sprung from her gesturing hands, bathing the enchantress in a brief emerald aura that lifted her into the air. Feeling she was as prepared as she could be, Candra floated over the gently flowing water towards the boat.<br>
<br>
The sounds of the flowing river masked her already quiet arrival. An fisherman sat in the boat, a fishing rod in his hands and a rather fine looking pipe caught between his lips. Candra stood at his back, searching for the words to greet him.<br>
<br>
“It’s a bit rude to just stand there staring, don’t you think?” His spoke in a rich baritone that resonated throughout Candra’s being. <br>
<br>
“I suppose it is,” she replied in a voice that was strangely shy. <br>
<br>
The fisherman stood to his feet without even threatening to upset his small craft. Candra considered the feat uncanny and it showed in her eyes. He regarded her with a smile that could melt glaciers, “It’s been some time, my dear. How are you, Candra?”<br>
<br>
The sound of that voice uttering her name sent a chill through the enchantress, but she managed to resist its power, much like she had his smile. Candra’s cool could outdo a glacier on her best day. “I’m fine. How are you, father?”<br>
<br>

<br>
Golden rays of sunlight illuminated High Castle as the sun began to sink below the distant line of the horizon. The chilling caress of Fall had left nothing untouched in this region. Small branches and leaves littered the pocked ground. Thin, half-barren trees no longer hid the furthest skyward reaching edifices of the proud and stalwart High Castle. <br>
<br>
Time seemed to stand still in a final moment of resistance as the light of day valiantly fought against the inevitable hordes of night. One last ray of hope flared briefly across the darkening sky in a desperate attempt to stay afloat, but shadows drowned the land and the glimmering hope flickered briefly and was gone. Darkness rode a swift horse across the plains of Karana and blanketed the land, covering the fortress’ façade. A heavy, oppressive darkness seeped into the tiny crevices between the brick and mortar. It crept under the cracks of doors and windows, and embraced the fortress as if it was an old, familiar friend. <br>
<br>
As darkness settled about High Castle and aged boards and wood creaked under the added weight, a slight wind began to stir, pushing dry leaves about like a small whirling dervish dancing fervently across the courtyard. The fires lighting the torches and sconces moved in synchronous rhythm, swaying to an unheard beat known only to the wind. <br>
<br>
Outside the iron gates, in the darkest shadows of a nearby tree, stood a solitary female figure wrapped in a dark, heavy cloak. The wind moaned low and mournful. As the figure took a single step forward, the wind moved to greet her. A trail of dry leaves swirled in its wake as the breezes converged about the woman’s legs, caressing and touching with adoration and respect as a servant would its master. Leaves circled the woman, briefly riding the chill air before launching about in a chaotic pattern then once again falling to stillness against the cooling ground. <br>
<br>
The woman began to incant softly into the night, her gentle words of spoken power carried hauntingly along the currents of air, echoing tenderly moments after she herself had finished. With a quiet sucking noise, air was suddenly displaced by the appearance of a tiny fairy - her delicate silvery wings fanned effortlessly so that she maintained eye contact with her Mistress as they discussed matters most dark. <br>
<br>
After a few brief whispers from the fairy’s tinkling bell-like voice, the cloaked Lady replied in hushed tones, “I too have felt the coming Darkness. Its unnatural presence beckons so powerfully. I have felt its tendrils coil and snake outward through the Nektulos forest and brush the edge of my soul. It is a Darkness that can be seen so clearly from the corner of one’s eye, but missed so completely when seen from straight on.” <br>
<br>
The dark Lady incanted slowly into the night air and faded to shadow. She continued speaking hidden from view, her voice a distant echo, layer upon layer whispering in the wind, “You will continue your watch, my summons. Observe the night, observe High Castle and observe the Champions. All is not as it seems.” <br>
<br>
Her fading voice, nearly a whisper, continues on, “We will wait for this ‘Darkness.’ Its time is nearly upon us all. Indeed, astute little one, something wicked this way comes…”<br>
<br>

<br>
Tytalus Verbana appeared much the same as Candra remembered him; long haired, mustached, and possessed of innate charm. His swarthy complexion was highlighted by prominent cheekbones and a pair of green eyes that captivated all who met his gaze. His strong, aristocratic nose suggested his noble ancestry. <br>
<br>
Candra quietly marveled at his timeless good-looks. Indeed, the man looked remarkably ageless for a human. Then again, no one knew better than an enchantress that looks could be deceiving. She couldn’t help but pry a little, “You’re looking remarkably well, father.”<br>
<br>
“Shall I say ‘Thank you’ and pretend your interest is a compliment?”<br>
<br>
A light smirk played over Candra’s lips. Candra liked a challenge and there was no one more challenging than her father. He had always been little larger than life when she was a young girl. His presence filled any room he entered. <br>
<br>
As she journeyed to this meeting, Candra had thought that effect would be diminished by his greater years and the harsh times he’d endured. The looking glass related a vague figure, somewhat obscured, she believed, by magic meant to foul attempts to scry his whereabouts. She filled in the blanks herself and believed the wizard to be old, tired and broken, a fallen champion whose power was but a whisper of the bellow it used to be. Well, you know what they say about when one “assumes”, she thought.<br>
<br>
Candra showed the man a slight grin as she replied to his obviously rhetorical question, “You’ll do as you please. You always have.”<br>
<br>
“Where are my manners?” Tytatlus extended his hand to the levitating enchantress. His mustache lent the grin bending his lips a feral charm. “Come aboard, won’t you? I’m afraid the accommodations here may not be suiting to a lady of your refined tastes. My, err...yacht is out for repairs.” He shot her a wink and showed his white teeth.<br>
<br>
Candra accepted the invitation and took the man’s hand. Contrary to popular belief, she had spent many a day on a similar boat enjoying the very same sport. She found the relative peace of fishing a wonderful exercise of patience and meditation. Her movements proved that fact as she easily situated herself to settle into the boats meager comforts.<br>
<br>
If Tytalus noticed her confidence, he didn’t let it show. “So what brings you about after so many years, my dear? I would like to think the call is purely social, but I know you better than that.”<br>
<br>
Candra didn’t waste any time feigning hurt feelings or shock in the face of brutal honesty. She saw no reason for the soft and gentle approach, she wasn’t feeling much in the mood to play around anyway, “I need your help to unravel a mystery. One that I feel will become a threat to the Realm if allowed to go on unchecked.”<br>
<br>
Intrigued, Tytalus leaned forward towards her. “Please continue.”<br>
<br>
Candra did her best to relay the story of the young paladin, Yadien and then the dreams, or rather nightmares, which haunted her sleep. She told him of the auguries she’d cast and of the sense of dread that had made its home in her heart.<br>
<br>
Tytalus listened eagerly to all she had to say, enrapt by the telling. Candra could only guess at the thoughts that ran through his mind. She dared not steal them. It would be considered rude if she was caught in the act, then too her father’s sanity was rumored to be a fragile thing and she, as a rule, shied away from prying into the minds of the mad. <br>
<br>
The enchantress searched through the wild look in the wizard’s wondrous green eyes. They were full of questions that were already tripping over his tongue to be asked.<br>
<br>
Tytalus stammered, “Tell me about the elf Yadien. Did the clerics make any effort to recall his soul to his body?”<br>
<br>
Candra held on to his gaze. “Yes, but they could not call it back. Something about...”<br>
<br>
A look of dread washed over Tytalus’ face. He turned slightly, looking away. Candra couldn’t determine if he did for distraction or to hide the growing fear she read in his expression. “It swallows souls, Candra. Leaving nothing but the shell behind.”<br>
<br>
He looked her up and down as if sizing her up. “These nightmares you speak of....I’m curious. Did you touch Its mind, Candra?”<br>
<br>
It was a detail she’s not told anyone. His intense look compelled her to answer him with honesty. “Yes.”<br>
<br>
“And what did you see there?”<br>
<br>
She was trembling and could not stop herself from doing so as she called that memory to present thought. “I saw a creature comprised of darkness and death. It thrived for the power of the souls it had consumed and was bent on a singular mission.”<br>
<br>
“What mission, Candra? Tell me! I must know!”<br>
<br>
“It...It intends to murder the world.” For her brief contact with the dark force that had possessed Yadien, Candra had caught a glimpse at something powerful and unique. A force of destruction the likes of which she’d never thought possible. It had the presence of a god, but lacked the power. She considered Its potential and ambition and couldn’t help but wonder -“What is 'It', father?”<br>
<br>
“I cannot say.”<br>
<br>
“Cannot or will not?” she demanded<br>
<br>
Tytalus turned on his daughter with wild, wide eyes, his voice charged with restrained power. “CANNOT!” The boat swayed violently, rocked by the churning waters that floated it.<br>
<br>
Candra felt dizzy, taken aback by the magic that emanated from the wizard. She found herself suffocating in the presence of such a phenomenon. She struggled against it, gripping the boat’s rim to steady herself. She looked back at her father with a pleading look.<br>
<br>
Tytalus caught her look and took control of his self. An apology shaped his expression as he reigned in the magic that had, for a moment, gotten away from him.<br>
<br>
Candra said nothing. She simply looked at the man across from her. Tytalus sat there, hugging himself. He seemed so vulnerable, but the display of power he’d shown warned Candra towards caution. A part of her longed to go to Tytalus and comfort him, but she was altogether too afraid; of his power, of losing time.<br>
<br>
Her lips parted to loose a voice so soft it fell over her father’s senses like the touch of feathers. A gentle breeze washed over the man, clearing his mind, sharpening his focus. “Please father, help me.”<br>
<br>
Tytalus seemed transformed as he looked back at Candra. There was a clear look in his eyes and his voice carried the same trait. ”It was centuries ago, m’dear, during a time that has come to be known as the Lost Age. The orcs had not yet settled into Greater Faydark and the outpost Firiona Vie was not even conceived in thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;The progenitors of the Immaculate Order of Dragons had not yet finished constructing their keep when a powerful threat...a danger unlike any they had known came upon the Realm and made fast plans to murder it. The Order gathered its allies and journeyed en masse in search of a beast that could leap from form to form. After countless lives had been lost It was still at large; pursuing an agenda that confounded all who ran after It. It was an event that the guild’s historians dubbed ‘The Great Contagion” for It swept over the land like a plague. In the end the Order and its allies prevailed against its foe, but they lacked a means to destroy its life. It is said that a great circle of powerful spell casters from each of the guilds gathered to cast a work of will that bound the beast in the empty void of space and time, thus bringing that awful chapter of history to a close.”<br>
<br>
Candra seemed confused, “How is it that I’ve never heard this before?”<br>
<br>
“There is a reason why they call it the Lost Age, Candra.”<br>
<br>
She nodded and to her credit didn’t blush for the embarrassment she felt. “Tell me more.”<br>
<br>
“You’ve heard all that I remember.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not enough, father. I need to know it’s name, its purpose and how, if all you’ve said is true, it escaped its prison.”<br>
<br>
Tytalus grinned. It was obvious the wizard was impressed by his daughter’s drive. He nodded. “There is one who can provide the information you seek.”<br>
<br>
Candra’s violet eyes blazed with curiosity. “Tell me!”<br>
<br>
Tytalus’ green eyes leveled to that determined gaze as he submitted to his daughter’s demand. He uttered only one word in reply. “Wuoshi.”<br>

<br>
The air was heavy with shadow and damp with moisture as it made its way from the dark, misting night into the sheltered underground of the Neriak, the Tier’dal city fortress. It seemed to breathe a sigh of relief to those that listened as it once again swept through the familiar halls lit by sigils and runes that cast a welcoming, comfortable glow. The breeze blew slowly through the bustling Foreign Quarter, making its invisible presence felt more than known. Its chill raised the course hairs on an Ogre Blacksmith’s sweaty arm and drew a slight gasp from the lips of a surprised human serving wench as its willowy touch lightly brushed her cheek. <br>
<br>
The meandering current continued its progress deeper into the vast underground city, past the dark, shadow-weaved adamantine gates securing the Neriak Commons from the outsiders taking residence in the Foreign Quarter. It swirled between the legs of patrolling guards and ever alert sentries. To those Tier’dal born with a heightened magical affinity, the air appeared to glimmer and sparkle briefly as it released yet another weary sigh, trembling as the dark magic of the Neriak embraced it. The air took one last pause, becoming a gently whirling dervish. It warmed its smoke-like tendrils against the glowing embers of the unused Tier’dal forge before it moved towards the third and final gate of the Neriak. <br>
<br>
The air met no welcome as it moved to and past the third gate. No cheery greeting. No affectionate acknowledgement. It was but a servant to its Mistress, the Witch of the Nektulos. It moved low across the rough hewn stone passages bringing a stir of dust and mites that marked its invisible passage. It rose from the ground and floated upward as it crossed a walkway over a watery pool to avoid picking up the chill from the nearby liquid. The tiny breeze reached the edge of a darkened structure set in the furthest recesses of the Neriak caverns. It approached an open window on the second floor and paused as another of its kind slowly drifted out. The breezes mingled, sharing touch, current and warmth if but for only a passing moment. The caresses ended far too quickly and the breezes split into their own strands, flowing to complete their missions. <br>
<br>
The breeze lazily entered the dimly lit room and found its Mistress sitting perfectly ridged, awaiting its arrival and news. Even though her face was wrapped in shadow and darkness, her pale blue eyes pierced the gloom as the play of sigil magic light flickered across her features. Her darkly painted lips parted ever so slowly as she raised one hand before her, “Welcome, Jenikabob.” <br>
<br>
The elemental wind paused as Talene uttered its true name. It moved low to the ground as if kneeling before her and waited a moment before rising and wrapping itself about her arm. Its borrowed warmth flushed her smooth skin, bringing a smile to those same lips that were frigid with formality a moment earlier. Talene moved her second hand about the wind, cradling it in her lap as if it were a small pet. The wind, eager to please its Mistress, began its tale with news from the Karanas, breathing but one word, “Wuoshi.”<br>

<br>
A rush of warm air breathed over Candra’s body as she appeared in Wakening Land. It was a welcome sensation after leaving the harsh cold of the Great Divide. She slowly stepped away from the portal, moving towards the center of the druid circle. The druid Halai had arrived moments before her and stood patiently, waiting.<br>
<br>
Candra met up with the elf, offering him a smile as warm as their environs. “Thank you, Halai. You’ve been so helpful, considering...”<br>
<br>
“Considering that what you intend to do is madness!” There was no apology to follow for his snapping remark. From the moment the enchantress explained her reasons for seeking him out, Halai had done his best to talk her out it.<br>
<br>
Decided in her course of action, Candra would not be swayed to change. She ignored his warning. The anxiety that gripped her stomach was already great and no good could come from further exposure to discouraging words.<br>
<br>
She took a moment to shrug off the furs that wrapped her shapely figure to reveal a form flattering tunic and matching leggings. With Coldain skin boots and gloves, she was a study of warm tones, browns and golds. Her dark hair was gathered into a thick braid that fell just shy of the center of her back.<br>
<br>
Her violet gaze swept over the area as she considered The Wakening Land. It was a large forested valley on an otherwise frozen continent. The goddess Tunare had a very palpable presence, and was likely the reason that the area was so full of life. Candra moved away from the ring’s center, stepping towards the egress.<br>
<br>
Halai followed after her, his mouth still moving. As he had yet to say anything that would encourage her, Candra was still ignoring him. She suddenly felt his gentle grip on her bicep, tugging her towards him. She turned to face her guildsman with a curious look drawn over her features.<br>
<br>
“I have faith in you, M’Lady.” His words rang with a sincerity that was echoed by his expression. His eyes held such concern. “Do not think for one moment that I do not. That which you seek is a powerful force and I only mean to urge you towards caution. It is madness for you to go alone.”<br>
<br>
“Trust in that faith, my friend. I do what must be done. This is the only way.”<br>
<br>
The druid seemed unconvinced, but was all talked out. He gave Candra a slow nod and took a step back as assent. “I shall wait for you here then, Regentia. May the Great Mother see you through this and return you safely to me soon.”<br>
<br>
She shared a reassuring smile with Halai, then turned away to leave the circle.<br>
<br>
Away from the Dragon Portal, Candra expected to be greeted with dramatic silence. She imagined an ominous, deep quiet to guide her path. The reality was that the moment she crossed over the circle’s threshold her senses were assaulted by signs of a great battle nearby. <br>
<br>
The smells of blood and magic rode the warm wind. Clashing weapons and cries of anguish rang in her ears. Her mind was reeling from fear and surprise. She turned about, spinning and searching for the source of such bedlam.<br>
<br>
Her eyes landed on a sight that was as amazing as it was terrible. Either, a group of adventurers had made the mistake of entering The Wakening Land unaware of the great dragon that made its home there, or they had come to seek it out with the intention of slaying the great beast for the fame and wealth that such a kill would bring them.<br>
<br>
Candra’s heart sank as she glanced over the mangled bodies that littered the ground; streams of crimson connecting them. She turned to those still standing and ached for the imminent loss of life. There were three of them. Candra studied each and guessed them to be a human cleric, and a Feir’Dal druid and ranger. There was nothing she could do to help them as she was unwilling to compromise her standing with the flight of dragons that made up the sect known as the Claws of Veeshan. Any attempt to help these poor souls would certainly earn the dragon’s enmity and deliver her into Death’s embrace.<br>
<br>
A splatter of blood and bits of gore had ruined the golden armor of the group’s remaining cleric; most of it not his own. The human struggled with a prayer for healing, but was cut short by a talon through his breast. The ranger fell soon after, burned to cinders as she tried to save her human companion. The druid was quick to think and took advantage of the moment to cast a spell that would take him away from the carnage. The very air about him rippled as he opened a rift in space-time, but alas, his gate proved unstable. His magic faltered and a powerful sweep of the dragon’s claws put an end to any notion of a second attempt.<br>
<br>
The dragon raised its long neck and roared so fiercely that the world shook. Candra fell to her knees, trembling for reasons besides the shaking ground beneath her feet. She struggled to compose herself, making a great effort to stand. When she had accomplished that feat, the enchantress looked up to find the dragon’s blazing serpentine gaze upon her.<br>
<br>
In that moment of incredible awe, the dragon slowly approaching - all rational thought fled her screaming mind. <br>
<br>

<br>
She struggled to reply in Dragon-speech. It had been a long time since she’d actually spoken the language aloud. Her voice was weak and came out in an awkward stammer. “I am...C-Candra Verbena, Enchantress of the 53rd Circ..”<br>
<br>
Wuoshi raised its scaly head and roared into the sky. Jets of flame streaked from its maw to blaze against the clear, night sky. Great tendrils of smoke curled from its ragged mouth as it put that scrutinizing, dragon eye back on the enchantress. <br>
<br>
Candra could not face those eyes, a sliver of black swimming against a blazing red sea. She instead ran her eyes over the line of large, sharp teeth that jutted along what could be lips. She swallowed back in attempt to eat her fear. She was suddenly of a mind that the dragon’s eyes were not so hard to look into.<br>
<br>
Wuoshi sniffed at her, the intake of air causing the loose tendrils of hair around her face to stir. Candra shivered visibly. Its voice slipped through her mind again, searching. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I smell the blood of my enemies on your flesh, and the essence of dragon-kind mingled with your own. What magic is this...?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“I stand before you, stripped of enchantments, Great Wuoshi.”<br>
<br>
Its great, serpentine eyes narrowed at her, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“You are of the blood.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It thought to her in a flat manner.<br>
<br>
Candra simply nodded, unsure of what to say. She’d known all along that Wuoshi would sense that trait in her. What she did not know was how it would react to such knowledge. She was taking a huge gamble.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“The days of the Cult are long gone, Candra. There are few scions left. You are a rare thing, indeed...”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Hearing her name gave the enchantress a start. She looked at it questioningly. “You know of me?”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Don’t be flattered, childe. I am ancient and there is precious little I do not know.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“That is the very reason why I’ve sought you out, Wuoshi. I have questions that demand answers and I lack the means to know them. I come to you seeking the guidance and wisdom that only one of your great life-span can provide. Will you help me?”<br>
<br>
Wuoshi replied as if he hadn’t heard the human speak. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Tell me, Illusionist. Do you still practice the Old Ways?”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Candra already felt small in the presence of such a power. That it ignored her plea made her feel as if she was shrinking still. “Nay, it has been years since I have partaken of the Ritual.”<br>
<br>
Wuoshi’s stare did not wander as it moved a talon inside a wound that had been inflicted upon it during the recent fight. Its expression was inscrutable as the dragon-blood-tipped talon was pushed against the enchantress’ lips. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Drink of my essence, Candra. Drink and you shall have all that you seek and more...”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The heavy scent of the dragon’s powerful vitae just under her sense was intoxicating. Candra's mind reeled, her world tilting. A great longing came over her and she found herself lacking the will to deny it. <br>
<br>
The enchantress inhaled deeply, allowing the heavy aroma to flow through her. Her eyelids were suddenly heavy - feeling weighted. She allowed them to close and leaned towards the talon, her cherry lips parting easily. Her glistening tongue snaked through them to flick against the offering; just a dab to sample. She started slow, seeming cautious. Its heavy, copper flavor exploded on her tongue and was scorching ecstasy as it flowed over the back of her mouth and down her throat, infusing her very being. Her skin was suddenly flush, body warm and becoming hotter by the second. She abandoned caution and licked harder, lapping down gobs of the powerful fluid.<br>
<br>
Even with her eyes closed, Candra could sense the dragon’s satisfaction, just as she knew it sensed hers. <br>
<br>
True to its word, when Candra had done as she was bid, Wuoshi took the enchantress under its wing and whispered long-held secrets into her mind.<br>
<br>

<br>
The myth is that Galain Whitegloves is an elf of impossible patience; that the seas of his mind are consistently placid. The High Elf carried himself with a quiet dignity that lent strength to such beliefs and a rather aloof mien, as well. <br>
<br>
The reality is that his waters are shaped by his environment, his moods by the times in which he lives. Many seem thrown off by his calm approach, failing to realize the powerful currents and trials of life constantly playing out in his depths. <br>
<br>
Every once in a while a storm gathers and rolls in over his sky. Its terrible affects upset the calm waters and shape powerful waves. <br>
<br>
The tempest currently rocking his mind was named “Candra”. She was a force of nature for sure, but to what end Galain had no clue. The human enchantress to whom he was married was, as she had always been since the two first met, a complete and utter mystery. <br>
<br>
Typically, that trait fascinated him. He appreciated her way of being completely intimate while remaining just out of reach. He didn’t mind the dalliances that played out in his absence or the various intrigues she perpetuated as amusement. <br>
<br>
There was still, most definitely, a limit to the Conjurer’s patience. <br>
<br>
“Don’t feed me this coc and bull story about the greater good, Nin’Seron. I know you, and obviously better than you think.” The two stood in middle of a large circular room on the first floor of the tower that was their home. A warm fire crackled the score for the scene and cast a golden glow over the room and its guests. They faced each other, Galain’s stern face showing his anger “You don’t do things for the ends, but for the rush the means provides.” <br>
<br>
Candra’s soft features were shaped by an indignant feeling “I did it because it was worth the risk,” she countered. <br>
<br>
“Because risk gives your life meaning and what you perceive as boredom is death?” A single brow quirked steeply, echoing the mocking sentiment of the question he posed to her. <br>
<br>
Passion coursed through the enchantress’ expression. She clenched her jaw, narrowed her almond-shaped eyes to show her disapproval of this chastisement. <br>
<br>
The display didn’t stop Galain from continuing with his point. “It’s always about the risk with you, Candra. The stakes are never so high that they can’t be made higher. As long as there’s a thrill in it, you’re willing to pay almost any price. Paybacks are a bitch, though, and you’ll get in over your head sooner or later.” <br>
<br>
“It’s my life to do with as I wish.” She spoke the words slowly, the warning obvious for her tone. <br>
<br>
Galain surged forward, so fast that Candra barely had time to register his movement at all. She was only vaguely aware of the sound of rustling silk. In an instant he had taken her by the left wrist, the action more rough than he intended it to be. He jerked her hand slightly, lifting it so that the room’s available light shined through the diamonds on the wedding ring adorning her slender finger. <br>
<br>
His gaze didn’t break away, the intense emotions bled through his eyes. “This says differently, Nin’Seron. This ring on your finger and the vow you pledged makes our lives one! <br>
<br>
“You could have been killed!” He released her with the same ‘gentle touch’ that took her. Galain’s frustration was getting the best of him. His wife’s recent trip to Wakening Land to meet with the dragon Wuoshi left the mage feeling something he didn’t care to admit to...fear. It was flooding through him now on a current of rage. <br>
<br>
Overwhelmed by his emotions, Galain turned away, putting his back to her and his face to an unadorned wall of stone. “It’s my turn to be a little selfish now, Candra. What if...you had died? Where would that have left me?” <br>
<br>
Candra stood there pouting as she stared at Galain’s back and rubbing her wrist. She could hear so much more than just the anger now and knowing of those feelings made it difficult for her to argue...but not impossible. “But I didn’t die!” <br>
<br>
“No, not this time.” <br>
<br>
Long moments passed without words. Neither seemed willing to give in to the other’s view and both feeling they had said enough. After minutes of silence passed, it was Galain who moved to settle things. <br>
<br>
The mage turned about slowly to face his wife. The anger had fled him at last and what remained was concern and just a hint of curiosity. “Your life is too precious to waste, Nin’Seron. I would like to hear of what the dragon told you. I would like to know that, at the very least, your gamble was not taken in vain.” <br>
<br>
A part of him always regretted these fights. Not for the exchange of heated words, but for the way they always ended. Candra like to win and she always did. It only took a look into those beautiful violet eyes and suddenly his clarity of thought blurred; his cause suddenly not so important. Truth to tell, Galain thought it was a trick of Candra’s magic. He had even taken to giving her his back in effort to avoid her beguiling gaze. It was to no avail. <br>
<br>
<br>
“All the ancient tongues have a name for ‘It’, Galain,” she spoke slowly, her voice soft as feathers and still somehow strong with confidence. “To translate them all into the Common-tongue would be to name our foe ‘Enemy’. It is an entity as old as any of the races, born in the Plane of Nightmare and a natural appetite for blood and souls. This Enemy lives for one single purpose that eludes my mortal mind. It wishes to murder the world, devour the realms.” <br>
<br>
Galain arched his brow to those words. “I can’t imagine this, Candra. It hardly seemed powerful enough to..” <br>
<br>
“Be careful with your assumptions, Galain,” she interrupted. Her expression was dire. “In ages past, Enemy was a power to be recognized. It was a demi-god whose power was backed by a small, but zealous death cult that followed after its agenda with unwavering devotion. When the Immaculate Order of Dragons put the horror down, much of its power was lost. Its Faith was hunted down and put to their deaths. <br>
<br>
“As a creature of spirit and not of flesh, Enemy relies on an able host to carry out its plans. My chat with Wuoshi leads me to believe that during all this time of quiet, it has replenished itself and recovered much of what it lost. I doubt that is has become the force it once was, but I’ll not take for granted its potential to become that kind of power again.” <br>
<br>
“And there’s no accounting for a few straggling devotees who may have escaped their due rewards.” Galain mused, his fingers moving across his chin as he spoke. “Enemy may well be assisted.” <br>
<br>
Candra nodded to show she concurred with Galain’s reasoning. <br>
<br>
Galain’s frustrated look returned. “How do we stop it? What does it want from me?” <br>
<br>
Candra said nothing still, replying with only a shrug of her shoulders. <br>
<br>
“Bah! Your chanced peril leaves me with more questions than answers, Candra.” Galain stepped over to his wife and planted a brief kiss against her forehead and then another against her lips. “You will not take another such risk without me, Nin’Seron. I respect your desire to unravel this mystery, but you will not do this alone.” <br>
<br>
Galain pulled away to search his love’s eyes, “Agreed?” <br>
<br>
Candra smiled into her husband’s face adoringly and lied. “Yes, Galain.” <br>
<br>
Ignorant of her deceit and satisfied with her reply, Galain pushed a long, tender kiss against Candra’s cherry lips. “And seeing that you crave adventure, make yourself ready to travel to the Wood That Burns. <br>
<br>
“I seek a wurm that holds the Embers that never die. I have been told these may hold a clue as to the fate of Magi’Kot and his seemingly fruitless attempt at mastering the Elements.” <br>
<br>
Galain turned away before indignation molded Candra’s features into something disagreeable. She hated being bossed around and he took quite a bit of pleasure in holding the reigns, if for only a moment.<br>
