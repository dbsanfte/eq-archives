2. Interesting would kind of limit random item ganking.  Would take some of the risk out of pvp as well though.<br>
<br>
3.  i think the idea that someone 4 lvls below me would be able to lure me for more than someone my level kind of ridiculous.  I really think higher levels in any match up are SUPPOSED to have the advantage.  Don't like it? level up.<br>
<br>
4. Same.  Resists are whacked enough as it is.<br>
<br>
5. Bad idea there.  City pvp can be fun and it would allow people to missuse certain strategies to a greater extent. a) zoning into a pvp safe zone to hide b) keeping an invulnerable healer in a safe zone to heal combatants as they get injured.<br>
<br>
6-7. I like this as it applies to guilds rather good idea however this has basicly no meaning when it applies to single players don't you remember people who attack and kill you?  Don't group much do ya?<br>

<br>
Higher level players have all the advantages as it is. They have better spells, better resistances, better items, better hitpoints, better AC, better everything. So in essence, higher level players have the advantage by default.<br>
What the damage bonuses (or reductions) do is to promote fair play between players of different level. It puts both combatents on even ground, instead of handing victories to higher level players.<br>
Anyway, if you don't like lower level players attacking you, level up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Zoning into a safe zone isn't hiding, it's retreating. In otherwords, you've won if your opponent retreats. This already happens with places like the nexus, and PoK. In fact, I see noobies actually playing (PvE) near PoK portals just so they don't have to deal with the PKs in the noobie/lowbie zones.<br>
The other thing you're forgetting about is this: If you're PvPing near a city zone, the guards are going to assist someone. Usually the one they see running, since the person running is not attacking the other player.<br>

Yeah, I know who the bad guys are, most of the time. The thing is, I've been playing for 3 and a half years, and it's a chore to have to keep a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://ralloszek.stephans.org/">database</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of people that have tried or successfully killed me. Not to mention that I'm sick of hearing guildies ask &quot;is X guild a PK guild?&quot;. It's pointless, and there should be some system of letting people know who is who.<br>

You must not understand anything about grouping yourself if you think those suggestions are unneccesary. I can't use 3/4ths of my AE spells in groups because if I do, I hit my groupmates/guildmates/raidmates as well as hitting the monsters. It's a totally stupid rule that needs to be looked at. I should have full access to all of my spells, just as anybody on a blue server has full access to their spells.<br>

Anyway, if you don't like lower level players attacking you, level up<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
How do you level past level 65?<br>
<br>
For example, a levle 61 wizards lure will have the exact same base damage as a level 65 wizards. But with your suggestion will the level 61 do closed to double the damage of the level 65 wizard. And no, you dont get double hps by leveling from 61 to 65. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2713<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/27/03 2:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Response</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But with your suggestion will the level 61 do closed to double the damage of the level 65 wizard.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Level 61 wiz would probably use Lure of Thunder, since it's the only PoP lure at 61. With the 66% nerf in place, LoT does 717 damage. Since the level 61 player is attacking a level 65, he'd get a 30% damage bonus for attacking a higher level player, which brings his damage to 932.<br>
The level 65, using Lure of Ro would be doing 717.<br>
<br>
I'd take the level 65 1 cast to make up for the level 61's damage bonus. It's not as big of an advantage as you think it is.<br>
Also, how likely is it that a level 61 will have Focus IV items? From my experience, it's not too likely. A level 65 still has a large advantage over the 61.<br>
<br>
Another thing you're totally forgetting about is the fact that players won't stay at specific levels just so they have that bonus over a level 65. They will still level up, so in the end, that level 61 will eventually be 65, and the playing field is once again level.<br>

<br>
Wizzy A (lvl 61) Casts for 932<br>
Wizzy B (lvl 65) Casts for 717<br>
<br>
they then trade one more lure<br>
<br>
Wizzy A (lvl 61) Casts for 932<br>
Wizzy B (lvl 65) Casts for 717<br>
<br>
Wizzy B dead? or close to it and gates...<br>
<br>
So whats this all mean??? Every level 65 wizard has 430 more hp then a level 61?  I dont think so.<br>

You're also forgetting about stuff like focus items, and a bunch of other stuff.<br>
Also, lures aren't the only tool players are going to use in PvP. I've been killed by sunstrike or EER more than I've been killed by lures. With a 65 wizzie having access to SoS, AT, and Ice flame + Ice Spear, It's more likely that you'll see those spells getting casted just for the fact that his odds would be better.<br>
<br>
In otherwords, a level 65 wiz would likely use their bigger nukes because they have a resistance bonus over lower level targets, not to mention that those spells have more of a chance at a one shot kill than a lure does.<br>
<br>
In any event, with the rules how they pertain manaburn now still being unchanged, most wizards I know will use MB over any nuke. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=znailvh>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 547<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/27/03 10:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Response</span><hr size=1> Quote by Jarnin:<br>

No, he would do 502. You didnt only suggest a 30% bonus for the 4 level lower, you also suggested a 30% penatly for the 4 levels higher.<br>

So the level 61 would hit for 932 and the lvel 65 would hit for 502.

Woah, good call. I didn't even realize that. I think I was originally split between a high level penalty and a low level bonus, but forgot I only want to have one or the other, not both.<br>

<br>
1)  I think that after MB a wizard should NOT be able to loot.  This is an extremely good idea, and i would think that all wizards would agree with it unless they are a one legged gimp.<br>
<br>
2)  Item loot is fine leave it as is.  No real reason to change it.  If you wanna wear your fungi, you better be ready to bag it.  Maybe there is a good reason for you wanting to do this?? I cant really think of one.<br>
<br>
3)  I think you new damge adjustment chart is much better.   However, I would be happy with the reduction cap being changed to 33% instead of 66%.  I cant count the number of times i have gated to paladins or to a buffed warrior.  The 66% nerf is really outdated and needs to be addressed.<br>
<br>
4)  Resists are so screwed up, i am afraid what they will screw up if they touch them.  (ie. I can see them make tash lower 200mr if u are 4 levels below and them thinking it is fair.)<br>
<br>
5)  I totally agree with this one.  I hate it when i am banking or doing some kind of tradeskills and some gimp comes and starts jacking with me.  Honestly  tho,  I am just as guilty as anyone.<br>
<br>
6 and 7)  I have wanted this for a long time.  It would be great to be able to see who is KoS to who.  I also would like to see an ability for a guild leader to make another guild KoS to them.  That would be really cool.<br>
<br>
8 and 9 and 10)  This is a great idea.. lol i love to use my rain spells but i cant use them when i am out with my guild ganking people.  In groups would be really nice to be able to use ae spells.  Chanters would probably love to use ae tash and ae mez.  <br>
<br>
Overall, good ideas, lets push to get some changes in PvP.  PvP needs to change with the new expansions, because PvP is dying as it is.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

<br>
1. True PvP'ers will PvP even if there is no item loot.<br>
<br>
2. The more restricted item loot rules are, the more relaxed players will be with PvP.<br>
<br>
3. With the Class/Race restrictions on looting in PvP, classes will migrate to PvPing with other players that may possibly have loot they can wear, which makes the battles a bit more even (Wiz vs. Enc/Mag/Nec/Wiz, Rogue vs. Rng/Shm/Rog, etc.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Another idea I've been tossing around is allowing No-Drop items to be looted in PvP. The idea is; So many people hide behind no-drop items that it ruins the idea of having item loot in the first place. With Class/Race restrictions, you'd only have to worry about players that can wear your items (same class or same armor type).<br>
No-Drop items would still have the same PvE rules (no drop, no trade). If you lose a no-drop item, you can bet that the person that got it is either wearing it, or destroyed it. They can't sell it, and they can't trade it. This might allow you the chance to get the item back in the future.<br>
<br>
The best armor for PvP would end up being cultural/religious armor that has a level requirement on it. That stuff would be about as no-drop as you'd get.<br>
<br>

Erm, what do you mean? It is a 33% damage reduction, or 66% damage done. I'm pretty sure you didn't mean you want nukes to do 33% damage, cause that would be silly...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>4) Resists are so screwed up, i am afraid what they will screw up if they touch them. (ie.

There's no change for lower level players.<br>
The idea behind this would be you go looking for higher level players to PvP against. That promotes learning PvP, because they're harder opponents.<br>

I think what i meant was that i would like to see them do around 75% or so.  We just need something to reflect the change in the amount of hp tanks have now.  <br>
<br>
Item loot - I still think this is something that is very balanced.  If you dont want something to be ganked simply dont wear it.   This is something that makes Rallos unique.  As crazy as it sounds i think that it is the only thing that really balances PvP (think about it, there arent people running around with 200+ resists because your 2k bd bracers can be ganked in a few seconds.)  From what everyone else is saying about SZ I am glad i am on RZ or my spells would render me a one legged gimp in PvP.<br>

<br>
The idea went like so.<br>
<br>
New commands.<br>
<br>
/guildkos available only to officers this command marks a single enemy or entire guild as kos to your fellows.<br>
<br>
Usage: /guildkos Graffe /guildkos &quot;Graffe Mods&quot;<br>
<br>
/kos available to all this command marks an enemy or an entire guild as kos to you.<br>
<br>
The actual result would be that anyone in that guild (or just you) would see the person with a KOS tag in any /who or /who all listing as well as in person.  This tag would be very similar to the AFK tag. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=acillatemzoso>Acillatem Zoso</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/2/03 3:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 10 suggested changes for Rallos Zek PvP rules</span><hr size=1> Coming from Tallon here, so bear with the critique <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1.  No comment - not needed on TZ IMO.<br>
<br>
2.  Again, not needed on TZ, however I see no reason to implement this anywayz.  If I kill someone, I would want a trophy, a mark of that kill and not be limited to looting someone who holds something I could USE.<br>
<br>
3. No.  Higher levels have an advantage for a reason.  It's called they EARNED it.  The gear, the levels, the AA's, the potions.  They are all a part of the PvP environment.  Those who take the time, and the energy to achieve all of the above, SHOULD have a significant advantage over Joe Blow with zero AAs, level 57, missing spells, wearing a Gossimmer Robe using no potions.  This idea only promotes laziness and takes away the &quot;spoils&quot; of achieving PvE goals in order to make yourself better in PvP.  If it's a fair fight yer looking for, /duel another 65 WIZ.<br>
<br>
4.  Again no.  A level 65 with &quot;Debuff of the Gods&quot; has EARNED the right to diminish my MR to nothingness.  Besides that, almost every debuff can be countered via potions or spells that a WIZ has anywayz.<br>
<br>
5.  I would imagine this is a problem on Rallos more than Tallon, however I frequently take my Human WIZ into Neriak to PvP unsuspecting Darks.  The prey is very few and far between since Luclin was released, however City PvP is some of the all time best PvP in EQ.  I can remember when I first started on Tallon Zek, Darks would raid Freeport, and Humans would rally from across the lands to hold it.  It was a weekly event, and was the best PvP I've ever had the chance to be in.<br>
<br>
Then they nerfed the guards~<br>
<br>
6.  Altho a nice idea, I think this is more of a novelty and not something really needed or useful.<br>
<br>
7.  See 6.<br>
<br>
8.  Good idea.  Altho simply pressing &lt;CTL&gt; &lt;D&gt; will nullify it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
9.  Must be a RZ thing.<br>
<br>
10.  Again, must be a RZ problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only &quot;lameness&quot; I've seen lately was people porting C3ers away from bazaar to gank their plat.  Perhaps something similar to yer No PvP group idea is to put a time restraint of 15 seconds after leaving group?<br>
<br>
Most of these I see no reason for on Tallon Zek.  Now if you can solve corpse camping, training, and bind rushing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
But as someone else said, Verant doesn't care.  Notice all of that became legal when Stormhammer was released?  Cuz they want you to get frustrated and leave your PvP server and pay 30 mroe dollars for a &quot;stress free&quot; game.<br>

Anywayz I finally agree to C3 him after he gives me a BD Earring <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
