<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The CIA has in its hands the critical parts of a key piece of Iraqi nuclear technology -- parts needed to develop a bomb program -- that were dug up in a back yard in Baghdad, CNN has learned. <br>
<br>
The parts, with accompanying plans, were unearthed by Iraqi scientist Mahdi Obeidi who said he had hidden them under a rose bush in his garden 12 years ago under orders from Qusay Hussein and Saddam Hussein's then son-in-law, Hussein Kamel. <br>
<br>
CNN Security Correspondent David Ensor reports that under United Nations sanctions in place in 1991, the concealment of such materials -- and failure to disclose their presence -- would have constituted violations of Security Council regulations. <br>
<br>
But U.S. officials emphasized that this was not evidence Iraq had a nuclear weapon -- but it was evidence the Iraqis concealed plans to reconstitute their nuclear program as soon as the world was no longer looking. <br>
<br>
The parts and documents Obeidi gave the CIA were shown exclusively to CNN at CIA headquarters in Virginia. <br>
<br>
Obeidi told CNN the parts of a gas centrifuge system for enriching uranium were part of a highly sophisticated system he was ordered to hide to be ready to rebuild the bomb program. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have very important things at my disposal that I have been ordered to have, to keep, and I've kept them, and I don't want this to proliferate, because of its potential consequences if it falls in the hands of tyrants, in the hands of dictators or of terrorists,&quot; said Obeidi, who has been taken out of Iraq with the help of the U.S. government. <br>
<br>
Obeidi also said he was not the only scientist ordered to hide that type of equipment. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think there may be more than three other copies. And I think it is quite important to look at this list so they will not fall into the hands of the wrong people,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Centrifuges are drums or cylinders that spin at high speed and separate heavy and light molecules, allowing increasingly enriched uranium to be drawn off. (Interactive: How uranium is enriched) <br>
<br>
David Kay, who led three U.N. arms inspection missions in Iraq in 1991-92 and now heads the CIA's search for unconventional weapons, started work two days ago in Baghdad. CNN spoke to him about the case over a secure teleconferencing line. <br>
<br>
&quot;It begins to tell us how huge our job is,&quot; Kay said. &quot;Remember, his material was buried in a barrel behind his house in a rose garden. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's no way that that would have been discovered by normal international inspections. I couldn't have done it. My successors couldn't have done it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kay said he had mixed emotions when he saw the centrifuge components: &quot;It was a realization that I hadn't gotten all the parts [of Iraq's nuclear program]. So there was a moment of regret, but there was also an exhilaration that now maybe we have a chance to take this to the very bottom.&quot; <br>
<br>
CNN learned of the discovery last week but made a decision to withhold the story at the request of the U.S. government, which cited safety and national security concerns. <br>
<br>
The U.S. government told CNN the security and safety issues have been dealt with and there is no risk now in telling the story fully. <br>
<br>
The gas centrifuge equipment dates to Iraq's pre-1991 efforts to build nuclear weapons. <br>
<br>
Experts said the documents and pieces Obeidi gave the United States were the critical information and parts to restart a nuclear weapons program, and would have saved Saddam's regime several years and as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for research. <br>
<br>
David Albright, who was a U.N. nuclear weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s, said inspectors &quot;understood that Iraq probably hid centrifuge documents, may have had components, and so it is very important that those items be found.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What it is that Obeidi was ordered to keep was all the information and some centrifuge components, so that if he was given the order, he could restart the centrifuge program,&quot; said Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington. <br>
<br>
&quot;In a sense, the program was in hibernation. He was the key to the restart of this centrifuge program, and he never got the order. So in that sense it doesn't show at all that Iraq had a nuclear program. And Obeidi told me that he never worked on a nuclear program after 1991.&quot; <br>
<br>
Obeidi said he felt unsafe in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion and that he was getting pressure from different corners of the country. <br>
<br>
He also said other Iraqi scientists were watching to see if he was safe after he cooperated with the U.S. government. <br>
<br>
Now that he and his family are safely out of Iraq, Obeidi said he believes other scientists would come forward with other components of Iraq's weapons program. <br>
<br>
Before the Iraq war, U.S. officials said Iraq tried to purchase aluminum tubes that could be used in centrifuges that enrich uranium. <br>
<br>
In his March 7 presentation to the U.N. Security Council, however, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei said there was no evidence &quot;Iraq intended to use these 81-millimeter tubes for any project other than the reverse engineering of rockets.&quot; (IAEA reaction, Transcript of ElBaradei March 7 report) <br>
<br>
U.S. officials, including President Bush, also had cited British intelligence documents indicating Iraq may have tried to buy 500 tons of uranium from Niger, but the IAEA said the documents were obvious fakes. <br>
<br>
CNN correspondents Mike Boettcher and David Ensor and producer Maria Fleet contributed to this story. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Certainly not a smoking gun of any sort, but obviously they've been hiding information about their nuclear program (which they claimed they never had) for some time now.

<br>
What saddens me more though is that 25% of the American population in a survey I saw in wensdays newspaper (local paper, no web link I could find) thought that Saddam had used WMD against the american troops in the last war, 60% did not and the rest where uncertain. Now, I can honestly say I did not spend a great deal of time watching the American news but did they report something to support such a belif? I know there where reports of finding stuff (which then where found to be normal powder etc) but did any media claim that the troops where ever subject of such attacks? Only curious where such belifs would come from, that is all.

Well... An Iraqi nuke scientist was told to hide the part...<br>
So he stuck it in a 50 gal drum and burried it in his backyard then planted a rose bush on top of it.<br>
He came forward and told US officals that he would give them all the info he had for safety in america... he then showed him where the parts were.<br>
This scientist has conformed that after it is proven that he is safe ... more will come forward with more info...<br>
so its really no surprize that inspecters didnt find anything... its all burried in peoples back yards all over Iraq.<br>
<br>
If i can find the whole story ill post it.<br>

Yet ironically, it wasn't the CIA's intelligence which got the information; it wasn't the barney torture tapes played over and over which got the information, and it surely wasn't the army's raids on scientist homes scaring them to death which got the information. All it took was trust between the scientist and a former UN inspector (you know the guys so villified and laughed at by americans), who assured him his safety, which got the information.<br>

What do you know? Treating scientists like people instead of terrorists actually works!<br>

errmm.. not sure what your point would be in any case..  That Saddam wouldn't have known what his officers were doing?  We are talking about Saddam Hussein, right?  Like, *The* Saddam Hussein?  The paranoid control freak that always ensured he knew exactly what was going on at all times?  It's not like he stayed in power as long as he did by just letting his men freelance, you know... If Qusay (Saddam's son, btw) and Hussein Kamel (Saddam's then-son-in-law) told the scientist to bury the equipment, I'd be shocked and awed to find out they weren't acting under Saddam's direct orders.  Independent thought and action weren't exactly encouraged under Hussein's regime... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=murel>Murel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1755<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 9:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well Murel</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What do you know?

It's worthwhile to note that this scientist would not have come forward with the Saddam government still in power. And while I haven't heard any stories of our troops terrorizing scientists so I don't know particulars, I'm pretty sure we're not threatening them and their families, so we're one up on Saddam. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 13538<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 10:00 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well Murel</span><hr size=1> Saddam should just use the same defense Reagan and George Bush senior used when they were accused of knowing all about Iran-Contra. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.EQPixelArmy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-animated-banner-animation.gif" height="120" width="80" alt="EQPA" border=0></a><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41790" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-animated-banner-text.gif" height=120 width=272 alt="Whizbang Dustyboots" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chortnazgul>chort nazgul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 893<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/03 10:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well Murel</span><hr size=1> It's pretty amusing for someone to suggest that if the UN inspectors would have had the intelligence, they could have achieved the same results.  Came you imagine the furor Saddam's govt would have raised about the UN wanting to search someone's back yard?  Do you think that would happen in a million years of rule by Saddam's family?  If you truly believe that could have happened with Saddam in power, then you're 50 times more gullible than you claim the general war-supporting American public is.<br>
<br>
Even if the scientist would have talked in the first place (which obviously they didn't while Saddam was in power, gee I wonder why that was?) the UN would not have been allowed to search.  As soon as the scientist who blew the whistle would have &quot;disappear mysteriously&quot; his colleagues would have magically developed severe cases of amnesia.<br>

If the UN said it wanted to inspect some place and Saddam denied it, he would have been invaded. I see no way he could deny them access and stay in power.<br>

He was in a position of having a gigantic army in his own country vs. a small team of unarmed UN inspectors.  How do you propose they could have carried out inspections of backyards without consent?<br>

I call bullshit.  The UN has never done anything to enforce resolutions since Korea.  Don't say Bosnia, because that was NATO, not the UN.  Iraq was in material breech of numerous UN resolutions, yet the UN sat on their hands indefinitely.  You can't possibly type that with a straight face.<br>

<br>
What difference does it make?  Saddam still would have blocked the inspections, regardless of whether the scientist was spirited away.  All the other scientists with sensitive data would have been put under lock and key.  There were several high-ranking defectors during the long period of UN in-action, a couple of them with extremely damning and frightening information, yet the UN sat idly by and didn't even bother to put up a fight when Saddam kicked them out.<br>

Really, there is no point in discussing the issue if you refuse to deal with facts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.showMessageRange?topicID=2225.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.showPrevMessage?topicID=2225.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.showNextMessage?topicID=2225.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.emailToFriend?topicID=2225.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.threadControl?topicID=2225.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2225.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2225.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm59>General OT Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
