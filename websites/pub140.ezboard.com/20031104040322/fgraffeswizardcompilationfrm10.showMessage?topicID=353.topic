<br>
&quot;Wizards right now have two specialties, damage and teleportation. They should be the masters of arcane magic and ripping holes in the fabric of space. Making them the masters of teleportation not only makes a lot of sense, it also adds a dimension to the class.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, we are moving toward making Wizards the master of arcane transportation. This seems like the right direction to take the class.&quot; <br>
<br>
Alan <br>
<br>
Now my argument...<br>
<br>
Didn't VI say a while back that druids were the masters of transportation?  I thought that was the explanation for them getting nicer and earlier lvl teleport spells.  That's also why they have Spirit of Wolf, remember?  Certainly not to allow them to kite.  And don't forget traveling utilities: Enduring breath, levitate, invisibility (camo, whatever).. even wolf form for faction certain places!<br>
<br>
So if druids are no longer masters of traveling, doesn't that mean they don't need all these spells anymore?  I personally think that if wizards are now the masters of transportation, then we should be able to run faster than others, and have all those other abilities earlier than druids.<br>
<br>
I'm not one to scream for other classes to be nerfed, so our SoW should be faster than druid, shaman, or bards could ever hope to run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And our version of wolf from (I like drake form myself) should have good faction everywhere and provide super running speed, mana regen, night vision, levitate, underwater breathing, and an in-flight movie. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, wizards should have a teleport to every single zone in the game (dungeons included).  And the first gates should be at lvl 12, not 20.  Portals at 16.  And evacs/translocates at 20.<br>
<br>
If all these things are given to wizards, then the new description really would be a fix (kinda), otherwise, it is a pimp smack in the nuts.<br>

Some say the world will end in fire;

Instead of say eye of zomm, how about an eye that you can cast which lands in PoH or Walking lands portal no matter what zone you cast it in.  The idea is that you can look around to see if wushi is up or if there are a doznen mobs at the portal before you port there.  That would be a useful spell!<br>

This problem could have been corrected over a YEAR ago and we'd be on to new things.  But they aren't capable of doing what they should.  So instead, they change the rules so what they are CURRENTLY doing...  looks great!  They had lost any respect I had for the game MONTHS ago.  Why do I still play?  My friends are more important then Verant is.  I will grit my teeth for them.<br>
<br>
And for those of you who think the masters of transportation is going to help US in the least, what on earth do these new Translocates tell you?  Its for OTHERS, not us.  What this is does is place a megaphone in our hands while we yell out... &quot;NO, WE DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE GAME!  WE JUST WANT TO BE BOTHERED FOR PORTS EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY!  SEND TELLS!&quot;<br>
<br>
And as for personal gates to Velious, all this does is conserve our mana a touch.  Still not overly filled with WORTH.<br>
<br>
They have sufficiently made it so there is nothing more to love about the class.  If you LIKE being bothered, and LIKE porting everwhere for other people ,and LIKE being the disaster recovery when people can't handle their OWN classes (along with necros summoning), then fine, have a blast.  This class has been MADE for you.  (all 5 of you)<br>

I thing the last thing we need to hear is more requests about porting as that tends not to get you experience. I just see teleportation as an attempt to pacify the wizard class with some small token.<br>

<br>
Now that we are the masters of transportation - will the CT gate/port spell location get changed to somewhere safer?<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Looking down the road - if we are getting these new spells, is there one in the works so that wizards are the only ones that will be able to port closer to Qeynos/Halas? (not that silly next to NK, WK port spell)<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Will we get a port to SK at the already there Wiz Platform to balance our ability with druid to port closer to the southern part of the world in a relatively safe spot (instead of CT).<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
To make it more efficient to translocate folks, will we get a zone target ability (along the lines of guild invite) or even better yet, a character target ability across zones? Something along the lines of being able to trans someone from Gfay to NK while sitting in an xp group in Karnors. Now, that would be uber skills.<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
When we are in xp groups/raids or whatever, will we get our own channel filter - anyone asking who uses the the word port, trans, translocate (etc) receives an automatic message stating &quot;Sorry, I am .... right now.&quot; without us having to deal with it in tells.<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Will translocate spells ever require that you have to have had at least X amount of xp with that person before you can trans them ever be a factor in the ability to cast the spell?<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Will trans spell mana costs ever be lowered to that of gate - which it essentially is?<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
As masters of arcane transportation, will the EJ and Skyfire zone evacs now become direct port spots for wizards, with druids limited to evac from dungeon only?<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Will wizard transportation spells ever be modified to ad benefits to the group - ie, evac spells have a heal modifier, all members of group are fully healed? Better yet, or at least additionally, when you port everyone is buffed with a 10 minute version of SoW automatically. Or a version of the spell that automatically invises all party members during casting (nice for that hate plane port in).<br>
<br>
Can you say PHAT chance!<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
If we are to be the masters, the skills of the spells need to be added to. Let druids at least become the less capable of the 2 classes. Something similar to the limitations of their healing abilities when compared to clerics - effective, but nowhere near as good.<br>

I think it's a mistake to take what he said there as proof that they have dropped the damage issue though, he didn't say that.  He actually suggested the opposite by saying we SHOULD be the masters of magical damage.  He didn't say Wizards ARE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukenju.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kenju</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/8/01 1:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: arcane teleportation</span><hr size=1> -Translocate mob (200mana,3sec cast,53lvl,45 SEC recast) sends mob to spawn point and wipes agro.<br>

Isn't this pretty much what disentegrate does? no exp/loot, makes mob go bye bye. phat chance at getting something better. <p><a href=http://www.lmalla.com/memtest/index.asp?memid=193>Kenju Weeple</a> <BR>

<br>
Does this apply to the group trans spell?<br>
<br>
Scenario - group trans, everyone leaves ... now wizard has to port himself (gate) using a separate spell. Hopefully this isn't the case.<br>

<br>
So, since we can send folks to so many new places - will we get any class defining bind spells? Something along the lines of bind tank anywhere and effect last 24 real life hours, then reverts to their original town bind spot.<br>
