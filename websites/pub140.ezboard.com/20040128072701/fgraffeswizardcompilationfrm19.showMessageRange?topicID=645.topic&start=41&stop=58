there's a few things you can do-<br>
<br>
1: get your magic resistance up, so you resist your own snare<br>
<br>
2: get a mage summoned spellhaste item<br>
<br>
3: pull them with your bof (hope you have kei)<br>
<br>
<br>
you might want to practice with the gnolls in S Kar - they are plentiful and wimpy - all in one little package.<br>

Faction Affected: None<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Best AA grind camp for solo wiz, that I've found so far. There are 9 spawns and room enough to kite them without snaring. MR on these is high enough to not to use snare for quads/9-kites. The spawntime on the 9 also allows for grabbing all 9 and then doing &quot;swarm kite&quot; and finish it before they respawn, thus making med time quite short. Their aggro range is very, very small, so you need to TFlux each one of them to get them to follow, then just round up all 9 and run around the picnic table area. When you use whole area (run behind huts) the long sides of the area give just enough room with JBoots to use pillar or Al'Kabor (and even some buffer if using Pillar of Frost). Using anything over 4s casting time is a suicide. Using just pillar of frost, it is easy to kill first 4, then another 4 and with resists and partials the last one should be around 50% at that time, so it is easy to snare and finish. If you have fast enough Al'Kabor, it can be used to do first 5 and then use pillar on rest 4.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Warning:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->This is not an easy camp, one slip, one lag spike, etc. and you'll be getting rez and new VoQ.<br>

Zone Name: IceClad Ocean<br>
Camp Area/LOC: By Eastern Wastes Bridge<br>
Mob List (HP): Dire Wolves (~1300), Frost Giant Scout (~2300), Frost Giant Elites (~2800)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 10 (I've been there for nearly 24 hours real time and never saw anyone else there)<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 5 (some plat and velious weapons, rare Ring of Frost)<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 (Easy)<br>
Faction Affected: Frost Giants (Kromzek and Kromrif decreased, Coldain and Claws of Veshan increased)<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: There are tons of dire wolves and Frost Giant Scouts on the southern half island with the EW brdige. Mobs are spread out enough to to avoid adds, yet close enough to quickly pull in a quad. I tend to favor the Giants over the Wolves, primarily because they have some loots (to pay for SoW potions, no luck for me with the <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :sosad --><img src=http://rombusmindspire.tripod.com/sosad.txt ALT=":sosad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) and for the Claws of Veshan (eventual Skyshrine quests) and Coldain (Thurgadin quests)faction. There are enough mobs to support 2 or 3 quadders easily, but I never saw anyone else. At around 37 I was getting 1.6 blues per quad, and still getting around 1 blue per quad at 43, although the scouts were starting to turn light blue on me. <br>
<br>
The following are my general quadding notes from my experiences:<br>
<br>
My spell lineup for Quadding<br>
<br>
1: a nuke (not my highest nuke, for finishing up)<br>
2: CoF<br>
3: BoF<br>
4: Root (I use Immobilize, usually for adds)<br>
5: Steelskin (this is mostly because I don't have SoTF and have to get agro by range)<br>
6: Harvest (between rounding up and killing this is usually repoped for each quad)<br>
7: Yonder (for when everything goes awry)<br>
8: Gate (I usually bind at my quad spot, so I usually have Nexus Gate memed for evacing myself, also need to go there often to sell loot)<br>
<br>
Buffs up:<br>
SoW (usually from a potion)<br>
Steelskin<br>
Minor Familar<br>
Greater Shielding<br>
Okiel's Levity<br>
<br>
General approach: <br>
1. As i'm lacking the SoTF <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :sosad --><img src=http://rombusmindspire.tripod.com/sosad.txt ALT=":sosad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I tend to just run into agro range, which is often through the legs. Snag up four this way <br>
2. Pull mobs to a non add area.<br>
3. switch to eye in the sky mode with f9 (3rd f9 puts you in eye in the sky mode, where you can zoom and in spin around your characters axis). Run in a large circle, such as tapping the right key every .75 seconds or so, usually one circle will group all of them, else do another circle. Use your mouse in pan around to make sure the mobs don't get close enough to whack you.<br>
4. Run a good distance ahead to cast BoF. With the eye in the sky mode I can correctly guess the proper distance every time now.<br>
5. Once they are snared it's all butter from then on out. CoF, walk ahead till gem repops, repeat.<br>
6. Keep track of time on new mobs pulls, make sure to rehit with BoF before it fades.<br>
7. Don't leave home without KEI. <br>
8. Try to get the same mobs in a quad. Not so much because of different HPs, but as long as there is more than 1 mob of the same type chasing you they won't run, they'll keep coming, which is good, else the group will break up because 1 is standing still or running and the other 3 are coming at you.<br>
9. Always be sure to have somehow to quickly resow yourself in case your sow drops.<br>
10. Always have yonder and gate memed when you forget about step 9.<br>

<br>
Caveat: I have not quadded the Wyverns in CS, but the following is what I have been told, about would like to hear feedback on the following if you believe it to be true or not.<br>
<br>
[Minimum Level: 51]<br>
<br>
I am told this can be done at 44. Using CoF (about 16 of them) and 3 or so BoFs With KEI (a 10 minute kite will regen you around 800 mana) and a large mana pool (I have a 240 Int). It will take all of your mana, you may even have to run around for the KEI to replinish for the last CoF, but it is doable (I think). I will try this personally soon, but this the above is consistant with the advice of others who have.<br>
<br>
[Mob List (HP): Wyvern]<br>
<br>
They have about 3200 hps.<br>
<br>
[Availability (1-&gt;10): 2]<br>
<br>
Goes without saying I suppose, but probably depends on server. On the frequent trips to the Othmirs to turn in tusks, I've never seen any qudding going on Rodcet Nife.<br>
<br>
[Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Often camped but very easy, Wyverns will not agro if you have a good faction with Claws of Veeshan, except for Yvolcarm and Azureake (the named Cobalt Drake).]<br>
<br>
I believe they are social though, so you can drag a agroed Wyvern through another to get agro even if you have good CoV faction.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Notes:   This is an unique quad.   You must be sow or jboots to do this.   The fort it self has 6 mobs  the outside has plenty more.   The major issue is gettting the pull.  Snare, Root, Or TFlux, however. be carefuly.   Now there is a HUGE sheet of ice on the south side of the fort.  Pull them to there.   Also, There are only 2 wanders that go on that huge sheet of ice, plus on the southeast end is a 2 spawn of giants if you run out.<br>
<br>
The main concern is getting them out.  Giants have a longer melee range than most mobs so keep that in mind.  do not pack in front of the fort get them on ice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
At 41st I had 2 - 2.5 bubbles of mana left after quading.  Maxium amount of mana I used was 3 bubbles of mana.   INT is 251 so you do the math.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
-----<br>
Quading in Dawnshroud is viable until 44. Large Zelniaks and Wolves are still blue at this level. The odd large Zelniak (1/6) is light blue.  I was still getting 4-5% of a level at 44 here per quad.<br>
<br>
Zelniaks have 1300-1500hps. Wolves are in the 1600hp range. <br>
<br>
The drawback to this zone is the odd named (agro) Wolf/Zelniak and of course the lightcrawlers. While these arnt terribly threatening to a PC with SoW, they are quite disruptive to your rhythm and will agro regardless of level.  <br>
<br>
Dont expect any loot. There is no coin, and no items of consequence.<br>
<br>
At higher levels It would be possible to quad stonegrabbers, but they do hit hard and have a ton of hps. Not recommended as value for mana.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Quading the beach in Gulf Of Gunthak<br>
Level 40-47.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt recomend it to inexperienced quaders for a number of reasons. <br>
<br>
1. The mobs seem to have a very random HP range. (1200hp-1500hp for the lower level skeletons, 1500-1800hps for some zombies, 1800-2400hps for the odd named mob). <br>
<br>
2. Snared mobs all move at different speeds depending on type. Zombies tend to be quite slow. Mixed quads can be difficult to keep bunched.<br>
<br>
3. All undead types will keep going for you, even at 1% health.<br>
<br>
4. The pathing is fairly good, but mobs do warp into melee range in some spots (left hand side of the beach has at least three spots I know of where this happens.). <br>
<br>
5. You usually have to clear a safe kiting lane initially, and then re-clear every 20 or so minutes. This may put you in competition with other players if you play during busy times.<br>
<br>
So your milage may vary. Solo XP is fairly good here, but I feel the beach is anti-quad by design.  The loot is appropriate (occasional peridots, opals, emeralds, black pearls, gold broaches) but doesnt approach hill giants.<br>

The first section of the beach is perfect for quadding.  Its a large open oval shape with mobs surrounding its perimeter.  Pull with atols and get busy.  The first mobs I pull are the mobs to the far right... and th far left.  The reason for this is to clear some room for the occasion snare resist.  The loot is wonderful and there are non stop donations for port outs for stranded explorers.  The exp is awesome and the loot is excellent as well being as though gunthak has random loot off random mobs.  Its not uncommon to walk away with 500 to 600 pp a night from mob loot and port requests.<br>
<br>
There is also a Castle near the Dulak zone in that has tons of drogmar and shrooms to pull.  Its very wide open and is NEVER camped.  The only downside is the loot is non existant.  Though the Drogmar drop an item that has a single charge of Clarity.  But seriously who needs clarity with all the Kei for Donation going around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunaltoadsnatcher>Lunal Toadsnatcher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1351<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/6/03 5:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quad Kiting Locations Guide - Rough Draft</span><hr size=1> You do realize that a level 34 does not get the spell Atol's Spectral Shackles, right?

<br>
I am working on my wizzy now that has been around since one month after I started my ranger. Needless to say I have found this board very informative and usefull...with a few exceptions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ....but anyway  the list on the first page has been great so far except one thing....I went to EW did Ulthorks right off the bat at umm 34...this got me t0 36 after 8 hrs   (4 hrs x 2 nights)  very very good plat and great exp....well I decided to try the tofs tower base as mentioned the loot there does suck...but the exp there was merely like one blue to a blue and a half a quad at 36 and to make matters worse when  these mobs get low the do run rather then chase still like most other mobs when in a pack....well this lead to them stopping all together and if I didnt kill them right off they would warp back to where they were pulled from.....has anyone else seen this ?  I got this a couple times elsewhere and figured it was a fluke thing....but it happens a ton at just outside tofs.... <br>
<br>
again imho the exp stinks for the level BUT I did notice if I got a full quad done with no problems ie all snared together all died together no warpage problem...that I could kill a quad in about 35 % mana....soooo it is kinda worth it seeing as how with only 240 INT and 230ish mana and kei I could do 3 quads to one of the ultorks before having to med....<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>well I decided to try the tofs tower base as mentioned the loot there does suck<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
My main problem there was adds, it was just hard to go anywhere without running into more mobs. I only tried a few times before I move to the southern part of the island and quadding wolves and IG scouts (the southernmost part of the big isle is flat enough (with o'kiels lev) and has few roamers). You get good faction hits (assuing your going on the favorable skyshrine route) and OK loot (2 to 10 plat per mob depending on loot, mostly velious weapons). Anyway, that's what I did at your level.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but the exp there was merely like one blue to a blue and a half a quad at 36<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Enjoy it while you can, that's about as best your going to get. The most i've ever gotten from a quad is about 8%, and, and most have been more like 5% (1 blue).<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>to make matters worse when these mobs get low the do run rather then chase still like most other mobs when in a pack<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I usually only run into this problem when the mobs are of different types. Usually as long as there is 2 of the same mob, they will always chase you (misery loves company), they being the mobs that are 2 or more. If you have 3 mobs and 2 are of 1 type and 1 of another, the 1 will run and not chase when it gets low on hp.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>this lead to them stopping all together and if I didnt kill them right off they would warp back to where they were pulled from<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It is a wierd deal, but it will continue happen. My experiences so far are that some mobs will run (when only 1 of there type is left in the quad) and some will gate if you get to far away from them (when they are low on health). What works for me is to not get to far away (not casting at max distance) when the mobs are low on health.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>soooo it is kinda worth it seeing as how with only 240 INT and 230ish mana and kei I could do 3 quads to one of the ultorks before having to med....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think part of this is the illusion of it being faster, because you are doing something (gathering the quad, running around) than just sitting there watching your mana bar creep up, e.g. waiting for the proverbial water to boil. To fairly compare these you'll need to time yourself on how much xp you get over a set amount of time. Plus other factors, such as loot and faction. I've determiend a long time ago that I won't quad things for no loot, else I run a defecit in buying SoW potions.<br>

I did em from 45 till I dinged 52.  The only time I died was from going LD during middle of kite, so with a lvl 53's arsenal of POF and Atols, I'd say you need some quadding practice.<br>
<br>
Raptors are actually where you should be quadding for xp at 53 in TD.  Other than learning to break the large island spawns, its mindlessly boring, but great xp.  <br>
<br>
Hint for raptors:  make use of all of the limited space, especially for the initial breaks.  Round em up over the water (with levity on yourself) then run em in a straightline over to the beach.  <br>

-&gt;this is a redo of Myztic's guide, as I arrived to pofire when there were no other elemental guilds: may want to quad with Guardian of Doomfire up. <br>
Minimum level: 65<br>
Maximum level: 65<br>
Zone Name: Doomfire (PoFire)<br>
Camp Area/Loc: Picnic table / area before Fennin ramp<br>
Mob List(HP): Doomfire Soldiers(highly MR), Doomfire Guardians, Doomfire Protectors (40-50k)<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 8 - mobs die a bit faster than you can kill them. the camp's always available for me, server varies- there's only one of this area. still the highest xp availability<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 3 - money, but unlike field of gib quads, no rare things to make trades items from. <br>
Quad Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 5  - Uncamped Tactics pit would be a 10(hardest successful quads I have done)... when ranking to make 10 the hardest.<br>
Pull Diff.Ranking(1-&gt;10): 6 - Quavonis Firetail being the hardest mob I've done pulls of for the '10' to compare it against. hard to target.<br>
Gear suggestions:Jboots/SOW, TFlux, ManaPreservation, FT10+, dagger of entrapment helps<br>
Faction Affected: None, or your conscience if you're a Solusek wizard(you killed daddy's defenders?!)<br>
<br>
Location: It's all the way in the back of the zone as you can get yourself; past both fields, the bridge, and the first castle.<br>
<br>
This is a snared version of the three 'sets' of quads. I experience 27% resists at the location to my snare, and a Dagger of Entrapment is very useful for the more limited area. Main danger is the Guardian of Doomfire, who is just ornery and won't let you run around the house that's close to him. I divide this into 3 sets, based on the easiest way to do it:<br>
<br>
First Set, single corner mob.<br>
You'll notice, on entering the area, a mob on the right side of the table area in the back far corner. Since there are 9 mobs, it's optimal to start with him. The easiest way to start is to cast Elnerik's Entombment of Ice on him, then fire snares on him in case of bad luck. You can kite him around the tables or around that area and the back right hut.<br>
<br>
Second Set,first quad.<br>
I have the worst time targeting anything in a hut. You can walk in and proximity guards out if you cant manage to target them(rendering maybe?). Another way is to use eye of tallon to target one. Flux the one on the right side of the left hut(the one by guardian spot) and drag him out. The other two from the other hut can be targeted and fluxed, or you can drag the mob that's chasing you over that hut to add them out. You then should grab the mob from the remaining corner(since trigger's up). Round those up and quad them in the table/back hut area.<br>
<br>
Third set, second quad.<br>
Run to the corner opposite of the two mobs that are standing by the guardian of doomfire. I start this one by getting the remaining one from the hut(just cant target the old boy), then full speed them and pull the other two from the corner around the guardian of doomfire, followed by the last one. Once you start quadding this, the back corner for the third set becomes a territory that's at risk to repopping on you, as the first 3 sets will run you out of mobs, giving you haphazard repop times. <br>
<br>
The other main quadding areas are the soldiers of fire, and the field of gib(which I prefer to the soldiers, for the drops)... which are much easier and I could post on them later! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=645.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=645.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=645.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=645.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=645.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.threadControl?topicID=645.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=645.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=645.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19>Soloing and Quad-Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
