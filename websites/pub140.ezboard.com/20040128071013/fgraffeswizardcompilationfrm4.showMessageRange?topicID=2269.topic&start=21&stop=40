I give you about 6.5.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You managed to stir commentary. That's a 10 to start with.<br>
<br>
You lose a point for coming here to piss on wizards. But I'll give one back for having the cojones to do so. So we're even.<br>
<br>
Take a point for being a Cleric. They ROCK.<br>
<br>
Lose one straight away for telling an AE snare class how to snare. Poor form. Like we didn't get the fucking message in OT?! I mean two years ago or more. Yeesh!<br>
<br>
Lose two for &quot;eye candy&quot; bullshit. Yeah, I started a Wizard in order to impress a WIS caster. Just like you started a WIS caster to show us up in the healing arena. Please! Have one for me...<br>
<br>
DOH!!! Concussion!!? Well, for those of us who had to solo 2/3 of it let me say that we are quite happy with it. I can only say that I hope that you supported your Wizard &quot;friends&quot; in getting theirs. Call it a draw on this one. Giving you the benefit here, and all. I mean, thanks for telling me what to cast.<br>
<br>
To you, and all the rest that wanted to take offense at Wizards, I claim a point. I mean, how many times did my sisters and brothers help you and yours to a rez? Hmmm? Forget the times that the more realistic of your brethren and sisterhood accepted fair payment for services. I dare say that we Wizards more than paid our way. I know bloody well that I did, as did (and do!) my sisters and brothers. &quot;/ooc Need a port to &lt;blah&gt; for a rez&quot; No worries. Seriously, if it were not for Druids (bless them) you'd lose two here!<br>
<br>
So you're seven out of ten now. Wondering where the other one point five is?<br>
<br>
No problem. (I, n00b that I am) took offense. I often take damage beyond my rune; the clerics I know, know I do that. I tell them I'm going to go nuts beforehand. You know what? They deal with it. I have a sense of get-the-fuck-out-of-here that I developed with the Clerics and non-Clerics that I have played with. I have saved as much XP butt as my friends have. My Sisters and Brothers of the Cloth have lost XP too. Lose a point there. Why? We're all human, and you seem to think you're more so.<br>
<br>
Lose a half for thinking your shit don't stink. Guess what? It does.<br>
<br>
I hope you don't play on my server, fuckchop.<br>
<br>
Um, take another half a point for posting here. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~dracophile/YllaenaPortrait1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

If someone is an obvious ebayer or just plain idiot, well, yes, as a cleric (responsible for the health of the group and all) we are responsible for letting them know. What you are suggesting, however, is to try and give a wizard a lesson on playing a wizard. That seems like an excellent way to piss someone off and lower the overall efficency of your group. If anyone ever told me how I should play either of my characters, I would tell them to shove it and kick them out of my group. <br>
<br>
As for wizards not getting groups. That's easy enough. People get these dumb ideas in thier heads about wizards not bringing enough to the table. It's just wrong information. My current group always consists of pally,  chanter and my cleric, and whenever possible, we add as many wizards as we can. We know the power of a wizard, and exploit it mightily. More people ought to do the same IMHO. Last night, in PoN, we had us 3, and added 2 wizzies and another pally. I got such an insane amount of experience. The faster you kill, the more you can kill, the more you kill, the faster you ding.

<br>
&quot;If a wizard takes more damage than his rune, then he sucks&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't know where you xp, but if I get aggro where I xp, that mob is going to double or quad me for 500-800 a pop.  So with my rune being = 800 hp, then any time I get aggro, I am going to take some damage.<br>
<br>
Sometimes mobs resist concussion.  Sometimes they smack you around after one cast of Ancient Ice or Draiught of Ro.  Life is unpredictable, adn so is EQ sometimes.  A cleric who can't roll with the punches sucks as much as a wizard who runs around like a chicken with his head cut off when he gets mob aggro. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www2.clickcomworks.net/customers/102061217552438/images/soceress1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=euphrates>Euphrates</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 12:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> Insert point by point responses&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

Point 1, Thalaan<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not all wizards have concussion, are you going to discriminate against them because of it? (I lost my VS faction before i was able to quest it)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, yes.  You have to understand something here though...  I am not a level 40 cleric grouping in CoM or a level 50 cleric grouping in karnors...  I am a level 65 cleric grouping in elemental planes/tactics. (no I am not trying to brag here, so don't try and say I am, it's actually relevant)  If you are a 65 wizard and flagged for one of those zones and you never got concussion or ancient concussion, then you are lazy.  Don't try and pull bad faction out as an excuse.  My good friend Claud had the same problem and put off getting concussion until level 55 or so because he was too lazy to farm the venril sathir faction.  Not to mention you can use lull/invis while trade window open if your faction stinks.  Why would I discriminate against a wizard that either doesn't have or doesn't use concussion?  Because if you are casting concussion, you can cast more nukes while maintaining the same aggro level...  yes I know that inserting concussion uses mana and puts an interval of time between nukes as well which lowers the raw DPS of the spells you are casting, but it still will usually come out higher with concussion than without.  Higher DPS = faster kills and when each kill gives you 3.5% aaxp in a 6 person group, your kill rate can drastically affect how fast the xp comes in.  If all 6 people in the group are being inefficient, then your 1aaxp/hour becomes 1aaxp/2 hours.  Sorry, but my time is valuable and I would rather have a wizard that does more damage, and sustained high damage over time requires concussion.  It is not that unreasonable for me to ask this, since all the wizards I would group with in the first place are in raiding guilds and would have concussion for their uber boss fights... I would hope...<br>

<br>
Thanks for the vote of confidence.  As stated above, I WON'T just come out and start telling wizards (or anyone in my group other than to designate who gets what jobs in case of multiple snarers or some similar situation, if they don't work it out amogst themselves first) how to play their class as soon as they join my group.  If they miss a snare once or over aggro or something, sure, I will be a little irritated but I won't really say anything until it happens again, at which time I might say something like, hey Wizardx, can you snare these please? just in case they were afk or thought we had another snarer or something.  If it continues to be a problem I will start becoming much less friendly and reasonable about it.  Things like that get groups killed and generally waste everyone's time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What spells I cast are up to me, as long as I'm doing my job<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, yes, I agree what spells you cast are up to you...  within reason.  I mean, as a cleric, if I was, say, using supernal light repeatedly to heal the tank (S-Light is a fast casting very large heal, ~1/2 a complete heal, that costs about 1.5 times the mana of complete heal) and getting aggro repeatedly because of it, as well as draining my mana twice as fast and then moaning to the group about how I was OOM, wouldn't you be a little upset with me?  It is the same situation here...  If you are casting your biggest nuke because it makes nice crits and that makes you feel warm and fuzzy, and you aren't concussioning at all, you keep getting summoned after these big nukes and I keep having to heal you because of it, or you snare too soon and get aggro on inc (there is NO REASON WHATSOEVER TO SNARE ON INCOMING) or have to back off and stop nuking because you keep overaggroing and refuse to use concussion, then I would say you are not doing your job effectively and if you refuse to listen to reasonable suggestions because YOU'RE THE WIZARD OMG AND YOU KNOW BEST, then have fun soloing or exercising your l33+ tactics in another group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for concussion. If your looking at what spells are cast and counting them, I sure wouldn't want to be in your group..

<br>
I don't count spells and in fact I don't have time to read every single spell cast message etc that floats down my chat screen.  However, you have be blind to miss the occasional concussion in the spam of casting...  &quot;Target suffers from a blow to the head&quot; or whatever the message is is pretty distinctive and I can pick it out of text in my peripheral vision just by the length of the chat line and it's color...  Plus I won't even care until I start seeing the wizard have aggro problems, and it becomes obvious very shortly afterwards if you pay attention at all whether or not concussion is even being used.<br>

Point 3, Nadiar<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Strike of Solusek is one of our most efficient spells. In fact, its more efficient than draughts and rains. Euphrates, you have no idea how to play a wizard, and from what you say, you have no idea how to play a cleric either.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
SoS may be efficient or it may not, I have not bothered to look into this because I don't really care.  However, it IS your largest nuke (well, consistently) and therefore carries with it more aggro than others.  I am not saying that a wizard that uses SoS is a bad wizard...  but a wizard that can't control his aggro but still uses SoS is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have played high end clerics, enchanters, paladins, wizards, and druids. I think I might know how to play my wizard better than you do. If I pull aggro, its because the tank isn't keeping up. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you pull aggro, it is most likely because of one of the following two reasons:<br>
<br>
1) As you state, the tank isn't keeping up/doing their job.  They're too busy jerking off with white rain to hit taunt and since you are used to them taunting you nuke accordingly and find yourself overaggroing.  In which case I heal you up and we all yell at the tank to taunt more.<br>
<br>
2) We yell at the tank to taunt more, and he says WTF, I have been taunting, disarming, begging on mezzed mobs, sitting when aggro goes to someone else, and I have my hate proc weapons equipped.  At this point (and only in this case) we have established that the tank is ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB, and it is you who is the fucktard overaggroing.  Yeah, so maybe this tank doesn't generate as much aggro as the one in your group yesterday.  If it is a problem, find a new tank, or a new group.  If you refuse to do either of those options, then it is your job to adjust your damage output and concussion ratio such that you don't overaggro anymore.<br>
<br>
You're such a good wizard and a smart person that you realized that though, and you were just testing me right?  I mean you wouldn't make blanket statements like 'If I pull aggro, its because the tank isn't keeping up' and actually mean it right, since obviously such a statement is situational?<br>
<br>
Point 4, Erumaron<br>
<br>
Thanks for the vote of confidence Erumaron.  I would like to point all you other wizards here reading this thread to erumaron's post.  He states that he tests his damage and adjusts according to the tank's ability to taunt etc.  This is a good way of doing things.  I have seen you wizards post on and on about how the best wizards ride the aggro line as tightly as they possibly can, maxing damage but managing aggro in such a way that if they get summoned they either don't get hit or they concussion once and the mob turns back to tank.  This is the type of wizard I expect in my group.<br>
<br>
<br>
Point 5, Kaisann<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you think SoS is an eye candy nuke perhaps you should step back and re-evaluate your knowledge of the class. Also, I really don't understand how you can have mana problems as a 65 cleric with even moderate gear. I happen to play one in xp groups all the time and I don't think I've ever gone below 80m with a slower + CC, 50m without one or the other. If you're in a group without both and the wizard pulls agro, feel free to let him die; I have no idea what your problem is otherwise. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sorry if my characterization of SoS as an eye candy nuke offends you.  It IS an eye candy nuke.  It is your biggest nuke... nuff said.  Note that just because it is *EYE CANDY* doesn't mean it is necessarily inefficient.  However, it would be narrow minded to ignore the fact that there are wizard who will use this nuke not for it's efficiency but because they get *BIG CRITS*.  Wizards tell me they are doing this sometimes, and I will humor them to some extent since it is a game.  The problem is that there are wizards who will just get excited by their crits and keep nuking, with little or no regard to aggro.<br>
<br>
As for my mana pool, yeah I have tons of mana regen but there are an insane number of mitigating factors here...  let me see...  PULL RATE would be a major factor, since mobs typically enter camp unslowed they deal a ton more damage than a slowed mob would, thus I have to heal more.  So if we are killing things quickly, more mobs come into camp in the same amount of elapsed time, meaning more unslowed damage to the tank in the same amount of time, meaning more mana expenditure, but more xp for the group...<br>
I may or may not have kei...  perhaps we are deep in plane of earth xping and it wears off.  I have the mana regen to continue to group, but I have to be more efficient about it.  Sometimes it isn't viable to gate out and refresh kei due to having to fight back to a spot that is now broken etc.  I try and maintain a mana reserve for adds, especially when we don't have a mezzer, if you are sucking up fast heals due to overaggro you are forcing me to dip into my reserves.  Also, if you are sucking up fast heals that means I am suddenly building way more aggro than I should have so now I may end up tanking an add or a mez break or even the single mob in camp.  Heal aggro sux, and clerics don't get the option of not casting the heal like wizards have the option of not casting the nuke.  Not to mention that if you are sucking up fast heals enough for it to be a problem, then it is likely that at some point no matter how hard I try, you will fuck up and die.  If you die I lose more mana rebuffing and healing you up, we lose damage while you med, and we lose xp while we recover.  So if you can just be a good wizard and manage your aggro, you will not set off a chain reaction of inefficiency.  Oh, I forgot probably the most important point: my fast heals are INEFFICIENT.  Supernal remedy costs EXACTLY THE SAME MANA AS COMPLETE HEAL.  So if you are forcing me to fast heal you when you have the ability to control it, you are forcing me to be inefficient.  This rather grates against my sensibilities, understandably so I think.<br>

This post is so far from the truth it makes me laugh.  Did you see the part about how there are extenuating circumstances, like adds etc?  Did you see how I said I won't say anything until the wizard screws up first?  Your position sounds like you think that it is so rude to tell someone how to play their class that you would rather have them continue to fuck up rather than hurt their precious feelings.  That's fine.  When you've CR'd for the 6th time because some moron in your group won't snare or some stupid tank won't taunt before mez break or whatever, don't come running to me.  Sure a wizard might take a ton of damage trying to root park a mob while I am mid heal, but I will just heal them and not say anything, because I understand that the wizard is performing a valuable role doing that.  I don't tell everyone how to play.  I just tell morons that cause me headaches how to play.  Anyone who knows me at all knows that I am very flexible grouping...  hell, I actually LIKE having wizards in my group, I don't follow the grouping formulas, I do groups without slowers, groups without CC, groups w/3 shms 2 clr and 1 enchanter, groups with necros as mana regen/CC, groups with no tank...  and you know what?  I adapt to the situation at hand and make it work, and get good xp doing so.  And no, I don't say shit about what character I played when or where.  Sure i've played some characters of other classes up to high levels, but suggestions I make are based on common sense, experience working with the class for YEARS, and reading class boards like THIS ONE.  Sorry but if for some reason you think that a wizard player is more capable of reading and understanding the information at this site than a non-wizard player, you are completely wrong.<br>

Rather than rehash my argument for concussion usage from above, I will simply refer you to it and to re-iterate the statement that you can push your damage higher with concussion, thus making us get xp faster.  Nuff said.<br>

You just wrote an entire post about how you don't want people to just jump on you and tell you how to play your class when you join.  I said nothing of the kind.  I said, if you fuck up, I say something.  For you to fuck up, we have to have started already, which means that I waited to see your skill before I said anything at all.  Also, I elaborated above on my reactions to various things I consider 'fuckups'.  I don't really consider someone as 'fucking up' until they consistently demonstrate to me that they are not snaring, or snaring to soon, etc.  I didn't really want to write a novel the first time; perhaps I should have.<br>

Contrary to the impression you all have, I don't have a procedure or formula for what a wizard is *SUPPOSED* to do.  Well.  I expect damage to be dealt.  With some efficiency.  Maybe snare.  Maybe some root parking.  Maybe evac if necessary.  Beyond that, it's up to you.  I *DO* have a list of things you *AREN'T* supposed to do though.  Big difference.  It's not like I parse wizard damage and say, &quot;Oh, JoeWizard, you're only doing 400DPS, that's just not enough, you should chain tears of A and garrisons instead.&quot;  And yeah, I am not a twit that thinks I am god, if a person makes a suggestion I will listen to it and won't immediately dismiss it just because they play a wizard and I play a cleric.  I may come back with a reason for what I was doing, just as you may come back with &quot;Oh sorry I am just trying to stun on inc so the shaman and tank don't get owned and you don't have to heal much before aggro is established, but I got too much aggro that time.&quot;  At which point I know you're not a fuckwit and that you actually think about what you are doing.  This buys you plenty of leeway.  If you consistently get aggro on incoming and fast healing you is worse than healing the tank, then I might eventually say something like 'Hey JoeWizard, I know you are trying to help by stunning but it doesn't seem to be saving me any mana, in fact my mana is dropping faster now than before.' At which point you either stop doing it or you try tweaking it to improve the situation.<br>

<br>
Sure concussion gets resisted a lot but having read your forums tons, I have seen many threads on this topic and I believe the conclusion was that even when resisted, concussion still provides an aggro reduction.  Although there are people on both sides of this fence, the evidence presented seems to favor that it really does de-aggro even on resists.  You're a wizard though so I am wrong and you are right though, neh?  (note that's not an attack against YOU, it's just a general point...  STFU about me being a cleric, obviously I know as much as many of the wizards on this board.  It's the same as saying someone is wrong and you are right because you have a higher post count.)<br>

I stole aggro off the tank all the time when we grouped and he always healed me.<br>

A much better statement of your position (and a position that I think everyone here would agree with):<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The problem is that there are wizards who will just get excited by their crits and keep nuking, with little or no regard to aggro.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>SoS may be efficient or it may not, I have not bothered to look into this because I don't really care.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It is.  It doesn't matter if you look into it or not - it's more efficient than the alternatives you mentioned (are you trying to imply that we're making stuff up here?  Just go look it up - it'll take you 30 seconds). Besides that, any wizard that has it should know how to manage aggro with SoS vs. with Draughts.  If, by your own admission, you don't have the specific knowledge necessary to make a judgement on what spells the wizard should be using, then keep your specific opinions to yourself.  If the wizard is over-aggroing consistently, then tell him to watch his aggro, of course.  But spell selection is up to him.<br>
<br>
And just FYI, if you're in a pickup group, and the wizard hasn't grouped with the tank before, expect him to over-aggro reasonably often for the first few pulls.  That's him figuring out where the aggro line is for that tank, and that means he's doing his job correctly.  If the wizard is still pulling <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>hard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> aggro <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>consistently</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> after 5 or 6 pulls, then he's doing something wrong, and you can (and should) call him on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and just a tip - if a group member is causing a problem (over-aggro, snare issues, breaking mezzes), mention it to them, but I'd suggest using general terms (eg. &quot;watch your aggro please&quot;, &quot;careful with the AEs&quot;, etc.).  Once you start telling them which specific spells to use, you're basically saying that you know their class better than they do.  If you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>want</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to piss people off, that's a great way to do it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=euphrates>Euphrates</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 2:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> Zarbonius:<br>

That is one of things I said that upset people yes, but I don't think that was the *ONLY* thing...  =)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I was being very general with my first post in order to get my opinion across and I didn't really clarify what EXACTLY I meant until my next post...  at which point it seems that we agree.  My statement that I didn't care if SoS was mana efficient or not wasn't an attempt to discredit anyone saying that SoS was mana efficient, it was me trying to make clear that once the aggro management is under control, I don't really care what spells you actually use to do damage as long as you deal damage (and aren't using some level 24 nuke that nets you 30DPS or something similarly gimp, but that is extreme and I don't go checking which nukes the wiz uses).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Besides that, any wizard that has it should know how to manage aggro with SoS vs. with Draughts<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would agree with you here on principal, but sadly, this isn't true.  I actually have grouped with a wizard with SoS that would chain cast it 'because he is a sucker for the big crits' he said to me, and I would have to heal him perhaps every other nuke, sometimes more, sometimes less.  Another wizard with SoS was using it in my group and drawing aggro quite often, so much so that he volunteered the comment 'Wow, SoS is too big for me, I can't manage aggro with it yet I better go back to using draughts etc.'.  Wizard A really pissed me off and I got rather irate with him.  Wizard B got brownie points with me for being rational and putting group efficiency before his happy crits.  The main point of these two examples however is that you simply can't assume that just because someone is 65 and has a hard to acquire spell that they have the experience and self control to use it effectively.<br>
<br>
Beyond those two little tidbits, I agree COMPLETELY with you Zarbonius...  a wizard should be feeling out aggro at the start, and considering that even if you group with the same tank, whether or not you have a chanter or a shm will affect the aggro level of the tank, among other things, so I expect this period of the group learning how to mesh together even for groups that group together regularly.<br>
<br>
As for the tip of using tact, I agree again.  I have tried to illustrate some of the more tactful ways I may approach differing situations, but then again the level of tact decreases as the number of fuckups increases...  up to the point where I either leave the group if it is not mine or I kick em out or something.<br>

PULL RATE would be a major factor, since mobs typically enter camp unslowed they deal a ton more damage than a slowed mob would, thus I have to heal more. So if we are killing things quickly, more mobs come into camp in the same amount of elapsed time, meaning more unslowed damage to the tank in the same amount of time, meaning more mana expenditure, but more xp for the group...<br>
I may or may not have kei... perhaps we are deep in plane of earth xping and it wears off. I have the mana regen to continue to group, but I have to be more efficient about it. Sometimes it isn't viable to gate out and refresh kei due to having to fight back to a spot that is now broken etc. I try and maintain a mana reserve for adds, especially when we don't have a mezzer, if you are sucking up fast heals due to overaggro you are forcing me to dip into my reserves. Also, if you are sucking up fast heals that means I am suddenly building way more aggro than I should have so now I may end up tanking an add or a mez break or even the single mob in camp. Heal aggro sux, and clerics don't get the option of not casting the heal like wizards have the option of not casting the nuke. Not to mention that if you are sucking up fast heals enough for it to be a problem, then it is likely that at some point no matter how hard I try, you will fuck up and die. If you die I lose more mana rebuffing and healing you up, we lose damage while you med, and we lose xp while we recover. So if you can just be a good wizard and manage your aggro, you will not set off a chain reaction of inefficiency. Oh, I forgot probably the most important point: my fast heals are INEFFICIENT. Supernal remedy costs EXACTLY THE SAME MANA AS COMPLETE HEAL. So if you are forcing me to fast heal you when you have the ability to control it, you are forcing me to be inefficient. This rather grates against my sensibilities, understandably so I think.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Since you decided to disregard everything I said, perhaps I just need to establish my credentials.  I already stated that I play a 65 cleric all the time (read: daily for a few months) in XP groups.  I know the mana cost of your spells as well as you do.  I've grouped with wizards who pull agro with snare, shammies who ALWAYS slow on pull without debuffing, bards (enough said there!), stupid chanters, suicidal mages, shitty warriors, and monks who insist on pulling and I've never had anyone in my group die with the exception of two complete wipeouts thanks to massive overpulls.  I also have NEVER had to cast supernal remedy.  Never.  Not once.  In fact, I don't even keep it memmed, chosing instead to have celestial elixir up as a patch heal.  I've grouped without mana regen beyond BAotR and with Wind of Marr + VoQ, with and without CC/slow.<br>
<br>
Okay, enough of that.  I understand and sympathize with your concern over SR, but as I already said I can't understand why you'd worry about spending mana unless you were in a group without a slower AND CC.  In that case, I would definitely say something to an int caster drawing agro consistently.  Otherwise....only an incompetent shaman could possibly provoke a comment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yandidari>yandidari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/12/03 8:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why wizards can't get groups...</span><hr size=1> Euphrates, wow you have flags to elementals and tactics, im like soooooo impressed. tactics flag means shit now, everyone 63 and over and get in, and just because you have elemental flags doesnt meant you're not an idiot. your guild got you the flag, you are still a moron and an ass. <br>
