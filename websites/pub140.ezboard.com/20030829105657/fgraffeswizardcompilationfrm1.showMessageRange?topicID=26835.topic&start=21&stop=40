This change was good for the game in general, not just druids.  Being able to pick up that lfg druid instead of waiting another 30 minutes for a cleric to show up is a very good thing indeed.<br>

<br>
 In a raid situation Druids can fit well in CH chain, patch heals for casters, in the meantime nuking and doting the mobs as well as providing some nice buffs, Protection of Nine and Cabbage is very nice and that is just a start on a Druids ability.<br>
<br>
 In a group they can do the same thing, they gave up being able to blast big in exchange for being able to heal and vice versa. I havent looked through the database for all the spells so I may be mistaken but show me another class that has a good nuke, heal, dot and buffs, that is how the Druid fits into things, he brings all of those skills to a group. Combine all of those and while a Druid maybe outdone by other specialist classes, that class can not do some of the other things, ie Wizards outnuke you but we have no heals. I believe this is the way it was intended to be.<br>
<br>
 This goes for all classes except a select few but in groups there is certain roles to fill, if you need a pure healer you would not get a wizard and if you are wanting a dps machine you would not pick up another cleric. <br>
<br>
Druids have their niche in groups and a well played Druid is always welcomed in my group but most the time if a Druid is unable to find a group, it is not because of his class but his unsocial behavior. Not to be mean but most the time it is the reputation some of the Druids have built for themselves. Why do you think so many bash Druids, it is not because they are great company.<br>
<br>
 I think most of the changes in the thread are insane and over the top. If you feel some minor tweaks need to be made say that, but adding insane requests in the same thread in my mind discounts most the others. About 4 posts in is when I had enough when the Druid was upset over the mage outnuking him. Well Mages are supposed to, because they have been neglected and overlooked for a little time does not mean they are out on line now.<br>
<br>
 Druids are far from hurting and they are very useful in groups, raids and still solo about as well as they always have. Before the Mini-Ch went in, I can see they needed an upgrade in heals but right now I think Druids are far from hurting that should require some of the drastic changes that were mentioned in the post and thread. This is my opinion, maybe I am around Super-Druids that are the best Druids in EQ but I would think there is quite a few others around who use every ability a Druid has and is very happy with their class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heofmanyfals>HeOfManyFals</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 7:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thats exactly the problem</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess that is were my opinion for a role of a Druid and yours differ, Druids were never meant to be a specialist they sacrificed that in exchange for being the generalist and being able to do almost everything.<br>

Improve the Attack debuffs so that debuffing attack actually creates a noticable reduction in dps. (Considering the hate these debuffs cause..)<br>

Animal-only slow (Iffy.  I don't see the big problem with it, but I don't think it fits in the RP stance of druids.

Might want to check over that list again, we got some minor things during balance.  We didn't get a lot because we didn't need a lot... regardless of what the naysayers will say, we are a good and well balanced class.  Our problem lies in perception.  Perception, perception, perception.  People see Wizard and think &quot;Oh, lame DPS.&quot;  Even a poorly equipped Wizard can contribute a lot of DPS to the group (in most cases more than an equally equipped Rogue).  It's all about knowing your class and understanding your limits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 9:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Re: Yep</span><hr size=1>  While I agree Druids can fit the generalist label, the same as a bard, but I thought this was the spot they were supposed to fill. There is more than one DPS class, Healing class, Tank class, Crowd Control class etc, this way if you do not have that one certain class, you are not stuck at the zone line unable to play.<br>
<br>
 In a normal exp group I am in; we have myself, lvl 65 Wizard for DPS, lvl 65 Druid for the healing, doting, buffing, some nuking and the other things he brings, lvl 65 Paladin for MA, little healing, and rez if things go sour, lvl 65 Bard for crowd control and all the other nice things bards bring( Rizlona and chorus of Marr <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), lvl 62 Rogue for more Dps, and the last spot is filled with various others, sometimes a cleric, enchanter, or any other friends who may be on at the time. I know some will say, well you are high level, most PoP spells were upgrades from earlier version, put in game to fight and use in PoP.<br>
<br>
This group does well and while not the exact Holy Trinity the exp rate is very close to the 'Perfect Trinity Group'. Sure we may have a few deaths and some downtime here and there, but all and all it is not to bad. The main thing is that it works, and works pretty well, add to the fact we all are friends and we have a good time is the main thing. <br>
<br>
I think some need to get out of the thinking of having the perfect setup and have fun. Every class has their weakness, Druids can fill quite a few roles depending on the situation. <br>
<br>
 2 classes right now, Enchanter and Cleric, are usually considered a must have, in some cases they are but because you are not considered the must have, does not mean you are broken by any means. If you like the idea of being the best at a skill, play the specialist class instead of trying to turn the Druid class into something that it was not intended to be. Just my impression on how Verant/SOE wants the Druid to fit in.<br>
<br>
 Please do not get me mistaken in far from EQ Fanboi but for the list of needs for the game, a druid being upgraded is close to the bottom. Some things I wish they would spend the time to work on before Druids is upgrading Warriors Taunt Ability, Slight Upgrade on a Rogues Damage Output, Adjusting some of the PoP loot tables. EQ is far from perfect and can be so much more but wasting time giving a class something they really do not need at this time, takes away from things they should be doing. Guess that last sentence sums up the SOE way though and Druids will get the upgrades before the other stuff gets looked at :/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gemlin>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 486<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/03 9:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druids are insane</span><hr size=1> Druids List Wants : <br>

AA skill which allows specialization in a secondary skill<br>

Random %chance of converting melee dmg received into healing at a fixed rate, say a 50% return (ie say 10% chance, it will be streaky but overall would act as a dmg output reduction of 10% on mobs with say 5% becoming healing - a 50% return rate)<br>
<br>
Random %chance of converting spell/spell-like (ie breath) effects into healing, say at a 50% return (as above perhaps 10% chance, so 1x out of 10 that 1000hp aoe might be a 500hp heal).<br>
<br>
Random %chance of converting melee dmg received into MANA at a fixed rate, say 50% return. (ie a melee hit for 300 has a 10% chance of being converted into 150 mana).<br>
<br>
Random %chance of converting spell/spell-like (ie breath) effects into healing, say at a 25% return (as above perhaps 10% chance, so 1x out of 10 that 1000hp aoe might become 250 mana. Remember this nets down to 25% of 10%, so 2.5% mana return on spell dmg over time. Shouldn't be too nutty).<br>
<br>
Buffs to increase Damage Mitigation and Damage Avoidance would be nice. Maybe this would mean just adding an AC component to a spell like Nature's Recovery, but possibly a new line of defense ability increasing buffs along the lines of Combat Stability and Combat Agility.<br>
<br>
Re-evaluate the effectiveness of Enhanced/Viscid roots. Making them more reliable could give druids a useful role in groups. <br>

A few of the changes were good,  most of them were not.  I'm still a strong believer that EQ would of been a better game with the druid class deleted.  Too late to ever do something like that though.  Give them those minor tweeks and leave it at that. The druid class doesn't need a damn thing more. <p><br><center><b>Sage <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21704">Legolos</a> Spellbynder |  <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21727">Uggliey</a> Bugger<br>LvL 65 Arcanist | LvL 56 Revenant<br>

<br>
If you look at class definations at the moment, they are still fairly blury.  Druids and Bards I have always considered jack of all trades, masters of none, but some stuff on that list does make me want to smack some fanatics around.  I don't think adding a few abilities here, a spell or two there, and number tweaking is really going to solve class defination.<br>
<br>
There was a paladin in the guild I belonged to that could heal just as well as any cleric of the same level, and I'm not talking helmet heal either (Yeah, okay, I'm exaggerating.  The point is the paladin healed good enough to keep the group in top shape).  We've had shamans and druids keeping the main tank alive just find before the mini-CH was introduced.<br>
<br>
VI/SOE needs to start taking some steps back before moving forward in my opinion.  They need to go back to the drawing board, decide on a specific defination for a class and stick with it.  Number tweaking, in my mind, is just blurring the lines.  Now granted, they have made some remarkable progress with class defination, but it still seems at times as if classX is just classY, only with weaker/more powerful spells/abilities.<br>
