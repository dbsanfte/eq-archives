A stray breeze had found its way through the full oaken branches with just enough strength left to momentarily part the heavy Faydark mists. Everything within the glade was warmed by the touch of the lazy rays of golden sunlight, and the darkened glade was no longer so. <br>
<br>
Tiny Fey creatures once hidden within the mists stopped to take notice of the moment as the warm light caressed tiny cheeks and stroked delicate wings. Even the morning dew retreated down slender blades of green grass to the cool earth below under the heated spotlight of the sun. As the brief play of air and light drew to an end and the curtain of mist began to intrude, one of the Sylvan oaks seemed to arch its branches a bit further than the rest as if trying to catch the last hints of light. The Fey drakelings and pixies in their small grove became mere shadow against shadow under the veil of fog, hidden to all but the most trained of eyes.<br>
<br>
Day passed to twilight, twilight passed to night, and night brought forth the unclean creatures that had made the Faydark forest their home…<br>

Wyture Winterwind<br>
Maiden of Journeys, Elven Elite<br>

She quickly and silently finished her meditations to her goddess, and reached outward with her mind rather than her eyes. She first felt the cool mists of the Faydark swirling and encircling her enticingly, then next the chill, moist earth beneath her. She imagined sinking her fingers into the ground and stretching, reaching outward with an expansive network of roots. Her consciousness crawled through the forest floor about her in an invisible wave of energy that radiated outward.<br>
<br>
Her mind first encountered simple worms and insects as they burrowed or crawled in the night in search of food. She continued pushing outward and felt the tread of a black wolf slinking through the night. As Wyture reached further, heavy vibrations rolled though the ground and over her attuned senses - she felt pain. A sylvan oak near her sung out in agony that was more felt than heard. She sharpened her senses, searching, honing in on the oak as another wave of pain crested her thoughts like a powerful ocean surging forward. She almost gasped aloud and doubled over, but all she could do was sway and move with the hurt as it rode through the soil and passed her. <br>
<br>
The vibrations were suddenly moving around Wyture as the squad of Crushbone Orcs continued their journey towards Kelethin. She sneered inwardly as the simple-minded orcs passed her by, unable to detect her for what she truly was. Quickly observing the situation and realizing the orcs were about her yet still marching, she gripped the land with a strong hand of thought and magic. <br>
<br>
Wyture heaved and rolled the ground with enchantments, forcing it upward and outward with her as the epicenter. The ground responded to her call, seeming to know its enemies as it selectively peaked and cracked throughout the grove. The result was immediate and devastating - armor and steel were crushed and rent asunder as easily as flesh and bone. The orcs expired with hardly a voiced sound of protestation as the ground continued to buckle and swallow the twisted corpses. When the magic settled, the spell complete, the land had returned to its natural state - nearby vegetation and foliage were untouched, trees were upright and the ground was again, unbroken.<br>
<br>
Along the perimeter of the grove, Wyture noticed the movement of a solitary orc that had been outside the radius of her earthen magic. As the stunned orc regained his senses and turned to flee, Wyture called out in ancient Elven to the nearby flora. Offended roots and vines violently snaked upward from the ground, impaling and mangling the orc’s legs and feet, ensnaring and rooting him to the spot. <br>
<br>
As the bleeding orc struggled in vain, a grand Sylvan oak began to shimmer and shrink. Rough patches of bark gave way to soft, smooth, honey-colored flesh. Roots slowly transformed to toes as they pulled from the ground and shook themselves free of dirt. Branches transformed to slender arms and leaves to delicate hands with graceful fingers. <br>
<br>
As the change continued, Wyture gently touched a nearby tree to reassure the oak that this night was hers. She stretched her limbs and released a heavy breath through parted lips that warmed of chill night air about her as she stood nude in the glade. With the shedding of the last remnants of her oaken skin, Wyture smiled widely and seemed pleased. She silently mouthed another prayer to her goddess and then began her slow saunter towards the struggling orc, her bare feet never touching the ground.<br>

Vile curses escaped his rage-twisted mouth as he watched the hauntingly nude elven female slowly glide towards him on feet of air. <br>
<br>
He had watched his friends succumb to the dark magics of the elf and stood there unable to react. Next, he had cut fervently at the roots and vines that immobilized him, but in vain, for every root cut two more took its place. He would not fail his people a third time. Gruthok gripped his oversized, weighted axe and paused long enough for the elven witch to drift closer.<br>
<br>
As the elf glided within striking distance, Gruthok reared back and swung with all the strength in his powerfully corded arms and shoulders. To his chagrin, the axe caught a thick vine during its descent and the timing of the strike was thrown off. Not only did the blow fall short, the axe slid from his blood-slicked hands and skittered across the solid forest floor with a dull thud. Rage exploded between his curled lips in an agonizing scream of failure and displeasure. A red haze descended over him as he frenzied and lost him mind. <br>
<br>
When Gruthok recovered and his fury lessened, he found that his situation had not changed one bit. The flesh of his legs and feet were bound to the ground, his squad defeated, his weapon out of reach on the ground before him and an elven whore staring rather amusedly into his face. He frenzied again. <br>
<br>
When Gruthok’s senses returned, he found himself screaming for a very different reason - Pain. Thousands of insects were crawling over his flesh and feasting. Gruthok opened his mouth wide with screams. The swarming locusts seized the opportunity to crawl in, forcing their way past his gnarled teeth and down his throat to eat from the warm meats inside. He choked, vomiting forth bile and bug. Salty tears ran from his lidless eyes and stung his half eaten nose and cheeks. He felt the insects creeping through his armor, finding the sweet, soft folds of flesh around his midsection and his loins. Again he screamed with a panicked edge to his voice and struggled against his bonds to reach the elf.<br>
<br>
Gruthok glared at the elf, determined to meet her gaze as the insects continued to raid under his protective layers of skin. He choked back another scream and wildly shook his braided hair, freeing his head and face from locusts. He returned his gaze to the naked elf while gathering what spit and bile remained in his mouth, then launched it at her defiantly.<br>
<br>
Gruthok grinned evilly as the spittle arced and landed on her smooth stomach in a glistening viscous mound. The glob slowly made its way past her thigh leaving behind a smooth trail of slime. The elf curiously arched a brow and spoke in a language that flowed like the tinkering of bells against an afternoon wind. Not understanding, Gruthok laughed maniacally and bellowed a challenge with a mouth that no longer had lips. He crunched a mouthful of invading bugs and hacked profusely, again spraying the ground before him.<br>
<br>
The elf spoke lightly and the invading plague of locusts suddenly pulled away from his skin taking flight in the night air. Gruthok fell to his knees as more insects burst from his swollen stomach bringing forth a flood of dark blood and entrails. He gasped for air, finding it difficult to draw breath with the damage done to his internal organs and lungs. His vision swam and the ground before him grew unfocused. Gruthok fell forward and caught himself with his hands, wincing as blades of grass speared the opened wounds of his palms. This new pain brought him a brief respite and a moment of clarity.<br>
<br>
As the elf spoke again, he lifted his head and peered through his matted braids. A piece of loose scalp fell to the ground unnoticed at his side. Gruthok caught her eyes again, putting all the hate of lifetime into that one venomous gaze. As their eyes locked, the elf suddenly stopped chanting. The moment seemed to freeze, lasting an eternity. The silence was deafening as the two stared at one another.<br>
<br>
A drop of blood fell from Gruthok’s forehead into his left eye, distorting the vision within. Time picked up pace and the moment ended, sound rushing back with an audible popping noise. With his unclouded right eye, Gruthok watched the elf open her mouth impossibly wide. An orange-like glow filtered from that hole a second before volcanic heat and flames poured forth, melting his flesh, burning his bone.<br>
<br>
Gruthok screamed.<br>
