<br>
Was the class balanced before level 60?  Are there NO monsters who have that hit point level who aren't giants nor dragons?  Does this 2k damage per blast really allow your contribution in damage to be even noteworthy? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uraelface7th.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raelface7th</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/01 1:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: death of the wizard class.</span><hr size=1> this is in reply to the comment about KSing groups.<br>
<br>
I was the seventh in a shroom King group, and was regularly KSing the other group.  (downtime was a factor of course) I was taking probably one in 5 kills.  The other group was a 57 war, 56 epic monk, 57 shammy, 56 cleric, 57 SK, 56 bard.<br>
<br>
Having the epic made a HUGE difference, because I didn't have to wait for the tanks to aggro the mob, I ended up tanking most of the mobs (reavers, adepts, priests, warriors) and generally speaking, they would be dead before my skin broke.  The cleric didn't mind, she never healed me (or buffed me, for that matter =\ )  the small amounts of damage I took, I healed up during medtime. <br>
<br>
The first kill I took, the rest of the group was pretty damn surprised (especially the epic monk)  I think they were just kinda PO'd when I kept doing it consistantly.<br>
<br>
Also, I was in a chardok raid, doing a break in.  Once again, flying solo (13 players in the zone...hmmm) And I was the xp group.<br>

For a lot of us groups are a problem cause we has no spells that will buff or help the group I mean even our vision spells are self only. The thought is to have some type of spell to enchant or raise the damage so to speak on a melee classes weapon. Like add fire cold or magic based damge for when it hits. Far fetched idea but it is 1 where i think suits us as a buff. Lets face it ppl groupies want buffs and we have none. Also maybe a specialization skill in meditate to raise our mana regen would be nice. I asked GZ about it at the st louis gathering awhile ago and the no I got was so I quick I got caught in mid sentence. I still think its a good idea though.<br>
<br>
I like my wizzie and the good thinkg for me is the im the only active wizzie in my guild so groups tend to come more frequently. I think the game changed for me when I got concussion ppl seem to like the chain nuking with non aggro.

Uhm no, you're not entirely right.<br>
<br>
I grab these figures from other thread:<br>
<br>
37mana/tick ~ 6 mana/second   - innate+C2<br>
<br>
Sunstrike is 450 mana<br>
<br>
450 / 6 ~ 75 seconds to recover from Sunstrike<br>
<br>
1615dmg / 75 seconds ~ 21dmg/second<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are going to have a serious discussion of dmg per second you have to account for regenning mana. And with SS you miss the med tick while casting.<br>

I have to admit, I play Fasty a lot more because I am the only one or one of a couple. I still think wizzys have fun in very particular circumstances. <br>
<br>
That being said, the reality is we are less useful in Velious than kunark. So are all other casters. It is tough for wizzys to get groups, but it is tough for anyone that is not a warrior, cleric, chanter, or rogue/monk. The funny part is that the main reason I ever get in a non-guild group is for snare......Nobody evacs after 55 unless evaccing to zone in. You lose the camp and the tanks have to walk.<br>
<br>
I am sure Verant, even though I give them a hard time, understand the issues with wizards, but I don't think they know how to fix them. Truth be told I don't think we know how to do it in a way that is not unbalancing. (I still vote for wizzys toget a cannibalize type spell)<br>
<br>
I think they are currently realizing that there are 3 main classes required and two others desired so that leaves 7 classes that have trouble finding groups. This is a fundamental balance problem that I assume they want to try to find a single thing that can help all the 7. Until they try the broad strokes, don't look for any details.<br>
<br>
I have always been vocal and a tad pessimistic but in the current situation and their recent trys at fixing broad strokes (resistances in skyshrine) I think we should all have a little patience and try to have as much fun as we can with what we have. I also say expect nothing and you will not be disappointed.<br>

<br>
Scenario 1 -<br>
Two decently balanced groups, I'm the only wiz in attendance and am in Group 2.  Each group has 2 melee's of close to equal damage output and either other caster classes filling in the holes.  Taking place in Kael on arena mobs (Troopers, Lego's, Adjutants and such).  Starting when the mob is about 20% down, I'll start laying in Draught of Fire, get in maybe 6 nukes at a reasonable pace so as not to aggro the mob.  NO EXP<br>
<br>
Scenario 2 -<br>
Same situation, only this time I wait til mob is about 35% down and start laying in Tears of Solusek rain spell, 2 draught of fire, another rain, 2 draught of fire and maybe 3 or more nukes to finish it off.  Even with the occasional resist, that's an assload of damage...NO EXP<br>
<br>
Scenario 3 -<br>
Same situation, medding through because I'm OOM trying to get a damn xp kill, guess what....we get EXP.<br>
<br>
WTF is up with that??<br>
<br>
As i've said, this isn't an isolated case.  I've tested these findings in PoG, Juggas, Hate, wherever there's at least a 2 group raid going on, and the results are always the same, there is more of a chance that my group will get the EXP if I just sit on my ass and let the rogue/monk/warrior whack away and get us the xp kill.  The more I nuke, the less our chances.  I know this doesn't make sense and quite frankly it really pisses me off, but that's the way it is.<br>

<br>
The simple truth of it is this: MoBs are getting more uber, MoBs are dropping more uber items, uber items have a direct increase in how much damage a melee character will do, items that do not generate effects do *ahem* dick all for casters, we (all of us, mages necros wizards) cast for the same damage as if we were naked, at least an enchanter's charisma affects how long their charms last...<br>
<br>
Items are getting better, hence melee classes are getting better, items are getting better, our spells are not. The more expansions the greater the rift will grow until items have a direct correlation to the casting of spells (cast time, recast time, dmg, mana cost, size of area of effect, resistance, fizzling, etc)<br>
<br>
The saving grace of casters may be that they can solo, which is fine and good, until you hit the higher 50s.<br>
<br>
No one seems to have mentioned tears of druzzil, which is 1200-1800dmg for 380 mana, the chance at resistance is high, yes... but you never hit for less than 1200 when the mob is tashed (albeit it is only useful on a solo mob), odd that I didnt see anything mentioned.<br>
<br>
If the 2 new uber lures could hit any mob they'd be just barely balanced, though we'd still never compete with melee on velious mobs. Why the hell didnt Verant impliment the percentage of HPs damage spells which would have worked and been balanced?<br>
<br>
All casters have complaints, all casting based classes need something new implimented to become balance, with perhaps the exception of enchanters and clerics whom's primary purpose does not involve dealing damage. The above mentioned about equiptment is just one possible solution.<br>
<br>
The biggest question to ask, is how do we make the point to Verant in such a way that they will act?<br>

From tests i've done on wizards in exp groups i'd say the wizard is lucky to do 20% the damage of the warrior+monk combo in long term damage.<br>
<br>
On the matter of not nuking to get kills i've noticed this too. In certain group situations group has a better chance to get kill when i (60wiz) DON'T nuke. My theory is the kill is given to the group with the highest average level on the hate list. So a wizard who nukes but then falls to the end of the hate list hurts the groups average and therefore hinders group in terms of getting exp. One thing that seams to work is to throw a few draughts in at the very end so mob dies with you very high on the list therefore bringing up the group hate average and therefore giving a better chance of getting the kill.<br>
<br>
The reason wizards are so disgusted by the way things are is becaues they are so opposite of what we expected them to be. We all have pre-concieved notions of what wizards are and that isn't what verant gave us; In fact it wasn't what they advertised to us either. As a wizard i want one thing, to be a major contributor in dealing damage. <br>
<br>
Another thing is that the game has changed drastically improving classes so far past the wizard that we have been left behind. I remember back in Lguk as a 49 wizard grouped with tanks that, if they were well equiped, would duel yaks. I could burn down mobs fast on an overpull (IC is about 1/4 dars hps) and my long term damage wasn't too far behind what the tank's was. In seb at lvl 59 a wizard can barely burn down one of the easiest of mobs if you can call it a burn. Wizard would probably be using draught of ice (731 damage) so it would take quite a while assuming the wizard didn't get pasted.<br>
<br>
Why should warriors be so good at taking damage (something wizards can't do at all) and still do more then two times the damage of a wizard? Don't tell me its utility a warrior through procs and unlimited effects can: levitate, invis, see invis, eb, summon bandages, heal, regen, str buff, ac buff, haste buff, atk buff, hp buff, damage shield, tash, snare, slow. Thats a heck of alot of utility for a non casting pure mele class. <br>
<br>
One last thing before i wrap up. Tanks can be drastically increased with equipmen. A tanks damage output can be more then trippled by aquiring good weapons and haste items. Seeing as these items are always increasing warriors (and all tanks) will always be increasing their damage and ac. Casters can't increase their damage output by equipment (we've seen no increase in caster damage since release) so its inevitable that tanks will far outdamage casters (situation we are in today). <br>
<br>
Well thats enough rambling for me.<br>

<br>
That about sums up the problem with wizards. The truly blind believe fast dmg is sufficient and all wizards should be good for.<br>

<br>
You are so full of sh*t your robe is turning brown. As in another post I saw here, we did Kael the other night. One group was all melee and a cleric (60 rogue, 54 warrior, 52 monk, and 2 others i think a bard and another warrior.) My group was me 55 wizard, a 53 wizard, druid, cleric, 54 mage, 54 monk. Both me and the other wizard were casting successful rain spells back to back testing our theory. We were intentionally trying to see if we could agro the mob and while the rain was hitting we would nuke. It never even paid attention to us or the druid in our group.(once in a while it would). Why? The mob had WAY too many hit points to even care and the melee classes were dealing damage much faster. You say at lvl 60 we deal good damage and are balanced? You call sunstrike a good spell with that long of a cast? You call bane spells, which you will use once a month at best and spend 5k per trip a good solution? You would be lucky to KS one mob let alone have to &quot;hold back&quot;. Was your group fighting fire beetles or something? what you do in 7 seconds, they do easily. Not to mention you must be an agroless wizard???? Must be that robe that makes you &quot;uber&quot;.  This class is broken and its a$$holes like you who make every other wizard trying to get something accomplished, pissed  off. Dont come on here and flaunt how good you think you are, come on here and tell us how you can get better to acutally HELP a group and the wizard community. Nuff said.....<br>

I bet you can't KS a group at level 55 but at Level 60 I can.  My spells do double the damage your spells do.  If I told you I camp juggs with a group of 6 you would probally call me a liar there too, but I do it most nights of the week helping to get some spells for my guildmates.  I'm telling you if any wizard goes in Karnors and casts 2 sunstrikes on any skeliten, the solo wizard will get the kill because 3230 damage on those mobs destroys them faster then any melee can build up significant hate.  Try it for yourselves instead of talking about things you are ignorant of. Heck, try it with 2 Ice Comets, it might work, but I have not tested it to know for certain. <br>
