They can create entire expansions for melees (kunark/velious), they can out-right buff melees (recent patch buffing all melees, coinciding with the release of DAOC). They can put more and more awesome melee loot in the game, increasing the power of the class exponentially.<br>
<br>
But for wizards, there always seems to be a hidden cost.<br>
<br>
Let's give them Harvest, but make it stun then for a long period of time, and make sure to implement it with a statement by Abashi that &quot;Wizards will be receiving some changes soon, but not because of any perceived lack in the class design.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's give them anti-gate (translocational suppression) spells, but it will silence them for 30seconds after casting.<br>
<br>
Let's give them a familiar, but make it cost them 1250hp/mana if it dies or poofs.<br>
<br>
Let's give them Rain spells, but leave the 3rd wave broken for 3 years, thus eliminating any possible mana efficiency of the spell, and therefore group attractiveness as well. While we're at it, lets make the PULL AND MEZ THE ADDS method of grouping the only viable method by adding insane MR to mobs in any zone where a wizard can really kick some ass, thereby elimitaing rains in grouping for fear of breaking the mez.<br>
<br>
Let's give them awesome AE spells that are only useful in a group because of the need for chain-stun by an enchanter. But, if they every find a good zone to use it in, lets eliminate its use by totally destroying that zone.<br>
<br>
Let's give them a massive nuke series called BANE, but make it useful against only a handful of monsters in the game, difficult to get, and make it cost 20pp per cast.<br>
<br>
Let's give them increased mana regen in the form of a familiar/buff, but make it take back 1250mana later to make them pay for that increased regen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am so sick of Veran't way of dealing with the wizard class.<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, lets give them lures as a response to the horrible resist rates on their spells and the problem of their mana-dependency, then eliminate the usefulness of a lure 1 year later by dropping resistance across the board and thus increasing the usefulness of everyone elses nukes but not addressing the original mana dependency issue that started lures in the first place. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umezmoriah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mezmoriah</A> at: 12/12/01 10:03:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukrela.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krela</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/12/01 4:00 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> *hands you a tissue* <p><center><img src="http://www.unresolved.org/images/everquest/sephsig.png"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uadoryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adoryn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/12/01 4:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> /agree!<br>

<br>
You're taking things they have given / considered giving us for balancing our class and pointing out where / why they are wrong and aspects of them that could / should be changed.  It fits in with both class balance and general discussions, but would be better suited in this forum.  <br>
<br>
As to your original post.<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them Harvest, but make it stun then for a long period of time, and make<br>
&gt; sure to implement it with a statement by Abashi that &quot;Wizards will be receiving<br>
&gt; some changes soon, but not because of any perceived lack in the class design.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you use harvest?  I do.  The stun isn't very long, it feels like 5 real life seconds.  Harvest was a great addition to the class, though they could have scaled it much better for the 50-60 crowd.<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them anti-gate (translocational suppression) spells, but it will <br>
&gt; silence them for 30seconds after casting.<br>
<br>
First of all, these never made it live because of the extreamly negative feedback.  Reality was that without the 30 second silence, one Wizard could chain cast these spells and take the risk of a mob gating out of the equation totally.  What people chose to leave out was that these spells had a .5 second casting time which allowed the Wizard to cast spells up until the end where he could cast the extreamly fast gate suppression spell and prevent the mob from gating.  Once the spell was cast that Wizard could sit and med for 30 seconds, and because the spell was cast when the mob was almost dead there would have been no loss of damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them a familiar, but make it cost them 1250hp/mana if it dies or poofs.<br>
<br>
It costs you approx 800 hp if it dies and that &quot;death&quot; will eat through your runes or epic shield.  The mana number works differently and I have a feeling it's a percentage of your current total mana.  You have also left out that we have the ability at 59 to turn these familiars invulnerable (even though I personally think they should be all together).  They are a situational spell, you must keep that in mind (like the Cleric self armor and the Mage self armor).<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them Rain spells, but leave the 3rd wave broken for 3 years, thus<br>
&gt; eliminating any possible mana efficiency of the spell, and therefore group<br>
&gt; attractiveness as well. <br>
<br>
Please get your facts straight.  The third wave couldn't get kill shots, that was all.  If a mob was at half HP all waves would hit fine, it was when the mob got below 10% that the problems started.  Other than that the spell was fine.  Instead of using the rain spells at the end, use them mid-mob life and normal nukes at the end.<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them awesome AE spells that are only useful in a group because of <br>
&gt; the need for chain-stun by an enchanter. But, if they every find a good zone <br>
&gt; to use it in, lets eliminate its use by totally destroying that zone.<br>
<br>
Read what you're saying again.  Imagine how POWERFUL Wizards would be if we could AE 30, 20, or even 10 mobs alone with no others.  Look at the other hand, an Enchanters PB stuns can't get put to maximum use w/o a Wizard.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever done AE in Sebilis, Karnors, or Chardok?  I have, I lived in AE seb from 56-60.  Those zones still work fine, I'm sure there are others that work great too.  The Grey incident isn't even worth getting into.  Anyone who has done AE there surely must admit that the nerf was partically called for.  My personal record there?  Around 86 mobs in ONE PULL with no risk and when they were all done we were still at 60% mana.  <br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them a massive nuke series called BANE, but make it useful against<br>
&gt; only a handful of monsters in the game, difficult to get, and make it cost 20pp<br>
&gt; per cast.<br>
<br>
We also have 2 two new nukes (one larger than banes) brought in with the introduction of Shadows of Luclin.  Those &quot;handful of mobs&quot; were honestly the only ones banes were needed on.  2000 points of unresistable damage on a 32k HP mob would be a sick representation of class balance.  Can you say 16 Wizards killing ANY 32k mob?  Cost-wise, I don't aprove of it one bit.  They really should have re-examined that and made them componentless or at the very least 1 peridot.<br>
<br>
&gt; Let's give them increased mana regen in the form of a familiar/buff, but make <br>
&gt; it take back 1250mana later to make them pay for that increased regen.<br>
<br>
I covered this above.<br>
<br>
&gt; Oh yeah, lets give them lures as a response to the horrible resist rates on their<br>
&gt; spells and the problem of their mana-dependency, then eliminate the usefulness<br>
&gt; of a lure 1 year later by dropping resistance across the board and thus <br>
&gt; increasing the usefulness of everyone elses nukes but not addressing the original<br>
&gt; mana dependency issue that started lures in the first place. <br>
<br>
Believe it or not, lures are still needed on SEVERAL mobs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

As for as the rain spells. I have used these very little. The reason is the 3rd wave for me does get resisted no matter where the mobs health is at. Begining.. end.. middle..

<br>
A post in General gets lots of views at first, but typically falls off the first page in a day and is eventually deleted by the EZboard.  A post in Class Balance will last for a lot longer.  Three weeks down the road when someone thinks &quot;Where was that hiddin cost thread Mezmoriah started&quot; they can find it in Class Balance.  If it was left in general, they could <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> try</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> searching.  If it wasn't deleted by the EZboard, then they'd still have next to no chance of getting the darn search engine to find it.<br>
<br>
Having a post moved to Class Balance shouldn't be considered a punishment.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 2444<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/01 1:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In response to Rombus's post on the familiars.

Did you have Manaskin up?  As I said, I was OOM and killed my familiar, it only ate through my epic rune which is 800~ points.  Not a shread of HP was taken after that rune was gone.<br>

I have used the 50+ rains extensivly, basically since I got them.  As long as I didn't cast the rain when the mob was at 10%~ HP I never had an issue with resists.  Sure, I got the occasional resist.. but for the most part I had 0 problems. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uetrofthedead.showPublicProfile?language=EN>etrofthedead</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/01 1:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> is there a way to decrease how often you are resisted?  because my rains average more than half resisted, usually 2/3 resisted on blues.   im 54 usually in char or seb. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxxkorex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xxkorex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/01 2:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> I did not have my epic rune up or any kind of dmg skin. I was thinking when a Familiar dies it take half you mana. mana pool for me being 2735. (This does not take into account that since luclin int is worth more mana now? If that is correct.) Half of that is 1367 mana. If you have no mana it takes from your hp. (not including rune info since I don't have that.) My hp being under 1367 I just died. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
However the latest patch has fixed it so you don't die just go very low on hp. Can't confirm since I'm still at work. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Is Verant still missing the whole invs problem? They stated they were going to fix it, but it would not be done today. That was like a week ago.<br>
<br>
On the AoE's the mobs I was casting on were even to red to me at 54. However I could still get the exp even with the 3rd wave being resisted. At about 75% I would cast my rain, click my insto buff pants to repop my spell icons, cast my draught of fire, click pants again, cast draught of fire. I would get both draughts of fire to hit by the time the 3rd wave of my rain spell was either resisted or hit. Meaning big amount of dmg and maybe a summon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      If the mob was red I could do the rain/dd twice before he was dead. Usually only got summoned as he died.<br>

~edit Sorry had to fix my spelling mistakes. I can only seem to find them after I post. I know I have run-ons too. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxxkorex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xxkorex</A> at: 12/14/01 12:27:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 772<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/14/01 3:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant and Wizards, there's always a hidden cost...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> is there a way to decrease how often you are resisted? because my rains average more than half resisted, usually 2/3 resisted on blues. im 54 usually in char or seb. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My guess is to group with an enchanter(tash) shaman/mage(mal__) or druid(sunder). <p><hr align="left"  width="100%">
