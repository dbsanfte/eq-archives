There is something to be said for the more cartoony style of WOW, but I have not been overly impressed with their implementation yet.<br>
<br>
I am a bit torn on these upcoming games. I very much like what I have read about EQ2, and some of what I have seen about WOW looks excellent. EQ2 would require a PC upgrade for me, but my next computer purchase will probably be a Mac. Blizzard just announced that they are working on WOW for the Mac.<br>
<br>
Blizzard lacks Sony's experience in running one of these games, but when EQ started so did Sony. Unfortunately, I have not yet played a Blizzard game that held my interest. Some of that it due to genre, I discovered that I just don't like RTS games. The AI is generally terrible, and micromanaging is a pain. I thought Diablo was boring and far too easy. I stopped playing it within a week of starting.<br>
<br>
That leaves me with staying with EQ until they upgrade it beyond my computer unless something really jumps out at me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=delfontes>Delfontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 5:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>AI is generally terrible<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well I guess its clear enought that EQII has superior graphics as of now, we see how it turns out. <br>
<br>
I really really cannot see another company making a better game of this genre then EQ. It just has to much mass, they can outspend Blizzard by 10-1 if they want (given SONY is behind them). <br>

No offense man, but &quot;ridiculous&quot; is assuming you know more about how someone feels than they do themselves.  There are a LOT of people so fed up that they will say &quot;bye bye&quot; if WoW even lives up to HALF the hype.<br>

And btw, I never stated Blizzard as being a &quot;noob company&quot;; I'm saying they're new to the world of MMPORGs, which is currently (obviously) dominated by EQ/SOE.  Blizzard has created some fun RTS games... StarCraft being my favorite (never got into the WC series)... but honestly the last WC and the last Diablo didn't really do much for me.  Is Blizzard really on that big of a roll?  You'd think they have a golden aura around them according to some of the people on this board. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
I like RTS as well as RPGs, but I just couldnt justify keeping WC III.  I personally liked Lords of Magic better tho the graphics sucked.<br>
<br>
Also to the person who says EBGames makes release dates up... I can understand why you feel that way, but no they do not.  I work in computer software retail and the way Bestbuy, GameStop, CompUSA, EBGames, and any others get their dates is.  Someone in their corperate office gets in contact with a representative from Blizard (as example) and they are given a round about date for release.  They are given a date (no matter how many times a game is pushed back) so they have something to base their pre-sales on.  This way they know when they have to have their orders in.  <br>
<br>
Yes the Sims is the number 1 selling PC game in the entire world.  Their are a few games that have gotten close to it tho.<br>

If WoW does the same, it can be a good game. Having never really enjoyed any of Blizzard's games due to them simply not being the sorts of games I enjoy (I've played WC2, SC, WC3, and some of Diablo), I've never developed the fandom about Blizzard that some have... but I have been playing (and for the most part enjoying) EverQuest for years now. If I'm going simply by graphics, well, I just don't know how I'd connect with a cartoony/comic book character over many years. It's fine for a short while (and I personally like anime quite a bit) but after a while... I just don't know.<br>
I'm not leaving EQ for WoW. I'm not leaving it for EQ2. I'm not leaving EQ because Furor says something's better. I'm going to play for myself and see which I like best. It's getting to the point where you have the choice between enough games that you can pick the style that suits you best. But I have to say I'm skeptical about new games. How many times have I heard that they'll fix all my gaming woes and deliver me to a realm of unparalleled online bliss? I'll wait until I see it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78952">Caldabuse Betelgeuse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arcanist and Pirate Queen of the Timorous Deep<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Erollisi Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 10:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1>  As some before me have stated the graphics between the two games are 2 different styles so it is really hard to say which is better, it is more of a personal preference. I think both are very nice and things are looking up for the genre, hopefully with both games, we the gamers will be the one to benefit by getting the best games possible.<br>
<br>
 EQ is/was a great game, I have played it probably more than any other game, I have many good memories playing it and it will be one of my favorites of all the games I have played.<br>
<br>
 A lot of things have changed for me though, EQ is not the game it use to be, I do not get the same feeling playing as I once did. The only reason I log on much is to spend time with friends. Things started changing for me when SOE started taking a bigger role in things and when VI began dissapearing slowly. Many of those who I think made EQ the great game it is have left for Sigil, there is some still left and I think others could make this a great game but the way SOE runs the company hurts the game most imo.<br>
<br>
 Seeing as the graphics are basically a wash and both excellent, it comes down to gameplay, CS, and the way the company will treat the game. I have been a part of the way SOE does business and no thanks, some things may change a little but SOE is still making lots of cash why change if people are still handing over their cash? <br>
<br>
From my experiences with Blizzard they try there best to take care of their games and their customers, the gameplay in WoW looks fun unlike some of the work that EQ requires and from what EQ2 is looking it will require. Everyone should make their own choices if you like SOE and how they run things play EQ2 and have fun, that is the most important thing, these are games and supposed to be fun.<br>
<br>
 I have to say for myself Gameplay&gt;Graphics, if the gameplay is horrid no matter how nice it looks I will not play for long. Look at AC2, the look of the game is very nice but the gameplay is awful so I didnt play long. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaziqueal>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 10:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1> The mmorpg with the best graphics and engine currently on the market right now is AC2, imo, yet it remains a ghost town.

<br>
I will tell you why I will be looking forward to playing WoW over EQ2 and graphics have absolutely nothing to do with it. I detest SoE. I like Blizzard.<br>
<br>
I fully expect EQ2 to ship with an unfinished skill system, whereas I doubt WoW will. SB actually shipped with a balanced skill system(albeit a whole world of other problems), so don't buy into the bullshit that it's not a reasonable thing to expect from a mmorpg. EQ just set a lazy standard that others are willing to use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 10:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Reply To Solar</span><hr size=1>  Friends and the community is why some don't leave including myself.

<br>
 Some of us have been playing EQ for who knows how long now and we are hoping to make the game better rather than just walking away, sometimes it is hard to see something you enjoyed so much coming to an end, or see the game change from what it use to be into something else. It is hard to just pick up and walk away, leaving friends and the game behind. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zertez>zertez</A> at: 5/15/03 10:16:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sorran>Sorran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/03 11:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reply To Solar</span><hr size=1> Personally, while I can appreciate the quality of the WoW graphics, the style turns me off - that's a purely personal preference. The EQ2 graphics leave me picking my jaw up from the floor. Again, purely personal preference.<br>
<br>
Blizzard has an undeniable record as the creator of some of the most popular games in computer gaming history. I have personally played and enjoyed all of them, to varying degress (Starcraft being my favourite). But you know what? Blizzard has never made a MMORGP. And the one thing you could probably get evey single MMORGP industry veteran to agree on, is that making a MMORGP is so utterly different from making a &quot;traditional&quot; computer game that they are barely comparable.<br>
<br>
There are a few reasons why I am staying unhyped about WoW, based purely off Blizzard and its previous products.<br>
<br>
Firstly, Blizzard has a reputation for having very long development cycles. Now, the upside of this is that it lets them release very stable, generally bug free games of absolute top quality. However, long development cycles can be very dangerous in a MMORGP when it comes to customer retention. One of the top complaints about pretty much every would-be challenger to EQ's crown has been &quot;lack of content&quot;, especially &quot;high end&quot; content. Unless Blizzard can show they can release content/fixes/updates/whatever on faster basis, their customer retention runs the risk of suffering.<br>
<br>
Secondly, in their psuedo-MMOG Battle.Net, hacks, cheats, etc are rampant. Now, this is primarily due to the fact that all these games are actually run client side - the server side operation of a MMORGP avoids that problem. However, having said that, Blizzard is notoriously slow to responding to even the most glaring of cheats in their games. That's an attitude that will have to change for WoW (and, of course, it may well do so).<br>
<br>
Thirdly, there is very little &quot;new&quot; in WoW. Like most Blizzard games, there is barely an original idea to be seen, that they have announced so far, anyway. And based off their track record, real innovation is not Blizzard's strong suit - they take a well proven idea, then make that idea the best it can possibly be. Even Warcraft 1, their first &quot;big&quot; game, was just a refinement of the previous generations of RTS - barely a single innovate feature in the entire game - it was just done better than anyone else had done before. I think WoW is running the risk of suffering the fate of every single other MMORPG that tried to be &quot;EQ but better&quot;. People simply won't leave their investment in their current game to try another game that is not that different from the previous one. People will flock to it in droves, realise its not that different from what they were playing before, and leave in almost as large droves.<br>
<br>
For me, it comes down to the fact that WoW is being made by a company without a single previous MMORPG under their belt, and for that reason alone, I will treat it with all caution that I have treated every other first-time MMORGP company. Blizzard may be brilliant at making RTS games, but they also may absolutely suck at making MMORPG games - only time will tell, but I'm counting my chickens before they are hatched =).<br>
<br>

Uhmm, I'm no fan boy but I know crap when I hear it.  They didn't give the game a completely different engine when they came out with luclin they were still working with the same old engine but trying to upgrade it.  It's eiasier to make a nice peice of furnuture from new wood then it is from rotted out falling apart wood.<br>
<br>
So on that note its rather premature to be judging EQ2's performance on what happened with luclin.  Yeah EQ2 could end up sucking, but saying its going to suck becuase of a completely unrelated happening that would have no effect on EQ2 is lame.  Remember EQ2 is not EQ, it's being treated as a completely different game with different development teams. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/16/03 1:44:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aillean>Aillean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 2:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> I think its fairly obvious that EQ is the best MMORPG so far. Considering that its the only MMORPG that SoE has released I would say that they have a great track record. Discounting Lineage, EQ has kept more subscribers for a longer time than any of the competition.<br>
<br>
Blizzard has made good games as well, no doubt about it. While I personally think that WC was a Dune II clone in a Warhammer world, its fairly obvious that a lot of people liked the series. Blizzard games tend to be released with very few bugs. On the other hand, the D2 BNet servercode was so unstable that you might have suspected that they had outsourced the development to Funcom. While Blizzard tend to release bugfree games they also tend to be outdated by the time they are released. In the RTS genre this might not mean much, but I think this could be a disadvantage for a MMORPG. The WC3 engine for example is workable, but its outdated even today. While I don't mind the WoW graphics I'm not sure how well they stand up to the competition in a year or two.<br>
<br>
That being said, I probably will try both EQ2 and WoW. My greatest concern with both games is that they might lack in complexity because the companies think that will sell more copies. Also, listening too much to customers is a bad thing. Lets hope they don't make that misstake.<br>

<br>
Those people enjoyed playing diablo2, but then suddenly blizzard makes 1.08 patch and 1.09 patch. Disabling stuff people liked a lot, making the &quot;rares&quot; pure crap. The idea behind those patches was, that blizzard though the players were playing the game different then it should be played, ahum. So they changed a lot of settings.<br>
<br>
Then they promised almost immediately a new patch v1.10.<br>
This patch has still to come.(promised more then 1 year ago)<br>
<br>
Blizzard want to force their customers to play the games as THEY think they should be played. So people who just play for themself get banned, because they use &quot;radar&quot; utilities. I know, there are still discussions going on, that those things are cheating, while other players say, they improve their gameplay. But result is the same, a load of people got disappointed and left that game.<br>
<br>
Also, if you forget to play diablo2 every 3 months, then your chars are GONE and there is no way to get them back. Not really a good sign of customers service. Also a reason a lot of people are really hesitating to even think about WoW.<br>
IF you have problems with your accounts, then you won't be helped either, you get auto-answers emails and they just keep on sending those. <br>
<br>
Beside, blizzard really has to improve their servers. How can someone even think to run a real mmorpg, if they can't even make their battlenet servers stable? When i played diablo2, i could not play a load of times, since there was some problem with the useast server again.<br>
<br>
Nah, please spare me remarks about blizzard being customers friendly, they are not that friendly or helpfull.<br>

<br>
But HOW the game plays is far more important to me.  WoW sounds like they have some really cool ideas.  SOE however has one HUGE advantage - Familiarity.  I've briefly tried some other MMORPGs and the games were so dissimilar I found I didn't want to learn from scratch all over again.<br>
<br>
Depending on how different EQII 'feels' from EQ will determine how much of an edge they keep in that area. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=camrael>camrael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1114<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/03 8:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQII vs WoW Graphics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Your dead wrong anti-fan boy.<br>
<br>
How about posting your resume and specific skills that relate to:<br>
<br>
a) designing and creating 3D Game engines, <br>
b) working with directX, and Microsoft development<br>
c) or if your not a game developer, your specific software engineering experience would be useful.<br>
<br>
That would give your assessment some validity.<br>
<br>
Allow me to give you a basic primer on how the world works in relation to your comment.<br>
<br>
They took an engine that was probably created up to 2 years before the initial launch of Everquest. They had no idea how popular everquest would be, and were designing around the current hardware of that time. Their beta's ended in 1999 I remember, so it is very possible that the design for this was first set out in 1997 or 1998.<br>
<br>
In case you did not know, it is very hard to completely replace a game engine without re-writing the entire game which is not something that is really possible in a popular online game. The work they did with Luclin while not to everyone's aesthetic tastes (i.e, some people did not like the look of the models) it can definitely be viewed as making lemonade out of lemons.<br>
<br>
I was a programmer for a number of years on PC and Playstation games for<br>
<br>
Electronic Arts (various sports titles)<br>
then<br>
Relic Entertainment (Homeworld)<br>
<br>
<br>
I have since tired of working 18 hour days and have moved into the business side of software development.<br>
