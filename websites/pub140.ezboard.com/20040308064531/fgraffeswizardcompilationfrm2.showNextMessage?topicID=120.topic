Being a Dark Elf with &quot;indifferent&quot; faction with the outpost in The Overthere I didn't want to risk doing much fighting except to save my hide.<br>
<br>
The closest I ever got to the jail area was when a group I was talking to got to the hand room and was staying there to fight.  Figuring on joining them I decided to try the little Gravity Flux trick to get up the wall.  Having tried this before, I didn't remember being able to move forward that much once I was launched in the air...and the moat is pretty wide.<br>
<br>
Hence, I swam up to the castle wall and started casting.  I hadn't even finished casting and some decayed prisoners and guards started hitting me through the castle wall.  I was down to a bubble of health before my casting was even complete.<br>
<br>
This leads to my question:  Is there a way to get a better run at moving while in the air?  I sure didn't remember moving all that much when I tried it on dry land...even with JBoots I would start running when the spell hit and I didn't seem to get far enough to cross the moat in Karnor's Castle.<br>
<br>
Any hints would be greatly appreciated.  Even without a group I could probably sit in the hand room and rest assuming only the hands were there...they are all indifferent to me.<br>

Buy that time I also had 4 things beating on me.  But I was able to get out alive with the bottle.  The one suggestion I would make cause I didn't agro to much stuff cause Im 54th, is get a shiny brass idol..This may help.<br>

run through the castle, across both bridges, and up the stairs in the room to the left. have manaskin up at all times. if there is something in your way, root it and run past it. if manaskin breaks, recast it. you can basically do this all the way to the jail. if the skeleton isnt up, gate out and do it again when it is on someone's tracking. at least then you know you can make it =) <p>Phantorn Sorrowbringer<BR>54th Wizard of T`Kagi Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uhippastus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippastus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/28/00 2:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I believe it's possible, I just don't see how.</span><hr size=1> OK, I tried the grav flux trick in karnor's repeatedly without any kind of luck.  Unless you consider dieing lucky in which case I was very fortunate (pulling mobs through the walls is no fun).  It seems to me the moat is simply too wide to flux over where the spoiler indicated.  What am I doing wrong?  I was very careful to do it in the spot indicated and I never had enough horizontal motion to get me to the wall.  I even tried it from in the water a couple of times just to be sure and still nothing.  Is there another trick I'm forgetting?  If you've done this, please, I want to hear from you.<br>

<br>
I dont know if it was a fluke but I hit run just as the spell goes off. I had jboots, and remember, do NOT levitate as it limits how high you can jump.<br>
<br>
The bad news is I screwed up the next bit as by the time I got to the jail cell the skel was gone and soon I was killed by two decaying soldiers, couldn't get a root off as they hit so fast and hard. <br>
<br>
I would recommend the rogue method, my friend has a level 15 and he got the bottle filled after a couple of attempts. (He also dragged my corpse to the zone, bless him) <br>

Good to know im not the only one!  Granted, i was only 43 or so when i did it, but i had a lvl 51 friend with me too, and that helped.  yeah, we got beat on, but we didn't die at all in the karnors part of the quest.  My advice if you are going to do it like we did - run like hell, don't get lost on your way back to the zone after you are done. (i know its not far, but i kept wanting to take a wrong turn)  And like he said, SoW, invis, steelskin, and levi - levi so you can jump down on your mad dash back, instead of working your way down the stairs.  It took a couple passes to get used to where we were going and which mobs were where, but Karnors was relatively camped, so there was always a person to clear out a stray that agro'd.<br>

Well I gave up on the gravity flux idea as impossible and made myself a rogue and brought him to karnor's.  I was surprised at how easy it was with the little guy.  Many people were kind enough to buff me up before going in.  It's amazing the things people give to you as a lvl 7 rogue in Karnor's.  But I went in and got my vial of swirling somke here with almost no problem once I figured out what I was doing.  I ran in, the skellie was up.  I activated my Shiny Brass Idol (which btw has no casting time, I was worried it might)  and handed in the bottle then jumped off the wall to make my corpse retrieval easier.  I probably could have made it to the zone, but I didn't want to train all the nice people that had buffed me up earlier.  So I'm happy to say I got my scroll of concussion and it is one of my most prized possessions.  I definately reccommend the rogue method over suicide runs  to the jail.  Yeah it's cheap, but as long as you're playing the rogue you're still finishing the quest.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Good luck all, I hope this helps.<br>

You stand on the path where it indicates on the map and face the wall.  Have jboots on (you probably don't really need them but it can't hurt) and keep your MR low so you don't resist your spell.  Just *before* the spell goes off (like a pixle or 2 of the purple Casting bar is still there) start running toward the wall.  If your channeling goes off (the &quot;You regain your concentration and continue casting...&quot; thing) and you don't resist the spell, you'll go flying over the moat and land on the path.  If you resist or your spell is interrupted, quickly turn around and swim back to the shore and try again.  That was the method I used anyway, and it seemed to work out well.  I landed in the moat a couple times at first because channeling didn't go off, but nothing agroed as I swam back to shore (and I'm an Erudite who's very KoS to VS).  <br>
<br>
P.S.  Yes, you can hand in the bottle while the shiny brass idol effect is up. <p>Magatone Brac'Taur<BR>

It will fly you further much like angling any kind of throws instead of standing up straight. =)  I did it this way since it was easier for me but you might find the running method easie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=46.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=46.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=46.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
