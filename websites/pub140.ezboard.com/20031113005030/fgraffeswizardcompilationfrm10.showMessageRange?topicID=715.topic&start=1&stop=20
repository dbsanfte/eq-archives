Most of us laugh at this, but it's a valid concern when we can kill mobs with a group of six wizards in a few seconds.<br>
<br>
So, the solution then is to stop this static zone setup.<br>
<br>
The solution in my opinion is to stop saying that those who buy expansions get new abilities for their characters, in addition to the new content.<br>
<br>
Those who never bought an expansion should have been allowed to go up to level 60.  They still couldn't go to Kunark or the other lands, so this would limit their access to spells and to group to get equipment.  They would end up with the scraps since they could never get NO DROP items that drop in expansions.  This would also allow Verant to boost the level on dragons such as Vox and Naggy, and then forcing those encounters to be &quot;off limits&quot; to high level characters would be gone.<br>
<br>
Alternate Advancement should have been opened up to everyone.  There's no trainers, or guild masters that teach AA abilities, they just &quot;come to us&quot; when we spend the points.  So why not give this to everyone of the appropriate level?<br>
<br>
Mobs over 32k HP should be the rule across the game once Velious came out.  This does NOT mean that all mobs would be made more powerful, just that the HP on those dragons and perhaps some other mobs would be higher, their damage output lowered, and that would maintain the current difficulty.<br>
<br>
Loot rewards MUST be changed as well I feel to reflect the current nature of the game.  Should Vox and Naggy drop items a level 60 would want if the game design says that level 60s shouldn't be killing those mobs?  Should tough boss-mob encounters drop items that are considered pathetic in comparison to the current availability of items?  A number of epic items are out-classed by drops from Velious and Luclin, so it should be time for either an upgrade, or an second phase to epic quests that would allow upgrades to epic items.<br>
<br>
Kunark out-classed Antonica/Faydwer/Odus, Velious out-classed Kunark, and finally we have Luclin, which doesn't turn Velious items into worthless items when fighting mobs, so Verant DID learn, but why can't they apply what they learned to the older zones?<br>

What game balance? The game is balanced. At low levels no matter the gear a wizard is weak. At the Highest level, with a load of AA points, and after spending insane amounts to buy a few spells, supported by a Guild with at least 60 other level 60 characters, a wizard is strong enough to hold his own for a few seconds, and for a minute in the old world.<br>

The ONLY way to do that with Verant mudflation from Velious and Luclin, is to re-tune the old world and Kunark so that they too have a proper risk vs. reward.  if this means to move some items from and to older mobs, that should be done.  Or they can get around to doing zone updates since a dragon is a dragon, and while some will be more powerful than others, do any of you think that it's weird for the yard trash in hall of testing, not even full dragons yet, wouldn't have a problem going up against Vox or Naggy, as well as the dragons on Kunark? <p>Targonis Manastorm<br>

First question; who is going to pay for all that time that SOE/VI spends doing it?<br>
<br>
Second question; What omniscent design team is going to balance (i.e. change) things in a way that everybody likes?<br>
<br>
Third question; Will any of this make the game more enjoyable for the majority of players?<br>
<br>
One point; I am a velious geared, level 60 wizard. There is nothing really on Kunark outside of Veeshan's Peak that I could really care less about.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, white scales are kinda funky, until those white dragonscale cloaks get done to death by my guildies.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way, my guild kills Gorenaire with 4 groups (5 when people are enthusiastic), with her lifespawn being about an hour. No manaburn needed, just bring five sorcerers with decent magic resistance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Guess what? That encounter was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> designed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for 60s.<br>
<br>
So it offends somebody's sensibilities that some guilds can easily kill Gorenaire with a mere four groups. How about three groups, maybe just one group?<br>
<br>
The real issue here, in my view, isn't about &quot;balance&quot; it is about not being &quot;able to compete&quot;. <p>-----

I also feel that AA abilities should be available to all characters regardless of expansions owned or not owned.  If these things were done, then Old World and Kunark could be updated to Velious rules for allowing mobs to have over 32k HP.<br>
<br>
Obviously, SOME balance will need to be done with the loot drops as well from mobs, and perhaps some zone upgrades as well, but this would make the older zones see more usage.<br>
<br>
Another way to look at this:<br>
<br>
If old world zone designed for levels 15 to 30 were to drop items that would be desired by people with all expansions, old and new, people of those levels would probably want to go there.<br>
<br>
If old world zone designed for level 35 to 50 were to drop items that would be desired in this level range for people with all expansions, people would go there.<br>
<br>
If old world zone has loot that used to be good, but now has poor loot and XP reward compared to similar level zones from the newer expansions, those with the newer expansions will NOT go there.<br>
<br>
What we have seen from EQ has supported this.  Mistmoore, once a heavily used hunting spot for those level 20 to 50 is now largely empty due to newer zones being better in many ways.  Unrest also doesn't have the population levels it once had, not because there are more zones, but because many realize that there is BETTER loot and XP to be had in other zones with a similar level of difficulty.<br>
<br>
These are only two examples, but the same thing applies to many of the &quot;unused zones&quot; in the game.  If the loot and/or XP arn't enough to justify going there, people won't go.  Sure, the zones may be FANTASTIC for design and content, but if they are out of the way, there needs to be more incentive.  What about increasing coin drop for example, so that the deeper you go, the more money you get.  If items arn't going to be added, having mobs drop 30 plat each might inspire those who need money to buy other things to go there.  How about tradeskills?  We have a few places to farm spider silk, I can bet that if the kaesora spiders dropped on average 4 spider silks that the place would see more action.<br>
<br>
So, boost the old zones, update them.  Chardok was empty until it was updated, and now it has more activity.  Other zones can get similar treatment and see similar results.  How long the increased population stays will be based on how well the changes are implemented.<br>

There is a progression here that you might like to ignore but some of us see it and appreciate it for what it is...<br>
<br>
Unbeknowest to you there are still guilds just now starting to claim the bragging rights of their first Fear run, or their first Hate run. Its these same people that are gearing up to make their first run at Naggy or Vox. Once they finish these guys they have to level up and then start making tries at other targets...<br>

Focus items are one way of making the areas more interesting to go to, that old Chrysoberyl Talisman some people used for the mana (rarely) now is more attractive for instance.<br>
<br>
However, there is a very limited gaming populace, probably around 1500-2000 people on any given server max at peak times.  That was pretty awful back before the expansions, it left nowhere to hunt and bad lag.  But the world is about three TIMES as big as it used to be, and those people are now scattered around all over the place.  You just cannot have every zone full of people all the time - there isn't the population to fill them all up!  It's OK for some dungeons to be empty, like Nurga for instance, if they are otherwise well done.  The reason to change a dungeon is because it sucks or needs work, not because it's empty.  Some places will always have light traffic, there's just not enough people to go everywhere at once. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 631<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 10:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can game balance happen without a change to the old worl</span><hr size=1> I never once said that the mobs should be made MORE powerful.  I repeat, they should not be made more powerful, just that they don't have the 32k HP cap.  The way to do this is simple, tune the damage output of the mobs to compensate for them having more hit points.  The encounter will be longer, but with lower damage output from the mob(s), it's the same difficulty, just a longer encounter.<br>
<br>
Most of us old timers remember how they boosted the damage output of mobs when Kunark was released, and this increased with Velious.  If the number of hit points that a mob does goes up, the way you keep it the same overall difficulty is to lower the damage output of the mobs.  This is also a way to reduce mudflation, to use this sort of thing when you tune encounters.  You can boost AC to make something more difficult to kill, boost HP, raise or LOWER the damage output to compensate, etc.<br>
<br>
So, one more time if you missed it, raising hit points past the 32k HP limit doesn't mean that the encounter MUST be more difficult as a result if you tune the encounter properly.<br>

You do realize that lvl 60 AA melee's can kill kunark dragons with just one group as well don't you? If they did what you say it just makes it so that a group of wizards can't kill them. Raising they're HP and lowering their damage output would just make it EASIER for the melee's to kill them. If you cut their melee damage by 50% then you would have 1 warrior and 1 cleric killing them. Yes, 2 people. A 60 warrior with that many AA points and a 60 cleric with all the healing AAs. The cleric would be able to med up mana faster for another complete heal than the dragon would be able to kill the warrior. Eventually they wear it down and win.<br>

Why?  Cause when I make my new characters, I like going to places like Sol A, Unrest, MM, etc. to go get exp.  I know it's not the greatest, but it's a zone to yourself to go kill in.  Get ya a group of friends together and go have at it.  I have a 60 wiz, 60 war, and 57 shammy... my 41 monk (who I lvl'd up in old world for the most part) is well-equiped from the money I make off my other characters, therefore, I could care less about loot on my monk (besides not being able to carry much in the first place). <p>Idarae Pyrcocaster

Your complaint is basically this: Wizards with full AA and massive equipment at level 60 can smoke creatures if they all band together.  Thus, these creatures need to be made less killable by said Wizards.  As an extension of this, you suggest old dungeons be changed because the creatures are too weak and easily killed by level 60s.<br>
<br>
As I pointed out, at level 60 you should be able to walk into an area that was built for level 50 max and kick it around, it would be absurd if you couldn't.  Making it so you can NOT do so by neccessity means it is... more powerful than before.  Making monsters harder to kill makes them... more powerful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 638<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/13/02 1:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Can game balance happen without a change to the old worl</span><hr size=1> No, my point is that the game balance will ALWAYS be broken if you don't update older zones.  <br>
<br>
If we look at EverQuest as a whole, not per expansion, then Naggy/Vox should be the least powerful, and the Ring of Scale is a complete joke compared to the dragons on Velious.  In general then, the difficulty of mobs needs to be properly adjusted so that mobs that in the game world that are comparitavely similar in power ARE similar in power, no matter when they were introduced.  If there is a need for mobs because the mobs that used to be easy are more powerful, then they should be added, or things moved around.<br>
<br>
When Kunark came out, the mobs were MUCH harder for their level compared to the old world.  Velious continued this.  Luclin was more or less even with Velious.  Now, how can you properly balance the classes unless you balance them PER EXPANSION?  For the classes to be balanced, does Verant need to say, &quot;Wizards will suck unless you have Luclin and 25AA points put into AA skills&quot;?  Wern't the mobs in Kunark designed with a certain difficulty of encounter in mind?  If future expansions trivilize the old content, then the old content should be properly balanced to compensate for this.  THAT is what I have been saying.  The thing that makes Kunark trivial isn't manaburn, it isn't the new weapons in Velious.  The thing is that the power of the players were boosted through mudflation, but the old zones wern't updated to compensate for this.  There's risk vs. reward, but if the risk is non existant for a decent reward due to expansions, that breaks the balance of the game as well.<br>
<br>
Are Velious mobs REALLY that much tougher than Kunark in a fantasy game sense, or is it just the mechanics changed to make them this way?  If the mechanics changed in one expansion, they SHOULD have changed across the board for all zones.  Once THAT is done, then you don't have to worry about stupid things like items and AA skills trivializing old content.<br>

<br>
Sorry but this really seems like a &quot; have nots &quot; complaining about something that a &quot; haves &quot; can do. <br>
<br>
 Considering most people would expect a group of lvl 60 manaburning wizards to drop old world mobs in 2 seconds flat there really isnt a problem. The thing you are refusing to acknowledge is that a group of lvl 60 wizards arnt the only thing that is that powerful. <br>
<br>
Wizards are desighned to do damage quickly, thats what we do. If the amount of time is whats bothering you, go look at some parsed data. There are things a group of 60 MB wizzies cant take down, why cause the hp is too high. But you know what? That other then mb wizzie group that could kill the same thing the mb group did, albiet longer will also kill the mob those wizzies can't. ( to clarify a group of 60 &lt;pick a random set of classes&gt; with full AA and gear will take not only what the group of wizzies with MB did, but also things they cant take down) So your point has no validation what so ever.<br>
<br>

I just happen to look at the game design from a different perspective than people who look at how to beat the game, rather than if the game is well designed.<br>
<br>
So again, is Vox and Naggy REALLY supposed to be that much weaker than the dragons we have seen in Kunark?  Are the Kunark dragons supposed to be pushovers compared to Velious dragons, or is it just because they use different rules in the newer expansions?  <br>
<br>
That's the problem that I see, if they are supposed to be roughly equal in power, then with the new expansions, and with EQ trilogy, the free account keys, and so on, it just seems STUPID that because someone has a newer expansion that older mobs become trivial.  This has NOTHING to do with manaburn.  It's more from a roleplaying perspective.<br>
<br>
Vox is a very good example of a problem.  For those who like the idea of being allied with the Ring of Scale from a roleplaying perspective, Vox is the ONLY dragon that drops a white dragon scale that isn't on Ring of Scale faction.  Because the idiots at Verant decided they didn't want to do any work, they just restricted access to those 52 and below.  Does this make sense with how trivial ALL of Kunark is for those who have Velious and have more dragon raids under their belts than there are people who still don't have ANY expansion?<br>

Each time they've added an expansion, the game got harder, when it should have just gotten bigger.<br>
<br>
Think about mob difficulty. Compared to Velious and Luclin uber-mobs, Naggy and Vox are wimps. Why is this? Because they're still building the game. At one point, Naggy and Vox were the uber-mobs. Now they'd be considered yard trash.<br>
<br>
Imagine if they had gone the other route, and made the game bigger instead of harder. What do I mean? Ok, how about making encounters need more people, not because an uber-mob has 100k hp, but because there are 3 32k ubermobs right next to each other, and they have to be taken down at the same time in order to beat them?<br>
Lack of vision, and bad methods plagues EQ. The thing is, it's not really their faults. They, a company that relies on subscription fees, need the players to continue playing. Otherwise they'll stop playing, and the game goes down the tubes.<br>
<br>
I dunno, I just think had they left everything as it was (32k hp limit, Skills/spells &gt; Items) that the game would be more about the adventures, and less about getting to 60 and all the uber loot. <p><CENTER>

<br>
There were more possiblities than just higher HP mobs and Phatter Lewts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your example is a good one.. But I think the key would have laid somewhere in between these ideas.. <br>
<br>
Maybe some multiple encounters such as this, and perhaps a few real baddies... <br>
Heck, maybe even a dungeon of all uber mobs would be wild.<br>
<br>
However; I agree with some of the above posts as well. The items dropping off some of the old world dragons isn't really useful when fighting some of the Velious/Luclin Boss mobs. Mostly, the higher levels farm the stuff and sell it. Like the J-boots for example. Lots of people still have troubles getting J-boots, because when they finally get the AC to pop, some 60 druid comes along, whacks it real fast for a Multi Quest, and the level 45 is just stuck.<br>
<br>
This is where I have to agree with some trivial code added to the game.. Although, that's a worse issue when it comes to &quot;what if's&quot; -- some of which have everybit of merit.. <br>
<br>
Like.. What if, the Level 58 Paladin never could get j-boots because he always got outdamaged and Kill Stolen.. <br>
<br>
I would propose one solution to Verant.. Add a flag/tag that allows an item to only be looted once. Like the AC ring, is a good example. This flag could have a time limit.. Say 90 days.. You get an AC ring today, you can't get another for 90 days. Dunno what kinda code nightmare that might be, but it seems like a good idea on te surface.<br>
<br>
Although, groups of 58+ may still go into Naggy's Lair to farm Tranix Crowns.. it would make farming some items not a feasible option. Thus removing even the desire to MB certain mobs, as they wouldn't drop anything worth the mana.. And this also eliminate some &quot;what if's&quot; for people who got to higher level and just got passed up on a certain item.<br>
