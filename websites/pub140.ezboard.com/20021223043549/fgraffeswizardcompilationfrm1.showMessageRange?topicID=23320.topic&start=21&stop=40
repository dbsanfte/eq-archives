&quot; you go into these movies expecting a science fantasy movie with good effects and lots of action you will most likely enjoy them. If you go in expecting hard core science fiction, good acting, a deep plot and an academy award winning script you will be disappointed. This is not what Star Wars is and never has been.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
We all know a bad movie when we see it.<br>
I did watch Star wars the other night and it is Still great.<br>
Episode1 was on thanksgiving night and i tried to watch it but its simply an awful movie.<br>
Attack of the Clones is Lightyears ahead of episode1 yet it still cannot compare to any of the originals.<br>
This is not my opinion because i grew up its simply not as good. It's very close, i mean george started out ok with this latest movie then simply couldn't recapture the magic.<br>
<br>
Want another good example related to George Lucas?<br>
<br>
Most people that enjoy action adventure/fantasy movies loved Raiders of the Lost Ark. Great all time movie.<br>
However, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is not that good. <br>
Other night i watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for the 4th time. Great Movie.<br>
Did the movie rehash old ideas in it? Sure. Did it have the same old cliche's and retread humor from the first movie? Yup.<br>
They returned to the  original formula and had a great  script. It has very memorable scenes and great acting and yet has a coherent and fast paced logically moving storylines. A truly memorabel flick an i hope that Star Wars can redeem itself with its last gasp of a film: Episaode 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ps. Does anyone else think that george left way to many things to happen in the third flick? It will have to be a 5 hour movie to correctly bridge the gap between AoTC and the original trilogy. <br>

I don't expect Shindler's List or the Red Ballon.<br>
<br>
I do expect good acting, though.  I expect a good plot, and I expect fun action.<br>
<br>
Star Wars 4 had mostly good acting.  I thought Alec Guinness, Peter Cushing, and Harrison Ford were all great, as was James Earl Jones.  Watching the movie again I also enjoyed Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and Anthony Daniel's performances.<br>
<br>
Star Wars 4 had a good plot.  It was nothing earth shattering, but that's not one of the things you expect.  It was enough to keep you interested, and enough to immerse you into the imaginary world.  Star Wars 4 did some subtle things, too.<br>
<br>
The much of the action in 4 would seem boring by today's standards, but even then there is tension and excitement as you follow the battle and, of course, Han Solo's surprise return.  Once you get past the graphical and stunt limitations they had, the action scenes were well done.  <br>
<br>
Empire, to me, had everything the first movie had and did it with more style.  IMO the only Star Wars movie to ever have a convincing romance.  That's not the only thing that made the film great, but I bring it up so that we can compare with episode II..<br>
<br>
Personally, I liked Jedi a lot.  I will admit the Ewok tribe defeating the storm troopers was stretching it a bit, but to me that was a minor flaw.  There wasn't much to the story, but there really wasn't much left to tell, and what was there was interesting.  The standard cast was comfortable in their roles, and I thought Ian Mcdiarmid was terrific as the Emperor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Attack of the Clones.  <br>
<br>
I expect good acting(and of course, directing).  I liked Ewen McGregor.  Hayden Christianson was ok.  I mean, he was pretty good, but I would have hoped for better.  <br>
<br>
Same with Natalie Portman.  Her character seemed written to be strong-willed and to have a commanding presence, but to me she appeared to be weak at heart and was trying hard not to be.  (Particularly vivid is the scene where she falls off the plane-thing and starts yelling orders at the clone trooper.  It struck me forcefully as just line-reading.)<br>
<br>
I thought Frank Oz was good, but thought he was better in V and VI.  I can't really place what my gripe with Yoda was, I just seem to have a little more difficulty associating that Yoda with the original Yoda than I would have expected.  <br>
<br>
I was disappointed with Samuel L. Jackson a bit, too, but overall I liked his protrayal of the character.<br>
<br>
I thought Ian McDiarmid was terrific as Palpatine.  To me, his performance shows that you can't blame everything on bad writing.  <br>
<br>
I thought the story concept was good.  Fairly predictable, but no major flaws that I care about.  Watching the movie on tape, though, I do have a big problem with the plots execution, though.<br>
<br>
Anakin was sent on this mission to protect Padme, and she was never really in any danger until they tried to rescue Obi-Wan.  The only purpose for being on Naboo was the love story, which frankly sucked.  To compare to two similar situations in Empire Strikes Back, Han and Leia's love story and Luke's training on Degobah.<br>
<br>
Han and Leia's story was woven into the plot.  They didn't just set aside a whole thread of the film wholly devoted to devloping their relationship.  Bits and pieces showed up as the movie progressed.  A few minutes on Hoth, the asteroid, and then the shared experiences in Cloud City, ending with Han getting frozen.  This was done mostly <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">simultaneously</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> with the rest of the story.  The Hoth part was interwoven with the story about Jabba's bounty on Han and the imperial attack on the base.  Love scenes were typically set as interludes to the action during the space chase.<br>
<br>
In contrast, the whole movie just stops frequently for a fair amount of time to do the Anakin-Padme stuff, as well as doing it along with the plot.  The love plot is started in Coruscant..  And the scene on the transport was fine to continue it..  but then they had the the balcony scene, the fruit scene, the fireplace scene, and the picnic scene.  In none of those scenes did I ever feel any connection with the rest of the movie.  The only thing going on was the relationship between Anakin and Padme.. <br>
<br>
What made it worse was that even with that much time devoted to developing the relationship, it wasn't done well.  Mostly, intead of being able to watch their feelings and watch how their feelings influenced their actions, you watched them talk about their feelings.. over and over.  You learn that such a relationship isn't going to be looked well upon by the Jedi in the very first scene you see Anakin.. the elevator scene.  You don't need 3 more lengthy scenes that don't really do anything but restate that and do nothing else for the plot.<br>
<br>
I don't think it was enough to kill the movie.  I definitely thought Attack of the Clones was a fun movie.  The rest of the plot was good, and the movie was definitely nice to look at.  I think it could have been a lot better overall though, even given the nature of Star Wars films. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dramadon>Dramadon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 2:39:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cafenet.demon.co.uk/Domus/Images/Guild_Logo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoTC</span><hr size=1> I enjoyed Episode II. I actually think the political build up was the best part of the movie (with the exception of most of the fight scenes). It makes the series have a larger scope and shows that the decisions that are made have an impact on the universe as a whole.<br>
<br>
As for Anakin, I can't for the life of me figure out why the hell Padme has any attraction to this psychotic, unstable, stalker that Anakin is in this movie. The only things I can come up with are she's scared to death of him if she says no (he did massacre a bunch of sand people) or maybe she just likes psychotic, unstable, stalker types (although that goes against everything else built into her character). Personally, I think the movie would have made more sense if they just dumped the whole love story all together and had Luke and Lea be born by something as stupid as &quot;an itch&quot; that they both have. &quot;Oh, well, we're going to die anyway and I don't want to die a virgin!&quot; (well those lines were basically in the movie anyway)<br>
<br>
And, I can't seem to get past the Yoda fight scene without laughing through the whole thing once he starts using his light saber. Was this intentional?<br>
<br>
In the end though, I was entertained by this movie and that is my goal when I see a movie. If I am entertained, then the movie does it's job. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yilanea>Yilanea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 2:46:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoTC</span><hr size=1> Ep I. better than Ep. 2, I think not, IMHO.

<br>
Luke's training on Degobah was similar in that it was not directly part of the main movie plot, and there were several scenes devoted to it.  But there were major differences.  There was a lot more done on Degobah than just Luke's training.  There was the introduction of Yoda, which was amusing and meaningful.  There was the fight in the cave.  There was Yoda using the force to get the ship from the swamp..  Basically what I'm saying is that the Training story was good.  <br>
<br>
If you don't want to make a love story interesting, if you just want to have a bunch of dialog that explains it, then don't devote several whole scenes to it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=banghichi>banghichi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 7:55:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.olywa.net/atd/hippie/banghi2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attack of the Clones:</span><hr size=1> i just could not get past the fact that there was this army of clones out there that _no one_ ordered (except some dingus who has been dead for ages and _never_ mentioned this big order to anyone, jedi council included) and they just say oh sure, we can use those. no one is the least bit suspicious about this. wtf?<br>

No, I'm referring to them actually calling someone 'The One' or 'The Chosen One'. And there's usually a prophecy predicting his/her arrival. Matrix had a solid science fiction concept, and then mucked it up by throwing in an oracle and prophecies about 'the one'.<br>

Prophecy never seemed to be very Star Wars-ish. Yes, they can forsee the future, but only in a limited way and it's obviously not very reliable (witness the Emperor).<br>

There's a whole range of fantasy/sci-fi that's not just a regurgitation of pulp works.<br>
<br>
I'd check out Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar books and Asimov's robot novels if you want to get two that are the antithesis of the above while still being highly influential classics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sanlear>Sanlear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1195<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 1:07:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ashborne.org/forum/avatar.php?userid=25&dateline=1035818918 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attack of the Clones:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'd check out Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar books <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'll second that.  I actually learned about Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser from reading a D&amp;D campaign book.

<br>
There's decades between movies, and not everything we know to be important later is important to the protagonists in the first trilogy. They should concentrate on making the first three a coherent narrative, something that's been sorely lacking so far.<br>
<br>
The most damning criticism I've seen of the original trilogy is that they only work as a sequel to the original three (i.e. you couldn't watch them for the first time in the &quot;proper order&quot; and get much out of it). The Yoda scene in Ep2 only works if you've seen &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; where he's an old cripple, likewise all the stupid in-jokes between the droids -- there's been no real attempt to set up who the returning characters are, and the films rely on the previous work to fill in the blanks for viewers. Bad movie making. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2605<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 2:06:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/neriakwraith.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attack of the Clones</span><hr size=1> You know what's erked me about the Prequels? That whole thing about Anakin being the one to bring balance to the force.<br>
Here's my thoughts on what balance to the force means:<br>
<br>
At the time that Episode I takes place, there are like 10,000 Jedi, and 2 sith. In order for the Force to balance itself out, it puts all it's &quot;good influence&quot; into the Jedi (All 10,000 of them). Then it puts all the &quot;bad influenece&quot; into the Sith.<br>
<br>
So, the Sith are inherently more powerful than the Jedi, because there are only two of them. There are 10,000 Jedi, so the &quot;good&quot; force is spread between all of them.<br>
<br>
Balancing the force basically means making the sides even. Vadar does that just fine between Episode III and Episode IV. When Episode IV takes place, there are only two (discounting all EU material) Jedi; Yoda and Ben Kenobi. <br>
There are only two Sith as well; Palpatine and Vadar. <br>
Luke doesn't really become force attuned until after Ben dies, which makes him a Padawan, which keeps balance at two on each side.<br>
<br>
The thing I find totally ludicrious, is the fact that the prophecy exists in Episode I, and the Jedi have no friggin clue what balancing the force means. They mention that there can only be two sith, yet the jedi are all over the place at this time. Talk about morons... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimstafftheurgist>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 6398<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/30/02 2:36:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23320.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grim3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Attack of the Clones</span><hr size=1> Its all been downhill since Empires Strikes Back.

Papatin (sp?) is obviously responsible for ordering the clones. Papatin is responsible for the robot army. He is the George Bush of politics. War = good for his career. Papatin creates the only situation that will give him powers he is not meant to have. This leads him to tranforming the Republic into the Empire. I thought it was brillant seeing how his plan came together. <br>
<br>
Things I was disappointed about: <br>
<br>
The force ending up just being a parasite.<br>
<br>
The whole thing where Anny's father is the force.<br>
