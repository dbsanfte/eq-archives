Go to Sebilis and see how many groups you can find that are shaman and wizard combos? Be realistic - this is not a question of which specific mob a wizard can kill with some particular other class, soloing or AE groups. I don't know what game you have been playing but in my server groups are camping some particular room and usually for hours and have to deal with wanderers and small trains in addition to local spawns. Of course, you may be lucky and burn a ton of peridots to kill some stuff without a tank but how PRACTICAL is that? <br>
<br>
No tank or cleric? In pretty much all group settings cleric makes sense just for Resurrect. Death without one on higher levels blows hours of that peridot burning fun away. And let us try not to say that you can get these from other players in the zone and clarity as well. Let's see the shammy and wizard do a CR from disco in Seb and rely on pestering others for C2 and Res.. yeah. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saradin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/01 10:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues, Wizards, and Damage</span><hr size=1> &quot;I've seen vox/naggy raids called off or fail because they didn't have enough wizards.

And where is the vox/naggy raid with no tanks?

<br>
Like Natan hinted, you are now arguing something completely different than the point of the sentence (you picked) of mine.<br>
<br>
You are arguing thinking I said the Wizard class sux or something. Which I am not (b/c I don't believe it). I am saying Wizards DO need tanks in raids ...and most group situations. Sure AoE groups and Soloing are exceptions. But since AoE groups are not common for everyone and the Wizard class is a 'group class' I am arguing based on that.<br>
<br>
Without a Tank in a XP grinding group or a raid situation it is going to be either really slow hunting or just plain not possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if you want to talk AoE groups: you need 1-2 other Wizards, 1-2 Enchanters ...and either... 1 tank (for pulling), 1 cleric (for heals and rezzes), or 1 more Wiz or Chanter.<br>

Even for wizards.<br>
<br>
A rogue fits nicely in that setting, he needs both of these classes and he is doing pretty nice damage for the group.<br>
<br>
A wizard fits in too, but does not provide as much damage over time.<br>
<br>
Both of the classes can benefit from an enchanter and/or a bard.<br>
<br>
The real problem is that if you already have a dungeon crawl core group (warrior, cleric and an enchanter) adding melee classes increases group's damage output much more than adding wizard. In a NORMAL xp group rogues stack pretty well if the warrior knows where his taunt button is and uses it. Wizards stack too, but stack of rogues will grind through more mobs in an hour. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umarktodd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MarkTodd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/01 11:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues, Wizards, and Damage</span><hr size=1> &quot;Wizards are second to none when it comes to casting powerful offensive spells.

One thing that is a source of irritation is when folks keep posting that bla,bla...is how such-and-such was originally intended.  <br>
<br>
Well, how would anyone know?  Do they work for VI?  Please don't drag out the original Wizard description or any hack-garbage from Beta. The class is intended as the designers make it, and evolves in the manner they hope for it to change, even if their intentions are stupid. In other words, it does not mean that their ideas don't suck, because many of them certainly do.  It just means that saying something is not how the makers intended, when the complainant is not the maker, is ludicrous. <br>
<br>
It's not that constructive criticism of VI's changes and designs cannot be helpful, but the constant negativity associated with a lot of these posts does more to hurt the Wizard class than help--talk about damage over time.  <br>
<br>
Many people accuse the more optimistic Wizards of having their heads in the sand, but I would assert clinging to some old moldy fantasy that some of these things are gonna be changed is the worst kind of denial. However, it definately does an effective job disuading people from wanting to make or group with a Wizard. I am not saying that other things might not be changed, but some of them are clearly closed cases--accept it.<br>
<br>
Some would argue that if it weren't for some of the massive flames and protests in the past directed at VI, that many of the good changes we have gotten would never have happened.  All I can say to that is, whatever in the world would give such people the idea that VI changed the things as the result of them? Rather narcisistic and egocentric, I would think.<br>
<br>
Futhermore, seeing the glass-half-full does not mean there aren't problems.  It just means that focusing on the useful aspects that are present and maximizing them can be a more effective means of change than the opposite. Quite frankly, human nature, and Nature itself,  tends to prefer to invest in the more successful concerns in life than in the lesser ones. Constantly presenting yourselves as failures and useless certainly is effective at fulfilling that. And just dropping in the qualifyer &quot;I'm not saying we are useless...BUT....&quot;  does not eliminate the erosion that overall negativity can have.<br>
<br>
I am very pleased to see several people stepping up and taking a more optimistic position, and am glad to hear stories of Wizard success, effectiveness, and new applications.  I am also glad to see many of the more depricating posts being moved to the Rants Forum (though some really positive and useful posts, particularly one about AoE that Beryl posted, got moved to Rants, wrongly I would suggest--that one really had to power to help some new Wizzys and inspire them, but perhaps that is being suppressed here?).<br>
<br>
At any rate, I will go back to happily and successfully playing my Wizard.  Yes, I will chime in with everyone of issues that seem reasonable to me and that should strongly be brought to VI's attention. But, if some of you insist on continuing to play by the Melee classes rules, then enjoy.<br>

I was talking about grouping, Grim.  I'm pretty sure the whole post was about the level of dependency melee types have on others in the group to do their job.  Wizards have very little dependency on their groups to do their job.  I often will tag along ungrouped with a other groups to sort of power them with free nukes just because I don't need those other guys to do what I need to do.  <br>
<br>
I didn't solo to 60 either.  Since about level 12 I had a regular or AoE group almost every day I played.  I only solo'd when I had to wait for them to log on.  But, I'm a wiz, not hard to bind where the group meets up and gate out to where I can solo.  This does two things that really helps wizzies.  First, I'm not just sitting around where I can be easily annoyed by people wanting ports.  Second, I am gaining exps almost all the time I'm online.  Just because I figured out a long time ago how to solo extremely well doesn't mean that's what I like to do.  I always group when I can.  In fact, after I made level 58, about a year ago, I pretty much quit soloing all together.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why you dislike epic wielding 60 level wizards.  I'd think you'd be more inclined to seek us out for ideas on how to get more out of the game.  Instead you try to beat us down with heresay.  Doesn't make any sense.  Oh well, hopefully other wizards will notice that maybe we have a better way to play the game and get past your sniping. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uellocopato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ellocopato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/01 6:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues, Wizards, and Damage</span><hr size=1> &quot;Called a team effort.

<br>
At some levels there are problems between wizard DD's and mage DD's, but who cares. The game isn't about being level 34-39 or where ever the problem lies. It's about what you put into it. The more you put into it, the more you get. Constant emails and posts to Verant do not count as what you put into the game. Log on and play.<br>
<br>
Before I was level 60, I would go on Hate raids for experience. Mainly because I was the only wizard in my guild that could gate up there. But while I was up there, I made a half a bubble of experience in 57 for example(Yellow, blue didn't exist back then). Oh yeah, I was solo up there too, groups are useless. I spent 215mana per mob and got at least 7 out of 8 kills. Whether this is still possible or not doesn't matter, I found a place where I could exploit my abilities and I used it.<br>
<br>
I would like Verant to increase our damage or decrease the mana cost on a lot of our spells, but it's not that big of deal. Ask yourself what the game means to you. To me it's not about experience, that was a one time thing and I got it out of the way as quickly as possible. It's not about loot, some does make us more efficient, but it's not needed to play the game. It's not about grouping, because the main purpose of a single group is to get experience and that's not important. The second purpose of a group is loot, and that's not important to me either.<br>
<br>
To me the game is about big raids and beating every challenge EverQuest has to offer and regardless of what you whining wizards think, we are useful for this. Pre-Velious, mobs hit points were maxed at 32,000. A group of wizards can do most of that, because our specialty is quick damage. In Velious, there are still some areas that could be adjusted (Although not every class is required to be useful 100% of the time), but in a single fight - with a single target - a single wizard did 44,000 damage. Tell me that's not contributing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 1328<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/01 9:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues, Wizards, and Damage</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm not sure why you dislike epic wielding 60 level wizards.&quot;<br>

That was not only rude, it was intentionally misleading.  Nowhere in my post did I EVER even remotely IMPLY that I didn't like epic-wielding level 60 Wizards.  What I DID say is that I was displeased with said epic-wielding level 60 Wizards who apparently forgot about the previous sixty levels and don't remember that not everyone has an uberguild, not everyone has a huge raid party around them to soak up aggro, and not everyone has level 60 spells.  Telling me you can drop x monster with a few Sunstrikes (as you said) is like telling a level 20 Wizards to stop bitching about Force Strike because Ice Comet is so good.<br>
<br>
Problems are problems at the level you face them, they are not solved by some remote single level that has x thing in it.  It's the same lame, stupid crap when people would say &quot;Wizards are fine, you can do 1000 damage with Ice Comet!!!!&quot;  Yeah... after 48 OTHER levels.<br>

&quot;I was talking about grouping, Grim. I'm pretty sure the whole post was about the level of dependency melee types have on others in the group to do their job.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, Beryl, lets look at the post you put up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can a 60 level rogue kill a blue? No. Can a 60 level wiz kill a blue? Yes, easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you were not referring to the Wizard soloing here?<br>
<br>
See, the point is, let's talk about grouping, not soloing.  That's the point, there are many Wizards here who are trying to pretend Wizards NEVER EVER need anyone around them, you can do it all alone!  A Wizard is the equal of a rogue/warrior/cleric!  And that is just not true, and you all know it.  Don't GO there.<br>
<br>
==============================================================<br>
<br>
&quot;One thing that is a source of irritation is when folks keep posting that bla,bla...is how such-and-such was originally intended. <br>
<br>
Well, how would anyone know? Do they work for VI? Please don't drag out the original Wizard description or any hack-garbage from Beta.&quot;<br>
<br>
We know becuase verant TOLD us what their intent and design was, in responses to our questions and emails and posts on message boards.  We aren't making this up, we are going on what we were TOLD by Verant.<br>
<br>
You don't like people talking about the description?  Too bad, the description was written to define and tell you what a class was like so when you created a character you'd have some idea what you were getting into.  See, the release didn't HAVE cheat and info sites everywhere with detailed spdat info on every spell.  You didn't even have full descriptions of spells in the book that came with Everquest originally, and it only went to level 29.  Your spells had a simple description on them: Mana cost, type of spell, name.  That tells you virtually nothing about the spells.<br>
<br>
So by looking through the book you saw a bunch of blasts (without the damage listed, resistance types, etc), a description that said MASTERS OF MAGICAL DAMAGE WITH NO RIVALS and MASTERS OF SEEKING KNOWLEDGE.  Gee, and people were stupid enough to think that might be true huh?<br>
<br>
Oh, and the reason people bring up Beta is that in Beta the Wizard class was a lot closer to that description than it is now.  In fact, they went too far making Wizards the masters of Magical Damage, it was absurd.  But the point is this: Verant had a design concept and class structure that they built and refined.  The original draft was too potent so they weakened it.  A lot.  Enormously.  To the point there are those idiotic levels like when Clerics can blast harder than Wizards, when Whirling Wind does nearly double the damage a Wizard blast does, that sort of thing.  Whether this was out of intent or being kind of sloppy and not looking closely at the other classes when they stripped Wizards back, I can't say.<br>
<br>
But the fact is, Verant tuned Wizards back heavily.  Then IN RESPONSE and INTENTIONALLY TO COMPENSATE for this, Verant gave Wizards sight spells and ports.  How do we know this?  Well GZ and others at Verant told us that was why we got the spells, and that this was the intent of the spells.  GZ also said the sight spells didn't work out like he inteneded and recognized ports don't help much in groups.  Further, with the release of Kunark and Velious, the evacs, the only grouping benefit of ports, were eroded to the point of being nothing (in Velious).<br>
<br>
This tells us two things:<br>
<br>
1) Verant thought Wizards needed compensation and something to balance the class.<br>
2) It didn't work.<br>
<br>
That leaves us with one conclusion:<br>
<br>
Verant intended us to be more balanced and needs to work on it, and they KNOW it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www,kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg BORDER=0> at: 5/22/01 7:30:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufazdaar00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fazdaar00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/01 9:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rogues, Wizards, and Damage</span><hr size=1> Umm, everyone of you who is saying that we don't need tanks and clerics to do our damage, try forming a single pull Sebilis group w/o a warrior, rogue, monk or cleric.

<br>
Exactly... who cares? No one, not even we - the WIzards - do care, we are 'fine and balanced and have oly some minor issues...&quot;<br>
<br>
WRONG!<br>
<br>
You are closeing your eyes and dreaming your dream. Unable to see the reality in the  misconception.<br>
We are far away from beeing fine and balanced, and we don't have minor issues we do encounter MAJOR issues, maybe unfixable.<br>
<br>
And again i have to agree... we don't have issues from level 39 to 44, we have issues from level 1 to 60, folks.<br>
<br>
We don't want to become like Merlin or Gandalf and no one of is seriously asked Berant to make us like them.<br>
<br>
But we should have a significant greater power output then any other nuking class and that is ot the fact at the moment.<br>
Our mana efficiency should be superior at ALL levels and that is as well not reality yet. And superior mean not by a difference of 0.1, heh.<br>
<br>
We should be able to KILL Mobs without major difficulty if the tank and the chanter is dead. But we can't. We should be the nuking life assurance to a group in trouble. But we AREN'T.<br>
<br>
That is the class definition... nothing else.<br>

There are a lot of places I won't even go with a group if both aren't present and in the case of the Enchantor not just because of the Clarity.  The reason they call them groups is because each member is at least somewhat dependent on the others. It almost seems like some of the people on this board believe that everyone else in a group should sit back while the mighty wizard casts one spell and destroys the mob. Try using some of your other capabilities and you might find yourself more useful than you seem to think you are now. <br>

Wizards are the gods of Kunark and Old World &quot;epic&quot; encounters, proficient soloers, horrible groupers, and excess weight in Velious.

In Solo:<br>
<br>
Wizards can out damage ANY rogue solo.  <br>
<br>
<br>
In groups though:<br>
<br>
Everyone compares Rouge damage with some uber weapon (Usually a ragebringer) but NEVER compares a wizard with their uber crap (Rend Robe, Concussion)<br>
<br>
Wizards are usually too timid to nuke in the beginning of a battle (Because the damn clerics never want to heal us that early)<br>
<br>
Grim, STOP using GZ as a comparison.  He no longer works for Everquest!  So he made a claim.  That's probably what got him fired off the team.  (Yah like Planetside is such a great game that he wanted to go there).  Now that you are stop using him as a meter, (That includes verant's promisies from the past)  Give us some good arguments why a Wizard with Rend Robe and Concussion CANNOT outdamage a Rogue with Ragebringer?  Hmm?<br>
<br>
More Mana is not the answer.  I happen to think that if could Chain Cast with no delay we would OWN the place!<br>

Well thought out and thorough post.....as usual. <br>
<br>
Somehow I believe that the uberguilded level 60 apologist, for whom no problem exist in the manner in which your post so capably illustrates, simply have forgotten what it was like being a lower level wizard or playing the game in a fasion that most do, ie, within &quot;normal&quot; grouping schemes and LFGing within those confines. <br>
<br>
Reminds me of a saying:<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Generals are those who vividly remember what it was like to be a private; Good Teachers are those who remember what it was like to be a student; Good parents are those who remember what it was like to feel the strength and blind and sometimes irrational power of youthful emotion&quot; <br>
<br>
Basically, these guys (The level 60 uberguilded Wiz variety), &quot;just don't remember.&quot; Of course not all uberguilded level 60s fall under one blanket, but there is an unfortunate and alarming trend here. <br>
