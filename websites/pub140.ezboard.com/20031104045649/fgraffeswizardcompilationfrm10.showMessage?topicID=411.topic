<br>
I’ve read a lot of posts complaining about how underpowered wizards are, and I’ve read a lot of the very reasonable replies by EverQuest staff explaining the delicate issues of class balance, maintaining group desirability, etc.  However, I’d like to point out some issues which I’m not sure anyone has addressed yet.  I would argue that the wizard class does have distinct disadvantages to other classes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first disadvantage is that wizards are entirely and completely dependent upon their mana.  You might not understand the significance of this at first, so let me explain.  Let us examine all the other casting classes (i.e. not warriors or hybrids).<br>
<br>
Clerics:  Clerics can get some very decent armor and can equip some quite nice weapons.  Even clerics that choose not to utilize their melee skills still have very nice AC and high HP, relative to casters that is.<br>
<br>
Druids:  Similar to clerics.<br>
<br>
Shamans: Similar deal, relatively high HP/AC/Combat abilities<br>
<br>
Enchanters:  Enchanters, while they, like wizards, have low HP and AC and negligible combat abilities, also have pets.  Even if their pets are not as magnificent as those of other classes just the existence of the pet is something.  A pet can take a fall while you run for the zone, or do some damage without burning mana.  And, of course, enchanters can have the best pets in the game by controlling mobs.<br>
<br>
Necromancers:  Necros have very low HP/AC/Combat abilities.  But, as we all know, they have excellent pets.<br>
<br>
Magicians:  Mages, of course, have even better pets.<br>
<br>
Its pretty easy to see that you can group these classes  into two groups:  fairly good melee abilities or pets.  Wizards, of course, fit in neither.  They have low AC, low HP, and negligible fighting abilities.  At the same time they lack a pet to make up the difference.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So what does this mean?  Well, picture yourself in a group, camping something or other, resting in between spawns, when suddenly your meditation is interrupted by some stupid greenie mob who decides that, even though you’re 20 levels higher than it, it might be a good time to attack since you’re sitting down.  What do you do?  Well, if you’re a warrior, hybrid, or priest class you beat it over the head a few times to teach it a good lesson.  If you’re an int caster, you send your pet after it, assuming for some reason your pet hasn’t already killed it.  So what do you do if you’re a wizard?  You have no pet, and you have no way to melee it.  You’re forced to nuke it.  So while everyone else is resting and meding you’re forced to burn half a bub of mana to kill a pathetic, weak creature.  I cannot even count the number of times this has happened to me.  Now, what do you do if two greens are attacking you?  Well, if your a wizard, there’s a good chance you won’t even be able to get off a spell.  That’s right, with two mobs hitting you you’ll most likely get interrupted every time and forced to run for the zone or call on your friends.  Remember, although the mobs are much lower level than you, wizards have very low AC and terrible Defense skill.   You might be able to get off a fade/shadowstep/yonder, but even if you do there’s no guarantee that they’ll take you far away enough to actually cast a spell that might be effective.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But there are other, more important implications of a wizard’s total reliance on his mana.  For one thing, it means much slower leveling.  A warrior/hybrid class can carve his way through four or five blues before having to stop to rest and heal.  A wizard, however, will have to med for a couple of minutes after each kill.  When each blue takes nearly half your mana (and believe me, it will.  Never underestimate the power of full or partial resists)  the sitting time is much greater for wizards.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now, one might well argue that this is the same for all casting classes.  Perhaps not necros or mages, who can send their pets off to melee very effectively, but certainly for the other casting classes.  Enc pets are not all that powerful (unless they charm something) and they would certainly have to burn and med a good deal.  Especially since they don’t have as good a mana/damage ratio as wizards.  And the wis casters, while they have decent HP/AC, certainly don’t have it as good as hybrids and will have to sit for a while after each kill.  This is a valid point, and I think it is something that must be addressed for other classes besides wizards.  I can understand why this might be, of course.  Some classes might level slower, but supposedly there are also greater rewards for leveling.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next let us examine the abilities of wizards in groups.  Firstly, lets get something straight.  Basically, wizards nuke.  That and evac is about all they can do.  They don’t really contribute much else to the group.  Now, there’s no problem at all with that.  Anyone who’s fought for a while can understand the value of a wizard.  When you pull more than you intended, or fear didn’t work, or something somehow went wrong, there’s nothing like having a wizzie around to burn off a few bubs of mana and take a few of the baddies down.  The ability to do gobs and gobs of damage in a few second is inestimably valuable.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The problem is this:  Wizards are a damaging class.  They are expected to do damage, lots of it, themselves.  Yet at the same time wizards have very low AC and HP.  What does this mean?  Well, it means wizards die.  It also reduces the effectiveness of wizzies in a group.  Wizards have to wait until the tanks have done enough damage before they nuke.  If they don’t the mob will aggro on them and they’ll be dead in a few hits.  The wizard class offers only direct damage to a group, yet they’re hopelessly limited in the actual amount of direct damage they do.  Many will talk about how wizards have the highest damage spells in the game, and the highest mana/damage ratio.  This is true.  The problem is that the damage a wizard can do is not limited by the spells they have, but by the realities of the game.  An attempt was made to solve this problem, it seems, with the damage absorbing skin line of spells.  However, when in groups usually you are facing higher level mobs who can take this shield out in one hit.  This is a problem unique to wizards:  Warriors and hybrids have enough HP to withstand an attack.  Wis casters, while they have less HP then hybrids, have enough to last a lot longer.  Mages and necros have pets.  Their pets do the brunt of the damage and the caster themselves are rarely in danger.  Encs, while their pets are not so amazing, are still better off.  Remember, they are not expected to do as much damage.  Their strengths lie in other areas;  they have much more to offer to a group.  Many groups actually prefer that an enc save his mana, especially when there area already plenty of able damage-dealers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So what are the solutions.  Many talk about the need for a larger mana pool, or some sort of mana regen spell or an item that casts Clarity.  This, of course, would create a class imbalance and its perfectly understandable why Verant refuses to do this.  Harvest is probably the closest we will  ever come to seeing wizards being able to expand their mana pool on their own.  However there are other, subtler ways Verant could make things easier for wizards.  One easy way would to be increase the skill cap, and the skill cap per level, on certain key abilities.  If evocation, channeling and alteration were higher per level, wizards would get much fewer resists and partial resists, allowing much more efficient use of mana.  There is certainly precedent; look at monks.  And while some might argue that this would give them too many advantages, remember that nuking is essentially all a wizard can do.  The same thing could be achieved by giving wizards a simple debuff spell.  I understand that people might think this overpowers wizards; after all, melee fighters often miss or hit for less damage.  But remember that in melee you can keep hitting until your opponent is dead.  Wizards only have so much mana to work with.  And when you spend 300 mana to deal 6 damage (and believe me, it happens), you’re going to end up running out. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another excellent solution would be to increase the meditate skill.  If wizards could meditate a just few points higher, perhaps an extra point every few levels, that would give them the competitive edge they need.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another solution might be to decrease the aggro caused by magical attacks.  This would allow wizzies to do more damage without fear of death.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, perhaps wizards could only expend mana proportional to the amount of damage their spells do.  If your spell that’s supposed to do 175 points of damage only does 4,  the mana consumed could reflect this proportion.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once again, these are small, subtle changes that would nevertheless immensely help out the wizard class.  As I’ve pointed out before, wizards are unique among the casters of Norrath. That is why they deserve special consideration.  I love playing wizards,  not only for their fun abilities but also because they’re fun to roleplay.  I would love to see wizards take their place among the other casters of EQ.<br>
<br>
This is all, of course, simply my humble opinion, which I proffer for consideration.<br>

<br>
A few of my issues  (excuse me for playing a bit of devil's advocate here):<br>
<br>
First, you seem to have 2 main points.  We cannot kill greens without mana use and the inability to sustain any real damage due to aggro'ing mobs during a fight.<br>
<br>
On the first point, I do not know how valid I would take this.  If I am in a group (as per your example) and some greenie aggro's me, then one of the melee's (non-pulling) has always killed it for me.  That way I CAN med since they do not have to do so.  Now if you mean when soloing, then Verant has already said they won't address soloing issues.  <br>
<br>
On the second point, I somewhat agree.  Yes, if we aggro badly, we die - period.  Which is why we are considered one of the hardest classes to play.  If you want an easy life, thousands of Druids can't be wrong.  Face it, most of us wizards are masochistic.  We like the uphill battle or we would have switched our class long ago.  Also, your example of a warrior having unlimited damage potential is flawed.  As was stated many times by Verant staff, Warriors(melee) and Clerics(healer) are a symbiotic relationship.  You would have to compare 2 wizards to a warrior and a cleric to get an honest picture of what one group can do over another.  In that comparison there is a limiting factor - the clerics mana.  And is a warrior misses a lot, then the clerics runs out of mana faster because the fight lasts longer.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the whole label of us being this, that or the other is part of the problem.  You know what I think I do best?  I make the whole party more efficient.  Because I can dump mana at will, it's not so much how much damage I am doing (though it should be competitive to other spell chuckers) but when I choose to nuke.  I have had many comments on how easy pulling became after I joined from other players throughout my levels.  Where before, things would vary between easy to oh crap - now it's a consistant flow, a rhythmn if you will.  <br>
<br>
Just my humble opinion...<br>
<br>
P.S. Don't think that I believe we are perfect, because we  do have issues.  I can't wait to see what our group enhancement will be as that is one our top issues.  <br>

I would, however, suggest that clerics are as dependent on mana as wizards.  They have better armor to help them sustain agro, but it only helps them solo at the very low levels but given a choice between plate and concussion... I'd take concussion hands down.  Clerics are extremely dependent on groups, but fortunately their skills make them highly desireable in groups.<br>
<br>
One change I would recommend, and am surprised Verant hasn't done this yet, is to reduce dramatically the agro caused by resisted DD's. This would at least put agro on the same terms as tank agro and inject some balance there.  In addition, it would actually require a bit more skill to play the high level wizard to it's potential. As it is now, it's rather formulaic as to the spacing between nukes to avoid agro, or the mix of concussion to nukes, etc.<br>

On many large raids I often get stuck in a caster only group with a necro or two, and if I end up with a healer in my party one goal is always to never need them.<br>

<br>
Yeah, Absor made the same mistake.  Clerics have spells that persist and help the group while they have no mana.  For example the symbol line gives hps to the party and even while the Cleric is totally out of mana, that symbol still contributes to the party members.  Their AC buffs are the same way.  In other words, they aren't as mana dependent as Wizards.<br>
<br>
However GROUPS are more dependent on the Cleric's mana than the Wizards.  Why?  Because healing is 100 times more efficient than blasting.  This is true in three senses.  First, a heal costs less mana for more effect than an equivalent level blast, especially Complete Heal, but true all levels.  However, more importantly, healing one tank that is being hit makes that tank able to deal his damage continuously, ignoring the beating he takes.  Meanwhile all the OTHER people attacking continue to attack with the heal keeping that one tank busy and focussed on by the monster.  Blasting lowers the life of the target but only that, it doesn't help anyone else do damage.  And lastly, nobody resists a heal. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufusionforcewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FusionForceWiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/01 2:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards Explained (hopefully)</span><hr size=1> I think Wizards should be thought of as a 3 pearson group.<br>
