Exactly.<br>
See what i miss here? That they do some little, little effort to fix stuff that they overnerfed. That they show, that they care.<br>
They do all kind of more or less usefull and funky stuff on test, but they seem not even to realize that they overnerfed Manaburn.<br>
There is no official statement. Even something along the lines 'Well, you think we overnerfed it, but team Devs team likes it as it is now' would be a little evidence that they care for the customers.<br>
It's called feedback. Feedback from THEIR side, that i miss here.<br>
<br>
Instead, Absor goes to the Druid board and asked them, what an allmost prefect and overbalanced class wants to see changed. (Not saying he should not do it, but what about stuff that is really broken now?)<br>
<br>
Maybe it's because of the Wiz community though. Whenever someone comes here and asks and cares about obviously broken stuff or missing stuff (like the missing cold based big bang, not talking about clearly overpowering requests that are silly), some naysayers show up, call them whiners, bitter, 'go change your class, if you don't like it', 'dead horse' or try to become even more blunt and things like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mythal>Mythal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 4:00 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> My biggest problem with MB as it is now is that I feel I was misled. <br>

When SoE announced that they were going to change MB, and mentioned what those changes would be (i.e. 1 minute timer), I chose to put the re-imbursed points back into MB. <br>
<br>
Not once, however, did they mention (or acknowledge, after the fact) the damage cap, or the removal of Crits, or the fact that ID items would no longer affect MB.<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes, true, only now it's just Sony, and a nearly everyone that was originally part of everquest as Verant is gone. And while some at Sony may think 6 wizards taking down a Kunark dragon was ok, 12, 18, 24 or however many wizards, taking down gods was not a good thing. <br>
<br>
I'm sure manaburn teams would have PLd wizards up and full of AA's and then start auctioning of raids to get flagged. If Manaburn hadn't been nerfed, guilds would have  been in the Plane of Time in half of the time it took. <br>
<br>
As for making some mobs able to resist Manaburn, that wasn't going to happen, because the idea behind it was that it was a mob couldn't resist it. If new mobs suddenly had started resisting Manaburn, there would have been a huge outcry of unfair. <br>
<br>
To also be fair, blame goes to Verant too. The always seemed to think in terms of &quot;This is the ultimate expression of this classes powers.&quot; Which is why you get clerics that can Complete heal for 10k at level 39, when no one at level 39 could even dream (even to this day) of having 10K hit points. Even with PoP where the cap on warriors HPs was raised to 12k, many level 65 warriors only come close to having 10k hps. Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling for a cleric nerf. But lowering CH from 10k to 7.5 hardly hurt them. <br>
<br>
Verant seemed to believe in the carrot before the donkey way of getting characters to play. The good rewards come when you reach the top level for your class. The best spells, mobs drop the best equipment. When they did come out with expansions, it was the same thing. The better gear is in the new expansion, to get you to go there. <br>
<br>
Sony thinks of this as a business, and a cash cow, and rightly so. I have no problem with them thinking like that. It's a business and a form of entertainment. There is no humanitarian reason for them to do this. And because they are thinking that this is a business, they are looking down the road. That is why there are all these new dungeons, and expansions, in the last year. You need product to keep a publics interest. And, unlike Verant, they seem to be interested in actually fixing things. Sure, some of those were doors. But Verant always came across as, &quot;Oh Well&quot;. <br>
<br>
Still, with as gimped manaburn is now, we really need something new. Or at least, a partial return of how it used to be.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 6:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember Manaburn?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Please stop repeating the crap that low level bards were brainwashed into believing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

I'm not repeating anything from a board.<br>
<br>
I play on FV, the refuge for those long term players that remember the &quot;good old days&quot;. I started on FV. Not everyone one there is a good old days. But you run into alot of them, who tell you they came to that server to get away from the problems of over crowded servers.<br>
<br>
And people talk, and people exaggerate. But generally, there it a core of truth to what they say. When they tell me something like, I had a level 60 wizard with maxxed mana burn and me and 3 other wizards could burn down anything in seconds, I tend to think, more like you and 6 other wizards. That the bending of the truth is how mana wizards were there, not them doing it.<br>
<br>
Just like when people say &quot;On my old server, I was in an uber guild and we held so and so spawn for a week.&quot; I bet they did. Some people just like to brag about how much of a dick they used to be.<br>
<br>
And <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wizards have never been shy about three things, being able to get anywhere fast, and being able to nuke down mobs fast, and being able to quad for lots of XP. Some brag and strut around and it's bound to piss people off. <br>
<br>
My point is, we drew to much attention to ourselves, because wizards really are a great class. I'm not saying the best class, but one of the better ones. I've played other classes, and I always return to my wizard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 899<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 7:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember Manaburn?</span><hr size=1> How about giving the Wizard community a warning shot?

The out of the blue way it was handled was just BAD.  I didn't even have MB when it was nerfed.  The nerf made wizards look bad (like we were all stealing content), and that also wasn't fair.<br>

It has been long enough now, that they need to revisit MB.  Read some of these posts.

HT/Lifeburn are far more useful.  They dont have the crippling effects.  Risk of lifeburn drawing low hp aggro was just fixed with the patch of June 11.   Yet they leave manaburn alone.   <br>
<br>
If the argument is that wizards can manaburn team down dragons.   Today, high level necromancers can SOLO kunark dragons.    Only one I have not heard of soloed is Gore.   So that whole line of argument is moot.<br>
<br>
What is sad is that wizards should beyond a shadow of a doubt rule in burst DPS.   Manaburn is inline with this intent.  Wizards at near full mana can use manaburn for 9492 damage cap with no other wizard able to use it on a given mob for 1 minute.   Yet lifeburn uses no mana and is continually used on most large encounters by necromancers.  Similar to HT with 6K+ damage per use.   I see SKs using HT during most major encounters also.   Also, there is does not seem to be the one minute stacking logic built in either.<br>
<br>
Given the current state of Lifeburn/HT and the fact that Kunark dragons are now soloed,  and finally wizards should lead all other classes in burst damage, manaburn needs a great deal of its applicability restored.<br>
<br>
At a minimum, the mana useage of this should be greatly lowered so that its cost is inline with the lifeburn/HT counter parts.   Keep in mind that both of these classes can easily FD off any risk of its uses too.  <br>
<br>
-- If crit is not restored to manaburn and the damage cap remains -- cost of mana should be zero.  Given the relative state of Lifeburn/HT I believe this is justified.<br>
-- If crit is restored and damage cap remains -- manaburn should cost mana at a 4 dmg/ 1 mana ratio.   This would cost the wizard about 2400 mana at the current damage cap.   So not an insignificat cost at all.  If the dmg/mana ratio were worsed -- how would it be inline with the lifeburn/HT counterparts?<br>
-- If the crit is restored and the damage cap goes -- It should use all mana.<br>
<br>
All of the above proposals leave the 1 minute restriction in place which does not exist for either the lifeburn/HT counter parts.  Given that wizards should be masters of burst damage -- what would be wrong with this?<br>

If all flags are of this nature (Massive adds and scripted events), then no, more then likely, you won't have MB teams holding raids to get people flagged.

That's kind of like deciding to beat your kid unconscious because he'll cry if you tell him to go sit in a corner.<br>
<br>
The problem with wizards is that we are smarter and more organized than most other classes.  The only way to counter the superiority of the wizard players is to unfairly weaken our class and limit the options available to us, thus removing our threat.<br>
<br>
If you think I'm wrong, ask yourself if manaburn was made to stack again, would wizards be killing Kunark dragons again? Yes? Then why aren't other classes who have that power to do the same, organizing kill groups?<br>
<br>
Wizards have been reduced to nothing more than player controlled DoTs.  All our other abilities have been slowly destroyed over the past expansions.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you pulled a mob, I was the main puller for my guild all the way through ToV until they nerfed Eye of Zomm.  How about port spells, I don't think I've cast anything other than teleport/exodus/abscond for months... PBAE? Quad Kiting? Roots? Snares? Stuns? Rains? Lures?<br>
<br>
Maybe some people still find usefulness in these spells, but you can't deny that they've lost a lot of their former glory.  Has any other class lost so much, and gained so little?<br>
<br>
Well, I hear those that whine about whining, in the distance... Despite all we have suffered, we are still superior to every other class... don't let those druids who accidentally clicked the [Wizard] button keep you down.<br>

If you think I'm wrong, ask yourself if manaburn was made to stack again, would wizards be killing Kunark dragons again? Yes? Then why aren't other classes who have that power to do the same, organizing kill groups?<br>

I've personally never stopped killing Kunark Dragons since the nerf. I do it just for the rush. With Pop abilities and spells I can now <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SOLO</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> these dragons. 7k Wizard, with resists from hell, and Dragons are dumb. Dragons try casting on you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A LOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, when they are casting, they aren't hitting you. You just gotta play smart. If you're not confident enough to take on a dragon solo, go get another 65 wizard and dual team him. Example : Gore dies within 30 seconds to two Strike Of Sol wizards.<br>

Not entirely true. It really depends on how you play a wizard. It comes down to do rapid damage with knowing your limits on your aggro.<br>

When was the last time you pulled a mob, I was the main puller for my guild all the way through ToV until they nerfed Eye of Zomm. How about port spells, I don't think I've cast anything other than teleport/exodus/abscond for months... PBAE? Quad Kiting? Roots? Snares? Stuns? Rains? Lures?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I've actually done a lot of pulling, I do a lot of xlocs for people I know, ports, and killing mobs fast. I admit I haven't done PBAE in a long time but I'd much rather quad in the plane of fire for Experience. <br>
<br>
Quadding - I do this all the time in Fire - not as much anymore since I maxxed my AA's but I still do it to help powerlevel guildmates. 72% AA exp from a quad is no laughing matter.<br>
<br>
Root/Snares - I root and snare a lot in certain elemental planes during the raid. One of the prime examples is Plane of Earth, the rock ring. I'll snare as many mobs as I can and get aggro on them till the chanters can mez them (People know what I'm talking about if I'm there)<br>
<br>
PBAE - Plane of Earth and Plane of Water - You guys know what I'm talking about if you are there.<br>
<br>
Rains - If you're not already casting rains on boss's then you really should try. I use rains all the time. Casting for example Tears of marr, then casting ADOI and Ice Spear = HUGE DPS with very little aggro as compared to ONE Strike of Sol Cast.<br>

Wizards actually gained a lot in Luclin and Planes of Power. Ask people in my guild how I do experience, how I kill things, do things, etc. They'll simply tell you... Tell gemlin F'Gemlin!<br>

<br>
Burn teams did sometimes abuse of their power but if you dont like that go over to some high guild bords and see what has been hapening lately (9 triton recently ganked Ikitar in ToV, plz dont comment on the rest of the post or the situation surrounding the event) VS has been soloed by necros. Basically the oneshot killness of MB is no longer unique. <br>
<br>
Like everyone else (or nearly) has said give us back Crits and get rid of Dmg cap, its silly we can SoS crit for 6k+ eazy at the cost of a grand 600mana (10%mana pool) yet also have the option of using 100% of our mana to do 9.2k ......... something is not right.<br>
<br>
Oh and MB can help &quot;claim&quot; encounters, tho if there is substancial evidence it was yours first /petition (those GMs and Devs have to be someware dont they)<br>
<br>
As for not most of the playerbase reading/posting here then: &quot;good call&quot; to you, a good bit of the MB comunity back then was also part of the graffe readers/posters community, and if we assume that the existance of one graffe person &quot;clense&quot; the team than i belive that upwards 95%+ of the MBteams were acounted for. <br>
<br>
well thats my thougts<br>

I don't even have a clue as how child beating could even an a metaphor to this. <br>
<br>
Manaburn is unresistable. If instead of nerfing it the way they did, (and I think the way they did it was bad) and instead made some mobs able to resist or be immune to manaburn, then people would have been upset (maybe not to this extent) about it.<br>
<br>
And also, that would mean Sony would have to go back as say well, Manaburn is MOSTLY unresistable. Save those mobs we don't want you to manaburn.

Since the majority don't have access to Elemental planes, and much of what Gemlin posted can be done by other classes, are you so sure that you are the one that that is 'in touch'?<br>
