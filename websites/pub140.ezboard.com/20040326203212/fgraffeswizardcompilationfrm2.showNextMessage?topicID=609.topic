It didn't take long to get the 4 toes to start it off, nor the 10 heads for shawl #2. When it came to shawl #3 I spend time getting my baking up, which it's now 135. I then gathered all the ingredients, including the hellish 4 Snow Griffin Eggs. I immediately began baking and everything was going great till i discovered I needed a Pot and a Pie Tin ... then I learned those only come from players DOH!. So I hault everything and begin working on pottery... heck I need that for shawl #4 anyway. In about an hour I was at 122 in Pottery. I then went to make the pot... hmmm I need Metal Bits ... which unfortunately comes from someone with smithing skills. So again I halt and take that up to make some bits. When I finally got some, I made the Pot and Pie tin then returned to Thug to complete the Baking part of the quest... what a pain in the ass that was.<br>
<br>
When I got to the Snow Griffin Soufle, I FAILED!!!<br>
<br>
This is such BULLSHxT! A 135 in baking and I can't make the thing??? Graffe has it in his guide that it's trivial at 117, thats plainly not the case anymore. (graffe you need to change your guide, others have reported failure's in the mid 130's as well)<br>
<br>
I am so frustrated at the time I have WAISTED on this quest... quests are suppose to be fun, this one IS NOT. I don't have alot of time to play in the evenings and the thought of gathering 4 more eggs just isn't worth the time.... it sure as hell isn't fun anymore.<br>
<br>
Screw the Dorfs, Screw the Shawls, Screw Verant for making such a time consuming and yet frustrating quest.<br>

It will take you a LOT more effort at 47 to even get though part 4 than when I did it at 60 (of course).<br>
<br>
My point is, level yourself young wizard, then you will have time to do things like these. This quest is for high level (read:60's) for something to do while not raiding. <br>
<br>
You think 3rd part is tough? Try getting all the way through 7 (I did). BUT, I can tell you it is the most rewarding piece of loot I wear and I have some nice stuff. That is because I made it from my own hands.<br>
<br>
Give it up now and go level. Levels for a wizard is what matters in the cold, harsh world of Velious anyway. Now go kite some Ulthorks!<br>

Yes, the snow griffs are WAY too hard for their level to kill, but I spent a couple of hours the other day, got my eggs, tried the combine, failed.  Spent 6 hours the next day, got my next four eggs, combined(no skill increase since the last time), and it was trivial, combined it, got third shawl.  Moved on to pottery, which I had been working on between griff hunts, got it to around 130 or so, then went off to Velketor's for some XP hunting, got the supplies, combined, failed on the combine.  The fourth is a bit easier than the third for components, so I had enough for three attempts on me.  Second combine worked, fourth shawl done.  Now, next, to get the strands of crystaline thread.  Tailoring skill of 34, tried it, failed, kept hunting in Velketor's for XP, got more threads, and silks, ok, try again, fail, third attempt, one strand done, combine the silks(trivial) to make swatches, and try to make some crystaline silk items, still havn't gotten a single combine on those(they trivial up in the 102-131 range depending on item), but I've gotten three of the strands made so far, and still going.<br>
<br>
Now, if you JUST want to work on shawl 5, you can do this easier in Crystal Caverns, but if you are looking to get some XP and progress on shawl 5 is an added benefit, then do that.  I do NOT recomend Velketor's for XP hunting for those less than level 48 or so, you will have a hard time getting groups on many servers at this point, and the mobs have over 4000 HP, and hit fairly hard(upwards of 80 damage/hit). <p>Targonis Manastorm<br>

We are very un uber and in a lil guild of our own making so we don't have phat l00ts or epics. But this is the one quest you can do to 4th stage if you have one friend who's done it already. For shawl 3 take a tracker to find the mobs needed (have friend with baking skill loot eggs, then he can do all the baking and turn in the cooked stuff while you turn in napkins, etc.) or, better yet, if someone is willing to give up their seal, you multiquest. No baking needed at all. Person hands in their seal, you hand in shawl 2, you get shawl 3 and seal. For fourth shawl if friend has done it, go to CC, get the velium right quick, have friend with brewing skill get note and turn it in, you turn in shawl 3, you get shawl 4. Now shawl 5 I will have to wait til i can do, but having a 4 int shawl until then is not a bad deal at all. <p>              <img src="http://eonwethewizard.homestead.com/files/sig.jpg" border="0"

Gee guess what, I have done all those quests... and alot more you failed to mention. They were all fun and I enjoyed doing them, heck I've even helped others complete their quests as well. I like Questing, it's mostly alot of fun... and I'd bet I've done more than you.<br>
<br>
What bothers me is after spending a tremendous amount of time to gather the components, and to build skill levels to the point the final combines are trivial, to still fail. People have complained about this same thing with respect to the monk epic quest... guess what, Verant fixed it. How would you feel if there was a chance of failure with the precious JBoots quest... and you actually failed at it? Well guess what, I spend 2x the time to gather griffin eggs for this quest than I did to kill the AC in Sro (did BOTH quests solo). See I'm not one of these teenager players who can shrug off playing for 8 hours straight per night... I am married and have a child, I get maybe, an hour and a half to play this game. That translates into weeks to gather components for this quest.<br>
<br>
Tell you what, if you fail a couple of times at the soufle (with baking at trivial levels for it), come back here and tell me how much fun you think this quest is. Other people out trying to collect their first 4 eggs will just love the competition you bring while trying to get 4 more... I know as I collected 12 of the $#%@$ things and I got more than a few angry tells from people who knew how many I had taken, which made their quest harder and more time consuming.<br>

There are few alternatives, and fewer that have int or mana on them. I'd still be wearing a Frozen Mantle at level 53 if not for the prayer shawl. The first 2 are jokingly easy to get, and the 3rd is a darn nice item for the time invested, plus you get a little something for your range slot.<br>
<br>
Failure is a part of tradeskills. Failing occasionally on obscenely trivial recipies is a part of tradeskills. It's frustrating when it happens with hard to find ingredients, but you need to suck it up since you cannot escape it. Fortunately, it's pretty rare when your skill is high enough. Out of people with skill 135 who try to make the Snow Griffin Soufle, about 1 in 20 will fail on the first try. Only about 1 in 400 will fail on the first 2 tries. Those aren't bad odds and I'm sorry that they bit you, Danenel.<br>
<br>
Now that you're over the Snow Griffin Egg hump, the 4th shawl is very easy to get. The imgredients aren't too rare and the skill is incredibly easy to raise. Don't go after the 5th if the 3rd made you angry, since it's about 48 thousand times harder by my math, and they keep getting worse.<br>
<br>
baking = easy as pie<br>
tailoring = hard as all get out<br>
<br>
My new answer for when someone asks about the fastest way to raise Tailoring for the 5th shawl quest is this:<br>
<br>
Max out with your guild trainer, do Raw Silk Masks till 36, Cured Silk Masks to 82, Quivers to 115, Crystalline Silk to 131, Wu's Fighting Armor to 158, and take your chances at that skill level even though the 6th and 7th shawls won't be trivial. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   To speed this process up, you can level a Necromancer, or perhaps a Magician, to 50 first</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and have him gather all the ingredients for your skill ups. <p>Zwobu &lt;Trade Foundation&gt; Innoruuk<br>The first against the wall when Dmitry's revolution comes.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umcdermit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mcdermit</A> at: 7/19/01 12:22:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udanenel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Danenel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/19/01 3:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Screw Shawl Quests</span><hr size=1> mcdermit, Thanks for the humorous post... it made me feel better.<br>

Actually i was 134 for first attempt, 142 for second. And when I tried the 3rd, I sat there making Rat Ear pie's, trivial at 142 for about 10 minutes... but still failing about 1 out of 10 attempts if you can believe it. I kept going until I felt good about recognizing the failure cycle and when it was about to happen. Shortly after a failure all of a sudden it hit me, try it NOW so in went the 4 eggs and spices and wala... soufle.

My poor luck with this trade skill thing makes me very very leery of going past 4th shawl (my pottery is already around 125 or so, so I might do 4th shawl). <br>
<br>
This original thread was created a while ago... I've since put it all on hold,  and been putting in effort to get to 49 and Ice Comet. I got through 47 in about a week and should hit 49 after another week (this sunday for sure). I will then help a few guildees do their Tempflux staffs and after that I'll rethink doing 4th shawl.<br>

Led a guild for so and so amount of levels, quested for a hell of a lot of stuff for guildmates in that time, yadda yadda yadda. You dont want to hear it, I dont want to talk about it.<br>
<br>
It was dumb luck, though, that made you do it...and its not that YOU have bad luck, or that the quests are stupid...it was just a total fluke that you failed twice in a row. No ones fault. Coming ranting isnt going to do anything about it and I just was pointing out my opinions about the quests.<br>
<br>
Anyways...the aboves kind of offensive too, now that I re-read it...try not to take it that way. I've gotten into a couple squabbles on various message boards and I hate it, so...sorry, again. I shouldnt have assumed, and I shouldnt have posted mild attacks against you. So, I re-wrote my last post.<br>

Dude, these quests are uber. It intrigues me that someone with as little COOKIES as what your BAKING had the strength to make a CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE at all. Maybe it was for the COOKIES.<br>
<br>
Anyways, level 40 and have 2 CHOCOLATE CHIPS...tradeskills were easy. Already have two and a half backpacks of the NUTS needed for the 5th COOKIE, gotten from a high level guildmate who would just destroy the stuff anyways (and destroyed a backpack of it just to make room in his bank, though he was sorry, he says it was necessary) If I fail on the COOKIES...I'll just try again. And you'd better belive that at level 40 they're a lot harder to get at level 47.<br>
<br>
I love EATING COOKIES..got CHOCOLATE CHIP, SUGAR, HERMIT, RAISIN, and a lot of fun out of EATING them. Pity youR COOKIES FAILED, your really missing GOOD COOKIES.<br>

     There is absolutely no reason why anyone should have to spend hours searching for a snow griffin (F-ing druids) only to have it not drop an egg.  One egg in 15 kills is unacceptable.  And then to have it fail at a 135 baking skill . . . anyway you cut it thats just plain wrong.  How absolutley punishing to the casual gamer.  I'll even suggest how to fix it:  EVERY TIME YOU KILL A SNOW GRIFFIN IT SHOULD DROP AN EGG.   <p>Torcer Arcana<Br>Level 54 Wizard<Br>The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/25/01 8:47 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Screw Shawl Quests</span><hr size=1> Do all of you realize how difficult it is to get a flowing thoughts item through combat?  Let's see, kill Yelinak, or Tormax, or Cazic Thule.....hmmmm, seems that with mobs as difficult as those, it might make ANY flowing thoughs item UBER.  And that's the point.  When we say the shawl is uber, we are talking about step 7.  Since you can work your trade skills up with other things(not just working on the quest), you need to look at doing steps 1 through 7, and judge how difficult it would be, not any individual part.  <br>
<br>
So, looking at just steps one through 4, we have 4 giant toes, 10 heads, 4 snow griff eggs, 2 bunny meats, some ulthork meat, and some tundra kodiak meat, then a Thurgadin gate potion.  That's not all THAT hard if you get the help of a tracker for shawl 3, hell, ANYONE can do this with friends.  A level 5 twink could potentially get shawl 4.  Would it be uber if level 5 twinks could get it(melee twinks is a seperate discussion).  So, part 5, tons of threads, tons of silk for the combines, the 5 shardwurm bile.  Yea, part 5 is tough enough to earn some extras besides one more point of AC, int, wis, and cold resist, so, charisma and fire resist isn't a bad upgrade.  Part 6 and 7 adds enough extras where they are worthy of the increased difficulty.<br>

Yeah... Seeing as my guild can't own any mob on a regular basis that can randomly give me a FT1 item, whereas they are capable of grouping in SG and Kael to finish up shawl 7, this quest is worthwhile to me.  I started working on this quest around L45 or 46, poking at it from time to time inbetween my other stuff.  I just got shawl 6 recently, at L56.  The Tailoring.  Tailoring is the real bitchy part, everything else will seem relatively easy once you get over the tailoring hump. <p><BR>Cabot Coriolis of Tholuxe Paells<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=branaman>Branaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 288<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/28/01 9:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Screw Shawl Quests</span><hr size=1> Tailoring 104 now. <br>

and i need to loot 30 more crystal silk threads and 1 more glowing bile.<br>
<br>
In the mean time i think that level 50 is a nice level to spent in Velketors Lab on crystal spiders.<br>
<br>
So will level 51 be spent in kael Drakkal for the components needed there while working on CoV faction. And once that gets High enough i will go to CS for level 51/52 and get my shawl items from there. <br>
<br>
This way i pick up alot of quest items while getting some xp at the same time. <p><center><img src="http://home.soneraplaza.nl/qn/prive/ja.wensveen/Branaman2.jpg" width="500" alt="" border="0" align="center"><br><table><tr>

Shawl 6 could be done by just about anyone in the 51+ range for the parts, and if you have a full group, you could probably get it in your 40s.  Mob difficulty, or even getting the siren hair in CS is fairly easy.  Getting your tailoring up to 157+ is a royal pain since you can't buy the components needed for tailoring.  Just getting the crystaline silk needed to get to 131 tailoring is a royal pain.<br>

You should be able to get all the components you need and finish a quest.  There should never be an instance where you have to do the quest over compleletly because of something completely beyond your control.  But that's what makes the item so uber.  Like an uber mob, this is an uber quest.  It takes a lot of determination and patience to get the reward, and only some people have the patience for it.  I have never ever seen another player on my server with the 5th shawl, even though I know many have it. That's because it's so rare.  However, being on RZ, most wizards my level have the exact same no drop gear.  Acumen mask, runescale or mystic cloak, tishan's kilt, warren or guardian robe, etc.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=637.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=637.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=637.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=637.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=637.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=637.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=637.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
