Then they won't matter in any case either, but it is still penis envy. If you really think people will care that much, use Ice Comet. But other than that, there is really no point because Draughts are in fact better than that Mage nuke you think people will be drooling over. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Makes sense to me to show them.  I never understood why I can see right down to the single health point of damage of every melee swing that I choose to, and can't see magical damage.  Either make it where players can see all damage, or no damage.  I never knew why they deemed it ok to see melee damage but not magical.<br>

I d prefer if they dont show and other damage during fights but a sum of each player at the end of fights. Means no more agro on anyone of raid ie Warrior X did 24.000 Dmg, Wizard Y did 190.000 Dmg ... ... (Maybe limit it to the top 10 or top 20 or just configurable).<br>

The aggro you get is based on the spell you cast, not the damage it actually does. Resists and crits don't affect how much aggro you gain. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

While it's not all bad, but  Wizards could use a bit of distance from the competition for group spots.  Draught damage may be all kinds of efficient, but most of the line does not distiguish itself from everyone else except in cast time and efficiency.<br>
<br>
I find it a bit tragic that for all that get nukes, Druids are the ones that get a big nuke that actually approaches a draught in mana efficiency, and Ice Comet in damage.<br>
<br>
But, the above is what people will look at when they see nuke damage shown.  Why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> invite a wizard to a group when a mage can nuke harder and have a pet?  Why Bother with a Wizard when a druid nukes within 100 points of our biggest, more efficiently, with similar cast time, and can DS/Heal/Buff?  Never mind it's a fire spell that they claim is resisted--though they get several fire debuffers to go with it.  Hell, even a second cleric is looking like a good alternative when you ignore cast time, you get the stuns, the roots, extra healing, and the fun of watching clerics argue over which heals are best to use when and where...  And that Necro tap is awesome, could be argued that it too has a 3.4 ratio, as the effect is doubled with an equal amount of healing.<br>
<br>
What's really sad about the above list is that most of the nukes are not really far apart, but all those that do excel are the ones left without groups traditionally.  Shaman, enchanters, and clerics usually can get groups pretty easy.  Wizards, Druids, Necro's and Mages have long had problems getting groups, and if you look at terms of what's offered, other than pure burst dps, we offer little in comparison.<br>
<br>
The point is that DPS is not considered group friendly.  Those that are good at it are left in the cold on groups, except rogues who never slow groups down to med.  Coupled with our undistiguished damage, showing the spell damage will suck 51-59 with the average playerbase. <p><br>

<br>
You are right, Wizards are in dire need of AE DT to keep up with the damage that other classes can do. Oh, and it should crit too.<br>
<br>
All classes have pluses and minuses. Wizards are set up to do a large amount of damage fast. All your complaints seem center around the fact that this apparently not what you want to do, you just want to show off how big your nukes are.<br>
<br>
&gt;I find it a bit tragic that for all that get nukes, Druids are the ones that get a big nuke that actually approaches a draught in mana efficiency, and Ice Comet in damage.<br>
<br>
You can pretty much complain about anything I guess. You do realize that you are complaining that Druids get a nuke as big as one you got 10 levels before they got theirs right? And that it is 1 level before you can pick up Ice Spear?<br>
<br>
Sorry, but this is pretty much how most of your arguments about nukes look to me. You complain about other classes even when it is easy to show what you have is superior. You complain because other people might percieve them as having something better than you. And then you launch into a long rant that in reality has nothing to do with nuking at all.<br>
<br>
Showing nuke damage won't solve any problems, and it won't show any problems, mostly because wizard damage is pretty much the best at most levels, especially when you only consider classes at a similar level. The class has weaknesses as well as strengths. If all you ever do is concentrate on the weaknesses and ignore any strengths, you will never be happy. That is pretty much what I see here. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Nothing.  Though Wildfire is 10 levels above Ice Comet, its the first spell in ANYONES line up to come close, and for Ice magic, they get an upgrade that is competive even at 60.  It's not Ice Spear, but it's not crap either.  I just thought that a class like Druid, who's main function isn't nuking, should have such a high quality nuke is odd when you consider others might be a little more needfull of the #2 nuke slot.  Not that it matters, Druids aren't really getting into groups much easier than us anyway.<br>
<br>
Ice Comet is the largest nuke that a wizard gets till level 59.  I stated that the picture changes at 60.  My point is that with damage being reported, that's what people are going to see.  They aren't going to go &quot;Wow, that wizard can cast twice as many times as that mage over there&quot;, nor will they say &quot;wow, it seems like the casting animation barely gets started before his nuke lands&quot;.  And the vast majority of the player base certainly isn't going to start parsing and go &quot;Wow, I didn't realise it, but wizards really do alot more damage than anyone else, despite some other classes commonly using bigger nukes, and most others using nukes nearly the same size.&quot;  They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> say &quot;wow, when a wizard wants too, he can dish some serious damage, wonder why he never uses his good nuke&quot;... You'd be surprised how much of the population does not have carnal relations with a calculator or parse their every keystroke for maximum efficiency.  They just go with what they see, and what they will see is a damage number.<br>
<br>
I just pointed out that although wizards with a billion AA, 63+ may look good, those of us stuck in the 50's are gonna have to suck it up for a long time before we even begin to see that 'Balance' that supposedly exists, and that perhaps with it being that visible, something might get done to actually set wizards apart.<br>
<br>
Though for once I'm glad to see an actual idea come from you Qaman.  AE deathtouch may be a bit overbalanced, but at least your are contributing positively. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><br>

Perhaps you could come up with a contribution other than whining about how lacking Wizards are in nuking. Sorry, but telling you that you are dead wrong about things is not the same thing as negative, and it doesn't mean you have made any positive contributions. It just happens that you focus on the area where we are pretty much the strongest, declare it a weakness somehow and demand it be changed to your satisfaction. If you would perhaps spend a little effort working in an area where the class is weak, I might even agree with you at some point. But if you are going to point out things like this where another class gets a nuke that is smaller than one we got 10 levels ago and declare it a problem, I will most definitely lump you in with the kind of people who aren't really interested in how the class works, but rather, how big other people think their dick is. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I don't think his point was that we should kill everything instantly, but rather that a class built around DD should have a greater degree of mastery and superiority than it does; sort of like a class built around Healing does for Clerics (or at least used to), or a class built around DOTs like Shamans should be.

You really don't understand the psychology of most people.  If joe Warrior sees a Druid nuke for 700 and the Wizard nuke for 600, he'll start asking why you aren't using a bigger blast.  I am not kidding you, they don't understand or care about efficiency, casting time, recast time or any of that crap, they see and understand damage.  Do you know which of two weapons is better in your secondary slot?  What poison components are used to make a snare poison?  It's not an area they know about.  And showing damage when there's resistances will cause problems, because they won't see anything happen, just you not doing anything.<br>
<br>
It's not a case of us wanting to be bigger boomers (well, I doubt any wizard here truthfully would turn them down) it is a case of other people's perception in groups causing problems.

<br>
I don't understand what you are saying here. It is still a smaller nuke than the one we got 10 levels earlier, that has a lower dps and lesser effiency than the current spells that get used by Wizards at that level. And even then it is even more outmoded in every category at the next level. It isn't even close to the disparity between a level 43 Wizard and a level 44 Druid. Druids are not outnuking Wizards in any sense at level 59, which is the implication he tries to make.<br>

Ah, so you often ask the Warrior why he isn't using some weapon over some other then? Or do you assume they know what they are doing? Actually, I would almost believe you do try to micromanage anyone who plays with you to that level.<br>

<br>
I really doubt it would change things either way myself, and don't really see any need for it because of that. I also don't think it would have quite the effect you think it would have. If the Warrior wants to start asking you about your nukes, return the favor and ask why his aggro management is so bad and give him tips on how to make it better. I am sure he will appreciate it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I personally haven't been asked for a TL to EJ/SF in well over a year, and I rarely if ever go roleplay/anonymous.<br>
<br>
Additionally, those two may be more confusing, since Wizards can TL to almost every spot they can port to.  Yes I know you can't TL to all port spots but if you don't play a Wizard, and don't read up on Wizards spells, how do you know?<br>

There will always be stupid people around.  You can't prevent it.  Some people don't listen, and will refuse to learn.  You just can't judge the majority of people by the minority of stupid ones.<br>

Or just you  I doubt you've interviewed anyone at all about this.<br>
<br>
You would be just as wrong as you usually are then Grim. Yes, I have talked over aggro amongst other subjects quite a bit with other wizards over the past 4 years. General consensus is that there is no difference in aggro the spell does based on the actual damage that lands. This makes a lot more sense than your view anyways.<br>
<br>
&gt;You are of the opinion that Wizards demonstrate significant enough mastery compared to other classes with their DD, others don't.<br>
<br>
I find it rather hard to argue the fact that wizards burst damage is behind any other class in the game, especially at the levels we are talking about. Sorry Grim, I haven't seen any rational arguments that show that we aren't. Most certainly none of them have been presented here when the best I got was whines about a spell 10 levels higher than one we get doing less damage, and even that spell was superceded within 1 level. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;So you've never ever worked with someone who asked you about your actions or spells cast? You've never see anyone tell a Bard what songs to sing? You've never see anyone ask why someone is using a 2HS instead of 2 one-handers? Because I have, and I know other people have as well. Aside from the blatant and banned personal attack, you do realize that people do notice the kind of things I've said and talk about it right?<br>
<br>
First, it wasn't a personal attack, it was an observation on your apparent style of play. And second, I don't see people saying quite the thing you were implying they would about the 600 and 700 damage thing. People, as a general rule, probably won't even notice that. Changing it to things like asking a Bard to play mana song isn't quite the same thing as what you are trying to imply. You don't, in general, see people telling the War which 1 hander he should be using. They may ask questions about him using a 1 hander setup vs 2 hander. But If you were using Grav Flux on a single mob instead of a regular DD, I might expect the same kinds of questions. You want to take apples and oranges and come up with grape juice somehow.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;f their aggro management is poor, I do ask if they are taunting. I suspect most people will pipe up if they think someone is awful at their job, don't you? If the warrior can't hold aggro when there's never been a problem previously with it, you'd just sit and say nothing? Do nothing? It's possible that you only work with the same small group of people who never say anything and work well together, but that's the minority report in this game, I can't imagine that being a good basis for making general statements about group behavior. <br>
<br>
This is still different. You are comparing someone doing a poor job and somehow trying to make that compare to a Wizard doing a normal job. Exactly how do you justify that transition? I've grouped with lots of people at all levels Grim, I just don't see this as being anything near the norm at the levels we are talking about for the most part. You just seem to be taking level 20 players and buffing them to level 55. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
