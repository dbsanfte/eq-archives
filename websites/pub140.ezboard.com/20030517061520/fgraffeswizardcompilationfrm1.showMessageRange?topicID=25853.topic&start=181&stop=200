Seems kind of a waste to me to spend a lot of AA points on Crits/Fury Mastery/etc just to have it get me summoned more. Whats the point in trying to &quot;Improve&quot; your character if SOE makes it such that we can't even cast without risk of getting summoned on our first cast with a MT on the mob?<br>
<br>
Last night in Plane of Fire I saw Wizards/Magicians/Rangers/Enchanters getting summoned and killed by mobs with the MT chasing them. Mind you the Main tank was on this mob for a good 2 minutes before this happened. Everyone I talked to got summoned on their first cast or 2nd cast on the mob. Hell even one wizard got summoned for casting flaming sword of xuzl. A magician got summoned and killed for casting malosini, a enchanter for re-tashing, etc... This can't be normal.<br>

<br>
I haven't noticed any increase in aggro raiding, and I have yet to group.  From reading this thread though it sounds like it might be a dps problem.  The MT is more likely to have a really high DPS in a raid situation where they can get max haste and have better gear. Grouping is more of a random shot.  Since the only thing a wizard really has on the mobs hatelist before the first nuke may proximatity there is no pre-established DPS.  when you hit the mob for 2.3k  you now have an insane DPS because it might not actually calculate it from the begining of the fight, and it looks like total damage is much less of a factor now.  Has anybody tried just nursing a level 1-20 nuke for the first 10% of the mob?  maybe establishing a really low dps on the mob from the begining will average out when you pull out AT.<br>
<br>
I was using rain from 90-50% never crit'd on two waves so I couldn't atest to that.  at 50% I switched over to draught.  Never drew aggro once and I didn't bother with conc.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for Sam's zerg strategy - low hit points are super aggro.  and casters don't have many to begin with.  I have been the victim of a low hit point summons when an ill timed mod occured as an AE landed on me.  insta-lunch<br>
<br>
My recomendation for those of you who can't get your aggro worked out.  train 5aa stick it into mb if you haven't already.  if you are going to get one nuke off it might as well be for 9.5k<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Last night I joined my guild's PoFire raid a bit late and they were in the middle of CR after getting wiped by Magmaton. I thought this was a bit unusual. People were saying something about an aggro bug but I figured they were just making excuses for the embarrassing situation. Nevertheless when we started fighting him again I waited until 70% just in case. <br>
<br>
I started off with my usual Lower Element from the flux stuff (every little bit can help) and before I could react I was suddenly being pummelled to death by Magmaton. As I stared at my corpse laying on the ground there were still a bunch of people standing around me and Magmaton was nowhere near me.<br>
<br>
1 lower element somehow managed to catch Magmaton's attention and isolate me in the middle of a crowd of casters already going crazy with their nukes. <br>
<br>
If that doesn't = broken I don't know what does.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Baelish spoke with SOE regarding the new charm experience changes and hate list revision. Here's what he learned: <br>
Charm Experience has been changed so that NPCs will take a more appropriate amount of experience per kill.   If the NPC does 100% of the damage it will take 33% of the experience of the kill.  This is the most that can ever be taken from the kill.  If it does 50% it will take 16.5%, if it does 10% it will take 3.3% etc.  Its a sliding scale based on how much damage the Charmed NPC does to the monster killed. <br>
<br>
This new system is independent of any grouping. The NPC will take Experience with this system whether the Enchanter is solo or not. <br>
<br>
There have been varying reports from players in relation to hate and agro.  Some say its severely worse, others have not noticed a significant change.  The testing department is currently reviewing data on agro generated from damage and if any change is warranted to correct a problem then they will be made accordingly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1563<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/03 7:40:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25853.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/phpBB2/images/avatars/gallery/Warcraft%20III/3lich.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ^^</span><hr size=1> I think most warriors were are talking about when referring to &quot;a MT&quot; are using a Blade of War.

Well guess what studs, your average level 65 SK is holding that agro off you by chain casting Spears, which, LIKE your nukes, are highly mana efficient DDs.  I say this, because the way we USED to hold great agro is with our lower level snares, but you'll see on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12847">our boards</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> that our snares aren't doing the agro they used to, but spears are working better than ever for agro.<br>

<br>
Ya if you take more than 1500HP of damage every 2 seconds (assuming 3 clerics) then yur dead.<br>
<br>
Well it works for exp mobs but not really strong raid type mobs. I wasn't really sure exactly what output damge higher end PoP mobs have but if its over 1000 dps well heh.... <br>
<br>
Still there are a lot of mobs that do not do 750dps, although most of the one you really want to kill do.<br>
<br>
Also note the guy that said he did 45K damage before going OOM. Thats just one wizard. Wizards who do draught pump can do vast amounts of damage fast. He can do that damage in about 4-5 mintues.<br>
<br>
Also I have to wonder if the mob with a 60 person hate list is able to focus on one person long enough to do 5000 damage, if all 60 people are putting out their max DPS. You really should not be the target longer than 5 seconds, even as little as 3. <br>
<br>
No one has really tested this with like 40 casters all draught pumping making the mobs hate list change as fast as it updates. I do know that I can be down to 30percent health on the chanter and the mob will leave me for the wizards, whereas before he would try and finish the job. <br>
<br>
If the hate list changes every 2 seconds and 40 people are draught pumping then the mob will not be on any one person longer then 2 seconds. If the hate list updates every tick well then you can't get the mob off you faster then 6 seconds...... <br>
<br>
Its the people doing little damage who don't go up the hate list that keeps the mob on the poeple doing a lot of damage and gets them killed.<br>

<br>
it seems all spells and abilities that either generate aggro (hategiver boc) or remove aggro (jolt, concussion, SCS) are NOT working. When i got summoned, sucessfully landing concussion (no resists) did nothing to get them off me.<br>
<br>
It also appears that crits and spells are generating the aggro they actually DO instead of the max base damage of the spell. Thus why crits are a death sentences often.<br>
<br>
The reason some are experienceing problems and some are not is the MT you are using. We have an MT that has high fast damage and can hold aggro with just melee and not have to use chater spells and hate proc weapons. He is usually not our MT though. Our MT is usually one that dual weilds hate proc weapons and has chanter spells and sk spells on. The MT with high damage could all of a sudden hold aggro MUCH better than the other. That is what leads me to beilieve that the aggro modifying spells and abilities are not working.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that gives VI some places to look for the problem. Maybe the new aggro code is not coded for the mods yet. <br>
<br>
Also while it seems a good idea to give tha actually aggro of the daamge we do, given the random nature of both crits and focus items, it is not fair to casters. If you need to nerf bow damage, then do that. using a machine gun for a jod that you should have use a rifle for just kills lots of innocent people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

But against boss mobs, the strat is useless. 4x2000+ is something that is meant for tanks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In either case, it is better to avoid aggro. Like in thread at Arcanist, it is sad, but even in PoP the fast damage isn't the key, even though they tried to advertise it so. The boss mobs easily have 500k-1M hitpoints (or low HP but insane regen), so they're much like Velious/Luclin in that sense. The bigger difference is that now the DPS of the groups has also gone up (like in every expansion) and those 100k-300k hitpoint mobs are the trash mobs.<br>
<br>
Wizards have been glorified DoTs since Velious, and that trend isn't going away anytime soon, the MB nerf for PoP has proven to be pointless, as none of the boss encounters would be trivial even with MB in pre-nerf state. And by some of the accounts in this thread, it looks like even the DoT function of us is now gone. If the plan is to nerf ranged damage out of existence, I guess it is only a matter of time when it hits me too and that'll be the moment to start acquiring some good melee weapons I guess.<br>
<br>
Only troubling thing in this whole mess (afterpatchmath) is that the reports are inconsistent across the boards. Seems like there are people in every damage dealing class saying aggro is fubar, some monks, some rogues, some rangers, some wizards, etc. meanwhile there are people in all those same classes who haven't noticed any difference.<br>
<br>
I just wish it was as clear cut as Rend being ice-based was... it was same to all and easy to verify, yet it took very long to be fixed. Now we seem to have an issue that isn't easy to verify, isn't same to all... so I'm fearing it'll take even longer to find the problem and fix it / explain it, and our boards will be a mess until that happens.<br>
<br>
Because, it very well could be that there is something wrong that isn't directly in DD aggro. It could be as simple as monk FD clearing out the hate list totally. That way the effect is noticeable to others, while other people don't see it and at the same time, it is so removed from the DD aggro that linking those two can be more difficult. Now, that was only an example... but if the cause-effect is that removed (or more), I can't see a fix arriving anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, some of us are unhappy and some of us are unconcerned with the changes. I'd prefer everyone to be happy and not having these kind of messes around, but such is the way of patches in EQ. Upgrading things isn't an option, nerfing is the way to fix things... and with the code being a jungle as it seems to be, the nerfs always seem to hit unforeseen targets. <br>
<br>
We all knew ranger archery aggro was going to be nerfed/fixed/whatever, but I don't believe any of us had slightest expectation that nukers or rogues would be incapacitated by the fix. Not saying all of us were hit with the nerf, but with few dozen people in various classes pointing aggro issues out 2 days after the patch, it is becoming clear that it's not only &quot;gut feeling&quot;. <br>
<br>
Patch-day posts about nerfs are way too common, that they easily paint people &quot;gun-jumpers&quot; and get unwanted posts in boards too. (Jboots were nerfed!!!) But like I wrote... when posts keep on pouring in after couple of days, the situation starts to clarify itself. Good thing is, SOE/VI is looking into it. I guess we just have to wait and see.<br>

Of course, I have scs3 too, but I don't think it would mitigate to the point that I could purposely try to get agro and not get hit if the agro is as fubar'd as everyone is saying.

<br>
And when a lot of us level 65 wizards with lots of aa's talk about our tanks, they ALL (as in 5 or 6 warriors) have Blades of War.<br>
<br>
Wizard aggro was just about perfect before, it was too high if anything as I could not use my mana to its full potential as aggro would limit its use, but it was fine and we all accepted it and it worked.<br>
<br>
There have been zero complaints from the Wizard community for quite sometime now as our class was finally &quot;balanced&quot;.  I do not see how these changes were seen to improve the game and increase your customers enjoyment.  Maybe it was an attempt to make things more challenging, but there is a difference between making us unable to perform our function in a raid (which is doing a lot of damage quickly without DIEING mind you) and making the game more challenging.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is there are for sure problems with aggro, just as there was when you screwed up Cleric's healing aggro, and we are all letting you know, and it isn't like we are all irrational whining children trying to get something our way, we know this game, and our class and when we tell you that you broke something, it would be in your best interest to listen to us. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14095">Sage Sond Planeshifter </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
first cast on a ssra trash mob with a 5k crit and I get summoned (it hit when the mob was at 40%). thats crazy. I should not be getting summoned like that.<br>
<br>
At this point I switch to draughts for the remainder of the night.<br>
<br>
start casting on Exile at 90%. after 2 draughts and I get summoned? c'mon, something is wrong.<br>
<br>
I need to med for Cursed, hes at ±35% (I've been using draughts and conncussion mind you). I throw 4 concussions, run across the basement to med and after I sit down, by the time I finished regening 20% of my mana, he summons me and I'm dead? wtf?<br>
<br>
I'm nuking less then before the patch and I'm getting summoned / dying a hell of a lot more since. 'something' is wrong with agro and no, I dont have an answer.<br>

<br>
Now, we've killed few avatars, few fire minis, couple of water minis, couple of earth rings, Sol Ro, did Coirnav ring, etc. since the patch.. and out of the mages, wizards, enchanters, necros, clerics, etc. in our guild, there is no visible change to death rates on those raids. And that's what baffles me the most, because I could understand if it was just me who didn't notice anything, but why it doesn't seem to effect our guild raids at all. Meanwhile other people on our server are posting that they see major changes.<br>
<br>
The problem with aggro currently seem to be so oddball, that it is very hard to pinpoint. Especially if the ones experiencing awful aggro don't experience it at all times.<br>

<br>
Last night: <br>
<br>
I xp'd for 3 hours in PoE with a guild group, pally as tank. I was pretty much able to nuke normally, and he held aggro very well. However, any crits with Strike of Solusek or Shock of Magic = summons. He could usually aggro it off me by chain stunning before much damage was incurred though. (Note PALLY was the tank)<br>
<br>
Raid: Plane of Fire <br>
<br>
~ 35 people for Quavonis Firetail. The wizard group all died around me within the first 20% or so of the fight. Most of the melee damage classes were also killed pretty much instantly. The MT couldn ot keep aggro. Now I know that this particular bird may be more difficult for a tank to keep aggro on, so this situation could be an exaggerated example of how fuxxored aggro is. Anyway, we wiped, and this bird is usually a sleepwalk for us. I was VERY SLOWLY casting Ancient Destruction of Ice, two concussions, ADoI, two concussions, etc, and lived pretty much til the end. <br>
<br>
Next pull: One wizard in group opened with 2 concussions on Quavonis (I dunno why, maybe doing a test). He was immediately killed. Most other people just went very slowly like i had the previous attempt, so we won, but the stupid fight took way longer than it should have. <br>
<br>
General somebody: A few Wizards/druids summoned and spanked when casting as they normally would on a mob. Bitching is getting louder, as we are not stupid. We raid every night and know our damn classes and the zones we play in. We do know we cannot play the way we did before, and we all cringe every time we get a crit, fearing for our lives. <br>
<br>
Arch Magus whoever: Couple of wizards had already logged in disgust. I was casting SS on tank and trying to nuke in between. I think all the wizards survived. <br>
<br>
People are NOT happy. I cannot imagine why some people are saying they have not noticed anything different. I am not imagining things. We did not expect any changes to our play style, so we were not looking for any. Thus, this is not some kind of group manufactured delusions. At least two wizards last night said they might just quit EQ, they were so frustrated.<br>
