I'm curious, does anyone ever go to their home cities anymore? Went back to Felwithe for the first time in ages and it was deserted. Had reason to be in Freeport a couple of weeks ago and there were just 3 or 4 people. All of this  was at peak time (early evening PST).<br>
<br>
It also made me wonder where the newbies were. Those few people I saw in GF, NRo or EC were being PLd. Hmmm. No shouts of orc hill looking for more or Level 6 Wiz LFG.

There aren't many reasons to visit old world cities anymore besides some tradeskills (mostly cultural). Spells are generally easier to find in PoK, and with travel being so much faster via portal stones, many melees stick to SH and PoK for thier needs as well.<br>

It's a sign of the the times ladies and gentlemen.  You know it.  I know it.  No one wants to admit it.<br>
<br>
EQ is dying.  It is dying a slow and horrible death.  High levels are retiring everyday.  Most of my friends have either severly cut back, quit, or cancelled their accounts long ago.  The only reason I play still is to get a fix.  I am waiting on EQ2.<br>
<br>
Need more evidence?  Okay... Some of the top guilds on my server are doing something they haven't done in years.  Holding open applications.  These guilds have virtually been by invitation only for ages.  I speak of Ascent specifically.  Most of the other once great guilds are hanging on by a thread and others feeling the beginings of collapse.  I have seen evidence of this myself and have heard much from others.  I may no longer participate in the high end game, but I do have friends.<br>
<br>
Frankly, it's time.  The game has come to a point where there is only the high end game.  There is no fresh blood worth mentioning coming in and many old timers and other high ender's are retiring one after the other.  Bare in mind that a year and a half ago Sony touted 650,000 subscribers.  That number has dropped in a years time to 450,000 or so.  This all points to the inevitable.  All good things come to an end.<br>
<br>
Kudos to SOE for pulling out all the stops to keep people playing (ei; froglocks, bank slots, charms, port stones, bazaar, chat channels, raid groups, etc.) but it is just not enough.  We need something new... something fresh... to be newbs again... to roam the world in total ignorance of what lay ahead... WOOT!!<br>

Though it may be unpopular, particularly among people who have committed considerable time and energy into playing a virtual game, such as EverQuest, Soren's views are supported by a widely expanding body of evidence to suggest that in actuality EverQuest is, indeed, contracting in size. Personally, I think that this can only bring good things to those who are committed to playing EverQuest -- since fewer people means less competition for limited resources. That being said, I'd just like to share a few of the perspectives that I made on my server's forums a couple of months ago.<br>
<br>
Though the &quot;EQ Doom Sayers&quot; have been predicting its demise numerous times, the fact of the matter is that EverQuest capitalized upon its design and its initiative to capture the majority of what most people claim is a &quot;finite sized consumer market&quot; (Brad McQuaid, 6/2/2001). People will be hard pressed to leave EverQuest for a new MMORPG, largely because of the time commitment already invested in EQ, and secondly, because EQ appeals to a distinctive Fantasy gaming crowd. Even so, EverQuest's user base has become less and less sustainable, and SOE has revealed this fact in a number of ways.<br>
<br>
It's well-known that the reason why SOE stopped listing the total numbers of users logged into each server was because Mythic Entertainment and Microsoft were both using these figures to leverage competition against Sony when their respective MMORPGs were expanding. By withholding these figures, Dark Age of Camelot and Asheron's Call had a harder time gauging what practices of theirs - if any - were having an effect upon the EverQuest user base. SOE's actions, nonetheless, spoke volumes of their circumstances. As more and more commercialization of the game emerged, it became obvious that EverQuest was dependant upon a veteran user base, rather than a growing new customer base. Take, for example, the name change services, the server move services, and even EQ-related products that can be purchased - such as the cell phone ringtones. The continued capitalization of extended products shows that SOE is committed to keeping its current customers.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I think that these are encouraging signs for the consumer. When a service like EverQuest begins to become stagnant, its proprietors have to be more responsive to their static userbase in order to maintain profit. <br>
<br>
Back to the original issue - vacant home cities. I also think that, yes, while there is considerable vacant low-level content, there is also vacant high-level content, as well, showing that at least many of the current players are fascinated with limited portions of the high level game. There are whole areas of the game that are vacant - large sections of once-competitive content in Kunark, much of Velious and even considerable areas of Luclin are completely abandoned. The newbie zones are also no longer as crowded as they once were in the past. Finally, EverQuest is finally no longer growing at a pace sufficient to replace its outgoing customers (one of the reasons why SOE has begun to reactivate and give &quot;free time&quot; to previously cancelled accounts). This can be attributed in part to a dated engine, and in part, to a shift on SOE's priorities to EQ2 and other services. If anything, I think we might see server combines as EverQuest begins to witness its contraction in the months and years ahead.<br>
<br>
Personally, I doubt that EverQuest will &quot;end&quot; anytime soon; though, like many MUDs and old MMORPGs (such as Sierra's &quot;The Realm&quot;, and Ultima Online), it will stop being competitive and appeal to fewer and fewer people, as other games take the mantle of the mainstream. For those that decide to stay on EverQuest - they will reap the bounty of being a privileged class of people who will be catered to and kept happy, for their continued happiness will directly affect the revenues generated by the game. For those moving on, the fierce competition that is likely to emerge between gaming giants such as Blizzard Entertainment and SOE for the Fourth Generation MMORPGs is likely to be rather intense, and should result in some exciting innovation for the gamers.<br>

New people join the game every day. Oddly, most of them don't end up joining an old server stuck three screens away from the first one they see when they log on for the first time.<br>
<br>
Go play on one of the younger servers and say that there are no new newbies. There are TONS of them and they join the game every day.<br>

If you're burned out on the game, fine. It happens to everyone eventually. But you don't need to project your feelings onto the game to have your feelings validated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seuinye>Seuinye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 7:45:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> KEI, Paludul caverns, Dawnshroud Peaks, OT, DL and Karnors Castle prove you wrong, Whizbang.<br>
<br>
The low end of this game has not been tweaked, or even addressed in a very long time, and it's not because it's perfect, it's because the majority of the people are in the end game, and enjoy being there.  Even twinks now have the express highway to the end game, using the above formula.<br>
<br>
KEI makes the first 25 odd levels trivial for casters, and melees have access to some excellent gear for a few pp in the bazaar.  Heck, Sony almost admits that the beginning game is dead - by leaving the KEI cap where it is, by letting ageo and focus and virtue land on anyone who's inthe right place at the right time.  That way people can speed by the beginning game without noticing the problems.<br>
<br>
And if you don't believe it, go around to the various once-popular locations in the game, and do /who's.  Oasis - dead.  Commons - twinks and high level druidbots.  ~laughs~ Even OT is dead anymore, with most of the people there with PLers to get to the next level.<br>
<br>
And fresh blood worth mentioning are the people who *don't* go around asking &quot;can ne1 give me a bp or pp?&quot;  And I have seen maybe two in the last few months.  Those who do beg like d00ds will usually do one of two things.  Give up and quit, or ride the express train to the end game and then give up and quit becasue they don't know how to really play. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587299" target="top">Seuinye Whitewater</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> 31 Wizard, Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yaxa>Yaxa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.crimsontempest.info/yaxa/y3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>I'm German, Help Me!</span><br>  Posts: 1202<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 7:59:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://images.crimsontempest.info/yaxa/familiar3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> Starting cities being mostly empty isn't a sign of EQ dying, although I'm sure it's past its zenith.

<br>
Also, many of the old newbie zones were designed pretty poorly (Toxx being the worst, imho). You will find a lot more people actually exp'ing in the &quot;good&quot; newbie zones. Field of Bone comes to mind, or Shar Vahl to a certain extend (the lag scares people away from there though). <p><CENTER>

<br>
I tend to disagree, honestly. While I agree with you that starting cities being empty does signal a &quot;change in pace&quot; for EverQuest, it also signals a drastic transformation of the business model upon which SOE has depended. For a long time, the SOE creative staff under Brad McQuaid instituted largely unpopular changes and were unphased by the input of the players. Why? Simply put - the game was growing at a pace to more than adequately handle any players who might leave, whether through apathy or simply a shift in priorities. EverQuest was growing and prospering, and its dramatic expansion was reflective of that.<br>
<br>
However, it has become more and more obvious that as the median level of the average player rises higher, EverQuest becomes less and less about appealing to newer audiences, but about retaining the older audiences that are still adequately subscribing. Hence, this mindset led to significant compromising on the part of SOE. Remember when people used to say that it was impossible to institute name changes or server moves? What about special-rules servers being largely limited to PvP circumstances? All of these rules, and innumerable others, have been bent and broken both during and most notably, following, the departure of McQuaid and the original team, now at SigilGames, because the new business model strategy for SOE was to keep their customers and derive as much profit from them as possible. This is a valid business model, and I would argue, the only real logical one if your product is no longer attracting new subscribers. <br>
<br>
But it is most definitely a sign of EverQuest's decline as a competitive game for future generations of players. This is, also, to be expected. EverQuest operates on a dated engine, a DikuMUD data structure variant, and increasingly complex hardware-server configurations that make it a costly endeavour and impede its ability to deliver newer technology to players. When I'm not practicing law, I frequent the game industry as a software design enthusiast, and some of the things that are just inching over the horizon simply blow me away. It's obvious that SOE understands this reality, and why they are eagerly coming out with new games that will try and extend the EverQuest success model. However, SOE's tradition of unilateralism and customer neglect will have to change across all of its products, and not just in the retention of its EQ customer base, if it is to become truly competitive. The age of EverQuest's disproportionate monopoly over the industry is winding down, and for the consumer, this is really great news.<br>
<br>
Choices, competition and options ultimately lead to better products and, in the end, a better experience - whether it be in Norrath, or in the World of Warcraft.<br>

A new player will not even see your server when they first load up the game on the server selection screen. That's why you aren't seeing any new players. I said this explicitly in my post above.<br>
<br>
Please go make a character on KB, AB or any of the servers sorted at the top (least populated) when sorted by population (the default view now for new players). Go walk around GFay or any of the other zones. Note that there ARE new players there (although not necessarily the hundreds that we had when no one could figure out how to get even to the next zone over reliably) and that they ARE asking the same old newbie questions in OOC and SHOUT.<br>
<br>
I still see plenty of people standing on the GFay elevators on Vaz, waiting for them to &quot;automatically&quot; start moving, for instance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=severinewolfe>Severine Wolfe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 639<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 12:38:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> I've seen less and less people in newbie zones.  GFay used to be packed with people (pre-bazaar) and even afterwards people still auctioned there.  Now I can head home and rarely see a shout or ooc while in GFay at all.  When I'm in Felwithe I run into a few newbies and I try to help them out as much as I am willing.<br>
<br>
The game has become top-heavy. We all know that, however, I have seen less and less true newbies on Solusek Ro, and I did wonder about it until I read Whiz's thoughts on the screens.  We're pretty near the bottom and it is unlikely that they will scroll down that far to find a server home.<br>
<br>
Sony knows what we know.  People who have invested years in playing EQ are not likely to do anything more than try out EQ2.  However, they will go into EQ2 expecting it to be a lot like EQ and when it is not like that they will go back to playing what they know.  It's human nature.  They will slowly come back to EQ or, in the case they were burned out, turn to something else. <p><img src=http://24.26.194.142/sevepic.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12405<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/03 12:56:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26165.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home cities</span><hr size=1> I don't get people wanting to stay in EQ1 when EQ2 comes out, especially the people who've been playing two years longer than me.

When EQ2 comes along, I'm gone.
