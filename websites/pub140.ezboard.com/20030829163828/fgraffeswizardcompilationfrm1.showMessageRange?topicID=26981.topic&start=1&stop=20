Well one thing comes to mind now.  Do you think there has been or still is hacking going on in EQ?  How can some people make ungodly amounts of platinum so fast at times?  I always thought there were hackers.  Perhaps they used some form of editing or maybe a hex program or some crap.<br>
<br>
Do any temp files actually get used on your system while you play then uploaded when you are done?  I don't see any other way a hacker could give him or herself plat otherwise.<br>
<br>
I know nobody would admit to it if there was but I always felt something was fishy at times with some of the people I knew. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Edit: Just to clarify, fletching is one of the few tradeskills that you can do entirely from vendors and sell at a profit, to vendors. At high levels you'll succeed enough to make a profit. Do it a zillion times really fast and you just made a heck of a lot of money. Never tried it myself but I've seen the process explained and it totally makes sense. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=murel>Murel</A> at: 6/17/03 1:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1351<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 2:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hacking</span><hr size=1> The only hacking that happens tends to be things live giving non-trackers access to track, or giving yourself huge speed increases (this one, from what I understand is pretty easy for them to catch), etc.<br>

You cannot actually create money from thin air.  As I understand it however, what does happen is someone will use a macro program, across multiple accounts and do a tradeskill which makes money. (Think of Cheese at super-human speeds with no afks, no sore wrists, and 6 accounts all doing it at the same time).  Last I heard Sony had implemented some sort of double memory check, but I doubt that will slow hackers for very long. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1352<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 2:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hacking</span><hr size=1> Oh, and once you reach the point of creating a program to play a game for you, you have officially crossed the line, I'm sorry, but you need to quit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maultar>Maultar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1436<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 2:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hacking</span><hr size=1> lol, too funny.

I don’t know how he did it, but I was in the Ak’Anon courtyard talking to someone when I heard a merchant repeatedly say, “Hello, Soanso, you look like you could use a water flask.” I mean, it was excessive to the point where it was zone disruption. I found the guy at the archery merchant. I immediately knew it was a script because of the way the gnome was moving. He’d swing towards the vendor and then swing towards his right slightly and then swing back.<br>
<br>
And this guy was smart enough to write a script where his activities would cease the minute a GM entered the zone. It would automatically put up AFK and just stay like that. That was why my petitions were fruitless. The GM would tell me there was nothing they could do because they couldn’t witness anything happening. I complained to a friend of mine a few days later because it was STILL going on and he came in to check it out. Agreed that I was right. He logged on his druid alt and attacked the NPC and trained it to the zone. I was laughing because the gnome was still standing there unable to proceed. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I went to work and when I came home, my friend had petitioned and explained to the GM exactly what was going on. The GM was able to forcefully boot the character and then log on. Soon after it was verified that the gnome was exploiting, but the GM wouldn’t give any details or anything beyond that. No idea what happened to the account – probably got banned or something. <br>
<br>
I looked at the merchant. I couldn’t figure out what he was doing. I think he was selling dupes, but the most expensive thing I saw was maybe a peridot.<br>

anyways yes its possible to make plat out of thin air but the people who do it generaly get caught very quickly ( and yes they use a hex edit to do it ) what they do is start an account and edit the packets while in a trade . the way they get caught is that the the numbers dont match up server to client .<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
I was one of those people who automated everything about the game. Yeah i've quit now, I played a bard and had everything automated including exping. <br>
<br>
The whole fletching thing, wasn't really 'high level fletching'. Using macros you could max fletching in about 90 seconds (200 anyway) <br>
<br>
the majority of platinum was made via illegitimate ways, I personally made around.. five million plat I guess. I wasn't one of the people selling it or anything though.<br>
<br>
The real reason was I trying to make the game fun for myself, I didn't really think that I was detracting from everyone elses fun (which I was).. eventually I realised that I wasn't having fun and I was lessening it for others.. so I quit.<br>
<br>
Oh and for future reference, the fletching thing netted around 4k pp per hour it ran. If you used tinkering + bow/cams you could make around 30,000pp per hour, per character.<br>
<br>
Hope that explains a couple of things.<br>
<br>
p.s. There is no 'hacking'. There are only three ways someone gets your password:<br>
<br>
1) You gave it to them. You got betrayed, if you have been 'hacked' you have about 999/1000 that this is what happened. Trust me.<br>
2) You have a trojan on your computer that is recording your keystrokes.<br>
3) Someone is watching you over your shoulder and working out your password.<br>
<br>
Nothing else happens. There is no brute forcing, or reverse engineering (of passwords anyway).

I've been privy to over-the-shoulder conversations with various EQ developers over the past year concerning macroing and various &quot;hack&quot; techniques that existed in game.<br>
<br>
Put it this way, a real life friend of mine netted $16,000 USD selling platinum he had macro'd 24/7 in 3 months time. Some of the more hardcore macroers made very large sums of real money in a years time doing this.<br>
<br>
There were bugs in the game that allowed you to take over another characters toon and move it to a new location (fixed about 4-6 months ago)... you had the ability to move your character below the world, out of a GMs view and still trade with NPCs making macroing very very lucrative.<br>
<br>
The various playersauction platinum sellers would buy platinum at $100/100kpp then resel it for $300-700 depending on the market at the time.<br>
<br>
Some of the various playersauction folk netted 20-30million plat PER day PER server based on these methods.<br>
<br>
There were macros that netted 800plat profit on 2plat invested that lasted ~8 hours before they got nerfed. Most macro's produced 5-10kpp per hour although some earlier ones netted 60-100kpp per hour.<br>
<br>
Multiple that by a few accounts and whoo...<br>
<br>
That friend of mine would buy up accounts on playersauction and macro on them until they got canned... $300-400 out of pocket was nothing for a return of $3-4k USD.<br>
<br>
(He made 16k in 3 months.. the guy who gave him the macro's made 65k in 6 months... the guy who gave him the macros made.. well, a Lot in a years time.)<br>
<br>
Remember, it's just a game. =)<br>
<br>
Silvered long swords, cam'd bows, tea leaves (alive about 8 hours before nerf)... Whee.<br>

Anyways, I have to hand it to the people who can figure this stuff out.  Anyone can macro some key strokes, but making an effective loop with mouse tracking and all isn't as easy, let alone going AFK when a GM comes by... Hehe that's just funny... <p><table width="320" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

Heh, well if we're ignoring the EULA, then I guess it depends on the game you're playing. If your game is &quot;getting around the EULA and making a lot of macroed plat&quot;, then I suppose macroing would not only not be cheating, but would be a key element. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26981.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26981.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26981.topic&start=61&stop=79>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26981.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26981.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
