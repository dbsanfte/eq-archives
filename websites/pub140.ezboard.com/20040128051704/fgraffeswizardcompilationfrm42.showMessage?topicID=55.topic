The bustle of the markets descended down a gradual incline to the towers, inns, and tenements of downtown—and with the beating heat of the mid-day sun, the marble of the city streets and buildings gleamed brightly, creating the illusion of a golden city perched on a mountaintop.   And indeed, Freeport was the closest thing in all the Realms to the fabled City of Light prophesied in the great Books of Yore.  For it was here and only here where all races, classes and creeds knew no distinction—where dwarves, elves, humans, halflings, and gnomes all commingled, drawn together under one social contract, bonded together by a single word etched in golden letters over the gates to the city: FREEDOM.   For the golden rule in Freeport was that every person within its walls would have the freedom to do as he or she willed, so long as he agreed not to infringe on the freedom of others to do likewise.  Under such a philosophy Freeport thrived and grew to become the most powerful and populous trading port in the Realms.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the midst of this torrent of activity-- the din of negotiation in the air, the shouts of sidewalk performers pawning theatrical acts, the clattering of cups as weary travelers and decadent lords shared fresh ale from the colossal brew-barrels-- a singularly unusual figure stepped its way lightly through the crowd, which parted before him.  His appearance gave him away at once as a wizard, and one not to be meddled with.  He was quite tall, nearly half a foot higher than the tallest human on the street, and though he was slender of build he moved with an air of confident strength.   His face was smooth as though cut from adamantine with sharp edges and high cheekbones—features that could be confused for feminine by human standards.   The eyes were wide and cerulean blue and shone brightly.  He was donned in a velvety blue robe embroidered with various runes and hieroglyphs, tapered at the sleeves with a golden sheen.  Over his shoulders flourished a vermilion cape buckled to his robe with golden clasps.  In fine long fingers he carried an oaken staff with a glittering silver tip, also engraved with arcane symbols.  His hair was a river of platinum blonde falling back high from his forehead.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There could be no question as to the race of this august personage:  the arched eyebrows were sign enough, but there was no mistaking the curvy pointed ears jutting out from his hair.  Here was an elf, but not just any elf: rather, here walked what was commonly referred to as a “High elf” or in their own ancient tongue, one of the Feir’dal.   Even in Freeport sightings of a Feir’dal were uncommon, typically signifying some unusual political or religious occasion.  Thus it was not surprising that the crowd abated around him, sometimes hushed sometimes whispering, but always talking notice.   Nonetheless, in Freeport trade reigns supreme so it was only a matter of time before one of the more aggressive merchants began to accost him with solicitations, hoping for the cha-ching of platinum that such a being would surely possess in abundance.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Master, let me not impose upon you, but I have some artifacts that one of your persuasion may find useful.”  A fat, balding human with a golden tooth and a crooked smile bowed obsequiously before him.  The merchant pointed to his wagon and ushered his assistant to him with an impatient stubby hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come come, Elishiru, let us not keep the Master a’waiting,” he barked.  “Bring the box, bring THE box!” &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A small elf with a flock of sandy hair emerged from behind a partition fumbling with a wide wooden box.  His little legs sped forward, nearly tripping over themselves, but just before he arrived at the merchant safely he glanced up and his eyes met those of the Feir’dal.   The young elf had never laid eyes on a Feir’dal before and, momentarily startled, he inadvertently let the box spiral out of his tiny hands.  It hit the floor with a crack and the contents spilled out in a nearly perfect 360 degree radius.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Eli! Why you clumsy elf, look what you done!  Can’t you do anything right!   I ought to club your hide!”  Then, remembering the potential loss of a valued customer, the merchant abruptly turned back to the wizard with that crooked smile once again, bowing deeply, as far as the rolls of fat under his tunic allowed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My deepest apologies, m’Lord, my assistant here is an elf as you can see but has the hands of an ogre.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It is no problem,” the wizard responded, as he smiled softly at the little elf, who was on hands and knees frantically trying to keep the farthest pieces from rolling even farther away.   He was going to bid the merchant good-day and be on his way to the temple, but no doubt the young wood elf would be blamed for the loss of a customer, maybe even released from his job and sent to the tunnels, where many of the city’s downtrodden youth were forced to live in abject poverty.  Yes, Freeport was a city of freedom, but the freedom to live as you see fit was also accompanied by the freedom to starve and go without.  In such a place there was no obligation to provide for the needy, and indeed, such unfortunates were often despised for not being able to make their own way.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thus the wizard turned his attention to the contents spluttered about before him on the ground: there were rings, amulets, necklaces, and pendants of various metallic compositions, many engraved with symbols in diverse languages.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The merchant followed his eyes.  “These are powerful magicks my Lord, recovered by artful industry and dangerous exploits, from the farthest reaches of the Realms they have been retained, and acquired at great cost by me, I can assure you.”  The merchant puffed out his chest and nodded his head proudly.  He snatched an amulet from the ground and brandished it before the wizard.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “For example, m’Lord, this exquisite piece, this—“<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Is quite worthless,” the high-elf interrupted, with a finality that cut off the merchant in midstream from the elaborate tale he was about to spin.   The merchant looked at his bauble uncertainly then slowly lowered his hand and tossed it back on the pile.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes m’Lord ‘tis as you say.”  The merchant began to search the pile again, looking for another item.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think you can let me be the judge of what items are truly possessed of magickal energy,” the wizard pointed out.  He scanned the items intently.  Most of them were common trinkets, worth no more or less than the silver or gold they were plated with.  The ones made of jade or quartz had natural healing properties but were not very powerful.   However, he recognized a silver ring among the pile, inscribed in gnomish with the name of Wou’shi, a named dragon who resided on the icy continent of Velious. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Elishiru, tracker of the forest shadows,” the wizard beckoned to the elf in the ancient tongue of the Koi’dail.  The elf scampered to his feet and bowed low before him.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes m’Lord, that is right, but how did—“<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come now, you surely don’t think I would not know the musical language of a cousin, do you?”   The elf looked down sheepishly: surely he did not know the language of the Feir’dal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now tell me, tracker of the forest shadows, if you can track for me the hidden treasure contained within this box.  Of all these pieces, which is the one you believe to be most valuable?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fat merchant followed this exchange with a puzzled expression and a slumped jaw, for he could not understand a word.  He was enough a businessman to know, however, that the wizard was still interested in his merchandise.  He sent a quick prayer to Bristlebane that the boy would not blow it for him again.  Elf or no, his lenience had gone too far, and if the little urchin blew it this time…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eli recoiled in front of the twin gazes of the wizard and his boss—whom he unaffectionately called the Skunk-- as he glanced once again at the wares spread out before him.  He knew that the Skunk would sometimes get an official assessment from the Wizard’s Guild to appraise his merchandise when he suspected something had value, but of late the Skunk had become sloppy, refusing to pay the costly wizard fees and evaluating the jewelry based solely on its composition and engravings.  None of these pieces had been designated as particularly special, as far as Eli knew.  If the Skunk ever came into possession of something truly valuable, it would in all likelihood not be sold in the Market, but taken to the Keep to one of the Lords.  Judging by appearances, the golden necklace or jacinth ring would be the most valuable—and jacinth had natural healing properties.  He had a sense, however, that the wizard’s test would not be met so easily.   Eli sent out his energy to the contents before him, but he felt nothing.   He was an elf, one whose lifeblood coursed with the astral potencies of magick, but since he had been taken from his home in the woods as a child, he had received little magickal training.  He could track some of the animals in the thickets outside the city grounds, but that was about it.  Animals he had a natural affinity for, but he felt nothing for jewels and stones.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come now, do not surrender so easily,” the wizard coaxed as Eli was on the edge of admitting failure.  The high-elf held out his glimmering staff.  “Here, take my staff, perhaps it may help you find the truth.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eli flinched from the staff as though it were a Holy Tome not meant to be touched or even gazed upon.  To put such a talisman of power in a stranger’s hands was an unprecedented act—and dangerous too, for such a staff in the wrong hands could produce…certain accidents.  The Feir’dal did not look concerned however, but merely motioned once again for him to take it as though it were a common broom.   Eli finally reached out and laid hold of the polished oak.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The staff felt comfortable in his hands and almost entirely weightless.  After a few seconds, his fingers began to tingle with light warmth.  Eli felt something strange ripple from his fingers to the rest of his body, a stirring of what could only be magickal energy.  He found himself closing his eyes and exulting in this foreign yet peaceful sensation, but he soon remembered the task before him.  He opened his eyes and glanced once again at the items strewn about in the box and about it.  There, as clear as a hand sticking out of mud, he noticed a simple silver ring gleam with an unmistakable magickal hue.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That one,” he announced with certainty, using the staff to point it out.  “The silver ring.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are…correct!” the wizard exclaimed cheerily.  The wizard scooped the ring from the box with a graceful movement, and held it up to the light of the sun.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, this is fine gnomish workmanship,” he said, reverting back to Common for the benefit of the merchant.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It is?” the merchant’s eyes lit up like wildfire.  “It is a…a ring of power?” The merchant clutched at the ends of his tunic like an eager schoolboy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wizard chuckled. “No, not quite.  It provides some resistance to fire.  No doubt it could be of aid to miners to face the great heat of a forge.  Or…perhaps it could provide a measure of protection against the fiery blast of a dragon’s breath.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wow,” Eli breathed, conjuring up images in his mind of the great wurms depicted on the walls of the Manor.  “Have you ever seen a dragon?”&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh yes.  You aren’t a real wizard until you’ve…introduced yourself to one.  But the ones I have met have been rather friendly—fortunate for me, is it not?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A friendly dragon?” Eli looked puzzled. “The Temple of Marr preaches that the dragons want to destroy the Realms, but that they will be defeated at the hands of humans, led by Mithaniel Marr in a last Great Battle.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And what do the wood elves say?” the wizard asked.  Eli looked down on his tunic shamefacedly.  He could not remember.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Everyone has different opinions about dragons,” the wizard went on. “And nearly all of them are wrong.”  The wizard turned back to the merchant.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ll take it.”  A few shiny platinum pieces dropped into the merchant’s stubby hands.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I think you will find that more than sufficient.”  The merchant nodded his head vigorously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh yes, m’Lord that will do, that will do nicely!  Very good, m’Lord, very good!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now I must bid you good day, I must make my way to the Temple without further delay.  I think, however, that I am missing something.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eli looked about him dumbly until he realized that the wizard’s staff was still clutched in his hands.  He murmured a quick apology as the cool wood was taken from reluctant fingers.  The magick that had so tingled his body immediately left, making him feel cold and a bit dizzy.  He managed to blurt out one last question before the wizard could become swallowed up in the crowd.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Good Master, we keep records of our sales, and it would be of great service to us if we could have your name and residence?”   A tattered notebook appeared in the elf’s hands.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wizard gazed at the youth intently for a moment before answering.  Then he drew himself up as though announcing an introduction before a king.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am known as Faenir, of the House of Lithandryl, Evoker of the Keeper of Arts, at the service of my Lord Thex, King of the Feir’dal.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The high-elf gave a regal bow then was gone, his golden head bobbing through the mass of the crowd.  Eli glanced down at his notebook.  Faenir, of the House of Lithandryl.   He had heard of that name before, but he couldn’t place where.  He would have to ask Magistir Lugo, the old goat knew everything about the history and politics of the Realms.   <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He wondered what a high elf wizard was doing in Freeport; perhaps he had come to help with the war against the Deathfist orcs?  Or broker a truce with neighboring Qeynos?   Freeport seemed to be at war with everyone of late.  Just the other day the Freeport Militia had assembled in the City Square, just west of the Marketplace.  Eli was able to sneak atop a pavilion and watch as the knights and warriors split into military formations.  Great shouts had flown up from the crowds along the streets.  “Long live Freeport!” “For the glory of Marr!” and even “Death to the Usurpers!”  Eli, however, had felt nothing but a sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach.  He could not generate any enthusiasm for war, nor did he feel very patriotic.   He belonged in the woods, with his own people, seeding the trees and singing to the stars.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Eli what matter with you, never seen a high elf before?” the Skunk spat, giving him a shot on the arm with a stubby fist.  The Skunk let out a belch of a laugh and began to shake his bag of coins to the left and the right.  Eli tried his best to hide his distaste of this unashamed display of gloating greed.  He wondered how he ever let himself become apprenticed to such a man.  Why not one of the priests at the Temple?  He could spend his days reading about the religions of the Realms, perhaps even learn more about his own people.  Or he could be tending to horses at the stables, the great tanned equestrians brought over from the Karanas.  He could even be apprenticed to one of the city wizards and learn a share of magick, as an elf he would be able to learn quickly enough.  But no, the gods conspired rather to torment him with this bloated beast, whose conception of virtue was getting drunk at sundown and stumbling home with a giggling whore on either arm, then show up at Temple the next morning to be forgiven his transgressions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The Marrs are just gods, but also forgiving.  They know how weak humans are, after all they created us,” the Skunk said to him once after Eli had made some disparaging comment about his illicit activities.  As ridiculous as the statement was, it was the most philosophical comment he ever heard from his Master.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come now Eli, we have done well today but there is always more gold to be had!”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eli trudged back to the tent, but his mind was on the curious visitor from afar.  The way that the wizard had knowingly smiled at him, that warm feeling of the staff radiating in his hands, the talk of dragons, Eli could not help but feel that suddenly his world had taken a turn.  Just where it would lead, Marr only knew.<br>
