<br>
if you are agro'ing mobs, you simply suck at playing a wizard.  we do not have enough mana regen to agro mobs in a fight.  cast your spells at the end, and if you really suck, use concussion.  i have over 100 days playing my wiz and agro has never been a problem. (hint: on large hp mobs that take multi-groups, realize that there are only so many slots on a mobs hate list, don't be one of them, i.e. wait to cast until the melee have the slots filled).<br>
<br>
maintaining any kind of respectable damage output in fights is the ONLY real issue we need to be addressing to them at this time.<br>

Bump this to the rant board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondly, aggro IS a problem even for wizards who are talented and seasoned.  If I am in kael, and mobs have been sufficiently taunted for 15 seconds or so, and I hit a giant with a 16 dd spell to at least get faction,(i.e. low level fire spell) I should NOT be getting aggro'd.  No, I haven't had a large problem with aggro.  No I wasn't sitting down.  It is a definite issue.  Not the biggest.  Damage/Mana efficiency is the biggest to me.  But still an issue.<br>
<br>
And the comment about aggroing means you suck...  A good wizard should be willing to take risks when they believe it will help the kill as a whole.  Most wizards who only nuke when it is 100% safe, get thrown out... FAST!  And I personally wouldn't blame the group if I was doing that.  Am I saying be dangerous all the time?  NO WAY!  But one has to size up the situation and chose the right moments to take risks.<br>

I try to nuke just on the edge of aggro.. you know what i mean where you nuke him and he doesnt turn to you until you sit and then stand back up real quick.. Hit concussion and keep nukin.<br>

Its something I play with in different situations to make sure I burn as much as needed/possible to keep my mana about the same as the healer/other grp members.<br>

learn your mobs, how much to burn and when to use concussion. you will find yourself much more useful.<br>

agro is a bit much i admit, but if we didnt have any agro at all what would be the fun, the risk is in overburning and pulling a mob when we dont want to, we have to fine tune our nuking. but i just dont feel right if i dont get whacked at least 2 times per fight   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And what they mean by that is this:<br>
<br>
I can technically cast about 6 Ice Comets.  That's 6720 damage to the target, a tidy sum of damage.  However, if I do so, I have just aggroed the monster to a berserk level of hatred that NO force will pull off me, unless an enchanter happens to successfully mindwipe it.  I wouldn't even get the third one cast, it would be on me like white on rice after two casts, unless the monster is nearly dead anyway... which sort of negates the need to cast quickly and the point of having fast chain casting.<br>
<br>
Thus, aggro is a problem, it prevents Wizards from successfully carrying out their task.  Concussion is an aid with this, and there are some tricks to work around it, but this comes up in discussions where someone says &quot;nobody does damage faster doood!!!&quot; and it is pointed out that doing that damage quickly gets you turned into a red smear on the ground.  Thus, aggro is a problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulifty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lifty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 4:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: absor/agro</span><hr size=1> I don't have a problem with agro.  Yes, I agro mobs, but only when I mean to (i.e. for exp in multi-groups, or to save someone else's ass).  I guess I'm the luckiest wizzy around, and it has nothing to do with skill.<br>
<br>
it is NOT the wizards job to yank a mob off the cleric.  that is the tanks/enchanters job.  if you feel you must do something, waste some mana and stun/root/concussion, don't yank it on you.<br>
<br>
i should have used the words &quot;unintentionally agro&quot; instead of agro.<br>
<br>
btw, use flux staff in kael for faction.<br>
<br>
if you are grouped and constant pulling and agro'ing, you are sitting oom through some fights instead of rationing yourself to an even amount of damage on all mobs (which is small comparitively to the melee's, our REAL problem).<br>
<br>
if you are multi-group raiding a single target, and need to empty a full bar, wait until its safe to get off one nuke, nuke, concussion, nuke, concussion, nuke nuke nuke...whatever.<br>
<br>
It's an art, and it is the MAIN thing you need to be skilled in.  You have to get to a level where you &quot;feel&quot; how much a mob hates you at all times, and how much hate your next move will make, and when.<br>
<br>
If I ever misjudge that hate, which is rare, i set at a distance where i can cast concussion before the mob gets to me, and have it hotkeyed.  In that rare scenario, the mob returns to the melee spot before they realize its moved. <br>
<br>
Fast Stun/root/concussion is another method.  Use your brains wizzies, this is what we are SUPPOSED to be able to do.<br>
<br>
I knew some people will argue this with me, but I suspect you are the ones that STARTED the trend of making wizards non-group friendly.  Those I mean that cannot control agro, and are constantly making the melee's run all over the place.  I wouldn't want to have wizards in my group either if that was my experience from them.<br>
<br>
Am (was) I the luckiest wizard around?  Or are there other wizzies out there that share my sentiment?  Or, are all the good wizzies already retired (like mine) and don't even read this board anymore (like I shouldn't be)?<br>

It is too much of a blanket statement.  If you are talking about being a &quot;good wizard&quot; then you need to be able to adjust with the situation.  In a multi mob pull where the tanks are ALREADY splitting their resources, and your chanter is getting hacked on by another, you had better HOPE that the wizard in your group has the !@#$^! to overnuke to get that mob off the cleric.  I just mean to gain aggro.  NOT nuke yourself into oblivion.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is an art of not getting hit.  But that only applies when things are going the way of the group.  You seem to think that the issue is black and white.  To aggro, or not to aggro.  There are so many situations where aggroing actually becomes appropriate.  And there is so much &quot;in between&quot; area.   It is a complete no-brainer to make the assessment that a wizard who constantly aggros doesn't know what they are doing.  You're not really going out on a limb with that one.  It is a given and doesn't even need to be mentioned.<br>
<br>
The truth of the matter is... people have more respect for a wizard who knows when to take the hit.  I do not have concussion.  I have never used concussion.  I have no need for concussion.  And I can still output as much as the next guy taking my fair share of hits.  In a standard exp group, you do still have hitpoints, so USE them to your advantage.  THAT is where the skill is.  Not just nuking when it seems safely convenient.  And I would say that HELPS my chances to find groups becuase people KNOW I play smart and am willing to take some for the group.  Many others do the same thing.  It isn't a revelation.  Playing smart is not playing YOUR way, or simply playing ONE way.  It is adjusting to every single scenario out there.  And there are many.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is... controling aggro does not mean AVOIDING aggro.  Using it to your advantage is the true skill.<br>
<br>
The point of aggro being a problem is when a tank taunts for several seconds and one nuke pulls it off.  That is simply a logic and mechanics flaw on verants part.  Not a wizard tactical flaw or a question of intelligence.<br>
<br>
Do I think your way is wrong?  No... but it is only ONE way.  And you can't tell me that every single wizard who posts on this site is not &quot;good&quot; because they don't do it your way.  Learning how to avoid aggro was a lesson easily picked up in the early 20's, if not earlier.  I don't think you could find many level 60's out there who have NOT learned the lesson well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other players don't say &quot;We don't want you in groups because you aggro too much.&quot;  They say &quot;we don't want you because we feel the need can be filled better with [insert class].&quot;  Other classes aren't crying about wizards as a whole because they aggro too much.  Its because they view our group functionality as limited.<br>
<br>
It is not enough to say &quot;aggro spells idiocy.&quot;  But at the same time, I believe that there is a point where a wizard is able to step BEYOND the normal &quot;timing your nukes&quot; strategy and begin to take control of the situation using other means.  NO, I don't mean &quot;nuke til you drop and get group killed in the process.&quot;  But there is a &quot;middle area&quot; not even being addressed here.<br>
<br>
My point on aggro being a problem is simply a mechanical and programming issue.  How a 16 DD spell could aggro the same as Sunstrike in certain situations.  That is not gameplayer intelligence.  That is game development. <p><img src="http://wraithwave.homestead.com/files/Wraith.gif" border="0"><BR><img src="http://wraithwave.homestead.com/files/Wraith2.gif" border="0"><BR><img src="http://wraithwave.homestead.com/files/Wraith3.gif" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujacestar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jacestar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/01 2:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: absor/agro</span><hr size=1> i completly aggree with wraithwave  ive had this discussion a few times with   50+ wizards on cazicthule  and even a couple times in shout in DL  and every &quot;uber&quot; wizard ive ever talked to has said adaptabilty is the key to being a great wizard.<br>

Here is an example, I nook a mob it has enuff life that if i nook it again i will nock it in to run fase so i blast with anouther spell, resisted and the mob now wants me for lunch and ignores the tanks as if i had just acumilated the agro points for two consecuative high level nukes when it was at full life.  Of course in this situation its a little easeir for the tanks to get mobs attention back then at a start of a fight cuz they've gained some hate points up.  But come on if its resisted it shouldn't care much about me.  lets say im in a fight and im a melle mob and a caster to the right of me cast a spell and it does absolutely nothing, am i going to chase down that caster or am i going to deal with the guy in my fase because he's doing damage and the other wizard type isnt.  theoreticaly i could go into a place were all the mobs are red and barely to high a level for me to hurt, and chain cast on them and probably get there attention with ever spell being resisted.<br>

The real problem is in the definition of what makes a spell get resisted in the first place.  Did your spell get absorbed by the creature's armor/hide/scales, in which case it might feel it without takeing damage, or does the magical energy just do nothing based on the armor, in which case the mob doesn't feel it.<br>
<br>
That's the issue I have with how resists work, if &quot;shards of ice&quot; have the ability to cut, then that means it's a physical type of damage, and shouldn't be resistable as such.  If you freeze the mob, then yea, that's more of a, &quot;It's getting frostbite&quot; type of thing.  Burning a mob should be the least resistable type of spell for most types of mobs, that along with magic(lightning) for damage. <br>
<br>
Why is root resisted for example?  Root might be dodged, as projections of ground that come up to envelop your feet MIGHT be avoided, but if you have your feet stuck in solid rock, that's NOT something that can be resisted, only avoided, or broken free of.  Atol's Spectral Shackles, how are these NOT going to link the feet of the mob together?  It could be broken, but how do you avoid something like that, it's magic based!  The only thing that might happen would be magical boots/leggings that resist the spell.  If your spell is cast and it says something like, &quot;Projections of rock reach up to grasp the feet of %t, but %t jumps and avoids it&quot;, that would be a hell of a lot better than &quot;%t has resisted.&quot;.  Basically, Verant was very lazy about their reasons for resists, they followed the lame Dungeons and Dragons &quot;Saving Throw&quot; concept, but didn't think about the idea behind it.  If a human, ANY human, ends up in the path of dragon breath, unless there's magical protection, that human is dead.  The only hope is to dodge the effect, or have a complete sphere of resistance around you.<br>
