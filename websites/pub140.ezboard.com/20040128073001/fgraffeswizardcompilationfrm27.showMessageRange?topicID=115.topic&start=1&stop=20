<br>
Need some cheese with that whine? <br>
-Healing classes are hard to kill not unkillable.  It isn't supposed to be EASY to kill someone who specializes in defense.  <br>
<br>
-Bards have always been almost impossible to kill solo for just about everyone join the club.<br>
<br>
-90+% of warriors don't HAVE 8k hp or any way to stop you from kiting them.<br>
<br>
-With the truely messed up resists spell resists shouldn't be terrible vs non ubers/bards.<br>
<br>
Snares/roots will land on some, less on TZ/VZ/SZ than RZ I know. At the high end snare/root shouldn't land AT ALL so count yourself lucky.  It trivializes combat enough already.<br>
<br>
Spare me your whines about how lacking your arsenal is. <br>
<br>
Lure of ro still hits for 800-850 focused in pvp nearly every time in a fraction over 3 seconds. 2-4 blasts will kill most people even if you use nothing else.<br>
<br>
Bigger non lure blasts can serve as opening moves dramaticly reducing the targets hp especially with a crit.<br>
<br>
Nuke then burn is still going to be pretty damn deadly.<br>
<br>
I fail to see how making it impossible to one shot people effectively cripples wizards in pvp.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/03 10:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This is how:</span><hr size=1> It takes too long for a wizard to effectively kill any class with the arsenal of spells we get to chose from, while being protected by any of the gear, spells, buffs, heal potions, or fast horses currently being offered in the game long enough to stay alive to kill a person with 1/10 th the aa, or 5 levels lower then us.   If we can't kill, and we have no defense..wtf are we supposed to do ?  Gate ?  This from a purely OFFENSIVE class ?  <br>
<br>
We are now at a disadvantage 95% of the time, irrespective of level, aa's or skill.  Yeah, seems fair to me /scoff.<br>
<br>
Let me explain something else to you:<br>
<br>
Seems you need a little excercise in casting reality.  This is how casting currently works with PvP.  Now, the given is that you are uber enough to have haste casting focus, and haste casting aa's, and anti-interupt aa's (I know most of you do not, but this is the BEST case scenario, assuming your a 130 + aa'd wizard, making this even more absurd.)  <br>
<br>
You see a Warrior, Sk, Rogue, X Melee  ..IF they have run speed III, jboots, sow, soe, Seleos, horse etc..(Most do, btw..and consequently..FAR easier then the aforementioned casting aa's, its like 5 to one in difficulty of obtaining..advantage melee's)..and run at me, and attempt to hit me ?  Guess what, 90% of the time, they not only hit me for about 1 K  (1/2 my ToTal HP..advantage Melee), they interupt my spell !! Imagine that..I now just stood there, wasted my epic skin (all wizards have this, right?), and knocked the first bubble of health off my meter..and I havn't even scratched him yet ! (advantage Melee)  What you say ?  How come you didn't use your 3 second fast casting 850 damage aa ?  Well I would have, except the only difference would have been, I would have hit his 200 FR butt for about 35 damage, if I crit..and I have the mana to take him to 80% health that way.. (advantage Melee).  <br>
<br>
Well, you say, what if he starts running away from you ?  Hmm, assuming you can catch up to him (if you cannot, fight over  ala gate  ..no advantage, both can leave when they want to leave..)  and when you catch him, stop..start casting..then enjoy your &quot;your target is out of range message&quot; ..wth you say..how can that be ?  /shrug,  but it is.<br>
<br>
Hmm, what if nobodies running, and you stand there, trying to dodge, and cast ..  Well, if your the wizard, you'll die.  Period.  (strong advantage Melee).<br>
<br>
So, to recap:<br>
<br>
Wizards cannot cast effectively.  That is all they have.  Wizards die too quickly if they try to cast.  Melee's die only if they want to, and only if they are foolish enough to allow themselves to get in range without interupting the caster 5-10 times..pretty damned moronic.   Melee's can BUY insta heal potions, once the mana is gone, a wiz is SoL.  Healers can not only heal, but damage a Wizard quite damned effectively in PvP as well..There is nothing equal or fair about the current state of PvP.  This is not how it should be.<br>
<br>
A equally equipped Wiz vs ANY class should be a good fight, not a 9 win vs 1 win joke.   April 8th was a good one. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A> at: 4/10/03 11:14:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aerimusshadowborn>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Regarding melees</span><hr size=1> So all melees hit for 1k dmg per melee round interupting all your spells.  We all have 2 fr and shrug off 60+ lures with ease with our 200 fr. Nice fantasy.<br>
<br>
Lets return to reality now shall we?<br>
<br>
Casters without 60+ focus can obtain no rent facimiles from your friendly local mage.  Once obtained if desired they can be stashed at the end of each play session on a corpse to retain them.<br>
<br>
Lures have a neg 300 resist check.  Even melees with 200 fr/cr will eat full damage most of the time.  Most melees will actually have a lot less since they must focus more now than ever on mr to avoid roots/snares/blinds.<br>
<br>
Per round melee damage isn't anywhere near 1k for any class out there.  The average will probably suprise you.  The average is a lot lower than the max. Some quick estimates...<br>
<br>
Bard about 50<br>
Sk/Pally 150 with 2her<br>
Monk/Ranger/warrior duel wielding about 80-90<br>
Monk/Ranger/Warrior duel wielding around 180<br>
Rogue w/o bs about 80<br>
Rogue with bs 1/2 the time about 200<br>
<br>
You should only take this damage at all when you stop to cast as they will have difficulty hitting you otherwise.<br>
<br>
In the real world big bangs have their uses as well.<br>
<br>
In the real world melee damage can be avoided cheesily with levitation.  In the real world there is also such a thing as shadow step/yonder.<br>
<br>
In the real world stacked damage shields can eat a rogue as well.<br>
<br>
In the real world high end wizards who don't get bashed are rarely interupted by standard issue melee.<br>
<br>

Picture having one hand tied behind your back, the other holding the brick.  Now..imagine somebody is starting to press a knife into your side as you are holding the brick.<br>
<br>
You have 2 choices:  <br>
<br>
1) You can continue to hold the brick above your head, and allow the knife to be pressed between your ribs..painfully killing you..<br>
<br>
2)  You can take the hand/knife away with your hand that is holding the brick above your head, allowing the brick to crash upon your skull, killing you..but you avoided the knife.<br>
<br>
This is known as a conundrum.  This is Wizard PvP.  See you have both hands available for you, we do not.  We either gate and live, or die trying to kill.<br>
<br>
 How do I prevent you from doing damage exactly as I stand there to do damage myself (cast) ?  Answer:  I do not, I cannot. I need to stand still for 4.5 seconds, and Aerimus, I have max focus IV..I have to, If I don't, I am even more vulnerable..Don't suggest the obvious..like..to avoid spells, there is this thing called resist gear you can buy..no shit.  We play on a PvP Server.  I have 210-285 self buffed resists..I have 100 K horse that doesnt have start stop ability..I have FT 16 ON 2 ITEMS, leaving me the other slots for HP/resists.  I have 140 AA's.  YOu know what ?  I get owned all day in the arena by people labled &quot;Baron&quot;.  Why ?<br>
<br>
How do YOU prevent me from doing damage while doing damage to me ?  Answer:  It is inherent to you doing damage to me...see, as you are doing damage to ME, you are also sucessfully interupting my ability to do damage you.. how convienient..<br>
<br>
To make this real simple for you:<br>
<br>
When you do damage you can ALSO interupt me !!  Thereby preventing me from doing damage at all..and killing me at the same time.<br>
<br>
Aerimus doing Damage + Interupting = pretty good shit.<br>
<br>
Wizard doing damage while standing there (casting) + no chance to interupt Melee damage = Pretty jacked up shit.<br>
<br>
Before you claim that a wizard will fast cast through any melee .. let me assure you, we have all been interupted by Rogues..they hit damned fast.  Also, throw in the new Defense mitigation Sony just patched in..We cannot even cast through GREEN MOBS..any questions ?<br>
<br>
So while you are attacking us, you have the ability to interupt our damage the majority of the time.  We have no such ability, to prevent you from doing damage .. We need to gate.  Do listen to you come here, and spew things from your perch that are not remotely &quot;real&quot; and claim them to be &quot;real world&quot; scenerios is almost comical.  You have no clue.  You are not even of high enough level to give an accurate ascertation as to how PvP scales after 100 AA's..  <br>
<br>
Go get your Rogue to the point where he is 100% AA&quot;d  geared for optimum PvP and then talk to me..I don't expect Ferarri to be talking race lessons from Hyundai, nor would I expect you to have extensive  highest level pvp experience.  Go play more, and gain some &quot;real &quot;perspective&quot; please  -  and stop attacking Wizards with 3 x the exp as you, and expect to have an advantage all the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aerimusshadowborn>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/03 1:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bull</span><hr size=1> HTML Comments are not allowed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aerimusshadowborn>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/03 1:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bull</span><hr size=1> Maybe if your getting smeared in the arena you should try some REAL pvp.<br>
<br>
Regarding the time you have to sit and take melee dmg. Its 4.5 pre haste 3.6 post haste and about 2.6 once you figure out they can't hit you for a second after you stop.<br>
<br>
Regarding melees and more specificly rogues.  Someone duel wielding 20 dly weapons will maybe squeeze in 2 rounds of melee combat into that time with max item haste.<br>
<br>
Thats 0-8 hits averaging out at 4 duel wield/double attack/miss ratios being what they are. 4 hits doesn't interupt a high lvl caster almost ever thanks.<br>
<br>
As far as damage your looking at between 160 damage from 4 melee hits to 1 hit on average from a 2her for near the same per cast of a spell that will do 650-850 depending on what spell/lvl we're talking about.<br>
<br>
Add backstab into the mix and we're talking about another 250ish dmg on average for every round that lands.  Then again backstab doesn't refresh instantly so if you take a few seconds to evade then cast again you'll get 2 casts per stab attempt.  If you have the good sense to turn if he tries to get behind you that and lag will most likely kill about 1/2 of those attempts.<br>
<br>
In other words every 4th cast you'll be looking at an extra nip off your hp.  Not exactly fearsome unless the rogue gets lucky and lands a few doubles for 500-700.<br>
<br>
The point is on average your looking at taking around less than 1/4-1/3 the damage your dishing out.<br>
<br>
Thats if you consent to stay on the ground and don't just fly overhead dishing out nukes.<br>
<br>
Clue from me to you.  Melees aren't overpowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brilinvz>BrilinVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/14/03 8:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bull</span><hr size=1> Aerimus, what server do you play on?<br>
<br>
And you guys are forgetting the best thing... Stun kick/bash.  Seems to me while your standing there trying to cast lure of ro, you get kicked once and your screwed.<br>
<br>
If you are fighting somone who is 65 and has decent gear, chances are the wizard will lose every time.  If your oppenent is too stupid to have resist armour on, you may get a lucky agnars off and do 1400 damage (thats if your extremely lucky).  But what are the chances of sitting there unnoticed for 6 seconds?<br>
<br>
NO melee (rogues aside) will EVER use 1h weapons in PvP.  Two reasons, a) Jousting, because there is lots of movement its better to attack in short bursts that 2h can provide.  b) damage shields, I know they can be dispelled, but hey guess what, they can also be recast.  A strong damage shield against a warrior or ranger(heh... as if they still aren't using gimped AM3 kiting) will take quick a chunk off<br>
<br>
Q<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
Thats 0-8 hits averaging out at 4 duel wield/double attack/miss ratios being what they are. 4 hits doesn't interupt a high lvl caster almost ever thanks<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Okay, so how often at level 65 does a melee miss?  How much damage are they really doing in PvP at that point?  Your more or less guarenteed to get hit AT least 3 times while casting a lure, thats if they are using a 2h weapon.  As I stated before, that kick (if it hits) generally screws over that casting round.  So you've just takin 400+ damage and have dealt none.<br>
<br>
Wizards are gimped in PvP (half the reason I quit).  Either you got lucky and found a guy with no resists, or you do the extremely gimped MB and nexus gate (Neyfear practically invented this great gimpness).  Wizards are only good to use now in mass PvP, even then, you have to be lucky to not get noticed or your going down quick.<br>

As far as what your experiences have been with PvP against me, I am not sure which of the aforementioned applies to you and your guild..heh, but I bet I could guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=annoid>Annoid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/16/03 10:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Answer</span><hr size=1> Verant/SOE clearly has an axe to grind against wizards.

The miss ratio remains about 1/3 even at high lvls and average damage per hit remains a fraction of max.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say that melee damage isn't good.  Misses, duel wield/double attack rolls, and variable damage is just how the melee combat system works.  The remaining fraction can be 100+ dps with the aid of a group member providing haste and a clear shot at a mobs back.<br>
<br>
Your point about bash is valid but only 1 out of 3 pure melees has this skill.  I wasn't speaking of hybrids. <br>
<br>
As far as warriors go they may be able to bash but they have no way of slowing down a levitating or kiting caster thus they are vulnerable.<br>
<br>
Regarding duel wielding vs 2hers.  I agree but for rogues that isn't an option.  <br>
<br>
Also my calculation was based on how many attacks you could manage with a pair of fast 1hers.  I'd be suprised if you managed more than one round with a slow 2her as stated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=velaelsoulrender>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>The Snuggly SZ'r!</span><br>  Posts: 1039<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/18/03 9:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Melees</span><hr size=1> Wow, anyone who bitches about pvp as a wizard after pop needs to be shot for pure fucking stupidity.<br>

You don't get deathtouch every 2 hours now, GOOD FOR THE GAME, that shit needed to be nerfed badly. If you can't kill people with all the ridiculous pvp spells that came with PoP (Force Shield, Lure of Thunder/Ro, Draught of Thunder) and with the stupidly good AA's for pvp you still have (Strong Root, 2x Instant Escapes, Crit9, Quick Damage) AND not to mention focus effects up to 30% additional damage.<br>
<br>
Your a fucking whining retard, and an embarassment to anyone who's really a pvp wizard. There's a term for that - &quot;no talent assclown&quot;<br>
<br>
Hell, I just noticed you used the term &quot;Ferrari&quot; to describe yourself, a member of the biggest fucking joke guild of VZ (who still haven't even killed CURSED for Christ's sake). If you are getting whiped by Defiant melees in Elemental gear, well ... that has nothing to do with being a wizard. Are you even cracking 2k hp unbuffed? Wizards, especially with PoP gear and spells, are the single best pvp class in the game, no contest. It's not even close.<br>

Think of this, ANYONE who can heal, and has some resists (causing the wizard to only use lures) can outheal a wizard.  So instantly, Druids, shamans, clerics, paladins, and yes, even rangers are more or less unkillable provided they aren't retarded.<br>
<br>
Wizards are by no means the best, I think that title now goes to SK's.  Hell, I've seen SKs that were increadible in PvP and were able to kill people 3 different ways.  Just spells, just melee, or just the press of one fricken button.  I dont think I have ever seen a 60+ SK die in one on one PvP. <br>

<br>
Wizards are 1 of the top 2 or 3 offensive classes, and combine that with the fact they have more survivability than any other in the game (yonder, gate, instant gate, instant GROUP evac, force shield, spellshield, levitate). Combined, that makes them the best pvp class under almost any circumstance, and certainly the most deadly. No other class has the ability to hit for 1500+ unresistable damage in less than 4 seconds - like I do every 5th cast. No other class lands 3500+ pvp shots like you'll get with Strike (and more often than you think).<br>
<br>
Now, because we don't outlast people in drawn out duels doesn't mean wizards aren't supreme in the role of killing people fast - I've seen wizards jump groups of 6 and have 2 dead before anyone knew what was going on. Hands down, best pvp class in the game and it's not really close.<br>
<br>
As for SK's in PvP, I've played with 2 of the best ever in EQ pvp (Splorge on VZ, Meatdawg on SZ). I understand just how powerful they are, but best overall? They can't get away like we can - which is a highly underated ability <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;font-family:courier;font-size:small;">&quot;It never stops hurting, you just go faster...&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> - <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Greg LeMond</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=velaelsoulrender>Velael Soulrender</A> at: 4/19/03 10:09:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 1:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Veleal Polestencher</span><hr size=1> Inbetween your sessions with your little &quot;friend&quot;, perhaps you might want to visit an alter existence, the rest of us would refer to as reality.  <br>
<br>
In response to your completely moronic and sophomoric personal, albiet completely CLUELESS attacks:  The personal rancor reflected in those comments, I don't care to dignify with comment; However, I would like to address your general attitude of egocentric ignorance.<br>
<br>
1)  I won the caster best of best ..  Yes, I suck.<br>
<br>
2)  250-320 self resists.  2500 hp + self buffed.  100K horse, and 500 + more in the bank..yeah, I have no idea on gear, and their effects on pvp.  In fact,   I run around in GuK gear mainly, I think the look is cool, and I am sure this helps me immensly in PvP as I figure they are so taken aback by my appearance, it gains me an extra 15-20 rounds of attacks.  It's my own version of rapture.<br>
<br>
2a)  You are not on my server, so what knowledge do you    have of me, or my guild ?  I thought so.  <br>
<br>
3)  Your server actually perpetuated the MB nerf, as the art of &quot;ganking&quot; was actually invented there by wizards such as yourself.  Yes, killing an afk person is truely a talent to be proud of.  /scoff.  Try honor, and respect for a change, maybe your outlook on PvP will evolve into something worth posting about.<br>
<br>
Let me clue you in on something you bozon clown.<br>
<br>
PvP on our server is not about leving yourself up, hiding in a tree, and &quot;killing 2-3 people before they knew what hit them&quot; -  IE GANKING ..   That is NOT talent, not the type of PvP that I care to debate.  Killing 2-3 level 58 chars that have no chance at resisting your spells, and that are actually stupid enough to hang around for the 4-12 casts it would take you to do that is not something to be proud of, nor anything you should be posting about here as an example of our clear prowess as a PvP class. I can hide in a wall too, and kill people that have no ability to counter.  I choose to highlight the real battles, you know, the ones when they are trying to fight back ?  Try it once, it's alot different then the &quot;gank technique&quot; you describe.<br>
<br>
Perhaps your claiming these people are of equal level and aa's as yourself, and that your killing these people with your self - dilusional &quot;talent &quot; ?  To that end, Mr. Polestencher, I call you a blatant liar.  How stupid are the people you are fighting on your server ?  If your any indication, maybe that was a rhetorical question, and you have a point.   <br>
<br>
I would like to point out, that unless your exploiting, you are not going to kill 2 people worth attacking on my server as a wizard  ..you have to be a complete moron to allow a caster to burn down 2 people and not interrupt him, or kill them..see, we can be interrupted, and will go down pretty fast with 5 K hp..  If you dispute this, meet me in the arena with a 65 Warior with CF, and i'll be happy to show you.  What you claim is simply BS, but I guess you just like to hear yourself  squawk.<br>
<br>
Strong root = dispellable you nescient fool.  A SK can be unrooted, and killing you with 1 click of a golem wand or annul potion if need be.  You fight clueless SK's as well I guess.   No, your name dropping BS doesn't impress me either.  I have fought Splorge before (even killed him), and let me tell you something, he would be nothing in today's realm of aa's and gear.  Oh, you know there is a refresh time on this right ?  So what do you do once this has dropped ?  Use Atol's, greater fetter ?  Do people on your server run around with 80 MR ? (That's MAGIC RESISTANCE btw, you know, hte stuff that resists our spells.  See, if they get thier resists higher, they actually resist the only way we can do damage, or keeping them off us..amazing how that works.)<br>
<br>
We have more survivabilty ?  What, insta gates/evacs ?   Yeah, thats impressive, &quot;See Velael run&quot;.   -The book was great, but I thought the movie kinda sucked. -<br>
<br>
So you are master of ganking and getting away.  I heard about Wizards like you on your loot server.  Ganking people at portals, stealing their gear, then insta evacing.  /appluad  Nice job, look what you managed to get nerfed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        Glad to hear you don't miss it now that you've sufficiently profited from it.  I also remember the people that were the most immature, most annoying  that left VZ to SZ when it came out, because their reputation was so tainted on Vallon, they had to leave.  I see one has resurfaced here.<br>
<br>
Oh, btw, all your spells are uninteruptable, right ?  Sounds like it, or are you just ignoring this fact, as it doesn't back your arguement ?  Ignorance is truly blissful, except on you.<br>
<br>
Healing classes.  Oh wise, one, could you please give us a detailed account of how you &quot;OWN&quot; these chars with your &quot;talent&quot; ?  Please, enlighten us poor folk on your L33T skillzzz as you say on SZ.<br>
<br>
While your at it, please tell us how you &quot;Own&quot; Lifeburn Necros, that can LB you through your skins/spellshield, invuln themselves in 1.0 seconds, heal to full, then start taping you with Thule for 600-1200 damage every 5 secs..while healing themselves at the same time..with your hp ? (thats what a tap does btw, if I needed to slow it down for you,  please, feel free to ask me to elaborate as I know how dendrite tentacles can cause mass confusion.  My grandfather had the same ailment, they called it Alzheimers.  God bless him.)<br>
<br>
Ahh, and Bards..How do you &quot;own&quot; them ?  Please give us a detailed account of how this is done, sir.  <br>
<br>
Clearly, you must have the answer to these questions, don't you ?  Or are you just blowing a bunch of BS up our butts so you can make an unfounded personal attack upon somebody that is giving the honest perspective about the current state of PvP, not some gankfest perspective.  I wish you were on my server, I really do.  I would love the chance to show you how limited my paradigm on PvP is.   The autoecism you describe only happens on your server, and I wouldnt be bragging about that if I were you.   On my server, people that play like that aren't known as &quot;no talent ass-clowns&quot;, but known as &quot;assholes&quot; .  Thanks for confirming this notion. Next.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I found it fittingly ironic that a person that hangs around  people with the names of &quot;Splorge&quot;, and &quot;Meatdawg&quot; has the signature stating -  &quot;It never stops hurting, you just go faster &quot;  ...   /ponder      You are truly the PvP queen my friend, truly the queen.  <br>

I'm sorry you don't even know your own server history <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I don't have manaburn, I refuse to buy it for the single purpose that it has ruined pvp in any environment. What's funny is to see people like you who are whining up a storm because they can't one shot people anymore. That's the ONLY THING that the 75% max did, that's it. You can't one shot with burn anymore, every other pvp skill you had before is still there. If you aren't some manaburn 'ganker' then you should actually LIKE this change.<br>
<br>
Now, you also seem to have a severe lack of knowledge of my server. There is no item loot, wizards don't sit and portal camp for gear ... that's Rallos. As for Vallon, don't tell me what it's like. I played 2 years there, and finally left in disgust over the shape of the server, and the fact that wankers like you were the growing breed. Most of my guild on SZ is old VZ people, trust me .. we know the server inside and out. Ask about Prophets, people still know who ran the server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
So basically, you are a 65 wizard with less than 2000hp unbuffed (I don't care if you are 2500 self buffed, I'm almost 4000 - that's real gear, not the shit you are wearing) who is whining because Defiant elemental geared toons wear his ass out ... that's funny. I'm one of the very best geared pvp wizards on any server (top 10 easily) and have played one for almost 4 years now at various levels. Trust me, there's little I haven't seen ... and wizards are the top of the pvp food chain. If you haven't figured out how to use walls to help you channel, how to use rains (esp. lure rain omg) to force healers to move, and any of 10,000 other tricks, that's not really my problem. You aren't going to kill every class in every situation 1 on 1, EQ has that right. There is no &quot;god&quot; class, though wizards/necros and SK's are the closest, by far. Now, I know you aren't willing to admit you can't win every time, so it can't be fair, but unless you are a total moron you will win the majority of the time. And if you aren't, unlike almost any other class, wizards can get out it. Most other classes die for screwing up, we don't. That's huge.<br>
<br>
Don't embarass my class by coming here whining that you can't fucking one shot with manaburn anymore, it's a fucking joke (as are you, and your guild - a known collection of retarded gimps). Go whine about manaburn pvp nerf somewhere else, those of us that actually care about pvp are glad to see it happen. They didn't &quot;bend us over&quot; ... there was a time in Velious when it was fairly ugly as wizard pvp, but that was 18 months ago, Luclin and PoP were candyland for wizards.<br>
<br>
Finally, the Greg LeMond quote is in regards to bike racing (though it applies to all life), I'm a Cat3 racer - so it fits.<br>

See if you can stop patting yourself on your back long enough to listen for a change, I know it will be a struggle, but please try.   You don't know me, nor the history of my guild you previously labled as &quot;the most worthless guild ever&quot; or whatever..if you did, you'd know I was actually in Defiant with my first character, and that I received the first AoN on my server.   I said I killed Splorge..did you skip that part ?  Also, if you were capable of comprehending what I am &quot;whining&quot; about, and IF you ever had Manaburn, youd realize a few things:  <br>
<br>
1) Manaburn wasn't the &quot;One shot Kill&quot;/ talentless skill you think it is.  It was very much avoidable, and with the insane HP PoP geared people had, you'd better be 100% mana and fully buffed to kill some of the people..which is not 100% guaranteed btw.. Hell, I avoided many myself with Shiny Brass Idols.<br>
<br>
2) It is a completely worthless skill now, and there is no refund of points, although they completley changed the functionality of it on PvP servers.  People just don't stay at &lt; 75% long enough for you to cast a 5 sec skill (Focus/haste aa doesn't affect this) ..<br>
<br>
3)  As another &quot;real&quot; PvP wizard has already stated, any Bard, Healing class or PoP warrior will not be killed by a wizard now . PERIOD.  Unless they are incredibly inept, and that does not count.  You hear that ?  12 out of 15 classes unkillable with comparable gear to what I wear.<br>
<br>
4) To slander me because of a misinterpretted statement I made in reference to the level 62 Rogue preaching to me about how effective I can be in casting through melee damage is incredibly insensitive and moronic.  Do you read posts before you reply to them ?<br>
<br>
5) My gear rivals that of Defiant Wizards, if not surpasses.<br>
<br>
6) You sir, are acting the ass, and are so full of yourself, that you are incapable of experiencing embarrasment.  Yet, ironically, ala the Manaburn skill that you also do not possess..you condescend about something you have absolutely no business talking about.  Are you seriously coming here, and trying to justify a nerf to a skill that you have NEVER HAD ?  WTF is wrong with that picture ?   Is your experience so extensive that you should be the be-all-know all- about the situations surrounding this nerf ?  How many times have you used it again ?  Yeah, brilliant.   Or did you just stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night ?<br>
<br>
7)  So, we have 7-8 wizards in agreement on this thread, that without MB, we have to flee about 12 of the 15 classes.. Unless they are completely worhtless (maybe they are on your server /shrug) Yet you sit here, on your condenscending throne, telling us we OWN all classes.  Funny, I asked you to elaborate to the rest of this exactly how you do this, I called you a blatant LIAR. So where is your defense ?  Are you afraid I would put you in your place with a calculated disection of your so called invulerabilty strategy ?  Come on , oh great one, enlighten us, so I can destroy your God complex, and bring you down to earth with the rest of us.<br>
<br>
HOW do YOU kill (any class) with 200+ resists (you know this is common right ?), especially indoors.  Come on, share with us, or prove to us you are full of shit.  What guild am I in ?  Share that with us as well, maybe you can insult even more of us.  no  matter WHAT your gear, you still cast as fast as me..and a corner isnt always handy.<br>
<br>
I lived down the street from Greg in MN, I know who he is, hell I know his family, so yesh, I knew the reference, and I was simply toying with your namedropping embarrasments.<br>
<br>
More importantly; anyone have any idea how a self inflated ego will skew the persons paradigm out of realistic perspective, thereby allowing themselves to spew excrescent diatribe usually in the form meritless slandor ?    <br>
<br>
P.S <br>
<br>

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in curtailing this incorporeal bantor you spew here.  You are not worthy of my thoughts any further  /shoo flea  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A> at: 4/21/03 3:57:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brilinvz>BrilinVZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 9:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> wait a sec here</span><hr size=1> After looking at Vereals maeglo, assuming its correct, we are comparing apples and oranges here.  Here we have a very nicely equiped wizard, with an insane amount of AC/HP/resisists.  And wizards, who although have decent gear, is nothing in comparison.  I wish I could have had gear like that, but alas, I played very casually the first 2 years.<br>
<br>
With gear such as yours, you are able to stay alive that much longer, your HP is much higher, and I'm sure your AC is probably close to 750+ self buffed.  I realize AC on a caster really doesn't matter all that much, but every little bit helps.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, as you said you are one of the best equiped wizards on EQ...  how many people (not in Hate) can even come remotely close to your gear on SZ?  Your in the most powerful guild with the most powerful team.<br>
<br>
I'd actually be interested to know how many non Evil players have even got access to zones beyond PoI and PoD.<br>
<br>
As I said, we are comparing apples and oranges.  You have almost no competition.  On Vallon, with the uprising of 4 teaming guilds, everyone has some competition.  Other than Defiant, there are many guilds with equal sets of gear.  Up until Defiant had elemental access their gear wasn't all that much better than a lot of high leveled guilds.<br>
<br>
I know who Splorge and Nanak are, yes, they were increadible in PvP... 2 years ago.  I haven't seen either of them in ages.  Problem is a lot has changed since they played. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91121">Baron Brilin Riorolt</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
