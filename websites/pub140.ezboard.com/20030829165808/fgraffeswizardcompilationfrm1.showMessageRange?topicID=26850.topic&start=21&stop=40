I've never had manaburn and will never have it as it was. Yes, Verant gave wizards some uber tool. You have to be in thier mindset of how they view the game being played. Groups of different classes working together to win against the mobs. There should be risks. <br>
<br>
If teams of wizards were manaburning down high end, boss mobs, and then auctioning off the rights to loot said mob, then we only screwed ourselves. <br>
<br>
With many boss mobs, the spawn cycle being mesaured in days, it would be, and I'm sure was done, easy to dominate certain mobs, there by preventing anyone else the fun of taking them down for themselves. 6-13 wizards holding a mob &quot;hostage&quot; on one sever, effects everyone else on that server. <br>
<br>
I'm quite sure that manaburn was never meant to be used like this in the game, and just like how people couldn't stop using gravity flux to get past things, people weren't going to stop using manaburn to take down boss mobs. <br>
<br>
That doesn't mean it will never get changed again. I do agree, Mana burn should do more damage then the max damage regular casting does. <br>
<br>
Paladins got a nerf around the same time, and spoke up, and they said, ok, we will change it back. Monks got screwed, and then got fixed. <br>
<br>
Speaking up won't hurt, but lets take responisblity for what we did to ourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=targonis>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 777<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/03 4:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember Manaburn?</span><hr size=1> The two things ARE linked, though not directly.  Think about this from a pure balance perspective.<br>
<br>
Kunark dragons were made trivial by Manaburn.  Wern't they made trivial by Luclin equipment?<br>
<br>
For a time, there was a valid concern by players about manaburn, and how multiple wizards working together could take down pretty much any single mob.<br>
<br>
The game changed, and evolved.  The ability to have skills scaled down or not work on given mobs has evolved.  Expansions are released, class power goes up, and the class balance changes.  Yet old zones never change, only new zones.<br>
<br>
<br>
What this shows is that instead of Verant/SoE going around nerfing things, they could very well just update old zones so new abilities don't make them trivial.  Fix the old zones so the mobs meet the standards of the latest expansions.  A level 60 mob from any zone should be a level 60 mob should be a level 60 mob, no matter what expansion the mob came from.  The 32k HP cap should have been removed from all original EQ and Kunark mobs.  Retune the mobs so they are the desired difficulty.  Assume that all characters will have all expansions when you tune the zones.  <br>
<br>
Once the old zones meet the standards of the current game, the AA skills COULD be properly adjusted, and no one would be able to say, &quot;But in SolB, a level 5 character can kill Nagafen solo&quot;.  That's the problem with ANY nerf, they keep trying to balance items and abilities around different expansions.  Until the difference in available power from new expansions is removed, there will always be people who whine about the abilities of other classes.  Kunark mobs will ALWAYS be underpowered for people with Velious and beyond, Velious has all but become trivial for the majority of players with the power AA skills have brought to characters.   Guilds that arn't even considered uber can take down Avatar of War at this point.  <br>
<br>
So, Manaburn, there WERE reasons to nerf it when it was done, but those reasons are no longer fully valid.  As a result, it should be brought back as a useful skill.  The 1 minute timer on it's own would be enough to keep the skill from being exploited, so what's the reason for leaving it nerfed into uselessness?<br>

This would ruin the progression of the game. Not everyone is 60+ in a raid guild. There are still lots of people/guilds that consider taking down Gore a big accomplishment, even when they do it with 30+ people. For their style of play and level of gear it still is a big deal.<br>
<br>
Mudflation will happen no matter what, you can't tune old content to new gear/abilities without killing the game for anyone that wasn't passed the level of the old content to begin with. If AoW was tuned to be like a PoP boss, the only people capable of killing him would be the uber guilds.

Also i do want to point out that only a small portion of the playerbase reads these types of forums and even fewer post. So sometimes getting all the facts is not possible on the manaburn team incidents that  may have happened.<br>

However, I did encounter an &quot;abuse&quot; with Rage when it had to be camped. There was some confusion over who had the camp but the other guild had a manaburn team so they were able to take Rage over us who did not have a manaburn team. We would have been able to make the kill without manaburn but the manaburn team was able to make the kill quick and therefore get the looting rights. That was my personal experience. I also saw some posts on the eqvault on the terris-thule section with complaints about my server manaburn team.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=natanmagus>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1015<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 12:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> Team HARMTOUCH will make us look like nuns. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeddicous>Zeddicous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 1:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember Manaburn?</span><hr size=1> Howdy all,<br>
<br>
I can't speak for all servers obviously, but on my server the manaburn crews were pretty active back in the day.  It was not at all uncommon to come home from work on patch day, and after spending a little family time log on to find out the burn crews had long ago killed the targets that had popped already.  I heard it a lot from my friends that saw it.  More than one occasion I was with my guild buffing up for a kunark dragon only to personally witness the ganksquad sprint past us and burn it down.<br>
<br>
It had to be one of the more poorly designed abilities I've seem in this system.  When it came out, it was a fairly high end Luclin ability, and the best thing the wizard community find to use it for was farming old content primarily for plat.  Even the burncrew members that I spoke with would admit that they never used Manaburn on a raid because they could be more effective without it.<br>
<br>
Granted they could have done a much better job adjusting it, but I can't say that I'm really surprised with what they reduced it to.  I think if they just upped the damage to a 3:1 ratio and leave the other limitations that it would be a nice tool to have.<br>
<br>
Feel free to flame away,<br>

Other than an extremely lucky crit, what target worth burning is gonna drop dead from the damage MB was able to do?<br>
<br>
I'd also be happy if they fixed it to be instant like HT, and put it on the same timer, without taking our mana.  Make us pay more AA to get it up to high damage, Mana/damage= level of manaburn... level 1 1/1, level 2 2/1, etc.  But either the crits need to be restored, or the 1 min timer needs to come off.  It's not otherwise fair IMHO.<br>

<br>
Theres big issues, the number of wizards with the required AA to get it is massive now, probably if it was returned you would see all wizard raids going after bigger and bigger targets.<br>
<br>
Suddenly PoP bosses have to all be flagged Immune or have there HPs upped to compensate. Either of these is bad.<br>
<br>
As soon as the first Mana-Burn immune mob comes out you just know it will spread like wildfire, every mob that could be contestable gets flagged. Suddenly your left only being able to Manaburn Kunark frogs and your thinking, hang on, that what we have now.<br>
<br>
While increasing HPs would screw our entire class royally like Velious/Luclin did.<br>
<br>
Personally i would like to see SoE play aout with it on test, try and make it usefull but not gamebreaking. But in my list of priorities it comes somewhat lower than them fixing doors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derangedcreature>Deranged Creature</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/03 2:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember Manaburn?</span><hr size=1> People seem to be mentioning alot about Harm Touch here, now it does require a ton more AA (sure.. who cares AA is fast as it is).... But when SK's begin to do that, I bet you most people won't really care... I think it has alot more to do with the fact EVERYONE talked about Manaburn, they talked and talked about it, people most likely had /feedback NERF MANABURN buttons for everytime they logged in.... It was all talk, people talk to much... For all we know people are doing team harm touch now and just not talking about it... just like it should have been done with manaburn...<br>
<br>
Talking = People crying = huge problem = nerfed to stop the cries...<br>
<br>
I don't really care who kills what, if they want to go kill dragons let them... Manaburn will never be fixed (at least not likely).. so if your bored buy it and go Manaburn a Orc... other than that.. whats the point..<br>
<br>
Not to say you shouldn't hope Manaburn gets fixed, but no point in this thread people will just complain about people complaining about Manaburn!... never gets anyone anywhere.. but hey I am bored and need something to read.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26850.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26850.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26850.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26850.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26850.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26850.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26850.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26850.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26850.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
