Gotta have this thing grrrrrr. I've tried to get the pieces solo but it just ain't working. My question is, is there a way that maybe I'm not seeing to get the Heart of Frost and Rod of Bone solo? I've tried to hit Perma and died a few times due to some goblin seeing invis and then the whole place jumping me. Getting a group to hit Sol A or Permafrost is like asking someone to take a root canal in your place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Currently guildless so my circle of friends is kinda limited. I have help to get the Heart of Fire (thanks Aazuar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but it's that frost heart and the rod that's really irking me.<br>
<br>
Any strategies on:<br>
<br>
1) Pulling the stone skellies singly<br>
2) Getting to the wizards in Perma with all my vital organs intact<br>
<br>
<br>
Or should I just wait and ghetto quad to high level and then get it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Kinda stumped at this point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The Skels in Rathe were green and I just snared one on left and his pet and other didn't aggro. Once they started heading out I nuked the bejesus outta the skel then took out pet. 2 pulls the bone dropped.<br>
<br>
For the hearts: I tried killing everything in Preacher room and a wiz spawned like once in 3 hours.  Next I went early in the morning (5AM or so EST) and found a high lvl Mage camping something in the jail who told me he'd seen a bunch of Wizs so I headed there and within minutes he crated one and I had the heart. Pretty much the same in PF, was a ranger camping the bar area. I sat while he killed stuff and eventually, maybe 40 minutes, a Wiz poped he killed it and I looted.<br>

You can pull the skellies single in Rathe if you are careful. Pull from max spell range and I only got one each time. Rooted the pet and killed the skellie. The SolA was the most difficult part but normally you can find a young monk soloing there that will help you clear the bar as they are after the pants the bartender drops. Before hiring the monk I had to gate out a few times. You can normally find a cpl of higher lvls in Permafrost or just outside that will help you also. Lots of my wizzie friends got them to help that way.<br>
<br>
Goodluck to you, the staff is worth 1000x the effort put into getting it. <p><B>******************</B><BR>

I helped a Druid out in the Oasis who was kiting SG.  She rewarded me with a Lambent Stone to sell, but I found out what I could use it for, so that started the quest.  I was lvl 19 or 20.  Held on the Lambent stone for a couple of levels.  I went to permafrost, I don't remember how I got the heart of frost, other then I was group.  Sorry about that one.<br>
<br>
To get the bone rod I tried several things, died a couple of times before working it out.  At level 22 the skellies and their pets all conned yellow or blue to me.  I was creative after my first suicide rush.  Anyway, what I did was bind myself very close to the RM zone ent, one step away. Loaded gate, shadow step and fade.  Also had about 150 in swimming.  At my level I would get aggro from all four, I would DD one from max, then try to root and dd as best I could, till the earth pets got to me and rooted me.  Then I would cast my shadow step, fade, and gate.  Which always put me in the lake till I gated.  Zone to RM, then repeat.  You are close enough that the damage you are doing does not heal fast enough.  However it is slow going since the skellies were dd me for about 200 pts of damage.  After repeating till all dead I got my bone rod.<br>
<br>
(At 35 they should be much easy, but if you decide to solo them, think about an escape plan and load the spells you need to escape they are undercons.)<br>
<br>
The heart of fire was another issue, no easy way to get it.  I had to bring in more fire power, did that twice and did not get the heart of fire, and died 8 times, this was at level 25.  I resorted to OOC, and incidentally my heart of fire dropped off a regular Inferno Goblin in the bar room.  (The PH for the bartender)<br>
<br>
Would not trade this staff for anything if it could be traded.<br>

Sol A is a nightmare and the Perma drop was way too rare.<br>
<br>
Got fed up in the end , took my 60 ranger up there and ganked the whole zone , tracking every goblin wiz down until i got a heart then mushed infernos in SolA. I could not pull the skeles solo in lake with my wiz so I also colledted the rod with my warder. Handed 3 parts in with ranger , camped , logged on wiz dropped staff onto the NPC and viola , new staff for me.<br>

<br>
Perm was no problem at all.   I was able to invis and get to the Peacher.  I camped the preacher and got a runed circlet to upgrade my headgear, got a cold iron morning star for my shaman, and got the heart of frost.  Now, the next room over - where the archeologist lives - had a gobbie or two that saw through invis.  I also camped the alchemist and got a pair of leggings.<br>
<br>
The skelies in Lake Rathe were a pain, but not too bad.   I had a SoW and Lev, used Bonds of force on one skele and his pet, rooted the other pet, and ran to the Rathe Moutain zone with the second skelie hot on my tail.    I finished him off close to the zone line, looted the bone rod and zoned.<br>
<br>
Sol A was a major pain!  I died several times because of gobbies seeing through invis.  Damn Shamans!  I managed to get in and set up camp at the bartender.   After several days, of camping and /ooc'ing for a heart, another group had one drop (there was rarely anyone else there but me).  By some miracle, I was able to get there and loot without aggro.  The Sol A part was by far the hardest part for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwitek02.showPublicProfile?language=EN>witek02</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/15/02 5:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Staff of Temperate Flux, solo at 35?</span><hr size=1> I did this quest pretty much around lvl 30. I was guilded and had some really helpful friends which made it much easier.<br>
1)Perma- Organised a guild raid to there, with two groups of 25-30's we had no problem owning the zone, getting a couple hearts plus the vast majority of people got the arch packs as well.  To do it solo should not be a problem if you can break the preacher room spawn. This was difficult at 30, but at 35 it should be easier with steelskin and the 34 shielding spell to protect you. If you can, bring a warrior, they could completely mop any of the areas that you need to go to. This is how I did the heart of frost a second time around with a friend. We got a 32 warrior to help us, had no problems getting the heart.<br>
2)Sol A- I have the best friends in the world <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have a group of friends, who even though we are now quite different levels, we still group together all the time just to have fun in some random dungeon with some quest or piece of loot. (we originally called these suicide missions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). We spent about a total of 8 hours over 3 evenings in Sol A in the bar room before finally getting the heart of fire to drop. Had no problems in the least holding the room with a 45 ench, 32 wiz, 30 dru, and 26 pally. <br>
3) The Lake Rathe skellies- try to find another wiz who needs this part of the quest so you guys can duo the spawn, then it should be no problem. I'm not sure if you can single pull these at 35, I know that at 32 they would still both aggro. Personally, I had a 38 warrior friend who helped me out with this part so no problems there.<br>
Yes, this quest can be done solo, but it is nowhere near as enjoyable. I had the best time of my life down in Sol A killing easy mobs for 8 hours because I was there with the people on EQ who I love spending time with. Thats what EQ is about for me, people coming together to achieve a common goal. The raid in Perma, since you need to get that heart of frost anyway, why not organise a raid for some of your friends? you'll have a good time, your risk is reduced, and everyone else gets to enjoy sometime together in a cool dungeon.<br>

<br>
In Perma, I did the Preacher room.  The Preacher is the highest level mob there at 29.  I got a runed circlet and a Cold Iron Morning Star before a wizard spawned in his place and I got the heart.<br>
<br>
In LR, I had a little trouble with the stone skellies.   I has Sow and lev on, snared one skellie and his pet and the second charged me.   I rooted his pet and ran across the water to the Rathe Mt zone line.  I stopped near the zone and killed the skellie.<br>
<br>
SolA was the hardest part for me.   I died a couple of times - very frustrating - because the casters saw through invis.  I finally made my way to the bar and set up shop.  I was hoping to get a shot at the bartender, but a wizzie spawned first and I got the heart.<br>

<br>
Rod of Bone:  I have this one with help from a guild mate that just happened to be in zone at the time.  40+ necro.  No way I would have been able to take down both at my level w/o medding in between (160 int.)  With helper it was a piece of cake.  Someone said root one and kite the other.  My xp is that the path of land you have to work with isn't small enough to get out of the rooted one's casting range.  I guess you could run them down into the lake, maybe.<br>
<br>
Permafrost- haven't been there since about 30.  Here is what happened to me:  Went in invis and life was good, nothing saw me and I was wandering around in there because I really didn't know where I was going.  I found what looked like a big room with a raised platform thing in the center, with gobbies all over the place (king room?)  I was wandering around in there found the wizard.  Just as I found the wizard (conned blue at 30), he saw through my invis and nuked me.  I nuked back then I had 4 million gobbies on me.  Tried to gate out -too late.  Need a group or someone to clear the room.  At 35, I imagine wizard will be green but you will still have all the adds beating on you.<br>
<br>
Heart of Fire - Was in Sol the other day to try to this one.  I figured that they would be green by now.  Wandered in invis nothing saw me.  Found a 35 ranger and 34 druid in the zone and asked if they could help me out with it.  Ranger said that he was looking for wizards too, for the heart of fire, for a ranger quest.  I didn't ask what that quest was.  I left at that point, but he did tell me that he had been there for 2 hours and killed &quot;a bunch&quot; of wizards but had not seen the heart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=429.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=429.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.threadControl?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2>General Quest Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
