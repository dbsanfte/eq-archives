You can be whoever you want to be online, but you'll still make less money if you're a woman. <br>
<br>
That's the conclusion of a recent study by a noted economics professor, who examined price differences between male and female characters auctioned off for the popular online fantasy game &quot;EverQuest.&quot; <br>
<br>
Edward Castronova, associate professor of economics at California State University at Fullerton, previously calculated that the fictional world of Norrath in &quot;EverQuest&quot; has a lively economy that ranks 77th among the nations of the world. <br>
<br>
For his latest study, Castronova again looked at online auctions in which players pay real-world money for characters and in-game items, a controversial activity that &quot;EverQuest&quot; publisher Sony Online Entertainment has tried to quash. <br>
<br>
&quot;EverQuest&quot; players are free to chose the character that represents them in the online game's world, and many of the men who make up 92 percent of the game's subscriber base play as a female at least part of the time. <br>
<br>
Castronova found that female characters, or &quot;avatars,&quot; sold for an average of $281, well below the $346 average selling price of a male character. Even when differences in skills and level attainment (the in-game attributes that would most directly determine a character's value) were taken into account, female characters still sold for an average of $41 less, or 12 percent less, than male counterparts. <br>
<br>
 That's better than the real world--gender pay disparity in the United States is around 28 percent, according to recent studies--but still not the egalitarian environment online utopians might envision. <br>
<br>
&quot;On Earth, people can point to differences in the way male and female bodies are built and say that's why we have gender inequality,&quot; Castronova said. &quot;That doesn't happen in Norrath--the bodies do exactly the same thing. Yet it turns out there's still something there.&quot; <br>
<br>
A number of factors could contribute to the &quot;EverQuest&quot; gender gap, Castronova said. But in playing the game, he found plenty of anecdotal evidence that female characters are valued less highly than are male ones, even though the real person behind the character can be of either gender. Castronova said he played the game as a female character a number of times, and would inevitably find other players assuming he was less knowledgeable or skilled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm pretty experienced, but I'd still get people coming up to me and saying, 'OK, honey, stand over there and watch what I do,'&quot; he said. &quot;Even though everybody knows the person behind the avatar could be either sex, the male avatars tend to be treated as more skilled...We've just taken sex roles from Earth and put them into Norrath.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ppatty>PPatty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/sgnon/pattyscreams.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/24/03 12:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nadiar>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Mistyr Smartipants</span><br>  Posts: 1385<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fems worth less in EverQuest</span><hr size=1> There are at least 3 women in my guild that play male characters as their main.<br>

Seriously, that is just fubar. one of my better friends on EQ (/wave dealer Ray) is a female both in RL (Im fairly certin otherwise im dead) and ingame, and even tho I make fun of her I dont think of her as less knolegable than any male players.....

Then what you're talking about is how much money you need to save to want to play a female more than your own gender.<br>
<br>
Most people find it awkward when some 15 year old kid is hitting on their toon, let alone when they are a guy in real life.<br>
<br>
I do get women who show 'affection' for my character (and what woman  wouldn't?!), but it is obviously less because of the smaller percentage of women playing EQ.  <br>
<br>
As for being told what to do, I have people try that shit all the time, and last time I asked, Nadiar said he was quite male, and to stop peeking up his robe.

hmm... &quot;a number of times&quot;, eh?  Why do I get the feeling he rolled up a number of low level female wood-elf druids?  If ever there was a stereotype race/class combo, that's it.  And I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but more women than men play EQ primarily for the social aspect (as opposed to playing it &quot;to win&quot;).  Of the &quot;socializer&quot; EQ players I've met, a disproportionate number have been female wood-elf druids.  It's an easy combo, takes little skill/work to level reasonably well (especially at low levels), and has an attractive avatar, which, if you're playing EQ for the social aspect, is a nice bonus (nobody flirts with female trolls, btw - ALL of them are really guys).<br>
<br>
So I'll freely admit that when I meet a new F/W-E/Dru, especially if they are low level, I am more likely to assume they either don't know a lot about the game, or that they don't care to learn (i.e. it's not their goal in the game).  Now, anyone I meet who is 50+, regardless of race/class, I assume has decent to good knowledge of their class and the game in general, so race/class doesn't matter.  Besides, people who play &quot;to win&quot; tend to choose more &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; combos, like Gnome Pallies (an abomination if ever there was one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  If I see one of those, I usually assume it's either an alt of a higher level player who's looking for a challenge, or a complete newb.  30 seconds of conversation with them, will make it obvious which is the case.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Y'know....<br>

on second glance here, I think I'm guilty of racial profiling. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=apollohades>Apollohades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 1:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fems worth less in EverQuest</span><hr size=1> I'd love to see the details behind the study.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hedonic analysis of the auction price data suggests that gender labels are a less important determinant of avatar values than the &quot;level,&quot; a game-design metric that indicates the overall capabilities of the avatar.

All sorts of information is missing, and likely sue to the author and subsequently the CNN writer, both lacking experience and understanding of Everquest.<br>

Flags and equipment weren't even mentioned, and by far their importance outweigh wether or not the character has a digital penis or not. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://forcesunknown.homestead.com/files/ap-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

More women will start playing MMOGs and lower the male to female ratio. Sure, there will be women who dont know what theyre doing, but there will be plenty of women who know their characters inside and out. There are several online boards specifically geared to female players and they will be encouraged to not put up with the sweetheart attitude. I dont expect this to change overnight or that the men are worth more than women attitude to be gone by the time WoW comes out, but I do expect the attitude to start dying out slowly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1973<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 3:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fems worth less in EverQuest</span><hr size=1> I dont believe 92%.

I am sure there are plenty who also do not want to be gender-benders and play women for whatever reason. <br>
<br>
Lets say 30% of the male population of players that buy characters are comfortable buying woman characters.  That still leaves the ratio at almost 1.5:1 male:female (62%:38%).  <br>
<br>
The male characters, therefore will sell for higher money because more people will want to buy them.<br>

For the most part people want to play the gender they are.  There are 10 times as many men who want to play.  They drive the character cost higher.  Yawn.  Can I have my doctorate now?  <br>

A more interesting point is that Online RPGs have always had a fair number of women playing and I would like to know why these games attract women.  <br>

<br>
I dont assume female toons are less knowledgeable because they are females irl, I assume they are idiots because they are men pretending to be females so they can try and get people to give them free stuff and buffs.  92% of the time I'm right too.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeryenne>Zeryenne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 5:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fems worth less in EverQuest</span><hr size=1> Its actually pretty funny guessing who is really female and who is really male. Sometimes its very obvious. Other times, you'd never know there is a male behind the female toon. I know at least two females in game who are really males. And I only know because I've met them. <br>
<br>
I think its more accurate to say as other posters have: Men want to play males. *shrug* Although, if there are more male characters, wouldn't it make sense that there would be more to bid on and get higher prices? I'd think that females would be less inclined to sell off their characters, for whatever reason. <br>

You kick ass while looking good doing it. It's a lot of fun to customize a character and have it &quot;represent&quot; how you want others to see you. <br>
<br>
2) Socialization -- this is a big part of it. There would be nights where I would just log on and chat with my friends without leaving the town I was in. Even though I've quit EQ, I still keep in touch with the same women either via emails or message boards where we're likely to hang out at. When I first bought the game, I was turned off by the amount of jerks I met and decided that I would rather play a game on my computer that didn't involve other people, but I ran into a couple of women who were very nice to me and showed me how to find an NPC to complete a quest and so on. I would rush home every night specifically because I knew they were logging on and I loved getting their tells. The action was only secondary -- leveling was not a big deal.<br>
<br>
There may be more reasons, but those are the two reasons why I'll go back to playing a MMOG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 13507<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/24/03 7:11 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fems worth less in EverQuest</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Considering how most female models are played by males, I find it doubtful that a female character is treated very differently - except by 14 year old raging-hormone boys.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You don't even play EQ, do you?
