<br>
Kunark, Velious, Luclin, it's still largely a melee world.  For VI designers who spend an awful lot of time worrying about people grouping (see Vision) it is still tougher for a wizard to get a group.  Please don't turn this into a &quot;You don't know how to play your class/if you are unhappy don't play/quit your whining&quot; re-rant, it's just (mine and others') general observation.  I do think Luclin is neat and I'm having more fun as a wizard than I used to, but in many ways the gameworld is still a bit &quot;unbalanced&quot; IMHO.  <br>
<br>
Being based on D&amp;D, I was thinking about why EQ wizards aren't quite what I expected when I rolled mine up, and looking back at the way the pure caster class is divided, you can see the wizard class &quot;schools&quot; showing through in each EQ pure caster class (as to which class gets mind alter  spells, pet summons, teleports, vision spells etc. etc.).<br>
<br>
Now I'm not trying to say VI did a bad job of this, they actually did a rather good job of it in many ways and yes, EVERY class has its issues.  I just continue to fail to see a wizard's class defining abilities.  <br>
<br>
Many months ago I started a thread on &quot;transportation as offense&quot; in response to VI's statements they thought teleports were where the class was headed - and mine (and others) comments foreshadowed what has become translocational suppressions.  I'm not claiming I came up with it, I was just encouraged to see some thought put into increasing a wizard's situational utility.  I know wizards on raids make some terrific contributions, but the suggestions below could just be incorporated into the early and mid levels to get a wizard into a group more often.   I was particularly  thinking of a few old D&amp;D concepts which would create some additional demand for pure casters, and possibly wizards in particular: <br>
<br>
Unmeleeable MOBS<br>
<br>
We as casters face extremely MR MOBs on occasion - why not create a few MOBS that take much less melee damage?  Put them in places where a group needs to &quot;get past&quot; them to go deeper into a dungeon.   <br>
<br>
SERIOUS Casters<br>
<br>
Verant's main solution in making a MOB tougher is to let it melee better (hit harder).  Let's see some more caster MOBs out there that stun, root and burn.  This will create a need for a &quot;get it dead now&quot; response from groups.  We could shine here.<br>
<br>
Silence<br>
<br>
Remember this line from D&amp;D?  Wanna keep that MOB cleric from healing its buddies or a nuker MOB from chaining?  This would help...<br>
<br>
Mana Taps<br>
<br>
We can pull mana from the air (Harvest) why can't we tap mana from a caster MOB?  I see SK's got a mana tap with Luclin (Mental Corruption, I believe) why couldn't we?  I mean if all we are is mana, it fits the gameworld as well as a melee hybrid (SK) or necro stealing health.  <br>
<br>
In general, I also believe the migration of spell casting to melee weapons is appaling.  But the barn door is oopen on that one, could VI maybe increase some useful effects for caster gear?  Oh and don't make it all fall off of raid level MOBs, thank you.<br>
<br>
None of these ideas, in moderation, would be de-stabilizing, or even increase ease of soloing (heaven forbid) and the MOB changes could be few and scattered among different levels of a wizard's life.<br>

They gave that one to Paladins a few patches ago (Thunder of Karana). Had an 18 second recast time. We don't normally have any problems clearing NToV in an evening, but with this spell and 3 Paladins, the whole place was extremely trivial to do. Zlexax got his AE off 1 time the whole fight.<br>
<br>
The spell was changed the very next day for some reason.... heh <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

Mobs with undispellible 500-1500 Damage Shield, low MR, and low HP. - You would need bards to keep attention, or warriors just taunting only.<br>
<br>
Mobs with Heavy absorbion skins for melee, and hit hard. but can be damaged by casters.<br>
<br>
If you have ever played Myth, wight-like mobs, that Explode upon death, a PBAOE, that horribly damages anthing near. - would be good for both, archers and casters.<br>
<br>
These mobs also drop REALLY GOOD loot, that would give a reason to fight em, or they would be ignored, like so many zones with heavy casters, and bad loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uremfin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remfin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 934<br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/22/01 10:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Unmeleeable MOBs, Silence</span><hr size=1> Qaman, I think he means a fixed version that isn't insanely broken... not the silence that WAS put in before <p>Remfin<BR>

Yah, but the problem is.. would some kind of fixed version even be useful, or would it be more along the lines of the usefulness of disintegrate? Sure, it is occasionally useful, but for the most part it is worthless.<br>

<br>
Guess this really depends on the things you fight. Resistant mobs (though better now) and high ac/slowing/etc (getting more of these) mobs are fairly common at the higher levels. Usually fight some combination of these most days. Some are more annoying than others (did more damage with my 47 monk on Tunare than I did with my 60 wiz for instance). <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
Boy Etnu, keep this up and you may become a moderator yet.   Not every point or idea you don't agree with is whining, and saying so is a bad habit practiced all too regularly on these boards by some lazy, self-satisfied uberguild portbitches.   You're better than that.<br>
<br>
First of all, I fail to see the whining part.  It's simply not there.  I made a few suggestions in the interests of variety.  You clearly don't agree.  Fine, that's what makes horseraces.  <br>
<br>
Why is the Holy Trinity the Holy Trinity (cleric/melee/chanter)?  Because the MOB world is still largely single pull and massive HP.  My point was, is this the best they can come up with?  For EVERY MOB and EVERY encounter?<br>
<br>
My point was NOT that high MR MOBs are a problem, I'd just simply like to see more variety.    Think of a gameworld where certain classes shine in certain locations/dungeons/encounters.  This is already partially in the game, although no where near complete, in the case of rogues and traps (like rogues need more help getting into groups).   It would be nice to hear &quot;to do (insert zone or part of a zone) right you really need a (certain class).&quot;   Or if (certain_class_01) is not in the group, trigger encounter #1, else trigger encounter #2 (where the encounter risk/reward is different).  This would introduce variability and would encourage people to seek wizards (or other less groupworthy classes) out.  Yeah, yeah, I know...wizards group fine, everyone wants one, if they don't want me it's my fault, etc., etc., whatever.   STOP thinking raid level, and think about levels 20-45.   <br>
<br>
Watching melees control an encounter until a MOB is 40% then nuking for 30 seconds is fine, just not 999 out of 1000 times. /snore.   My suggestion would apply to, at best 10% of encounters, but it is already the NORM for chanters and clerics 95% of the time.  Can't do (whatever) without crowd control, or won't go in there without a cleric.  Blah, blah, blah.  BOOOOORING...<br>
<br>
Some of the most fun I had as a young wizard was dueling derv casters in NoRo, who could often drop a melee before you knew it.  That exiliration of meeting fire with fire is the thrill almost EVERY encounter after that has been missing.   <br>
<br>
Much of this is probably beyond the game mechanics, I don't know, I'm not a programmer.   VI has done a fairly decent job of implementing change to EQ, some of which has emanated from these fine boards with respect to wizards.  I simply don't see the harm in creative thinking.  If you don't like the ideas, terrific, then read and move on - you are none the worse for wear.    <br>

Biggest problems seems to be the fact that meeles can increase their damage output speed by better weapons/haste, where casters cannot really change the speed they deal damage.<br>
<br>
But.... SoL has IMHO several mobs/dungeons that seem to be more friendly towards casters, at least compared to old world zones:<br>

Acrylia caverns: The grimlings have horrible high AC and only let meeles hit mostly at minimum. Nukers would seriously improve the grind experience there. I would prefer maybe a combo of two taunters/tanks, 2 wizards, chanter and a cleric/shaman/druid.<br>
<br>
SS temple when you come from thedeep: Relatively tough nuking mobs there. <br>
<br>
But those are just two examples of dungeons that are caster friendly.<br>
<br>
On the converse, fungus grove mushrooms are a joke. With semi-decent resists, the mushrooms chain try to slow/stun you with zero damage output while you chop them down. But this also means a nuker can solo there easy. As I read in the studies here about class balancing, constant fighting without reduces the damage percentage a wizard contributes to a group.<br>

But why not have counterspells?<br>
<br>
have a low lvl one then as you get higher in lvls have one that not onpy spell spells but provects it from casting same spell in oh 4 or 6 secs, and then later on add mana steal to some of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucovenantu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Covenant U</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/9/02 8:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Unmeleeable MOBs, Silence</span><hr size=1> Imagine EQ without Clarity II, mez or resurrection. I'm serious, imagine they were replaced with much lesser spell lines for a sec.<br>
<br>
Now imagine someone suggesting those spells be added to the game on a message board just like this one.  Finally permit yourself to imagine the reaction:<br>
<br>
&quot;[Clarity/Mez/Resurrection] would be way too powerful...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Resurrection would trivialize encounters, I mean where would the risk be if you could die and get back almost all your experience?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't suggest a silence would last forever, just like the D&amp;D spell it may or may not work, would be somewhat more highly resistable and would wear off.  Hell, let it generate aggro just like mez so the MOB starts kicking wizzie ass.  Whatever...<br>
<br>
And speaking of mez, why is it ok to take a MOB out of the fight and have it motionless, staring blankly and drooling for minutes at a time but taking a casting mob's spellcasting out of the equation for limited duration is &quot;too powerful.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's amazing to me that people have accepted Verant's gameworld choices, and excuses, as if they were the very laws of physics.<br>
