This is certainly good news.<br>
<br>
Now, I have a couple questions about this bugger. First, can you give him the jar while he's beating on you? If not, does he see invis?<br>
<br>
My idea there is to have a friend pull him, drop my jar in a trade window and then have a 2nd friend invis me. Will this work or am I crazy?<br>
<br>
Also, does he have placeholders in his new spot, or is he pretty much always going to be up (after the initial rush for us all to get him, hehe)?<br>
<br>
Hmm, seems like the guy in Karnor's is going to be the toughest one now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urazail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/20/01 3:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CoM Skeleton move</span><hr size=1> Bit confused on this one, is the new spot on the ledge or in the courtyard past the gate? <p><BR>Semper Fidelis,<BR>

Something I plan to try if the dang thing ever pops is to get someone to pull him (via Gflux method), root it, and run the others away before zoning, or FD (probably monk, I will get him some silks from CC).  I will then try my invis undead spell after the other stuff leaves (golems are not undead).  Granted, the invis undead spell will set you back 1 or 2kpp, but you will greatly appreciate it for Lguk too.  Since he is only level 40 to 44 and undead, I doubt he will see invisibility to undead.  I did test part of this, I was able to give items to skeletons in nek forest without the invis undead dropping.  For me, the CoM portion is mostly a waiting game until I can get a puller and hopefully an enchanter when he is up.  I have brought a party there twice now to find he was never up in the 3 hours or so I was there each time.  I think the CoM spawn must have a placeholder (and I will have to get multiple FD pulls by a monk, or get two groups to break in (including a rogue) to the area. <p><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=6029">Azlinon Seflarian</a> of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/divinesymphony">Divine Symphony</a><br>

<br>
If it works, you could do this part with 3 Wizards: One to Flux up and pull then zone, one to Immobilize then zone, and one to IvU and turn in the goods.<br>
<br>
Even if only one of the three Wizards has IvU (and this will be less of a problem as time wears on and the Velious drop-only spells have a chance to proliferate), he can get the swirling smoke and multiquest it for the other two, at least as long as multiquesting remains possible. I know I'd be willing to do this part 3 times if it would get the quest done, and I'de be helping out some friends in the process.<br>
<br>
I think that because the reward here is Wizard-only, it'll be great to only need the help of a couple other Wizards. <p>Zwobu &lt;Trade Foundation&gt; Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uebuanuangelfeather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ebuanu Angelfeather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/26/01 12:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> CoM skellie NOT moved as of 26-3</span><hr size=1> We got to &quot;old&quot; spawnpoint..Used CoH to get a group up on the path over the gate.<br>

I had heard that the CoM skelly had moved, and I was wondering when?<br>
It was still spawning up in the room on the wall when I tuned in the bottle. I had a group consisting of level 52 Wizard (me), 53 Cleric, 50 Shaman, 47 SK, 46 Ranger, 52 Enchanter. Here's how we did it:<br>
<br>
Step one: Got the bottles from Trak's Teeth and KC. CoM is the hardest one, saved it for last.<br>
<br>
Step two: Got the group to CoM. There was a group hunting the entrance. We went through the gate to the right balcony and camped there.<br>
<br>
Step three: Enchanter Boon of Garou'd and then Grav Fluxed our shaman. I timed Lev so it hit at the peak of the Grav Flux.<br>
<br>
Step four: Shaman pulled down wall wanderers and room. 4-5 MoBs on the first pull. Very nasty unless you AoE them.<br>
<br>
Step five: Repeat step three.<br>
<br>
Step six: Shaman solo's Wandering mobs and respawns. If the shaman gets more than one MoB on them, He'd pull to us. As long as the shammy was in the room, we could heal him and buff him.<br>
<br>
Step seven: Wait for the Human Skeleton to Spawn. He is not a common spawn, and he isn't always up. The first time this group went to CoM and did this, he never spawned. The second time it took about 2 hours.<br>
<br>
Step eight: Had the shaman pull the Human Skeleton (who was nuking the shaman BTW). Our Enchanter CHARMED the wizzie, I handed it the bottle, and it despawned.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's really only possible to break this room the first time with a solid 50+ group. Once it's broken you have a few choices. You can (by /d the whole group) get the whole group up on the wall and camp inside the room. Lots of wanderers pass through the room, so this is not something for lower level groups trying.<br>
The other way to do it is to do what we did. Just have a tank or a shaman/druid up there pulling stuff as it spawns. You'll need to time Levitate just right. I think it was a 3 count after the enchanter started casting GF.<br>
The hardest part of this was knowing when the chanter was gonna cast it. I suggested him making a hotbutton with it saying right when I needed to cast, but he said that was too much work (lazy chanters).<br>
<br>
As for how well the spell works, I love it. I can't think of how I lived without it. Since I've gotten it I've saved hundreds of plat on peridots simply because MoBs don't aggro me anymore. If they do, I cast Concussion again, and they turn to the highest person on the hate list.<br>
I spent this past Friday in the Hole testing this with Rock Golems. On a level 54 RG I was able to chain Lure of frost and Concussion from the pull to the end. No Aggros. On one pull I had a Ratman Guard aggro me, but I casted Concussion a couple times on it, and it turned right back to the tanks.<br>
<br>
Concussion is magic based, so it helps alot to have a chanter handy to tash, or shaman/mage to malo. I seriously doubt this will help at all on totally resistant MoBs. This spell is only good for groups. It lowers your number on the hate list. It does nothing but that. I've heard it compaired to the rogue &quot;Evade&quot; skill. When it lands successfully, you get moved from you're current spot down 2-3 on the targets hate list. Casting it over and over seemed to work just fine to keep MoBs of me.<br>
It's great for when players try to train you too. Sitting at the portal in Cazic some Druid came running up to me with 4 Defenders on his tail. They of course aggroed me as the druid hauled off into one of the tunnels. I casted 4 quick concussions and they all left, one after another to go hunt down the dirty little druid.<br>
I still had to gate afterwards since it doesn't clear aggro, but it gave me alot more time. Thats another great thing about it. It's very fast casting. Almost impossible to be interrupted.<br>
<br>
Out of all of the &quot;Must Have&quot; spells, I'd rank this right up there with Harvest and Ice Comet. It is probably the only spell that will let you dump on a MoB and not get beat to death before you can get healed.  <p><center><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/jarninblack.jpg><br>Jarnin Fisheermann<Br><b>Disciple of Hate<Br><b>Rallos Zek</b><Br></b><Br>Master Fisherman<Br>Master Brewer<Br>Master Chef</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uabmagfab.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AbMagFab</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/26/01 9:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CoM skellie NOT moved as of 26-3</span><hr size=1> <br>
Ebuanu - did you end up getting the human skellie up there?  Given your post time it looks like it happened pretty quickly?<br>

The guy who needed help with his epic just sat outside the zone for 30 minutes, not saying anything after I got there, so I ended up logging.<br>

I warned those near the zone I was going to pull a nasty train before doing this. I grav fluxed myself up to the ramparts, ( took a couple of times to get there with nothing walking by ), and invised myself. Walked over to the area that has the human skel and invised to undead. Walked right up to it handed in the bottle and ran as the entire room agroed me. Jumped over the ledge and as soon as I hit the water began casting gate.<br>
As I play on a PvP server had to use the rogue trick to get the one from Karnors though, kind of bites zoneing in and getting wings of death, harm touched and Jiva before taking more than 20 or so steps.<br>
