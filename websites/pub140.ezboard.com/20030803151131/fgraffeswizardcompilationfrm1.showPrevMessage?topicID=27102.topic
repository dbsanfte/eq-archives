<br>
I have been posting about a topic on the Mage tower.  My posts have basically run into what I consider game design misunderstanding of some of the players that post on those mage boards.  I am seeking some support in some basic concepts of damage dealing and I know wizzies will be a good resource for this because it relates directly to what you guys do.<br>
<br>
Here is exactly what I said on the mage boards...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ducalio stated: <br>
&quot;Some of you seem to think that a mage sitting medding is adding nothing to a group. This is patently wrong as Jobaber is still pumping out his 80+ dps, and any clicky DDs from horseback add another 25 while u med. <br>
<br>
Pet-canni is an awesome ability for regenning mana, but while you are regenning your DPS is ZERO.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Ok, allow me to clue you guys into an idea here... <br>
<br>
1. A mage that adds a higher average of damage over time is probably a greater benefit for most exp groups. <br>
<br>
2. Average damage is total damage divided by total time. <br>
<br>
3. Huge burst damage with some downtime, IS better then consistant damage if the average damage over time is higher. <br>
<br>
A quick example:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Warrior A deals 80 DPS for 60 seconds. <br>
Wizard B deals 8000 damage in 2 nukes totaling 14 seconds of cast time at the end. <br>
<br>
Warrior A dealt 4800 damage at 80 DPS <br>
Wizard B dealt 8000 damage at 133.33 DPS <br>
<br>
Damage wise, the Wizard was more valuable to the group then the Warrior.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
4. Wizards and Mages are classes that are BUILT around Burst Damage. That is what we do. That is why we have a mana pool, and a Warrior does not. A mana pool is by game design a restricting factor that limits our damage output. <br>
<br>
5. If a mage can meditate while using boots of bladecalling and a pet doing 80 DPS, then that mage is sustaining 80 + 35 DPS. The Damage value he adds to the group is 115 DPS. <br>
<br>
Where as, if a mage can canni for mana, then drop nukes and the total averaged DPS over the full time is higher then 115 DPS, then the canni'ing mage adds more to his group. <br>
<br>
6. By choosing a mage as your character in this game, you already made a choice to play a class that does his damage in bursts. Mages are slightly different then wizards where we can maintain sustained DPS through pets. But it's important for any mage to realize that it's truely the overall DPS over time that matters the most.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This basic principle should be well understood by any wizard or mage.  I wanted to get some good wizzie feedback or support on this subject to help show the other mages what I'm talking about.  Can you guys lend a hand?<br>
==============================================<br>
EDIT: Your message board will not let me reply, so I'm editing in my reply to this post.<br>
<br>
I'm looking for wizards to back up the theory of burst damage versus sustained damage.  Wizards are all about burst damage, which is why I'm posting it here.  Because I know that many wizards will have that concept down.  I'm basically trying to show some mages that it's the overall damage divided by the overall fight time that matters the most.  Some mages cannot handle the thought of no pet while they use other tactics to recover mana for big nukes at the end.<br>
<br>
Goladus, lol.  Man,  you have more posts here on these boards then the mage boards!<br>
==============================================<br>
EDIT AGAIN:  Yeah, Moozh nailed the point of the post.  Overall idea for a damage dealer is (Total Damage)/(Fight Time).  Some mages just get way to hung up on seeing nonstop DPS that they lose the &quot;big picture.&quot;<br>
<br>
To explain the &quot;other mage related stuff&quot; better...  When OOM, a mage can either just let pet do damage and click mana free nukes, or the mage can reclaim/suspend the pet, and do a tactic called <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pet Cannibalization</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to recover mana at an extremely high rate, then bring a pet back out and resume normal pet damage and nuking.  There is discussion with mages on whether or not it's better to pet-canni or not when your OOM and the current target is still there.  If you want more explaination you're just going to have to allow me to make more then 1 post per day on this site.   :-) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Sage Eandori Raintree<br>

<br>
This is really a discussion for the mages, I think, but you asked for an opinion, and I have tons of those. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Regardless of which class you play, mage or wizzie, your job is to do damage.

Melees are seeing the casters throw a few nukes, then sit down and do nothing, whereas the melee are fighting the entire time. Somehow in their minds this = a greater overall damage for the melee than the casters.<br>
<br>
His point is that even if a caster does a huge burst of damage in a short amount of time then sits to med for a while, the casters nukes do enough damage that the med time is justified. Even WITH the med time, the caster's OVERALL damage might be greater than the melee that are bitching about it... its just that a caster can choose when to nuke and when to med, and still deal decent damage, whereas the melee have to constantly be doing some sort of attack to contribute any kind of damage in the group. They think casters are being lazy, basically.<br>
<br>
and then he gets into mage stuff, and I really have no idea whether canni pet is more efficient than pet dps, etc.<br>

<br>
Now some shrewd readers are saying &quot;well no depending on your dmg tactics the fight lasts longer or shorter, that affects (overall) dmg from the *streamline* dmg classes and reduces healer mana ect.....&quot; <br>
<br>
So If i decide to deal my 133 dps (from your example) by chain casting focused rend (chain casting rend is about 133dps), im gonnna slowly kill the mob and do my dps, the war ranger ect will do MORE overall dmg because I'm not burning the mob down, im spoonfeeding it down. basically both melee and wizza are lowering the mobs hps at the same time, so the fight lasts longer, and the mob does more dmg and the healer wasts more mana.<br>
<br>
Now that is what I imagine non_canni_your_pet mages are doing, letting the pet beat it down while clicking the boots. This is an efficient way to put dmg but puts stress on your healer.<br>
<br>
Now the other alternative is to burn it, in the wizzard sense of burn.... fight starts war has aggro and we deal the 8k and sit. If the ranger is up in arms about not doing consistent dmg, we cast grater decession on him......<br>
<br>
Example fighting a mob with 50k hps dealing after slows and whatever 400dps (randomly chosen numbers) The group has one perfect MT who does not loose aggro, at all. <br>
 <br>
MT- 60dps, 7.5k hps<br>
Wizza- 330dps (chain casting draught of ro with some focus)<br>
Ranger 80dps<br>
Cleric- 4k manapool (after regenning mana ect) CH hit perfectly<br>
<br>
So the group is putting out 390 dps... now like this it takes 10CHs to finish off the mobs..... or all of the clerics mana (spec bonuses forgotten for simplicity but we get the idea)<br>
<br>
Now the group without the wizza has no chance but well take him to do 0dps and instead burst every now and then with a flaming visage....<br>
<br>
Chs need to land every 12.5 secs so im going to devide the fight in CH intervals<br>
Wizza does 1SoS, 3 SoS, 2 SoS 1 SoS, harvests both up so 0 , 2SoS, 2SoS you gain exp....<br>
<br>
OK so I tortured the numbers a bit so that they worked in my favour, our hero here has 7k manapool (after taking into acount manaregen) also elemental gloves and focus....<br>
<br>
But thru his bursts he managed to save the cleric some mana, about 800mana, and his bursts ended up doing 330ish dps, same dps but less fight time, specificlly about (woa that sounds nice, &quot;specificly about...&quot;) 15 secs off the fight, or 9k dmg...... <br>
<br>
Ok so its not an incredible differance but its there. I would have done the numbers with mages but I dont know you guys well enuf to do that.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that in a normal group that would have to be one hell of a tank to keep that aggro, CHs are landing exactlly as the war hits 1 hp.... all theses simplifications wich add in.<br>
<br>
Personally I preffer to go Boom Boom and sit it out, but then again I dont have a pet to do the consistent dmg for me.<br>

In almost all of the EP fights aside from the big gods(only killed fennin so far ;p) I can run oom, and do this while using efficient spells and not lures/draughts. I went to 12% on one while war discs were up, though. Damage definately is aggro limited but at the same time is limited by your mana. Run out, and you can no longer do damage. On the flip side, aggro must be managed. Personally I keep getting damaged by mobs(ie a touch of melee hits), but only killed 3.5% of the time I ganked aggro on them so far- mainly due to being too close to something unpinned! &lt;3 LR/ID.<br>
<br>
This thread though mainly is about groups. Well, DPS = exp. Melee and caster dps are two different beasts. The melees only produce their dps while fighting, but caster dps `recharges` like a battery and is `discharged` via burst dps. It's up to the puller, NOT the wizard(unless you pull. I do sometimes and pwn it!), as to whether or not the melees have a lot of uptime. Burst dps is really a question of how fast you can spend your mana, in a group. Mages have a hybrid melee dps in the form of the pet, while wizards aside from xuzl are this recharge-burst thing.<br>
<br>
When it comes to how much aaxp you get, consider it mathematically.<br>
Say a 24k hp mob is worth 9% aaxp per kill before split(24,000hp = 9%aaxp) and you have 120dps. 24,000/120 = 9% aaxp per 200 sec, or 162% aaxp per hour is your value. Now, generally people regard aaxp in terms of how much experience they get per hour. Since aaxp can be converted to correspond with a mob's hp by its aaxp per kill, then your dps can be converted into aaxp/s as demonstrated here. Merely taking this over a longer period of time to relate all of the damage done in an hour (432,000 at 120dps sustained) will probably support your point of that the amount of damage you do over a long period of time is more signifiance than burst dps.<br>
<br>
Unless, that is, your mages consider grouping in 5-minute intervals and see the best aaxping that they can do in any particualr one... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=samdeathwalker>Sam DeathWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 633<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/27/03 2:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DeathWalker's Six BoXoR RoXoR &gt; Furor!</span><hr size=1> There is no question overall dps is calculated by total damage / total fight time.

Setting that aside I really don't like to group with mellee's for that reason its always &quot;pull pull pull&quot; even if the caster is no where near ready. Not to say it is their fault they don't get exp when they are not fighting.... <br>
<br>
Really best is all caster group or all mellee group, I am doning Hate a lot with two mixed groups caue the quest items for mellee, priest and hybrid would rot if they were not around (we divide the groups up kinda even and get way more exp then if we were in raid formation). But I do all the pulling and that way I only pull when my wizards are gtg. And then with 4 wizards the mobs fall so fast that the mellee dont get in a lot of hits.... Well I don't know I guess my play style is so different then most (Well the wizard is supposed to take the agro thats why I have a cleric..... ).<br>

Oh and in my long post i dont mean to bash the melee for week dps or anything just that they do dmg that has to be considered into the equation, and i do realise they also play another key role in most groups.<br>

It gets rather annoying when people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>repeatedly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> say how class a does 5% more dps than class b on average, therefore class a *must* be more worthwhile to the group.  We can leave out every other mitigating factor such player skill, equipment, aa selection, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>secondary abilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->; we don't need any of that because some guy on a message board told me that your class doesn't do as much damage as some other class.<br>
<br>
Also, I wouldn't be using a warrior for a DPS example, they're notoriously lousy damage dealers- besides, that's not what the warrior class was designed to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=throes>Throes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flintnilf the Wise</span><br>  Posts: 344<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/27/03 5:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DeathWalker's Six BoXoR RoXoR &gt; Furor!</span><hr size=1> I've always ignored DPS, because of random start/finish points by most players.<br>
