<br>
Actually, no, you wouldn't see much of an improvement.  Odd thing about mage id bracer is, you have to have the lvl 44 summon to affect our lvl 39 spells.  Mages don't get a lvl 39 nuke, so their ID bracer only works up to lvl 34 until they get their lvl 44 spells.  <br>
<br>
I remember being in a similar group in OT and just using the mage ID focused lvl 34 nuke instead of the one we got at lvl 39 because the ID focused nuke ended up being pretty darn close, so it was more mana efficient.  Unless you go all out and chain nuke, this means a mage can outburn a wizard in these level ranges. <br>
<br>
Our lvl 39 dd is really weak. <br>

Columns/Pillars: great for quadding if you have snare/jboots/sow - haven't found much use for them outside of that<br>
<br>
<br>
depending on group setup you can use pillars in a group.  in my old guild a bunch of us used to do lots of exp hunting in howling stones. with 3 or 4 melee each tanking a mob near each other i would use pillar of flame and we where very effecient killing this way.  is a very situational way to use them but when you can it is very effecient to do. <p>aazdazen quickcaster<br>

<br>
Allow me to qualify my statement, though, if I may.  Most groups in the level range the original poster discussed (indeed, basically anything pre-50) don't often have the organization or skills to handle a multi-mob pull well enough to position the mobs so they can be hit by our column/pillar spells.  <br>
<br>
A guild group/raid, as you mentioned, that was well organized, and most likely 50+, would be better able to handle such a situation, and I could definitely see using that spell line in those circumstances.  Twinks and alts might be able to organize such a thing pre-50, though...  I won't say I've never used them in a group, but it has been very rare for me to use them outside of quadding.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course (and give this point the least weight, as it's not applicable to 90% of the EQ population), I'm on a PvP server, and AEs in groups can sometimes hit my own group members, so that's a further restriction.  But that's a minor point.<br>
<br>
<br>
In any case, that still leaves wizards with at best, 2 lines of useful spells in the 1-49 game.  The Al-Kabor's never get better, and channeling skill is level-limited to prevent PBAEs from being terribly useful pre-50, and pre-50 rains have useless ratios.  I agree with the original poster that some of our spell lines (pre-50) could stand to be looked at, and I wouldn't mind seeing a mini-spear line extend down to the lower levels (a la Frozen Harpoon).  With the KEI fix, perhaps SOE will consider taking a look at them.  /crosses fingers <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=necridious>Necridious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 10:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lvl 39 spells</span><hr size=1> Well, pre 50 rains do have one advantage for the low level caster-- they don't draw as much aggro, which, without Concussion they need to really stay on top of the aggro control.<br>
<br>
Rains are still fubar, since they *always* break root if they land damage, have a hardcode resist rate, and for some odd reason don't land 3 waves all the time--it's just stupid to limit it by 'hits'. <p><br>

<br>
Again, check the parse result I posted in the Class Balance and Bugs forum.  My paladin was 36 at the time and did the same amount of damage over time.  Another point is that we were well within each other's level range for sharing exp in a group.  It's very typical to have a few levels difference between group members.  <br>
<br>

<br>
For one, I really don't think most people are taking this as a personal attack on their class.  I didn't have to be honest and critique the wizard's choice of spells.  But I gave my opinion on it because I wanted to make sure it was understood that I thought that the wizard could actually do a bit better.<br>
<br>
And I'll say it again, this is what really happens ingame.  You can't control what spells people choose to cast or when to cast them.  Most people don't sit down with a calculator and plan out their spellcasting for maximum efficiency.  This guy was using what was available to him and it's hard to really fault him for it.  Wizards have a pretty pathetic spell lineup in this level range and I would actually give him credit for at least not using Alakabor, pillar or PBAE's.<br>
<br>
I don't think there's any coincidence that SOE chose to nerf KEI for low levels at the same time as they started displaying spell damage.  So now there's some hard truth coming out and maybe it's not always going to be pretty.  I can't sit here and force SOE to seriously look at what needs to be changed but I hope they would at least make a real effort for once instead of giftwrapping a few more nice presents for the uber wizards and calling it a day.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 4759<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 6:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladain (40) and Wizard (36) damage log</span><hr size=1> Do you happen to have the melee uptime of the paladin and mage pet? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zarbonius>Zarbonius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 7:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladain (40) and Wizard (36) damage log</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You can't control what spells people choose to cast or when to cast them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
True, but I try to give friendly pointers/advice to lower level wizards when I'm grouped with them on my alts.  I'm not sure that I would have stayed silent for 40 minutes in a group watching the wizard use pre-50 rains, when I know they're hurting both his output, and the effectiveness of the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
I don't see your initial post as an attack on any class, really.  But the nature of your parsing situation made it difficult to tell exactly what you were trying to show.  /shrug, it's a good effort, but a parse of that nature is unlikely to convince SOE of anything.  <br>
<br>
It is a first step, though - more data is always good, although the more balanced/unbiased the situations that you log and parse, the more weight they are likely to have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 7:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladain (40) and Wizard (36) damage log</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The magician just played like most pet casters at all levels; lazy as hell and not exactly squeezing out every last drop of their mana.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Um, from reading your posts, and follow ups, and the comment I quoted above, your arguement lost a lot of credibility with me. <br>
<br>
You come across has having a beef with casters vs melee, rather then really trying to show something here. <br>
<br>
And like you said, you had damage shields, and no proper way to give credit where credit is due. Is your damage amount including the damage shields? You don't say if your damage includes that or not. I'm thinking, it does. Most melees I know always say, Look I was doing x amount of damage each time I got hit! <br>
<br>
Your comments about wrong spells, and lazy pet casters hardly seem like the best way to prove that your rocked, and they sucked. Not to mention you were slightly twinked, as you put it. And yes, at those levels, four levels do make a difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xanthippe>Xanthippe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 8:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> A mage was always able to outdamage us wizards at same level.

Currently most of the talk in this thread and for that matter Graffes has talked about how KEI affects Wizards and the Wizard's balance to other groups.<br>
<br>
When KEI was able to be casted on me (level 1-40) I could out aggo any melee person when I had at least 20% mana, regardless of how tweaked they are.  Why does that matter?  Chain nuking is the fastest way to do damage and the way to get the most damage in.  With KEI, this was our real constraint in a group.  Now, without KEI, my constraint is my mana regen.  This has lowered my damage output at my early 40's.<br>
<br>
So, what's my point?  If they gave KEI back to mid-level wizards it would bring them a bit closer into balance with their tweaked melee counterparts.  Other then under level 20, I think we can all agree that KEI made life easier for wizards and put us on par with melee tweaks about the same level.  That said, I agree with the KEI 'nerf' even though I really hate it.<br>
<br>
Why is that?  Look at a Paladin/Ranger/Cleric/Shaman/Druid at the mid level game with KEI.  With 'free' mana, the Paladin/Ranger has virtually no downtime because they should have near full mana at the end of a fight to heal themselves up to full, then regen while fighting.  Maybe it's not quite as good as I'm saying, but KEI on low level casting melees that can heal is over-powering.  Now, what about the Cleric/Shaman/Druid?  With healers having no mana constraints, the group can pull and pull and pull and pull and pull.  That, again, is over powering.  There is no cap like wizards have with aggo.<br>
<br>
So, no KEI really sucks for wizards because it was actually somewhat balanced for us.  But I agree with the change because of healers with KEI was making the tweaked melee so much more powerful (especially when the tweaked melee could heal themselves).<br>
<br>
At 46+ KEI is still really only a great boon for wizards and druids.  We can bind somewhere fairly safe, port out, get KEI, gate back, and re-join the group.  Others must take more time to get a refresh which means they either don't get a refresh, loose valuable time and possibly their place in the group, or are limited in hunting groups that are fairly close to PoK book (errm, anyone ever wonder why LoY is so sparsely populated... that's right KEI.)<br>
<br>
Ok, last but not least, can someone send me a link to &quot;Damage Parsing for Dummies&quot;?  I think I want to start running my own experiments and post it in that other forum there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 938<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 10:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tweaked mid-lvl Paladin spanks lower lvl wizard in dmg.</span><hr size=1> I'm not overly concerned about whether or not I can outdamage another class in a group.

<br>
Instead, I see myself in a group function as one who speeds the killing process along.  I'm going to eat up about 30 - 40% of a mobs hitpoints during a fight (with no resists).  The melee's/other casters will take care of the rest.  The fact that in two casts, I can erase that much health of a mob means we will be able to pull more mobs, which means more XP and loot for the group.<br>

There is absolutely nothing that you can give to a caster that can match that as far as equipment is concerned.  That is a design problem.  I have no doubt (at that level with that weapon) that the pally is doing big damage.<br>
<br>
(2)  Did mage have a focus item for his pet?  If he didn't then that is still another problem and one that that mage should work on.  It will make a real difference.<br>
<br>
(3)  As you pointed out, nuke selection is important--they didn't make the correct choice.<br>
<br>
(4)  Aggro--were you doing you're job holding aggro?  Were you purposely not stunning alot so that if the casters tried to up their damage they'd take aggro then get verbally bashed for doing so?  I don't know just asking.<br>
<br>
(5)  Did they (mage Wiz) have horses?<br>
<br>
(6)  Why didn't you add in DS damage which over time can account for up to 25-30% more damage for the mage.<br>
<br>
(7)  Did you add the pets special attack into damage?  No you couldn't have because no parser shows it (so when we look at damage of the mage not taking this into account always makes me laugh my ass off since I'm a 65 mage.  Water pet doing 160 lure DD every 6 seconds adds up to a shit ton).<br>
<br>
So in conclusion there are alot of variables.  (A)Twinking casters is not nearly as good as twinking melee (efficiency wise).  Once again a game design flaw. (B) You're logs don't show everything. (C) The most efficient way to twink casters is with a horse and KEI and you have rightly pointed out that the lack of KEI has hurt casters.  Good now how about some love for the lower end casters then since focus items don't compensate for giving a melee a fungi, a CoCW/CoF, and a good weapon (pick one). (D) Wizards in particular don't come into there own until later in the game (bad design but that's how it is), then they are a terror.  They are supposedly compensated by greater ease of soloing though (can be argued I know).  So if your point was to demonstrate that in the lower end game (1-50) that casters need some help Vs their twinked melee bretheren you have reaffirmed what we all know. Grats!<br>

I will say though, speaking from experience that at 44, even with no kei but using shock of swords and focused 44 water or fire pet that you couldn't possibly do the damage that the mage is doing--especially with his new DS included.  And when he gets to 49 he far and away kicks your ass by a wide margin.  I think the designers realize this and that's how they decide game balance by how the character does over its life rather than in ranges.<br>
<br>
Btw, the most damaging character in that group would have been the enchanter if you chose to charm.  With creativity and skill come effectiveness.  The least damaging character in your parse could have not only been doing the most additive damage via haste but also direct damage with a dual wielding, hasted charmed mob.  Something to think about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 12:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tweaked mid-lvl Paladin spanks lower lvl wizard in dmg.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And like you said, you had damage shields, and no proper way to give credit where credit is due.

Here's how EQC lists the damage:<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
My uptime: 24 minutes, 24 seconds<br>
Xabanab's uptime: 19 minutes, 4 seconds<br>
<br>
Sometimes the magician was a bit slow in getting the pet involved but that's realistic for normal grouping situations.  It's actually understandable too since the average fight time was 35 seconds per mob.  A few seconds delay in sending in the pet will add up after awhile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dedanaanclan>DeDanaan Clan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 1:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Enchanter contribution</span><hr size=1> Please credit your enchanter with about a quarter of the paladin's damage.

<br>
Uptime was 50%.  At L 34, you meditate at 15 mana / tick.<br>
<br>
Assuming you stand while the mob is in camp, that's 5945 mana per caster.<br>
<br>
Wizard damage / mana: 1.89 (+damage shield)<br>
Mage damager / mana: 1.13 (+damage shield)<br>
<br>
Lava storm is a 1.87 ratio nuke (counting earring and spec).<br>
Ice shock is a 2.57 ratio nuke (counting focus and spec).<br>
<br>
So, the wizard could have done a good 15 k damage if he had used ice shock.<br>
<br>
Adding in a horse would have upped damage by another 8 k.<br>
<br>
Adding in a solists wand as well would have upped damage by another 5 k.<br>
<br>
The wizard, with a horse, clarity, and an icy wand, would hit 28 k damage.  Still less than the paladin.<br>

By counting the DS towards your dmg, or not counting towards the mages, you are not getting proper counts.<br>
<br>
The DS dmg should atributed to the caster, not the target.  Snd if it s ebing ignored, then the figures are real off. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.skybyrd.net/Images/gaffa/Oaker.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Come on, a level 40 weilding a 28/30 weapon? That's a joke. <br>
<br>
Any weapon that overpowered needs to be limited to 51+, or thereabouts. I also don't like how everything was toned down - for example the level 1-10 no exp loss issue. More and more EQ is becoming less a challenge, and more a &quot;if I sit here long enough maybe I can level up 4 level 65 characters.&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope the KEI nerf is a sign of the times...bring the challenge back, reduce boredom frustrations.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 654<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/16/03 3:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tweaked mid-lvl Paladin spanks lower lvl wizard in dmg.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Please credit your enchanter with about a quarter of the paladin's damage.

The enchanter was using augmentation for haste and clarity for buffs.  So if I give the enchanter credit for some of my damage output, so does the wizard.<br>
<br>
Thanks for bringing that up though.  It shows the disparity between haste buffs and mana regen buffs from level 29 to 46.  <br>
<br>
Level 29-39<br>
Clarity: Increase Mana by 4 (L29) to 7 (L4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  per tick<br>
Augmentation: Increase Attack Speed by 22% (L29) to 28% (L52)<br>
Quickness:Increase Attack Speed by 28% (L16) to 30% (L20)<br>
Alacrity:Increase Attack Speed by 34% (L24) to 40% (L36)<br>
<br>
Level 39<br>
Celerity: Increase Attack Speed by 47% (L39) to 50% (L44)<br>
<br>
I think SOE must have something up their sleeve if you look at the KEI nerf and grouping bonus combined.  If they want to encourage grouping and felt that KEI needed to be gone from low levels they need to either add/change some spells or put some good caster gear in there.  Pre-46 caster balancing is pretty much back to square one now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26955.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26955.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26955.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26955.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
