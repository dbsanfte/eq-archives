LDoN is much closer to what most people were looking for when they purchased EQ. And I find instanced dungeons to be a lot more realistic than 90 people in a dungeon as an occupying force spread out every five feet. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Whether or not raiding is the selling point on the back of the box, it is a fairly well-established fact that EverQuest encourages &quot;raiding&quot;; that is, entering zones in multiple groups, coordinating a systemic clear, camp, and kill methodology, and receiving the spoils of battle, largely in the form of loot. Since the first days when players would camp Ambassador D'Vinn for his Dragoon Dirk, to the raiding of the planes, virtually every level tier has emphasized high rewards through high risk. Given the architecture of EverQuest itself, it's fairly evident that the primary way that risk manifests itself is if threats are presented that cannot be handled by a single group, and consequently, most of the game's desirable rewards, particularly in the mid-to-end game, are acquirable only by multiple groups.<br>
<br>
I'm not specifically defending &quot;raiding&quot; as a desirable way to play EverQuest -- to the contrary, I find nothing more boring than a multiple hour pull-and-kill fest, and on the whole, EverQuest has not changed much over the past four years with this respect. That being said, there are those that actually do enjoy raiding - whether it's from a leadership standpoint, or simply from the epic-scale of large encounters; but for me, the novelty of the latter wore off after the first few raids, and the responsibilities I had under the former were so tedious that they ultimately sapped the joy I derived from it. So, obviously, one would think that this change would be eagerly embraced, especially by someone who detests the raiding lifestyle. Admittedly, there is, after all, major appeal to being able to engage in short expeditions with a single group that yield in a good experience. <br>
<br>
I seriously challenge your statement that &quot;most people were looking for&quot; something like LDoN when they purchased EverQuest. When I purchased EverQuest in June of 1999, I was looking not for a Diablo-clone, where I could grab a bunch of my buddies and go and &quot;do&quot; and dungeon, but instead for an immersive, massively-multiplayer virtual experience, where I could role play the existence of my character and compete and interact with hundreds and thousands of players. Though it can be argued that at least some aspects of the second vision have not been fully manifested over the years, on the whole, it's fair to say that if people wanted to play Diablo, they could do so best by purchasing the Blizzard product. I think that most people who purchased EverQuest, furthermore, didn't want to play with just five other people in an instanced dungeon, and then shut off the game. That's not what McQuaid billed the game as, and that's certainly not how it was promoted.<br>
<br>
Please don't misconstrue my argument, however -- I have no problem with SOE catering to non-uber gamers (as my wizard, whom I have played since I first played EQ, definitely falls into the non-uber category), and it is ultimately inevitable for the designers to begin to appeal more and more to the average population of its subscriber base in order to retain revenues in a product that no longer attracts substantial growth to replace its turn-over. I applaud Lost Dungeons of Norrath because it will really strengthen friendships among smaller groups of friends.<br>
<br>
But the price, as was mentioned earlier, is unfortunately very high. Immersiveness and continuity are both sacrificed in this move by creating a series of instanced dungeons, because players will no longer be required to rely upon a broader base of fellow adventurers, and they will consequently demand less class diversity. If people simply require six characters to undertake an encounter, you can rest assured that most encounters will be mapped out with &quot;ideal&quot; classes (much like some camps today are hyped up as preferrably done with x number of one class, and x number of another), further marginalizing some classes that have limited utility. There are also serious doubts in my mind that SOE can create proportional rewards to match the risks faced by these single-group excursions, but I've got faith that if the encounters are long enough and difficult enough for the single group, the rewards will be substantial. But aside from the design and architecture concerns, we should examine the impact on the game's communities.<br>
<br>
Emphasis on EverQuest has always been put upon large groups of people interacting with one another, and thereby developing a system of interdependency. Competition over limited resources (i.e., spawns and their loot) was, despite its frustration, part of the original plan to encourage guilds to establish parameters for engagement. Because people needed other people to advance, guilds formed one (but obviously, not the only) of the chief avenues for networking and cooperation. Communities, on EverQuest, are built around the massively-multiplayer experience, because ultimately, that's what makes Norrath come alive -- it's the many players that constitute its world. <br>
<br>
Obviously, Lost Dungeons of Norrath won't shatter this world view, but it will create a competing paradigm that places socialization and teamwork among a small, select few in stark contrast to the norm everywhere else in the game -- and that is interdependence and interaction with dozens of other players in a huge game world that institutions, organizations and practices that add depth to the pixels and bytes of an otherwise predictable game. It is, after all, the people that make the MMORPG, not so much the content. That being said, the content that does exist in EverQuest has almost always revolved around a camping and raiding methodology. The skills that players acquire while in instanced dungeons will be largely inapplicable outside of these specialized encounters. Nonetheless, it is a good business decision - because ultimately, players that spend time in instanced dungeons, won't really advance into the end-game scenario any quicker.<br>
<br>
Unless, that is, the rewards are disproportionate to the risks. That remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
Just my sincere thoughts.<br>

<br>
There was a time when this was not the case.  High rewards were obtained through patience and repetition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the primary way that risk manifests itself is if threats are presented that cannot be handled by a single group, and consequently, most of the game's desirable rewards, particularly in the mid-to-end game, are acquirable only by multiple groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is the &quot;Post Old World&quot; model.  In the old world there were really only four multigroup raids... Efretti, Fire Giants and the two dragons.  Ninety-nine percent of all items were acquired by camping or canpquesting (or trading... there were very few nodrop items by comparison to today's standard).<br>
<br>
With the advent of the planes this changed.  The planes brought out the need for forty people to routinely get together to get armor.  I believe it is the planes that created the modern uberguild.  Until then there were very few &quot;raiding&quot; guilds because they were not necessary.  <br>
<br>
So when Triton posts jokingly on their main board &quot;Anyways, keep checking back for us killing and destroying shit in Plane of Time before the next expansion destroys uber guilds everywhere.&quot;  There is something to that idea.  (Although I am sure it is tongue in cheek).  <br>
<br>
Verant clearly thought that &quot;raiding&quot; was good.  It designed the next three major expansions as raiding expansions with PoP being &quot;raid necessary&quot; to advance.  The problem is that raids take large amounts of time and that focusses on only one part of the player base. (albeit a large part).  <br>
<br>
I personally am only barely able to stay online for the amount of time a &quot;raiding&quot; guild demands.  Look at the recruiting of major raiding guilds these days.  Many are losing members faster than they can replace them.  I welcome an expansion that caters to a shorter online period focussed on smaller groups.  The raiding guild model has lots to do already with three raid expansions.  <br>
<br>
Lets get back to &quot;Going down to King.... need enchanter to round out group.&quot;  That is when the game was most fun for me.        <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 13350<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 7:50 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Re: ldon Well, with instancing technology, you could ea</span><hr size=1> Kaelon, for some reason I can't copy-and-paste from your giant treatise, but let me just say I find the notion that a six person group in an instanced dungeon somehow threatening the basic fabric of EQ society to be a bizarre one. The fact is, MOST PEOPLE DO NOT RAID. Most people associate with a dozen or so folks on their /friend list, and do XP camps with a single group at a time. Period.<br>
<br>
Go wander around the Plane of Nightmare, or Karnor's Castle or Paludal Caverns.<br>
<br>
Those aren't multiple groups actively cooperating -- indeed, people carve out discreet areas and try to keep other groups from interfering with their experiences. The only thing that many of them willingly participate in beyond the borders of their group are various channels to talk in.<br>
<br>
All of these people have the ability to work together in /raid mode, but they choose not to. They want a single group experience and they do everything they can to achieve it.<br>
<br>
EverQuest is NOT a raiding game for most of its members. Go wander around the zones sometime and do a headcount. I have, when I've been at loose ends. The vast majority of players on my two year old server are in XP zones, not in raid zones.<br>
<br>
LDoN is giving those people a variant on the type of play they normally experience.<br>
<br>
For those that enjoy raiding, they have Kunark, Velious, Luclin and PoP to play while waiting six more months for the expansion after LDoN. For the handful (and it is a handful) of guilds that will be finished with all that content by that point, they can relax and realize this is the consequence of what they get for racing through all content as fast as they can. As a tiny fraction of a small subset, they don't get everything catered around their interests. It's just not a smart move from a business standpoint. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-gear.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/17/03 7:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=menarion>Menarion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 165<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 8:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Re: ldon Well, with instancing technology, you could ea</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I seriously challenge your statement that &quot;most people were looking for&quot; something like LDoN when they purchased EverQuest.

<br>
I'm truly stumped  how anyone can think the addition of LDoN would make a EQ a Diablo clone.<br>
<br>
Secondly EQ was billed as an MMORPG.  MMORPG does not mean &quot;raiding groups of 72&quot; game.  It means thousands of people to interact with.  Rewards were based around a six person group, evidenced by the fact that only six people can join a group.  It is not until fairly recently that a raid group was introduced to the game and even more recently raid experience.<br>
<br>
As far as 6 people doing a dungeon and then shutting off EQ...riiiiiight... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=306743">Arkinon Ben'Dar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

However, raids were a partof the end game of the original release (Vox, Naggy, Fire Giants and Efreeti).  In order to upgrade your gear raids became NECESSARY even before the introduction of Kunark with the introduction of Hate and Fear. <br>
<br>
Kunark brought us dragons and the first real uberguild &quot;strategy challenge&quot; (IMHO) of Trakanon.  <br>
<br>
From there you had basically nothing but UBER guild content in Velious, Luclin and PoP.  <br>
<br>
It has seemed to me that each of those expansions catered more and more to uberguilds.  Something happened after PoP.  I will be damned if I know how but someone put the brakes on uberguild focus.  Personally, I could not be happier that Verant is going to step back and focus on more casual players and maybe get back to the days of &quot;camps please?&quot;  &quot;Magi Hand King Cavalier Exe!!&quot;<br>

Sometimes these multiplayer games remind me of the Monty Python skit &quot;Bicycle repair man&quot; where everyone is Superman. Since everybody is an adventurer, the adventure areas can get crowded.<br>
<br>
Most people are not in any danger of using up the  &quot;end game&quot; content that there is, adding more of that would be foolish. (2% is certainly not a major underestimation of the players who are in elementals+.)<br>
<br>
A series of dungeons linked by quests which help to tie the storyline of Norrath together. Each dungeon is designed to both challenge and reward the specific group that enters it, and should be completed in 45 to 90 minutes. The promise sounds good. We will have to see how much of that it lives up to, but I am glad to see the shift in focus from increasing the top level game.<br>
<br>
The addition of breakable objects and the idea of catering each dungeon to the group on the mission makes me think they could make Al'Kabor spells useful. Five carefully placed objects that must be damaged simultaneously could do it.<br>

<br>
Most people do 'raid'.  But I think the problem is you're defining raid as something completely different.<br>
<br>
I can't think of a single guild that doesn't want to raid, in some manner.  Granted, some of them don't do it often, but I think every guild does it.  Some guilds can only manage a group, some unfortunately can't even do that. BUT ALL OF THEM RAID.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>.raid., a hostile or predatory incursion : a surprise attack by a small force; a brief foray outside one's usual sphere : a daring operation against a competitor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Now, I will fully admit that LDoN could qualify in some aspect as raiding, but IMO the information we have makes it sound like it will be able to be completed by a standard XP group (i.e. very little challenge).<br>
<br>
A *NORMAL* xp group should never be able to get gear equivelent to gear that rivals what you would have earned by taking 30 well equipped people into a dangerous situation.<br>
<br>
Now, if the dungeons scale difficulty correctly, and you can take a Time equipped group in and get some loot that they would actually want to keep, then LDoN works perfectly.  However, if you can bring a Kunark equipped group in and get Elemental level loot, the entire game is going to suffer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elidaarruneweaver>Elidaar Runeweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/03 7:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Befallen</span><hr size=1> &gt;I thought Befallen was Tashkiz'Hiz.

Befallen was originally an outpost in the Commonlands for the Paladins of Marr; their largest fortress to control the onslaught of the Deathfist on Freeport.  It was destroyed in one night by an evil force contained within a wandering lunatic by the name of Gynok Moltor (the named mummy in the Paw of Opolla quest). <br>

The key word here is &quot;few&quot;; it's one thing to be able to interact with thousands of people when I like, but when I'm actually adventuring I want it closer to Record of Lodoss War than the Invasion of Normandy Beach. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

While I agree that one shouldn't get super high quality loot from these dungeons without a corresponding super high difficulty, I do think the current requirement to get 20, 30, 40... hell, 70+ people together for any kind of meaningful upgrade to a character is... not optimal game design.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion, though. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.marshall.edu/~wellma15/spritesig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 656<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/18/03 8:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Befallen</span><hr size=1> I think the challenge factor of EQ's been misplaced for a long freakin time.  It shouldn't be in how much masochistically dull grinding you can do or if you can tolerate the overall suckness of working with a large guild on a raid.  It should be about being skilled at playing your class and working as a team.  <br>
<br>
If that team gets too big your individual contribution tends to get lost.  If the amount of time it takes to accomplish what you're trying to do is too long then it gets boring after awhile.  60-90 minutes is about equal to my &quot;fun&quot; attention span time.  When I go over that it usually starts to get really monotonous.  <br>
<br>
SOE seems to be really trying to make EQ into a legitimately good game rather than a timesink for people with social problems.

Having left a raiding guild a little before they hit the elemental planes due to time constraints and a general boredom with the whole raiding scene I ended up joining a small guild of good friends who like tearing around Norrath getting ourselves in trouble and having fun. Suddenly I remembered why I actualyl started playing this game again. It wasn't to kill gods (hell there wasn't even a god up until after I bought EQ) it was to hang around with mates and get in trouble in some deep horrible pit surrounded by nasty critters who wanted a piece of me. <br>
Strikes me this is what LDoN is going to provide, I've nothing against PoP, some of it's kidna fun and I every now and then merc myself out to friendly guilds for a taste of the old raiding game, but a whole expansion targetted at the 6 person group is just awesome, particaually is that expansion can work for groups of any level of power. Tho I'm hardly elemental planes /Potime I have as do most of my guildies (all ex raiders) have pretty solid kit, I'd like to see these challenge me, the same as they'd challenge a group of 6 level 35's or A group of 6 from Triton seems SOE are working at that and if it's achieved damn that's something awesome for EQ.<br>
