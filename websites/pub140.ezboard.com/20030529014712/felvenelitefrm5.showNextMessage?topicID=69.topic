The Lana'Ch'Graokh twisted through his beard had been glowing for hours.  The dreams of the small warrior had been very disturbing as of late.  They told of a future which he could not prevent, of the passing of the title of leadership of the Kuhn'Tcha Moreia.  Blahg's mind raced.<br>
<br>
How could it be possible?  The Lana'Ch'Graokh which signified his leadership of the New Moreia had been fused with his body and soul.  How could this be passed to another?  And to whom?<br>
<br>
Blahg found himself wandering a familiar path towards a tunnel leading to the lair of some small creatures called Netherbian.  He had gone through their lair many times, as another tunnel from within it lead to some of his favorite hunting grounds.  As he walked upwards through the entrance tunnel, he turned over his recent dreams in his head, seaching for clues, finding nothing.  When his Lana'Ch'Graokh first began to glow, he took up his arms, looking nervously about, waiting for an attack which never came.  After hours of the force flowing through his body, he knew it must cease soon, or the power of Brell Serilis would surely crush him.<br>
<br>
A rustling sound from his left caused him to whirl around crazily, drawing weapons and preparing for attack.  A bloody hand hung over a boulder in the path, and behind it lay a dying guardsman.  Just then, he noticed the stench he had been walking through since entering the tunnel.  Blahg had only noticed this strange rotting smell in one place, and it nearly gagged him the first time he entered the hall of the Maestro of Rancor.  This was the odor of Innoruk's minions.   As he turned to find the source of the nauseating stench, a hand picked him up and tossed him to the side.  His armor crumpled in at the force of the blow, and not even Brell's forces could prevent the odd bits of shattered armor from piercing his sides, drawing the very air from his lungs.  Blahg looked up just in time to see the massive head of Innoruk's own warhammer, Gardash, crush the front of his helm.  Everything went black.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
&quot;Come my son, we have much to do.  I am sorry that I could not protect you, but your charge in that world is nearly completed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brell scurried ahead of him, as Blahg slowly stumbled up the hall feeling very lightheaded and queasy.  They soon entered an area Blahg had never seen before.  A small table sat in the gloom, surrounded by several chairs. Brell motioned towards a chair and sat at the other side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blahg, you have served me well, but I have need of you here, with me, now.  Before you come to me, you must do one last thing.  The Lana'Ch'Graokh must be passed to a new leader of the Moreia.  This person must be strong and wise, and must have the trust of those you have found to fight for good.  There is a young warrior, I think you know whom I speak of.  She must carry the Lana'Ch'Graokh for you, and fight evil in your place among the Moreia and the Armies of Light.  Debba must take this charge, and fight the legions of Innoruk's minions.  She will need help, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aryllian and Lenian&quot; whispered Blahg.  Aryllian had always been able to feel the power of the Lana'Ch'Graokh, even when he couldn't see it to know that it was fueling Blahg's fight, and Lenian had always been like a lighthouse for Debba, helping her through the worst storms.  Perhaps there was more between the two then it seemed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.  Between the three, they will make for fine leadership of the Moreia.   Go now, your friends are near.&quot;<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
The light hurt Blahg's eye.  Debba sat nearby with Lenian, and Aryllian stood guard a short ways away from the small fire.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Rest, little one.  Seyah and Slaini are on their way, and surely they can help you.&quot;  The kindness on Debba's face eased the pain a bit.<br>
<br>
Lenian sat there, fidgeting with his sword, unsure of what to do, knowing that the healers may not make it in time.  Black grease marked Blahg's wounds, a sign of the tainted weapons carried by Innoruk and his minions.  Blahg had been saved from this poison once.  Twice may be too much to hope for.<br>
<br>
&quot;Debba...  Lenian...  Aryllian.&quot;  Blahg gasped as he shifted his weight.<br>
<br>
Blahg struggled to release a small sword from his belt.  Debba helped him free it, and as he raised the blade, he whispered to his friends.  &quot;My time here is short.  There is a great power in three's, and you must all carry on in my place.&quot;  Blahg's skin paled as he cut the Lana'Ch'Graokh from his beard, the power crackling along the hand which held it.  &quot;Debba, you must take this, and carry it at all times.  You are the new leader of the Kuhn'Tcha Moreia.  The three of you must go to Kaladim and speak with the high priests there.  They will know the rites to perform, and can help you all understand your new duties.  Please take me there also, so that I may rest with my family's fallen.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tear from Debba's lovely eyes fell upon Blahg's cheek.  &quot;Gather near my friends, so I may see you one last time.&quot;  He studied the face of each for a moment, then touched each one gently, an act they all would have thought impossible for the warrior a short while before.  &quot;May Brell light your paths, and may I see you again in the heavens.  I will be watching over you, my friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blahg turned slightly to ease the pain, and as his friends looked on in sorrow, the light passed from his eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=68.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=68.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=68.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=68.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=68.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
