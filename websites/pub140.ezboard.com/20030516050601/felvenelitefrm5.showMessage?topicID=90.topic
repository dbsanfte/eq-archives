His mind is filled with an unholy torment.  His friends pass by and speak words of kindness, but he continues on unhearing.  What is it that Bristlebane calls to him to do?<br>
<br>
He finds himself in the gardens of the hall of the Elven Elite, but he finds himself hiding in the shadows.  He realizes that his heart is what really is in shadow.  He knows that he must now make a choice and let all be settled by it.  He heads from the gardens in search of the Grand Moff.<br>
<br>
He enters via the window, undetected by Aryllyian.  He clears his throat as he approaches the desk.  “Sir Aryllyian, I must speak to you regarding the troubles of my heart,” Myrrer begins.<br>
<br>
“In the past several days I have felt a pull to do that which you and those of the Elite will find most horrific and I am not certain of my course.  I ask that you listen to my story and think upon my dilemma.  Then I ask your advice.”<br>
<br>
At Aryllyian’s nod Myrrer continues, “Good knight, I have felt a recent pull to enter an area forbidden by the oath I have sworn as a member of the Elven Elite.  I am not sorry, that I cannot find fault with my desire to enter the gardens of the Goddess and take its dweller’s life.  She after all is not the one I worship.  However, I am not an oath breaker and no person shall be able to state otherwise.<br>
<br>
“You are my oldest friend of the membership and you know I have the heart of a rogue, but not a black heart at all.  My troubles are in the conflict of oath versus a pull that I believe comes from Bristlebane himself.  It would be simple if that was the sole conflict, but a greater one arises, as here is my home, my friends and those I’d die for above any calling.  And I do not wish to depart this hall.”<br>
<br>
“Please do not respond immediately but think upon this for me, I shall in the meantime seek out others for their guidance.<br>
<br>
Myrrer exits through the door and seeks out Vladimirski, Seyah, Rokken, Firinn and Craw and relays his dilemma to them, parting with the same request, “Think upon this for a time and allow me to wander the lands and consider this further.  I vow to not break my oath until I have had your council.”<br>
<br>
As he exits the Guild Hall, Myrrer looks back and wonders if this, his only home, will still welcome him when next he returns… <br>

Bending his entire will toward peace, he remains silent while the Rogue speaks.  It strikes Ary as very odd that this Halfling would risk all that he loves for  some rash and impetuous impulse.  But, Followers of Bristlebane often act without any pretense of forethought.  Ary smiles and nods, while pulling his cloak tighter to shelter against the sudden breeze.<br>
<br>
Inside, Aryllyian burns with a desire to react violently to this rogue's outlandish and self absorbing desires.  Projecting a calmness bought through many seasons of loss, Aryllyian's eyes clearly express the sadness of a passing friend.  To Ary the Rogue has suddenly become Elthoeill (an elven concept of outsider)<br>
<br>
Aryllyian's world is black and white.  You are either friend or foe.  As Myrrer slips into the shadows, Ary whispers,  &quot;So it comes to this, old friend....May Tunare stay my wrath and May Bristlebane lead you to righteousness&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=firinn>Firinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Leader / BFB</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(12/17/02 2:59:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Temptation of a Rogue</span><hr size=1>      Its late in the guildhall, quiet and subdued.  A large painted barbarian sits in the corner, facing the wall, engaged in ritual.  Firinn sits in the darkness, in silence, slow gestures are made, his head head slightly turned, as if listening, his eyes open, staring into the infinite darkess.  <br>
     A soft voice ripples the silence, &quot;Hello, bear.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Hello, rogue.&quot; the shaman responds, without turning.<br>
    &quot;I've come to seek council, Firinn.  My heart is burdened with choices I wish I did not have to make.&quot;<br>
    Firinn rises and turns to face the rogue, looking down he studies Myrrer's face for a moment, and then sits.  &quot;Lets talk friend, tell me of your troubles.&quot;<br>
    Myrrer explains the calling of Bristlebane, the very calling of adventure, that draws him to the lands of Tunare.  They talk of the fantastic possibilities of exploring a new land, the excitement and the anticipation of the unknown, and the possibility of great reward.  The rogue explains his dilema, his call to adventure, and his loyalty to his friends.  He knows that an act of aggression against Tunare will be a violation of trust with his friends, though he does not feel their devotion to Tunare.  They talk of possibilities, of adventures past, and adventures yet to come.<br>
    &quot;Myrrer, my friend and companion, I fear you will find the Elves intolerant of trangressions against Tunare.  Many are followers of Tunare, and cannot fathom what it is you are considering.  Know that I cannot fault your inclination; as it serves your lord Bristlebane, if only for the adventure, and, I believe it serves your very nature.  Though, you may find the rewards do not outweigh the loss, you may also find other association more suited to your wanderings.  No matter which you choose, your are always welcome in my company.  Also know, that if you stay, you may still satisfy your lord Bristlebane with great adventures in the company of Elves, though you will never hunt the realm of Tunare.  I do not envy the choice before you, friend, but I do hope you will decide to keep this guildhall as your home.&quot;<br>
    With that, they both stand.  Firinn once again looks down on his friends face, frowns, and then smiles.  &quot;Safe journey to you rogue, it is time for me to rest.  Do let me know what you decide.&quot;  The barbarian turns and walks away.<br>

The pint of ale in his hands does little to comfort him at this hour, for a dark cloud has descended over his heart.  <br>
<br>
He recalls, glumly, the argument he had with Myrrer, begging him not to follow this path.  If Craw had a practical, rational side, he would have realized that Myrrer must follow his heart and do what he believes to be right.  However, as we all know, Dwarves are neither practical or rational.<br>
<br>
So instead, he sits alone, wondering if he’ll ever see his friend in these halls again.<br>
