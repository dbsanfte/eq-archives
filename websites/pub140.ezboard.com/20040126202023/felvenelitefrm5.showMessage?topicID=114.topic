The gnome, garbed in a striking black robe with blue and green trim appeared quite distressed.   The usual spark gone from his eyes, his face drawn into a tight frown, he plodded along the road, seeming to hardly care which direction he headed in.  Throughout the twisting hills he rode, until at last he came to a hidden clearing tucked neatly among steep cliffs.  Three stones of chiseled granite jutted from the earth, each bearing a name.<br>
<br>
Sliding from his pony, the gnome fell to his knees beside the smallest of the tombstones, a tear beading in the corner of his eye.  Greggle, as the gnome was known, mourned in this position for quite some time, finally kissing his fingers and laying them gently upon the tombstone of his only love, Rashukch.  After a moment, he rose, drawing energy from the air until shafts of orange lightning swirled around his hands.  Pointing at the earth near the three gravestones, he unleashed the energy to create a deep hole in the ground.  Turning to the cart, he gently forced a dark ebony casket to rise from its place in the back.  Slowly drawing the casket until it rested, floating, just above the hole, he looked one last time towards his long time friend, Blahg.<br>
<br>
Greggle had found Blahg in the Plane of Knowledge, staring blankly at a tome pulled randomly from the shelves of the Great Library.  His old friend looked somehow faded, as though the forces keeping him in this world past his death were weakening.  Sitting across the table, he gently asked what was wrong.  Blahg slowly looked up, paused for a moment, and asked his friend to &quot;make arrangements&quot;.  Blahg's god was slowly releasing his hold upon the dwarf, allowing him to finally drift into eternal sleep once again.  A new leader of the Moreia had been chosen, a young spiritful dwarf.  His young body was more able to perform the terrible tasks assigned to the Moreia, and was much better suited for the position.  Blahg had been growing weaker and weaker since the new leader had been chosen, and had summoned Greggle to help him through his last days.  As they sat in the library those days, Blahg told Greggle of his many adventures, of responsibilities that would need to be carried out.  After a few days of reminiscing, Greggle went out into the world to carry news and ask for help from those that Blahg had mentioned.<br>
<br>
Finally returning to the Library, he helped Blahg out and into the bar to enjoy one last tankard of dwarvish stout.  Sometime during that night, Blahg's spirit passed into another world.  Greggle gathered up his things, and an old friend helped open a portal to an old shrine in the Butcherblock Mountains.<br>
<br>
Now, standing and looking at his friend's final resting place, he could not allow his friend to be buried in such a dismal black box.  Summoning even more energy from the air, he commanded the dark ebony to change form into a beautiful hammered brass and silver casket.  Satisfied, he began lowering the casket into the hole he had created.  Once it was firmly settled into the earth, he began to summon his will to refill the hole.  Before he could, however, a great shadow engulfed the clearing, and a pair of bright eyes shone from the darkest corner of the glade.  In a voice he felt more in his mind than heard with his ears, the God of the Dwarves spoke to Greggle.  As the gnome fell to his knees with Brell's dark face mere feet away, the doubts that had always made him unable to believe washed away.<br>
<br>
With his newfound God watching from nearby, Greggle rose to his feet, summoned his will, and refilled the hole where his friend could finally rest.<br>
<br>
Later, he made his way towards the elven cities.  Bearing a small sack, he opened the door of his guildhall, the Hall of the Elven Elite.  During the time he spent in the Plane of Knowledge, Blahg had been very busy.  In the forge, he had created a small dagger for all of his female friends in the guild, which he had asked Greggle to deliver for him, reasoning that since their dwarven &quot;protector&quot; would no longer be able to watch over them, he would give them means to defend themselves.  After handing out the gifts, he approached Seyah, knelt before her, and told her that he would be leaving also.<br>
<br>
With a twist of the hand, and small puff of smoke, the gnome disappeared from the Elven Elite, and from Norrath.<br>

Misprints and Misquotes:<br>
<br>
In a story earlier this year, the Norrath Times, in a misprint (rivaled only by the famous &quot;Dewey Defeats Karana!&quot; and &quot;Tunare and Bertox...  Kelethin's newest couple?&quot; headlines...  Ed.), announced the death of one of Kaladim's most color coordinated warriors, Blahg Blenderblades.  <br>
<br>
When contacted for comments, the dwarf, which appeared to more than likely be alive, was said to mutter &quot;Wha!?  Dead?  I'm not dead, you blabbering idiots!  For Brell's sake, what would a corpse be doing sitting here with a mug of beer?!  Now get out of here before the Bloodforges find ya.  They're a bit miffed about that picture you ran of little Missy Bloodforge and her, ermm...  friends...  at spring break!&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, our most heartfelt apologies go out to the Blenderblades family. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=114.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=114.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=114.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=114.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=114.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=114.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Library<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Recruiting<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
