<br>
1. The plow to named (or exp-group)<br>
You never sit at FM, therefore any bit of +manaregen helps you do additional damage, manapool is somewhat irrelevant.<br>
<br>
2. The named fight<br>
Damage is often constricted by aggro, this along with the fight being somewhat short'ish in PoP at least makes regen (and manapool) less of an issue, because you can easily unload up to aggro-limit with a lower manaregen. Due to the short time of these encounters, manapool/focus effects/crits will be somewhat more useful than regen - this of course depending on fight etc. <p><big><center><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370955 target=blank>Sage Aauminki Iceblade</a><br><a href=http://www.vazaelle.dk target=blank>Caer Cadarn</a></big><br>Vazaelle Server</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sincrofashad>SincroFashad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/18/03 5:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The High End Wizard</span><hr size=1> Ok, yeah, that makes sense.  On the specific named fights, mana regen is largely irrelevent since the fight doesn't last long enough to unload a full bar without drawing aggro and getting the smack-down laid on you.  I assume we're not talking about the bosses of either Ssra or VT here, since those damn things have 800 zillion hit points.  Mana regen is an issue for those as well.<br>
<br>
On the plow to named, good way of putting it, btw, my point of mana-regen does make a difference.  I'll bet it makes even more of a difference when working for XP, be it quadding or in an XP group.<br>
<br>
In an XP situation, the key isn't total mana pool, its mana regen, correct?<br>
<br>
Qaman, I think you are the one missing the point.  I just demonstrated that 15 points of mana regen = 388 extra damage per minute, or 6.46 extra DPS.  You say its either largely or completely irrelevant.  I call bull.  Any damage dealing class would want the extra 6+ DPS.  So would you.<br>

<br>
And I call bull on your numbers. They don't reflect my experience except perhaps when soloing. Running out of mana while plowing to a named? Rare occurrence. Running out of mana while in a group? Rare occurrence. Running out of mana while fighting a named? Rare occurrence. In order for your numbers to have any relevance at all, they need to happen to happen more than rarely. It becomes less of a factor as you move up in my experiece. Is it nice to have? Sure. Would I like FT 30? You bet. But it wouldn't do anything for me while raiding for the most part, and that is where I spend a large part of my time. Does having FT 15 add 6 dps to my output? Not even close.<br>

<br>
If you do ask for it, why?  You just said it makes no difference to your ability to perform on the raid.<br>
<br>
For the XP situation, we aren't talking about the puller in any way, shape or form.  We are talking about the wizard, and their casting abilities.  Any XP group I have been in that didn't totally suck pulls fast enough that the wizard has to regulate their casting to avoid going oom.  Therefore, mana regen makes a difference in their damage contribution.<br>
<br>
Added cause I don't want to post to another thread, and this info rightfully belongs in this one: From reading the quadding thread, it most certainly sounds like additional mana regen increases the overall rate of kills when XPing that way.  Can you and I agree on that point?<br>

Does FT become worthless at a certain point of the game, or does it become worthless once you have reached a certain level of mana regen?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The value of FT doesn't follow a simple pattern.  There are a number of dynamics involved, and those dynamics are never identical from one day to the next.  <br>
<br>
There are a huge number of encounters in this game, even the same mob done twice won't be the exact same both times.<br>
<br>
If you are talking in terms of damage, it's &quot;roughly&quot; like this:<br>
<br>
The maximum dps for a nuker is limited ultimately by the cast times of his spells and his luck with crits.  This ceiling can be lowered by a mob that forces the wizard to waste time(for instance Wuoshi or a Quad-kite).<br>
<br>
In most situations, the chance of drawing aggro also reduces your rate of damage.<br>
<br>
Once he runs out of mana, his dps will slow down further.<br>
<br>
However, in order for dps to slow as a result of mana loss, conditions must be met:<br>
<br>
1.  Mana expenditure must be greater than mana income.<br>
2.  The &quot;critical time&quot; must be greater than manapool/defecit.<br>
<br>
Note that for many encounters, &quot;critical time&quot; depends not only on the mob but also on the capabilities of your group or raid.<br>
<br>
For a quick example, lets take a fight where a wizard can spend 150 mana per tick, and the fight lasts 4 minutes(40 ticks).  Lets say he has a 4800point mana pool.  You need 6000 mana total for the fight.  1200 has to come from somewhere other than your normal mana pool.  1200 over 4 minutes is a mere 30 mana per tick.  Any mana regen over 30 is pretty much wasted, you'll end the fight with mana you were unable to spend.  This is actually one of the remaining uses of manaburn-- to dump mana that would have otherwise been wasted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 3586<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 1:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The High End Wizard</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Even so, based on the other thread where I was smacked down pretty hard<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Where is this other thread?

I think I got to oom on 2 of the bosses on the first VT clearing we did, and at that time I had FT3 and mage summoned ring/bracer/earring.<br>
<br>
During that first clearing I grabbed a twilight shroud and a mask of secrets, and never got oom in VT since <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
(that dropped me to FT1 too since 2 of my FT was coming from the shroud of unhollyness)<br>
<br>
On clearings to bosses, I find myself having a very hard time to get under 50% mana, except for some gaters or heavy pulls (10+ mobs in VT for instance) but after those there is usually some recovery time, and with my wizard specific regen and no need for rebuffing others, I usually find myself back to FM rather faster than others.<br>
<br>
On xp groups, I'll agree that mana regen often makes a difference. If grouped with a high AA paladin or SK (which happens often to me), I'll be main damage supplier. Found myself many times in Tactics with a bard, KEI (no enchanter, so going for long duration), 9, FT11 and the wiz mana regen but still going oom. When there are enough caster mobs, I even sometimes ask for dex buff so the dagger of thoughts has a better chance to proc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Point is though, in xp groups where my mana goes very low, I am usually the main damage dealer of the group, even after I have expanded my mana pool. So in those cases, with my lame FT11 (not that many elemental flagged wizards have so low) I still think our class rules <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sincrofashad>SincroFashad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/19/03 10:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The High End Wizard</span><hr size=1> Goladus,<br>

The other thread was in the general EQ discussion section.  I made a comment at the end of a post about being frustrated with the disparity between availibility of Vengeance vice FT items.  It was asserted that the disparity exsists because Veng items contribute directly to DPS, while FT itmes do not.  The thread wound up semi-derailed.  My bad.  Even though I didn't totally buy the argument, I conceded the point.<br>
<br>
What got me into this thread was the comment that KEI helps a wizard maintain damage relative to melee.  I conveniently ignored that the poster was talking about a lower level wizard, and not the end-game.  I wasn't totally convinced mana-regen, or additional mana regen, didn't help a wizards DPS, so I applied that statement to the end-game.<br>
<br>
I'm almost ready to concede this point too, but something just nags at me when the statement that additional mana regen is essentially no use once you reach a certain level, and that level of mana regen appears to be quite low.  Is wizard damage/mana seriously that hyper-efficient that you can't run oom with gear available to Ssra/Tier 2-3 plane guilds?<br>
<br>
As a rogue, all I can look forward to in an XP group or on a raid is dealing damage.  I have a couple <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> minor tricks I can do, but damage is pretty much the reason to invite me.  Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I see wizards the same way.  I don't ask for a wizard in an XP group so I have an evac capability, I ask for em cause you nuke.  I've always looked at additional mana regen as a nice, easy way to up your DPS while maintaining a steady-state of mana.  I'm still not 100% sure I believe you, but I think I'll take this as my cue to shut up and color. <p>-<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79237" target="top">Sinc</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I use every bit of extra mana regen.(yes i do have 15FT on items) (still wondering if the effect of ahr quest necklace also would stack atop of those 15 or is only part of it)<br>
I have VOQ,POTN,SD on during every raid(too bad i can't get it in every xp group). Yes i do click away virtue and druids provide then potn.<br>
Aggro? limit? Not really, i still got ancient concussion and otherwise i just use my lvl 60 ice nukes or gss or dor or doe instead of AT(still got to wait for my 65 nukes)<br>
<br>
Yeah i still run oom! during raids.<br>
Why? Because Healing spells are way too efficient!! That's right. We can never compete with healing effectivity. Enough clerics/druids/pallies/shamans on a raid and a raid can &quot;pull&quot;/advance that fast, that wizards do run oom with lots of ft items even. <br>
Before pop, people always told me and i have to agree: Stop using stun spells on melee mobs, it's a waste of mana. It's easier to let the tank get some more hits, because it will be healed with a complete heal anyway. Go for pure damage! So yeah, i only used my stuns for caster mobs.(i personally still think something is wrong there, our stuns should be more important in this game. They should have been the alternative to slows!)<br>
<br>
Verant choised to give the majority of the people more action per hour. That was easily done, just make sure heals are improved. Now i do team with healers that also have 10 to 15ft, means the puller can pull more often too(number of mobs is not an issue in loads of pop zones, so a puller will keep on going as long as the clerics are not oom, which they hardly get with THEIR FT items)<br>
 <br>
Nah, i am sorry, but in MY situation every point of FT is being used and if i would remove them, i would notice it during raids and xp groups.(yes, guild is raiding VT and very close to planes in pop)<br>
<br>
Maybe you are in a guild with less healers or something and the raid needs med. breaks, yeah i guess u won't be oom that much then. Aggro problem? depends what spells you are using. I don't like my new pop nukes, except the draughts and telekin(for solo,casters) Most of them have way too much aggro/per damage point.<br>
<br>
BTW 15ft on items allows hoh quadding with 4300 mana.<br>

<br>
However that doesn't mean there should be more Vengeance items, or that we should even look for a &quot;disparity&quot; between the two in the first place.  Melee and spellcasting are totally different.  Now.. both types have to worry about aggro, but melees have nothing at all like mana.  Actually I think it would be better to approach the issue by sharing some facts and asking you a few questions..<br>
<br>
<br>
It is relatively easy to contrive situations where a caster will be able to realize his full potential, and the flowing thought would have had zero difference in the outcome of the fight.  After major fights, ask your casters how much mana they have left.  Personally I usually wind up anywhere between 10% and 60%, but then I am not a wizard.  I would say full mana regen has only mattered on maybe half of the fights I've ever encountered..  Now I ask you:<br>
<br>
How often do you look back on a fight and think &quot;Well I guess I didn't really need the Vengeance,&quot; not counting fights where you die?  My guess is only the fights where are unable to get in melee range.<br>

How often do you look ahead to a fight <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>knowing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that you won't use your Vengeance?  --That you might as well wear nothing at all for all the difference it will make.  My guess is even less.<br>
<br>
Now again, the point here is not to show that FT should be more common than Vengeance, to answer that question one really needs to look at each class's capabilities and loot selection as a whole, the point is that FT and Vengeance don't really give the type of benefits that are easily compareable.  In some situations, FT is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> useful than Vengeance, other situations Vengeance is clearly superior.  Casters don't need to prove that mana regen &quot;never&quot; or &quot;almost never&quot; affects dps in order to make the point that they aren't easily compareable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm almost ready to concede this point too, but something just nags at me when the statement that additional mana regen is essentially no use once you reach a certain level, and that level of mana regen appears to be quite low.

Casters also still don't have an &quot;equivalent&quot; to primal weapons.<br>
<br>
And again it is not so much the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>level</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>level</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of play, it is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nature</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the play.  It's the environment that leads to FT being severely marginalized.<br>
<br>
Also don't make the mistake of assuming that just because a caster isn't worried about mana that they are just nuking away non-stop.  There are other things that reduce nuker output..  Sometimes it's not that mana regen is so high or the mob dies fast, it's that for some reason the caster simply cannot spend his mana.  Again a clear example of this would be Wuoshi or Severilous.  If a wizard spends 75% of the time stunned he won't be spending much time nuking and his mana will go down very slowly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As a rogue, all I can look forward to in an XP group or on a raid is dealing damage. I have a couple very minor tricks I can do, but damage is pretty much the reason to invite me. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I see wizards the same way. I don't ask for a wizard in an XP group so I have an evac capability, I ask for em cause you nuke. I've always looked at additional mana regen as a nice, easy way to up your DPS while maintaining a steady-state of mana. I'm still not 100% sure I believe you, but I think I'll take this as my cue to shut up and color. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You don't really need to get pouty heh...<br>
<br>
Realize Qaman is speaking from his own experience, which is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a Ssra/Teir3 guild, he's Teir 4.  I do suspect that he takes some of his FT for granted, but probably not much.  I don't think either of us can really comment on his level of XPing.  I can tell you, though, that at my level FT can help my dps go up.  If you are talking relative to a melee, FT15 probably would account for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than 6dps, because melee damage suffers from downtime. <p><center><br>

I conveniently ignored that the poster was talking about a lower level wizard, and not the end-game. I wasn't totally convinced mana-regen, or additional mana regen, didn't help a wizards DPS, so I applied that statement to the end-game<br>
<br>
Yes, KEI and FT can help you maintain sustained damage relative to melee in some situations. The primary reason for this is that melee have no cap on how long they can sustain damage. If they aren't dead, they can do damage. This is not the case with casters. You are trying to compare apples and oranges, but somehow I feel you keep coming up with lemonade. But you can't just say FT raises DPS by X amount because a number of conditions have to be met before it is even effective, and if those conditions are not met, the effect is zero. At the high end, you just tend to have so much mana regen that FT kinda gets lost in the noise of the rest of the mana regen. I have roughly 6300 mana available, it takes a long time to empty that when mana is coming in at roughly 100/tick without FT which is about what I get when raiding. I will admit that in groups it can have a bit more impact though. <br>
<br>
Again though, you can't just say FT adds X DPS because it just doesn't work that way. If I fight once an hour and don't go OOM, FT has essentially no effect. Compare that to melee that picks up a better weapon or Vengeance items. Those do have an effect, even if you only fight once an hour. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Personally, I would first have to be convinced that such a disparity exists. But in any case:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My guild has multiple casters at or near the worn FT cap and at the same time possesses a single Vengeance item, which was acquired from Aerin`Dar.  We do have access to additional Veng items from the ornate armor drops in places like BoT, but we've been fairly unlucky, and haven't gotten a single one yet as a guild, and we've been in BoT since Early December at least.  The facts of the matter are, however: We could progress no further as a guild, and put virtually every caster at the worn FT cap, but no melee would come close to approaching the worn ATK cap.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions about when would I either look back and say Vengeance did nothing for me, or think going into the fight, my gear doesn't mean crap, there's only one fight my guild has currently handled where Vengeance would be wasted for me, and that's Cursed in Ssra.  Thus, you are correct, only fights where I am relegated to ranged combat only.  Not a big issue for me at this time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
FT being superior in any non-combat situation, Vengeance being superior in any combat situation where the melee (not rangers) are relegated to ranged combat.  That statement almost sounds like an absolute, though, and those tend to get proved wrong at some point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
Unfortunately, guilds at my level can and do have gobs of FT items.  There's more of it available then you think.  Aura of Battle stuff is available to us, but again, not in the amounts FT is.  Not meant to be a whine, just stating a fact.  For casters lacking a 'primal weapon' equivalent, you're right.  I can't think of any item that gives a worn or procced effect of: causes all spells cast to be resisted at -50.  Damn, that would be cool, though.<br>
<br>
I wasn't trying to be pouty.  Shut up and color is sorta a military phrase for: Nothing further to be gained by arguing a point into senselessness, lets move on.<br>

Just to answer Qaman.  My mistake was trying to apply a low end case to a high end situation.  I can easily see how some of the mana regen you have gets lost in the noise. <p>-<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79237" target="top">Sinc</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I usually can oom in ele boss mobs and in poearths. Because the duration of those battles allows me. But that's not a lot of time out of for example one week's raiding. Most of times I'm hard pressed to go under 70m, the pulls, clerics, tanks, etc. dictate that rate too much.<br>
