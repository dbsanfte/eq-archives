The AE Rain spells below level 51 are awful on the whole.  The level 4 one is very close to post-50 levels of power and is very useful at the level.  But the ones between there are from 1.1-1.2 times the power of the most potent DD that level.  That means all three waves have to hit, for full, before you see a slight amount of damage more than your blast that level - and it costs more mana.  That's pathetic.<br>
<br>
If they raised the damage on these to the 1.4-1.6 level the post 50 and level 4 ones are, we'd have some real tools, it would make Wizards more potent in groups, do nothing for soloing.  To be sure, they could make them all single target only.  Mages would like this too (their AE rains are fewer but more powerful than ours, but they fill gaps in their DD line). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2507<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/2/02 10:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~~</span><hr size=1> You guys just don't get it.

How many times have you seen mobs or zones nerfed due to AoE spells? I can count 5, and I'm sure there are more instances I'm forgetting. Hell, all of our AoE spells were nerfed in Beta because they were too powerful. You guys think they're going to look at them now you're delusional.<br>

<br>
However, just a few random ideas:<br>
<br>
Make Wizards the Masters of Space, Time, and Damage.<br>
<br>
New spell lines: <br>
<br>
Timestop - Mob is mezzed and immune to all damage and spells other than Cancel Magic (which stops the Timestop).  Single target only, high recast (15 seconds) but guaranteed duration (15 seconds).  In situations where adds are common an enchanter is still better, and the wizard would be better off nuking. Overwritten by Enchanter and Bard mez<br>
<br>
Timeheal - Increases the amount of mana and hipoints given per tick in increments of 1/6th (depending on level and type of spell).  Does not apply to 'CC' spells or Lich Form.<br>
<br>
Time Dilation - Increases the cast time of all spells on the target.  Does not effect proc spells.  <br>
<br>
Time Haste - Group Spell Buff - Decreases the cast time of all spells except % heals.  Relatively short duration.  Does not effect Detrimental AE spells<br>
<br>
Paradox - Instant Intra-Zone Evac, removes all effects and leaves all characters OOM.  In the Lore the cast time should be longer, but you're just moving that damn fast.<br>
<br>
Of course, they should have more interesting names than that, such as <br>
G'ravv's Lesser/Minor/normal/Major Time Heal <br>
Lorend's Lesser/Minor/normal/Major Time Dilation <br>
Ainstyne's Paradox <br>
Starfyre's Lesser/Minor/normal/Major Time Cessation <br>
Ognit's Lesser/Minor/normal/Major Casting Expediation  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarnin>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Likes to wear<BR>Yoda Under-Roos</span><br>  Posts: 2514<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/4/02 2:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~~</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Timestop - Mob is mezzed and immune to all damage and spells<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hrm, I seriously doubt chanters would like this idea. I mean, a mezz that makes the target immune to damage and spells? That's a safe mez! They'd scream and yell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Timeheal - Increases the amount of mana and hipoints given per tick in increments of 1/6th<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Chanters and bards wouldn't like this. We'd be taking away something that their classes currently cover, and cover well.<br>
<br>

This, I actually like. I like it alot. Except it doesn't belong to the wizard class. More like chanter or shaman or bard. I mean, you're basically describing a &quot;casting slow spell&quot; debuff. They would love it, wizards, from everything I've seen, wouldn't.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Time Haste - Group Spell Buff<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
BZZZZ! You broke rule number 1! Wizards don't want buffs. Not to mention that Enchanters, Bards and Shaman would complain about it.<br>

Besides the &quot;removing all buffs&quot; and the &quot;leaving all characters OOM&quot; how is this any different than the intra-zone evacs we have now?<br>

Like I said, we need something that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>isn't in the game already</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>something that no other class can do</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.

<br>
An attempt to make AE nukes an alternative to mez, or a suppliment.  You could use it during enchanter lockdown to do some bonus DPS. . .  And if you had no enchanter, on a pull of 3, you'll do alot more damage.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>    Quote:Near melee-range nukes.<br>

We have these limits now on many mobs. Not because our spells aren't long range, but because the mobs are coded this way. Interesting idea though.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
*nod*, the melee-range restriction was pre-summoning, IIRC -- an attempt to keep you from safe-spot killing a mob with nukes.  Melee-range on spells would make the spells unusable without someone &quot;tanking&quot; (Via stuns or aggro) the mob. . .<br>

<br>
Click it off if it gets in the way, silly.  =)<br>
<br>
The hour is &quot;forever&quot; -- if you turn it on and off constantly, you pay a large price for it.  If you rarely need to move, it is much cheaper. . .<br>
<br>
Once again, has the problem that it helps you on raids as much as in groups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The point of Evac was originally designed to take you to a save spot in the zone, and also to make it so you can't just run back in on a failed fight. This would basically do the same thing except it would drop you in the same spot you were in. Now, just imagine if you're fighting in the room where your group failed. You'd pop back in the same spot, not be able to move or cast, and you'd be indifferent. As soon as the effects wore off, you'd get slaughtered.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You might get slaughtered.<br>
<br>
Or, it might give you a 2nd chance at the mobs.  The train may be gone, the adds may have wandered off, and the cleric may be no longer oom.<br>
<br>
3 minutes of mana regen is, for many people, half their manapool.<br>
<br>
And yes, in some situations, evac would be better.  In others, Inplace evac is better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, watch them use them to solo and to raid better. This wouldn't help much in grouping situations, because as I said, groups don't notice our damage outdput all that often.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Which is exactly my point.  You double the efficiency of DD, and DDs become a prefered spell to quads for soloing.<br>
<br>
Groups don't notice wizards damage output because, quite often, it isn't as good as other classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Obviously not, because a solo cleric can't do constant pulls, where a good group can.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Correct conclusion, wrong logic.  Lack of constant pulls does not imply worse xp.  AoE groups often have downtime, yet can generate more XP than a group that is constantly pulling mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They solo about the same as warriors, not better. Remember that most clerics can't tank all that well. Sure they wear plate armor, but it helps them about as much as it helps bards in tanking.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Warriors that can heal themselves quickly and efficiently (by regen/clicky items) and Clerics who can tank are about equally rare.  CHeal makes up for alot of &quot;bad tanking ability&quot;, especially on non-summoning mobs (root, back up, cheal, reengage).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How is wizard damage in a group crippled?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You do twice the damage outside a tank group as within.<br>
<br>
The group has crippled your ability to do damage, because all mobs they engage must be tanked, and tanking 4 mobs is very difficult.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I've never had a problem doing damage in any situation. I've had problems getting into groups becuase damage was all that I offered them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Rogues, however, offer more damage.  No, really.  It takes a damn well geared L 60 wizard, with lots of AA, to match the damage of a random L 60 rogue with dragon haste + ragebringer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What do you mean our most efficient nukes don't work in groups?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Do you regularly cast column nukes in a group?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They require heals to fight.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No.  A rogue can fight and not lose hps with a regen buff on.  Adding a rogue does not significantly increase the groups healing load.<br>
<br>
They require someone to be healed, but they do not actually add healing load.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Since there isn't a class in the game that can &quot;heal mana&quot; eventually wizards can't keep up in groups like they can, that's why we're not the first pick for damage dealers in groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You aren't first pick because once you have a tank, and a healer, adding j random wizard doesn't add as much damage per hour as adding j random rogue.<br>

A good wizard beats out a poor rogue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you had a group of 2 wizards, a tank, a healer and a CC class, the wizards could quad while the melee does their thing, and you'd see exp soar.

<br>
Sure, under certain circumstances, you're absolutely right. But those are very specific circumstances, and don't relate to our inability to be welcome in most group configurations.<br>
<br>
Sure, sometimes we rock in groups. But most the time we aren't up to par, not because we don't deal good damage, but because it's not noticed by our peers. Other classes know what we offer them, and they really don't care.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to have you guys come up with a solution, and giving us more damage and better mana efficiency isn't it. SOE will never go for it. They also won't go for improving our AoE spells because like I said, they're scared shitless that we'll actually use them.<br>
<br>
For the last 3 years I've been reading about wizards concerns, and it's never been &quot;I want to solo better&quot; or &quot;I want to raid better&quot;. It's always been &quot;How come I can't get into groups?&quot;. If you haven't been seeing this, then you're blind.<br>
So instead of picking peoples words apart, how about you do some thinking and actually come up with some suggestions that SOE might actually use? I mean, so far you've basically contributed things that they've rejected at least a hundred times.<br>

We've been waiting 3 years, we can wait a little longer for a really good idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enoah35>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/4/02 6:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My view</span><hr size=1> Well not sure this will solve anything. But giving wizard capable to do this... migh thelp a bit in DPS.<br>
<br>
1) Give wizard to have a chance of dual casting the same spell. Like for example 2 ~ 5% chance of casting 2 nukes in 1 cast and using 1 cast mana.<br>
<br>
2 ) Similar to above but give ability to dual cast 2 different spells at once with reasonable mana of same spell line like 2 droughts or 2 lure... this is more likely to be a skill... usable every 5min 10min how ever it suits in balance issue.<br>
<br>
These are skills from Final Fantasy I know from the red mage skill who can dual cast spells. If we are the master of Direct damage, short fight High DPS factor then this could not imbalance much. This might solve the mage 61 DD issue since we are dealing 2 spells in 1 go, and with crit we can have no prob in being overnuked. <br>

The way the magic system work, it's currently impossible to do this. Sure, they could code this in with some effort, but they won't do it. We've been balanced with the thought that we cast big damage nukes or small fast nukes. <br>
Allowing us to possibly &quot;duel cast&quot; would not only improve our solo abilities, but also our raiding abilities, which is just not going to happen.<br>

Adjust with aggro on the wizard.  Also please note that you can only mez 1 mob, and have a cast time duration between reuse.  And frankly, I don't give a fuck if other classes whine because we get spells similar to their own.  They give up all DD spells and I will allow them to bitch.<br>

Hence why it's a group buff--it's essentially a <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, Jarnin, rethink your rules.  No damage increases, No efficiency increases, no buffs, no crowd control,   There are only 3 things that matter in Groups:<br>
1) 1 mob at a time translates into crowd control, soemthing wizards are already somewhat good at if they know what they are doing, but nowhere near as good as a Monk, ShadowKnight, Bard, or Enchanter.<br>
2) Mana Regen:  Mana Pool is irrelevent, if you expend more mana per mob than you can regen in that time, it is useless.<br>
3) DPS: Mob HP - Your DPS + any regen and heals &gt; Your HP - Mobs DPS +Your Regen.  Want to discuss range?  Kiting essentially negates the Mob's DPS, thats why we can do it.  Slows are the best DPS buff you can have.<br>
<br>
Now, who are the masters of thes?<br>
CC: Monks, Enchanters, Bards, ShadowKnights<br>
Mana Regen: Clerics &amp; Druids (effiecient Heals), Enchanters, Bards<br>
DPS: Clerics(heals), Warriors(HP), Rogues(constant damage), Enchanters(Haste &amp; Slows), Shaman(Slows &amp; Haste)<br>
<br>
There is nothing else.  If you look at it, you can actually work out a larger grand unified formula. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=infotainmentx>Infotainmentx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 304<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/4/02 11:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~~</span><hr size=1> I've always wondered why Mages, who have so much utility, got the DS line over Wizards who have very little.<br>

<br>
Somethign I suggested a long time ago was the idea of an offensive damage shield. Rather than casting a DS on the MA so that every time they get hit, damage is caused, but one that every time they hit they do more damage. This would be separate from weapon damage calculation. Just flat replace Okiels with these. Use the same times, etc.l. as the okiels line and make them stack with all DSs. 2 points a hit is actually pretty damn good -- and 6 is even better. at higher levels make group versions, and maybe a level 64ish AE version. This is definately a buff, but it's the kind that is right along the lines we intend -- damage output.<br>
<br>
Second change I would like to see is a set of spells where they do damage like a damage over time, but are a &quot;holding damage&quot; type spell. Here is what I mean. I cast a draught on a mob, and it lands. Initially it does some damage, but so long as I take no other action (move, cast, etc...) the damage keeps going. Imagine casting an electrical stream on a mob, and it keeps hitting it. As we hold it, mana keeps getting eaten, the longer it's held, the less mana over time it uses and the more agro it generates. The initial damage would be on the order of a drought, maybe 2.8-3.2 to 1, and then 4 to 1 after that.<br>
<br>
Last change would be for more powerful push spells. Thunderstrike like spells, but with bigger pushes and more damage. I mean sutff that knocks a mob hundreds of feet across a zone. Stick a 1 second stun on it, or better a root component when it's cast. Mana heavy, but fast casting. <br>
<br>
Here are my arguements overall: They add to groupability, and add some pretty nify raid abilities in certain situations. The offensive damage shield is really the ringer I think. There are a lot of ways to keep power in check with these. Useing elemental saves, and making some higher level version Lure-like, for example. <br>
<br>
Ohh, one more major change is to stop the insanity about spell rarety for wizards.  <p><image src=http://www.webhazard.net/images/Vote-Sig/ennya_kiel.jpg><BR>

AoE spells were supposed to be the wizard's contribution to groups, but because of aggro and crowd control issues are not used as much as they could be.<br>

<br>
My feeling right now is that the Plane of Knowledge has almost totally killed the usefulness of wizard teleports.  I find that I rarely need the normal ports anymore.  When I was making my original character, the ability to teleport myself weighed very heavily in my choice of class.  While I ended up choosing Magician, anyway, the point is that ports were a major consideration for me.  Now?  They wouldn't be a consideration at all.   <br>
<br>
On the other hand, it seems like I've evacced a lot more since PoP.  Often, returning to camps from the zone-in is trivial, and it's better to evac and run right back to your camp at full power than deal with downtime from rez effects.  How evacs will work out in higher level zones I don't know.<br>
<br>
Personally, I love the access I have to the portals as a high level raider.  The ability to get myself around basically just takes some of the burden off the Wizards and Druids in the guild.  I really think the lower level game has lost something though, because of this.  What is the point of running across Antonica ever again?  Now it's Freeport or Qeynos, with a few possible XP zones in between.<br>
<br>
If it were me, I'd have limited the travel from Plane of Knowledge by level and by flags.  You would only be able to travel to cities if you'd already been there and were of suffecient level to use the port. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enoah35>Enoah35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/7/02 2:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> Ennya (sorry if I spelled wrong) the magic duration over time could be a perfect replacement of Manaburn IMHO.

Guess my Idea of dbl casting was very hard to acomplish because of more coding and etc. Altho I felt it was the best thing to improve our dps. Can't think of any now... really we only do 1 and only thing and the only improvement for us could be adding a completly new thing (which I cannot think of any) or simply improve the tool we got now.<br>
<br>
The problem that we face is what people has been saying all the time. We provide nothing but damage in exchange for our mana. Nothing more. And there are many who does the same role. (rogues comes into mind with no mana needed) I still think the group bonus is the best solution of wizard being usefull in groups. <br>

<br>
The rules:<br>
1. No Buffs (I am assuming targetted Buffs and not self Buffs)<br>
2. No Pets<br>
3. No changes to our nuking ability<br>
4. No changes to our current AoE spells<br>
5. Our new ability can't allow us to raid better<br>
6. Our new ability can't allow us to solo better<br>
<br>
A self-only buff. Duration, maybe 30 seconds to one minute.  Effect would be: 1) a % aggro reduction on subsequent spell casts for duration.  2) An AE 'pulsed' effect (like how bard songs break .. err.. work) that imparts a 'small but useful' melee effect for the duration (a DS, Haste component, improved chance to critical, magic damage bonus of a point or two,  etc.).<br>
<br>
Sort of breaks Rule 1, but its a self buff and we have those already.  I am sort of partial to self-only buffs as they allow me to keep my desired target yet apply a spell to myself.  Rule 2 is not broken.  It bends Rule 3 a bit, as an aggro redution does alter our 'ability to nuke' but does not alter any nukes.  Rule 4 may be at issue as a % aggro reduction may allow rains to be cast sooner, however, would likely void effect 2 as you wouldn't be close enough to the melee peeps to get the effect.  Rule 5 would is also at issue for similar reasons as Rule 4, but add to that the numerous Boss AE spells and short duration may counter that.  Rule 6 is a non-issue as reduce aggro while soloing is pointless and most things that are solo'd post level 10 (guessing. Its been a while) will kill you very quickly if your trying to swing a stick at it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I posted in another thread much to the degree that Jarnin has stated here, that other classes can't 'see' what we bring to a group.  With the exception of crits, our damage is hidden behind a descriptive sentence and a 'poof' of sparkels which many people probably have turned off, moved to window so they don't have to see it, or goes unnoticed.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Also posted in another thread is the idea of group bonuses based on class composition of the group.  While general to all classes, is still a good idea to bring up.<br>

<br>
If you're in a /raid group, you are &quot;normal.&quot;<br>
If you're solo, you are &quot;normal.&quot;<br>
If you're in a standard 6-person group, you get<br>
a bonus. <br>
<br>
Possible Bonuses: <br>
<br>
* &quot;x&quot;% damage bump on ALL damage spells.  Maybe it scales to +5% / group member so a 6 person group nets you +30% damage.  Maybe base it off of the number of wizards in the group.<br>
<br>
* &quot;x&quot;% mana reduction.  All of YOUR spells cost less to cast.  Increases our DPS in groups by giving us more nuking power ONLY in a group.<br>
<br>
* As the masters of damage, we know how to mitigate it.  As a proc'd effect, all people in a radius that would take melee damage are simply missed.  This is borderline a group buff, but there's no buff icon so I threw it in. =P<br>
Maybe may 1 in 10 attacks miss or something.  Maybe 1 in 20.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
*  Another borderline group buff, but we act as a focus for the rest of the groups spells, increasing all spells by 5% per wizard in the group.  Cleric + 5 wizards = +25% healing.  Wizards get +25% nuking power/mana reduction.<br>
<br>
Groups are already chainpulling with zero downtime so our nuking would simply replace the damage of , say, a thief/monk and could be balanced against that.<br>
<br>
This gives us better rains, better DD, better spells  as long as we're grouped and not any other time.<br>

<br>
One thing I don't think I've seen anyone mention is that not ALL wizards play EQ to merely solo, or for that matter enjoy soloing.  I for one don't really enjoy it.  Maybe it's just personality differences, or maybe I'm just not that good at it, whatever.  <br>
<br>
So to fix the class by making us better soloers does not meet the issues that many of us have.  Making us more desireable in groups is the issue (in my opinion).  They have continued to whittle things away from us.  I get groups now because I have a lot of friends on the server, in spite of my class, not because of my class (except for when they specifically need an evac'er and a druid is not available).<br>
<br>
That's sad.<br>

Yes I'm sure there are soloing issues too, but I for one, don't play EQ to solo.<br>

This is a good idea, yet we have a spell (albeit not a spell that is available to all) that does the same thing, sort of, which is Concussion.<br>
Chanters have a buff that does exactly what you describe, which is called <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1598">Beguiling Visage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. It costs alot of mana, and only lasts for 15 minutes. It doesn't get much use from my experience because of those limits. Not to mention it's yet another buff we have to ask for from enchanters, and ask quite frequently.<br>
<br>
By the way Fredre, you didn't break any rules with that one. Self buffs don't count unless it relates to overall improvements to our class, IE. Soloing, Grouping and Raiding. Your idea wouldn't help us solo better, so that's a big plus. It would probably help us group, which is another plus. It would allow us to raid slightly better however, so that's a negative.<br>

<br>
<br>
why is it that enchanters are the only class that get a viable means of crowd control in most any situation, bards etc. dont cut it most of the time. Yes, clerics are the most viable healers, but in many many grouping situations, a shammy, or even a druid is just as viable. But almost nowhere is a non enchanter crowd controler reliable enought or efficient enought to hack it. Why can't they step up and give another class, a less effective, but still reliable form of crowd control. And possibly could that class be the wizard class, and if so, what type of crowd control line would suit our style?:P Anybody have thoughts on this? I know im out on a limb, but its an interesting train of thought.<br>
<br>
I also liked the idea that was posted about giving people a DS that hurts the mob ever time they hit the mob, that is a good idea, maybe make a fire line, and ice line, and a magic line, perhaps magic based one that has a chance to stun ( only and interrupt 0 second stun of course) and some group and AE ones at the high end, i think by increasing the dps of the melee in the group we would be very VERY desirrable, AND the BEST part is it does NOT effect our soloing in ANY way. i like this idea immensly))<br>
<br>
oh and also, make the DS( or DE; Damage Enhancer, as i have decided to coigne it:P) cost us mana out our arse so it is not viable to buff a whole raid or even a whole group, perhaps put a long recast on it so we have to use it like chanters use boon, only on MA, and MAYBE one other.<br>
