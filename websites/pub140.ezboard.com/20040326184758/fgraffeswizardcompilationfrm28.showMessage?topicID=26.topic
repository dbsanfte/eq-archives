<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 0 Introduction</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Why write this FAQ?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Having haunted the 'Graffe's Wizard Compilation' board since sometime near its inception, I've begun to spot a pattern in questions being asked. I thought I'd take some time to distill some of the information I've gathered both in game and here so that other might benefit and put something back into the community.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Who has contributed to the knowledge in this FAQ?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Special mention goes to everyone who posts an answer to a question however inane, on the 'Graffe's Wizard Compilation' forums ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation">pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffe...ompilation</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ). Be sure to check out the main page too ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com">www.graffe.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ).<br>
<br>
I'd also like to make special mention to Graffe M'yrddin, Armok Komra &amp; Twiddle O'Toole.<br>
<br>
Everything I know about raid tactics I owe to my guild, 'Avatar's of Discord' on Rodcet Nife. Sadly I can't reveal specific details of many tactics here (hey this game is a competition!), but with the knowledge here imparted, you can infer a lot for yourself, and hey thats life! (Please forward any complaints to Abashi@Verant.com)<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Who the hell are you?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Just another level 60 wizard in a decent guild on Rodcet Nife. I make no grand claims about my abilities although I certainly feel I am competent and have a reasonably broad grasp of game mechanics. I started playing Everquest a couple of months after it came out, and I've got a decently horrific /played time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1 Mana &amp; Mana Regen</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: At what level can I stop looking at this damned spell book?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: At level 35, sitting is equivalent to explicitly meditating.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Explain mana regeneration.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: The everquest servers 'tick' every 6 seconds. On this tick, the server will check if you are sitting or standing. If sitting you will regain an amount of mana corresponding to your meditate skill (or 2 per tick if lower than level 35), whilst if standing you will regain one mana a tick. It is irrelevant whether or not you are sitting or standing in between the ticks, it only looks at the exact instance in time when the tick goes off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What spells help my mana regen, and by how much?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: The following list illustrate the benefit of each spell. Spells that are in seperate groups stack, although bard stacking is more complex (if someone provides an explanation I'll add it in). Note that these spells add the same mana regen irrespective of whether you are standing, sitting or meditating.<br>
<br>
Group 1<br>
-------<br>
Breeze ........................... +2 per tick (ENC L16)<br>
Clarity .......................... +4..7 per tick (ENC L29..40)<br>
Spiritual Purity ................. +7 per tick (BSTL L59)<br>
&lt;^^ uncertain of stacking, this is a guess, I just hope its incorrect!&gt;<br>
Boon of the Clear Mind (grp) ..... +7..8 per tick (ENC L52..60)<br>
Clarity II ....................... +11 per tick (ENC L54)<br>
Gift of Pure Thought (grp) ....... +11 per tick (ENC L59)<br>
Kodiac's Endless Intellect (grp).. +14 per tick (ENC L60) *Does not stack with Group 2*<br>
<br>
Group 2<br>
-------<br>
Gift of Insight .................. +1 per tick (ENC L55)<br>

Barrier of Force ................. +3 per tick (WIZ epic right-click effect)<br>
<br>
Group 5<br>
-------<br>
Lesser Familiar .................. +1 per tick (WIZ L49)<br>

Greater Familiar ................. +4 per tick (WIZ L60)<br>
<br>
<br>
Bardsong Injectors (Stack with everything, including themselves)<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Cassindra's Chant of Clarity ..... +2 per tick (L20)<br>
Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity .... +5..7 per tick (L32..4 <br>
<br>
* The level 30 bard song 'amplify' can increase the mana regen on injectors, as does wielding<br>
their epic *<br>
<br>
Bardsong Standard Mana Regen (Do not stack)<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
Cantata of Soothing .............. +5 per tick (L34)<br>
Cantata of Replenishment ......... +12..13 per tick (L55..60)<br>

Sedulous Subversion .............. +150 (NEC L56, costs 400)<br>
<br>
Item Procs<br>
----------<br>
Modulation (Modulating Rod) ...... +150 for 225 hp (MAG L44 summon, costs 200)<br>
Mystical Transvergence (Modrod 2). +220 for 300 hp (MAG L56 summon, costs 400, 3 charges)<br>
Mana Conversion (Mana Robe) ...... +20 for 60 hp<br>
ManaConvert (Manastone) .......... +20 for 60 hp<br>
<br>
&lt;Need info on the stacking of the beast lord mana regen spell please!&gt;<br>
<br>
(Thanks to Twiddle O'Toole for these numbers)<br>
(Thanks to Celebairn for digging up bard info)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is the formula to calculate my mana regen from meditation?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: At level 60 it has been calculated to add 18mana tick (skill 252). When medding this would give a total of 20 as standing mana regen is 1 per tick, sitting mana regen is 2 per tick.<br>
&lt;Need a formula!&gt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Does 'Flowing Thought' (FT) Stack?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yes. If you have an FT1 item and an FT2 item, you get FT3 total. Furthermore, if you have several FT items of the same level, they too will stack. So FT1+FT1+FT1 will give you a total of 3 extra regen per tick.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Is 'Flowing Thought' capped?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yes. You can have a maximum of 15 points of FT in total.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I calculate the size of my mana pool at level x?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: &lt;Need forumala pleases&gt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2 Spells</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I find 'Elnerick's Electrical Rendering'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Elnerick's is known to still drop from the 'Thought Horror Overfiend' (THO) in 'The Deep.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I find 'Garrison's Superios Sundering'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: When Luclin was released, there were rumours of it dropping from the THO. Whether or not these are true I cannot confirm, however I can confirm that it no longer drops from him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I get Levitation from?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: From the 'Deranged Underbulk' in 'The Deep'. From the zone in, head down the tunnel, take the first right, then take the first left into a dead end. The 'Enraged Underbulk' is a fairly common spawn in this dead end. The camp requires a competent group of mid to high 50s as mobs hit hard in 'The Deep.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I get 'Porlov's Fury' (Dragon's Bane)?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Quest walkthrough - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests/wrath_spells/porlos_fury/index.htm">www.graffe.com/quests/wra.../index.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I get 'Hsagra's Wrath' (Giant's Bane)?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Quest walkthrough - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests/wrath_spells/hsagras_wrath/index.htm">www.graffe.com/quests/wra.../index.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What Dragons can I hit with Dragon's Bane?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Warders in Sleepers Tomb, Yelinak, Tov dragons with Lord or Lady in their name. No Kunark Dragons.<br>
(Minka Zaubermaus)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What Giants can I hit with Giant's Bane?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: King Tormax, Vindicator, Velketor, Narandi.<br>
(Minka Zaubermaus)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Do I need be in melee-range for banes?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: No. Line of Sight is all you need.<br>
(Minka Zaubermaus)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Is the aggro generated by banes the same as for other direct damage spells?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: No, it is lower than expected considering the damage. *NB* Giant's have very strange aggro so be careful baning them - they don't like it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I get 'Concussion' (Brainbite)?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Quest walkthrough - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com/quests/brain_bite_kunark/index.htm">www.graffe.com/quests/bra.../index.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What does 'Concussion' do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: It removes 400 points of 'aggro' towards you from the monster's hate list.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do spell resists work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Depending on a monsters resistance to a given 'element', it will have an ability to resist either partially or fully your spells based on their element. The resist levels appear to be quantised such that partial resists always fall as a percentage of maximum damage in the following range {1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%}. {1%, 5%, 10%} are much more rare, although the distribution has not been formally analysed.<br>
(Thanks to Armok Komra for analysis)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats the deal with rain spells?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: When used judiciously, rain spells can improve ones damage to mana expended efficiency. The downside is that the rains have a higher chance to be resisted than normal direct damage spell, and since they are area of effect (AoE (*)) you may hit monsters that have been mesmerised and wake them up. The further downside is that a wave of rain cannot kill a monster due to a coding issue so if you cast near the end of a mobs life, it is guaranteed to resist any wave that would kill it. On the plus side, you can cast these and then cast other spells whilst the rains are still descending.<br>
<br>
Discussing whether rains are any good, is generally as productive as arguing religions. For what its worth, when I parsed my usage of them, I found that the added resists and extra time I had to spend moving around to ensure that I wasn't going to hit mesmermised monsters (which could have been spend medding) negated any benefit from these spells. They can help you kill steal more effectively however!<br>
<br>
Addendum: Whizbang Dustyboots, a great advocate of rains claims that he has killed mobs with them. Whilst I've never experienced this, and it directly contradicts a statement by Verant (who claim rains were set to not kill mobs due to an xp allocation issue) I mention this in order to present both sides.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (*) Which is a misgnomer (**), they should be Area of Affect. The 'effect' is the dmg done, the 'affect' is the act of inflicting that damage<br>
<br>
(**) 'Misgnomer' - noun, derived from research showing that everything ill in the world, can be directly traced to the intervention of gnomes.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are 'Lures'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Spells with attrocious ratios, that whilst less likely to be resisted are seldom used these days as Verant wisely lowered magical resistances across the board. Mages seem to really want them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are 'Ancient' spells?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: These are very high level and rare spells that one should never expect to scribe. They are intended to be the ultimate spells in a wizards repetior and to seperate a Sorceror who lives in 'Velketor's Labyrinth' from one who live in the 'Arx Seru.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Thats a kick in the teeth!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Nothing in life worth having is free of cost.<br>
(P.S. 'kick in the teeth' is a banned phrase, I only used it for the amusement of regulars.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Some 'uber mobs' seem to resist all my spells although they shouldn't according to my friend, what gives?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: You may well need to be standing in melee range. Verant added this to stop casters exploiting pathing to nuke monsters from outside of their melee range whilst the monster was unable to retaliate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Any other nasty tricks they put in to stop monsters being cast at without being able to damage the player?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yeah, monsters can summon you too! Level 51 and above monsters pre-Luclin can summon you if you are at the top of the hate list and outside melee range, although only if the monster has had several hundered hp of damage inflicted on it. With the addition of Luclin, lower level monsters get this trick too!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Could they have been smarter about the above two hacks?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: What like make the monster realise it can't hurt you and run away, or perhaps nuke you back or even pull out a bow? Nah never!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is 'Specialisation' ('Specialization')</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: This is an interesting one. Its an example of Verant's description having little resemblance to reality. They claim that you have a percantage chance when you cast for this skill to kick in and save you some of the mana cost. The chance is meant to be governed by you skill in specialisation for that given discipline of specialisation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are the 'Specialisation' skill caps?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: One discipline may be up to skill level 200 dependant on your level, whilst the rest are capped at 50.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So what really happens with 'Specialisation'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: You save a percantage of the spell cost on every cast, the amount contingent upon your specialisation skill in that discipline.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do you know? Thats not what I heard!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Because someone used a packet sniffer to check it out (See ShowEQ).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much do I save per cast with a 'Specialistation' at 200?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: 10%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: And at 50?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: 2.5%. (Can you see a pattern? &lt;grin&gt;)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What should a wizard choose as his primary specialisation?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Evocation of course!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I set my primary specialisation?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: You must have at least a point in every specialisation discipline. Then once one goes over 50, it becomes your primary, so be careful that you don't accidently train the wrong one as your primary.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I trained the wrong one as my primary - help!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: There is a quest in the 'Temple of Solusek Ro' to reset all specialisations to zero. Talk to Ostorm and he will offer to change your specialization if you give him a ruby and 50 gp. (I am told you can do this without the 50 gp). This resets all of your specializations back to 49. Make sure the one that hits 50 next is the one you really want. <br>
(Milaru, stolen from somewhere else!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Should I use the upgrades to 'Root'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: A hot topic! Generally no, unless you need the longer potential hold time. However when you finally get 'Fetter' you may as well use it since it has a slightly faster cast and longer hold time. Some people with 'Fetter' still swear by 'Root' as they think they are more likely to channel with the lower level spell. Whilst I don't know if that a certainty, I would add that 'Fetter' still takes less time to cast...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What's the deal with 'Bind Sight' spells?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: They let you look through another entities eyes. Originally, you could use this to travel remotely through a dungeon by traveling from monster to monster. Unfortunately, in what was otherwise a positive change for caster spells, this got nerfed so that in the majority of zones you can't cast it on entities you don't have a line of sight too. No longer can you explore North Temple of Veeshan through the eyes of the dragons. Tis a shame.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are familiar's?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Buffs which have an attached graphic that makes annoying flapping noises and gets in the way of targeting. Its also suspectible to AoEs and direct attack by players. It is non-aggro to npcs but again, AoE's will kill it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are the benefits of having a familiar up?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: As follows :<br>
Minor Familiar (L29) :<br>
<br>
Lesser Familiar (L49) :<br>
- +1 mana a tick.<br>
<br>
Familiar (L54) :<br>
- +2 mana a tick.<br>
<br>
Greater Familiar (L60) :<br>
- +25 all resists.<br>
- Decrease fizzle level by 8.<br>
- +4 mana a tick.<br>
- See invis.<br>
- +150 mana.<br>
<br>
Alternate Xp Familiar (L59):<br>
- currently broken.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are the negative aspects of having a familiar up?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: As follows:<br>
- If he dies to an enemy, you lose mana scaled to the familiars level. If you don't have enough mana to cover this debt, he takes hp instead although never enough to kill you (but hey being at 1hp is as good as dead mostly).<br>
- He can get in the way of targetting mobs.<br>
- He makes an annoying noise.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I'm sick of having my familiar flap around in my face. How can I make it go away?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4 Lies, Damned Lies &amp; Statistics</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What does each statistic do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Straight from Verant, many moons ago : <br>
<br>
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows (per Abashi, dex also increases the chance of critical hits).<br>
<br>
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills.<br>
<br>
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath.<br>
<br>
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights.<br>
<br>
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers/paladins; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <br>
<br>
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular).<br>
<br>
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4 Monster Hate and You!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How does aggro (aggresion) work?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: All monsters have a hate list, where they record any action you perform on them that they dislike, such as harming them, healing someone they already hate &amp; etc. The person with the most aggro will be at the 'top of the hatelist' and will be attacked by the monster.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Are there any exceptions to this?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yes. There is something known as 'undead' or 'proximity' aggro. This is where a monster will go after the nearest person to them who is on the hate list irrespective of specific aggro. Most undead have this type of aggro. NOTE: When you (or Verant) root a monster, irrespective of its hate type, it will switch to this form of aggro. You can use this to your advantage by keeping sufficiently far away and positioning melees between you and your target. If you do that, it facilitates harder nuking standard aggro permits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much aggro does casting a spell add?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: This isn't thoroughly known as all the calculations are stored on the server. However deduction suggests the following. When you cast a standard direct damage spell (with no stun component) the amount of aggro it causes corresponds directly to the number of hp that spell could remove from the monster if it were completely unresisted. So if you cast a spell that can potentially do 300 damage to a monster, you gain 300 points of hate. Spells with additional components such as stuns add more hate than their raw damage would suggest, and debuffs etc. all appear to have hard coded values. It works similarly for melees hitting monsters although its not clearly known exactly how much aggro is generated for misses or hits. This is why you can't nuke a monster at the start of a fight and not end up topping the hate list. It is widely assumed that dual wielding creates more aggro than using a 2 handed weapon, whilst this was certainly the case, when Verant patched two handed damage they also addressed this, so the divide is certainly less pronounced than it was.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is a rampage list?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Certain 'uber mobs' have rampage lists where a set number of people near the top of the hate list are all hit when the monster 'Rampages'. A rampage being a special attack where the monster hits multiple players all at once. Rampage has a huge range, so don't be surprised if the monster melees you half way across a zone if you've qualified yourself a place on the list.<br>
<br>
There is debate as to whether the list is simply the top few on the hate list, or whether its maintained seperately. Frankly, I don't know!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I lower my aggro?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Hate decays over time. As far as I can discern, every server tick a certain amount of hate is removed from each persons aggro counter on a monsters hate list. This is why when trying to kill steal on a multigroup raid, it is far more effective to nuke hard at the end, than consistently throughout the encounter.<br>
<br>
In addition, wizards may cast 'Concussion' &amp; 'Ancient: Concussion' to remove 400 and 600 points of aggro respectively.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Any other factors that affect how much aggro I draw?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yep :<br>
- There is thought to be a range component in monster aggro too. So the further away you can stand when nuking the better.<br>
- Sitting down also adds to your aggro on the monsters hate list. Watch out meditating in fights!<br>
- Your level relative to the monsters affects your aggro radius - the distance you need to be to the monster for it to attack you. A level 60 can pass fairly close to a level 45 monster and it won't react. A level 40 will probably be attacked at 4 times the distance with the same monster.<br>
- Casting your epic (but this is mentioned in the epic section).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is kill stealing?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: When you ensure that your group recieves the experience from killing a monster, normally in a multigroup raid type situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4. General Tactics.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Ooops, I just got to the top of the hate list and the monster is beating me up. Do I run in a circle screaming?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: No. Stand still, try and cast concussion if you have the spell and let the tanks try to peel the monster off you. Running around means they can't hit the monster reliably so in all likelihood has a higher probability in killing you. Whilst running is a mistake, backing up from the mob slowly is a good idea - as mentioned a portion of hate is proximity based so backing up may allow the melees to peel you more easily.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Are there any exceptions to the above?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Sometimes. In an outdoor zone, if you are able to run faster than the monster, it may be worth outrunning it and 'kiting' it around until the group is able to deal with it. Generally one adopts a holding pattern near the group, always maintaing enough distance to stay out of the monsters melee range.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I get across Siren's Grotto?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well if you are cool, you can run it. If however you are a lazy ner'do well, you can cast 'Abscond' or 'Evacuate' at the zone in and end up close to the 'West Wastes' zone out.<br>
(Kwinic Yoegh'ilrymmin)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Arghhhh, I've got this nasty DOT on me and I'm about to die. I can't cure it, HELP!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: You may have noticed, that if you zone with very low hit points, you tend to appear on the other side stripped off buffs and with a fixed number of hit points. Apparently, it occurs when you zone with less hit points than you have +hit point items and was a work around they inserted to fix a bug. This can be used to your advantage, but I'll leave it for you to infer the rest...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5. Alternate Advancement.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What do these do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: As follows:<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Mastery<br>
---------------------<br>
I .......... 2.5% mana saving on *every* spell.<br>
II ......... 5% mana saving on *every* spell.<br>
III ........ 10% mana saving on *every* spell.<br>
(On top of specialisation saving! So this is arguably the best alternate advancement skill, in terms of bang per AA point).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What order would you recommend I pursue these skills in?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well this is again highly personal and dependent on whether you raid, solo or group. However this is what I would recommend:<br>
1.Runspeed I-III<br>
2.Improved Natural Regeneration I-III<br>
3.Spell Casting Mastery I-III<br>
&lt;Gets more difficult to decide beyond this as its contingent on what class skills you want. I want mana burn, and don't care too much about crits as they are expensive for the performance increase they yield, so my choice is as follows.&gt;<br>
4. Mental Clarity I-III<br>
5. Nexus Gate (great utility).<br>
6. Manaburn.<br>
7. Spell Casting Fury I-III.<br>
8. Spell Casting Fury Mastery I-III.<br>
<br>
Note that if you are AoE grouping, the crits have a more noticeable impact as you are hitting a lot more mobs with spell damage over a given period of time. Of course this is contingent on mana being the throttle rather than mob respawn - which isn't something I've ever had an issue with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Does 'Spell Casting Deftness' improve the casting speed of my epic?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Apparently not, although this is contrary to what Lawrence Poe indicated at the fan faire so may be a bug/oversight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much damage can I do with manaburn?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Ignoring critical hits, 1.5-2.0 times your current mana level. Crits could further double that to a maximum of four times your current mana.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6. Fighting 'Uber Mobs'.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I've never killed one before, give me the basics.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well most big battles are made or broken entirely on the monsters positioning. How does this affect you? Well it means that you need to control your aggro, because you moving the mob over to you could cause the whole raid to wipe out. Monsters can only summon every 10 or so seconds, so its actually not that hard to ruin the positioning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What else?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Most 'ubers' cast AoE spells, so you need to know ahead of the battle what resist you need to have in order to protect yourself. Use that knowledge to gird yourself in appropriate equipment to protect yourself. As a guide, getting your resist over 200 including buffs is normally sufficient in most fights.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I have my resists over 200 and I still die more than Kenny McCormack?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Level plays a hugely significant part in your ability to resists spells. Level up and all will be well. Also some AoEs aren't resistable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats this hiding thing?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: A lot of AoEs depend on you being in the monsters line of sight to be able to hit you. If you know he casts every 45 seconds, you can dance in and out based on that time period, hiding behind a nice wall each time he casts. For some long interval between AoE mobs I will actually use a stop watch to time this, for others its a case of getting one spell off and hiding.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I know when the mobs has cast its AoE?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: There are several tricks to this, firstly have a melee standing in the AoE shout each time it goes off. The effectiveness of this is moderated by lag. Also, use your ears and eyes as there are other clues - you may have to turn particle effects on however.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: My group never gets a cleric on raids?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: You probably don't need one if you have your epic and decent resists. Recasting 'Barrier of Force' is equivalent to an 796hp heal and can keep you alive in all but the most difficult of encounters.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 7. Soloing.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is root/nuking?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well you root a mob, stand far enough back so that it can't hit you and then nuke it. Ideally stand as far back as possible as root nearly always breaks when you nuke the mob so you will have to recast and back up again. Its a terribly inefficient way to level, and best practised near a zone line if your luck is anything like mine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is kiting?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Killing a monster, by constantly outrunning its melee range and nuking whilst you are sufficiently ahead to not be hit. Generally its easier if you can snare (a druid term, our spell is called 'Bonds of Force' and is level 29) the monster which slows its movement rate, and sow (increase runspeed) yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is quad kiting?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Using our pillar line of spells to kill 4 monsters at a time, which has a positive impact on our mana efficiency, and thus our xp gaining efficiency.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How do I do this?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where do I do this?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Depends entirely on level, at some levels its nearly impossible due to lack of either hunting spots or adequate spells. Here are some guides including teqchnique and locations to quad:<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 8. Area of Effect (AoE) Grouping.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So what is AoE grouping, I keep hearing other classes using it as justification for wizards being less than desireable for groups?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Its a way in which several groupless wizards and some buddies can make decent xp in a very limited number of zones. It involves killing 20+ monsters at a time, and then medding up in between, so whilst the xp does sound wonderful and sometimes is, its not quite as wonderful as some might think. Its great for making others jealous though!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Give me some practical examples of how to AoE group.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well there are several ways to build the group, depending on the zone you are in and how you want to play it. First important thing is that you need to be a highish level wizard to do this effectively as the 'Jyll's' line of spells is fairly essential. <br>
<br>
Forming the group, you need several wizards or a mage at a pinch. You also need an enchanter or two to chain stun the monsters with their AoE stun spells. Two enchanters adds safety if the mobs are dangerous and likely to do nasty things like stun or hit a lot, but it isn't necessary in most zones. A cleric can be handy too for keeping folks alive, and then lastly you can get youself a puller. The wizards can actually do the pulling, but it depends on how brave they are. Personally my favourite puller is a Paladin as he has good AC, and can cast DA which saves him at times. So what does that leave you with, well here is my typical aoe group:<br>
<br>
2 Wizards<br>
1 Wizard/Mage<br>
1 Enchanter<br>
1 Cleric<br>
1 Paladin<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So whats the tactic?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well the puller runs off and grabs a huge train of mobs for the group. When the mobs are in range the chanter(s) chain stun them, and the wizards chain cast point blank AoE spells such as Jyll's. Its important to get the mobs tightly grouped so that you can hit them all with your AoE.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Any other tips?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yeah. When casting, one component of it failing due to interuption is based on whether or not you moved during the invocation. This means that when monsters knock you back, you can fail the casting by default. To get around this, jam your arse in the corner so that you can't be knocked back. Its most important your chanters do this, although mostly they don't listen when you impart this advice!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What else?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Keep the enchanter alive at all costs, hes your lifeline.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Which zones can I do this in?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Hmm, I was going to say, but since Verant aren't wonderfully kean on the tactic I don't want to give too much away in case they spot something they consider too easy. Best bet is to ask around amongst other wizards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 9. Patch Paranoia.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Have they nerfed jboots, they seem way slower?!!?!111!!!1!!11</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Probably not, have you checked you have run turned on? This is a recurring question every patch, verify before crying wolf please.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: All my spells seem to fizzle or be resisted - have those b*****ds nerfed us?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Probably not, people ask this every patch too. The random number generator in EQ appears to be *very* streaky. As such you are liable to get chains of failure on things, which when combined with the usual patch paranoia can suggest new patterns that really aren't there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 10. The Epic.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What does it do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: What does it do? This is the quintissential piece of wizard gear. Probably the most important item you will ever own and one of the few epics that hasn't been surpassed by MUD inflation as yet. It has decent stats (although we got shafted on the resists) and allows you to right click cast the spell 'Barrier of Force' upon yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What does 'Barrier of Force' do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: 796 hit point dmg shield, and +3 mana a tick regen. It takes 15 seconds to cast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Where can I get it?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well its a quest you see...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I seem to get aggro when I cast my epic, what's going on?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well, mysteriously one day, the epic rune became a huge aoe taunt. Be careful in zones where people tend to train groups of mobs back to the raid (i.e. 'Grieg's End' is awful - frankly I recommend being invis there until you get to the raid mob!). I suspect that it was given aggro corresponding to a heal of 796hp and whilst heals had their aggro toned down, I don't believe runes did. This is pure guesswork, but I wouldn't be surprised if the epic generates 796 points of aggro, which is quite a lot. Hatebringer, a very effective taunt weapon and a very high end item has a proc that does 700 points of aggro, if this puts it in perspective. Anyway, try to re-skin away from mobs unless they are already pretty aggro on someone else.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 11. Issues of Equipment.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats a manastone?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: An item that when activated, converts 60 of your hit points to 20 mana. It no longer drops in game and indeed this was done so long ago many servers don't have any. It is also instant cast and can only be used in old world zones, excluding the planes and the new 'Cazic Thule.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Why did they nerf the manastone?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: It was hugely imbalancing, especially in the hands of clerics who could convert all their hitpoints to mana and then complete heal themselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What use is it then?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well wizards probably gain the most out of these for general usage these days. After soloing some monsters, we tend to gate to an old world zone, manastone ourselves up to full mana and then go back to killing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Who else uses them?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Mostly healing classes that are power leveling up characters in the old world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats a manarobe?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: The replacement to the manastone, but they added a cast time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So a manarobe is good then?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Not really, the cast time is sufficient that you need to concentrate and click the damned thing constantly to see any benefit. Even then the benefit is marginal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What right click mana free nuke items are their available for us?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Not many, and most at level 50+ ! Here, in order of desireability :<br>
<br>
Solist's Icy Want ...................... 38 dmg, 5 sec cast.<br>
Velious Quest Robe ..................... 360 dmg, 28 sec cast.<br>
Vermillion Orb of Torrefaction ......... 250 dmg, 10 sec cast.<br>
Vermillion Robe of Torrefaction ........ 625 dmg, 15 sec cast.<br>
Solist's Robe of Invocation ............ 784 dmg, 14 sec cast.<br>
(Renamed 'Robe of Invocation')<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What is a 'SotF'?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: One of two things, often dependent upon the level of the person using the term. For those of lower level, its a 'Staff of Temperate Flux' - a quest reward from the 'Temple of Solusek Ro' for a fairly handy item. Those of higher level, are often referring to the 'Staff of the Four', which is the formal name of our epic weapon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats the 'Staff of Temperate Flux' used for?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Pulling. Its instant click, so you can use it to remotely pull mobs with minimum effort, time and risk - you don't even have to be facing the monster although you do need line of sight. Oh, it also has a negligable debuff to a mobs fire and cold resists. And I mean negligable. Lots of wizzies love this a lot. And I mean a lot. I was lazy and didn't get it until level 59, and could still quad kite just fine so don't let them beat you up about it!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What else is the 'Staff of Temperate Flux' good for?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Taunting, checking to see if other classes debuffs are on yet, determining max range, refreshing spell icons, getting a rough feel for a target's MR, and others (junk debuff).<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So how does the zone affect this?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Zones have a multiplier known as the ZEM (Zone Experience Multiplier) that is multiplied with the monsters base xp to yield the final reward amount. Some lesser used or more dangers zones have higher ZEMs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So potentially I can make faster xp there?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yep, but they have higher ZEMs normally because they are a pain in the arse or hard to get to.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Can you list the ZEMs?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: I don't have a definitive list, but these are the zones VI patched to have increased ZEM a while back:<br>
<br>
Droga increased by 12% <br>
Nurga increased by 12% <br>
Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13% <br>
Najena increased by 13% <br>
Befallen increased by 13% <br>
Paw increased by 13% <br>
Permafrost increased by 13% <br>
Kaesora increased by 18% <br>
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% <br>
Runnyeye increased by 20% <br>
Kerra Ridge increased by 20% <br>
The Hole increased by 25% <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: I hear groups get an xp bonus for each extra person?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Yes. Its as follows:<br>
<br>
2 person group - 2% total bonus. <br>
3 person group - 6% total bonus. <br>
4 person group - 10% total bonus. <br>
5 person group - 14% total bonus. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So its a good idea to have a full group?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Generally no, its best to have the minimum number of people in your group possible to hold the camp as the group xp bonus is fairly pitiful. If you want a game that puts its money where its mouth is in encouraging grouping, go play Anarchy Online. A full group there gets a 200% bonus which is great motivation to fill up a group. Verant take note please.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How is xp split between people of varying levels in the same group?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: This is dredged from my memory so I'll make my disclaimers now. As far as I can recall, xp is split between group members proportionately based upon the amount of xp they needed to attain their current level. Thus two people of the same level who are grouped will gain equal xp. You'd need to know the xp/level formulas to work out other more complex permutations. Also remember that there are exceptions and caps involved that stop low level people grouping with high levels, high levels from farming green mobs, and low levels getting insane xp from killing reds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much xp do I get from killing 'light blue' mobs?[/Q]<br>
A: The ShowEq users who have investigated claim there are two levels of light blue. The higher light blues yield 50%xp, whilst the lower ones only 25%. This makes light blue killing a fairly unattractive prospect in my mind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are hell lev</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Indication that whoever worked out the xp curves hadn't got much further than adding up grocery bills in their mathematical education. They wanted xp to increase more steaply every so often, so they just put in a big multiplier at certain levels (described below) to up the requirement. Rather than cleverly spreading the pain across a level range such as 35-40, they decided to put the whole burden in at 35 etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: When are these hell levels?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Levels {30, 35, 40, 45, 51, 54, 59}<br>
(All post 50 levels are harder, but hell really relates to levels where the xp modifier steps up).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Will they ever fix this oversight?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Most likely not, as it would have the effect of leveling people who were a long way into a hell level and this is either thought damaging, or they think it would probably break everything. I submit that its a combination of both factors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are the exact xp modifiers that cause these hell levels - I like details!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
01-29 modifier ... 1.0<br>
30-34 modifier ... 1.1<br>
35-39 modifier ... 1.2<br>
40-44 modifier ... 1.3<br>
45-50 modifier ... 1.4<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Is it easier to gain alternate experience before I hit 60?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: There isn't a simple answer to this. If you look merely at hunting opportunities (especially if you like to quad) then almost certainly. Of course there are a lot of benefits to being level 60 including superior spells, resists, the feeling of relief &amp; etc... If I hadn't been 60 when alt xp arrived, I'd probably have built up about 20 alt xp points total before getting to 60 on the raptors. Then again I might not have, given that my guild is all 60s now and I had a fair amount of pressure to level up at the time. Like I said, its a hard question and some things like aoe groups become easier when you are higher level. In the end it comes down to your play style.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 12. Player vs. Player (PvP)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Why do people go on about Shock of Lightening in pvp?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Because its a low level spell (so easy to channel, low mana &amp; fast cast) and interupts casting. It can also be chain cast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much damage do my spells do in pvp?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: 2/3'rds as much as against an npc. (/sigh)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Whats the general pvp tactic for a wizard?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: PvP is pretty hard for wizzies with the general availability of resist gear, regen gear and the damage multiplier (of 0.6). Having said that, here are a few things wizzies do:<br>
<br>
- Use the 'Yonder' line of spells to stay constantly out of other players range. Especially useful against melees. Watch out though as it won't let you go uphill...<br>
- Cast invis if you've managed to hide from the opponent, it makes you drop off their targetting unless they have see invis cast.<br>
- Don't ever be grouped with a player you are dualing. They can use /follow to stay locked to you. Especially deadly against rogues.<br>
- Keep your back to the wall if dualing a rogue!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: What are pumice stones?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: The original and no longer sold by vendor version is an instant click debuff spell that. This was judged unfair, so they replaced them with 'Crystalised Pumice' on the vendors, which has a cast time of 5 seconds. &lt;Is that right cast time?&gt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How come people still seem to have the old instant cast variety around?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Because you can use vendors to recharge them if you have a fully charged one in addition to your empty one. To do this, find an unused vendor with some empty slots (you can tell because when you sell them an item, they will display it). Sell them the empty pumice first, then sell them the charged one. Buy both back. You now have two charged pumice stones. This works on other items too, but practicality is dictated by the buy back price. VI will probably get around to nerfing this at some point, but its been around for nearly 3 years at the time of writing. &lt;Is vendor trick correctly described - I've never done it, but thats how I recall it being explained&gt;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: So how do wizards win at pvp?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well I don't play on a pvp server, but I've been lead to believe that mostly, they creep up on injured players and nuke em... Frankly if you are up against a warrior with 6k hp, resist gear and a fungal tunic, you are going to run oom before you kill them if you try to be honourable. Alternatively, manaburn can be pretty nice for this too.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 13. Class Balance.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: How much damage do wizards do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: A contentious issue indeed! Sadly less than most of us feel is equitable. Armok, a Sorceror spent considerable time logging various grouping situations and arrived at the following charts:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=641.topic">pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffe...=641.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
I believe we need a considerable boost in our sustainable damage output, and hope that the balancing currently taking place will address our issues throughout the level range.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Why do we do less than other classes?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: Well, we are still predominantly using the spells that the game was released with, or evolutions based on the ratios of damage to mana originally formulated. Melee equipment has continued to increase in power by leaps and bounds each expansion, somewhat exclipsing our abilities. Condsider, when the game came out, one of the best weapons was a 'Short Sword of Ykesha' which had a ratio of 8/24 and a 70dmg proc. Current warrior weapons have ratios in the order of 12/20 and procs of several hundred points damage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Q: Are wizards alone in this?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A: No, most casters have issues, although our predicament is somewhat unique since we don't have pets to inflict mana efficient damage for us. Of course, with pathing as it is and pet control so finicky, there are times when pets are no good either.<br>

---------<br>
Song type A mana injectors<br>
Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity ..... +2 per tick (L20)<br>
Cassindra`s Chorus of Clarity .... +5..7 per tick (L32..4<br>
<br>
Song type B mana regen increasers<br>
Cantata of Soothing .............. +5 per tick (L34)<br>
Cantata of Replenishment ......... +12..13 per tick (L55..60)<br>
Chorus of Replenishment ......... +12..13 per tick (area effect)<br>
<br>
There are two types of bard manasongs, as indicated above. Technically, you can't call the type A songs mana regen increasers, they're mana injectors. There is no buff effect to these songs, but each time a bard sings a pulse of that song (almost all bard songs pulse or cast at 6 seconds per song), the group's mana users are injected with the amount of mana for that song. Because there is no buff effect, these songs can &quot;stack&quot; with anything including another bard singing the same song.<br>
<br>
The type B songs are more like the clarity line, in that they have a buff effect icon, and increase your mana regeneration. the level 55 Cantata is very similar to the level 58 Chorus upgrade, but Cantata affects only the group the bard is in, whereas Chorus affects all players within the AE radius. Type B songs do not stack with each other, do not overwrite each other, but they do stack with PotG, Clarity lines, Barrier of Force, etc.<br>
<br>
Because of the &quot;not overwriting each other&quot; issue, if you have a level 58 bard singing Chorus of Replenishment for a raid for example, all other bards should sing the level 32 injection if they want to further improve their groups mana situation, or they may run the risk of their preventing their group from getting the full benefit from the chorus by blocking it with a lower level song like cantata of soothing.<br>

IIRC injectors all stack?<br>
<br>
There is also the matter of amplification songs which further improve manaregen songs I think?<br>
<br>
I'll definitely put some of this in so thanks for the big run-down, I may try to trim it a bit though in the interests of brevity. <p><CENTER>
