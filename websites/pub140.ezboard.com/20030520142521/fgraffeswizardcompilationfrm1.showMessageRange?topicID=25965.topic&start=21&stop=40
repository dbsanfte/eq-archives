I believe you guys got in the hate list due to the fact that monk was the MA. If there was only 1 tank and cleric being oom just by healing him, then eighther he healed in a wrong way or his mana pool was insanely low.<br>

(I always type something original in the topic :</span><hr size=1> What's funny is that after all this time, many people don't realize that playing a wizard is an ART, not a science.  How you play, if you play to avoid agro, or to push the agro line, to get the hit points so if you get hit you don't drain the cleric's mana, etc are really about HOW you want to play your character.<br>
<br>
For those fantasy fans(not everyone is big on fantasy yet they play EQ), Gandalf went toe to toe with the balrog in Moria.  Some wizards follow this image, some follow the image of a skinny weakling who throws huge damage spells from far away.  If you can play it where you get agro without getting too badly hurt(needing a LOT of cleric mana), then go for it.  If you can't cut it toe to toe with a mob, then don't play that way.<br>
<br>
Now, it's clear that all of us need to approach named mobs differently than the normal mobs we fight in XP groups because they hit harder.  Those who push the agro line DO tend to step back a bit on named, especially when the named mobs don't die quickly.  But that's also a part of the art of playing a wizard.<br>
<br>
So, if you feel that wizards should NEVER get agro, or should never take ANY damage, that's your right, you play the class the way you will.  Others who enjoy riding the edge of agro also have the right, as long as they know by the time they hit the high level game how to play it.<br>
<br>
If you have two wizards who are agressive, and know to stay in melee range when in an XP group, they can be a VERY solid team while allowing the melees to contribute fully.  Nothing wrong with it, and any clerics who deny that wizards CAN do a very good level of damage when working together doesn't have much experience with us.<br>

Maybe it's because I'm not the best Wizard out there, or my play style is different, but I've always viewed that a dead Wizards DPS is significantly lower than mine.  Not to mention the downtime it takes to recover from a death while you med up.<br>
<br>
To each their own.  Play the way that you enjoy that doesn't go in contrast to your group dynamics.  If the group (note: Not just one person) doesn't want you to play that style, and you don't want to change, perhaps it's time to find another group. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=511810">Mysthawk Nightcaster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - 62 High Elven  Wizard <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.vbforums.com/images/smilies/cool.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I've had similar success rotating stuns with a pally friend of mine, while my husbands ranger sits back and fires at the unrooted but stationary mob. In this case, i concussion liberally between stuns to make sure the pally keeps the aggro. It's not alway the most efficient tactic, but its an option. In fact I would guess it left your monk healthy and ready to pull as soon as the fights were over. Alot of clerics are very used to a &quot;role&quot; just as alot of wizards are. Your cleric may have had a hard time attention wise keeping up with 2 targets that likely didn't have more than 2k hp. Alternative tactics require that the majority of the group is able to adapt. It seems to me like the cleric was just frustrated with a change from the norm, and wanted to go back to a traditional tactic. Sounds like you were more than able to drop aggro when asked, so the clerics nasty comments about how to play your class seem unwarranted to me. I think the key to playing a good wizard is getting aggro only when you want to get it. I would bet there are dozens of different tactics for achieving that in varying situations tho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=targonis>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 765<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 9:40:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25965.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Mysthawk, the logic is fairly simple(to me at least).  My thinking on this is that the power of wizards is that we can do the most damage in the shortest period of time.  Also, dead mobs don't do damage, so the quicker you kill a mob, the less damage the tanks take, which means the cleric(s) don't need to heal as much.<br>
  Now, if you ride the agro line perfectly, you will get summoned, but the mob will turn back to the tanks before even attacking you.  So, you are doing the max DPS without taking any cleric mana.  If you have your epic, and have HP buffs, even if you agro a mob that breaks through your epic rune, you won't need healing until after the mob is dead, and even then it won't be a HUGE level of healing.  You've saved cleric mana by killing faster.<br>
<br>
This of course, implies that you can stay alive, and can ride close to the agro line without making the cleric heal you continually.  It also implies that you have the hit points to take a few hits without getting killed.  One thing many people never understood is why STAMINA is listed as a primary stat for wizards.  Take a look at character creation, you will see that Intelligence AND Stamina are the primary stats.  We get self-only runes through our advancement because we WILL occasionally get agro.<br>
<br>
Then, there is also the mindset of many wizards that has developed over time because wizards were relegated to taxi service by MANY guilds and people during the Kunark and Velious days(pre-AA abilities).  The damage output from melees compared to casters JUMPED up with Kunark's release.  It got to the point where people wouldn't notice that a wizard was in the group unless an evac was needed.  The solution that some of us came up with was to make our presence FELT in groups.  Perhaps not on EVERY mob, but at least here and there, we'd nuke a LOT, the mob would drop quick, and the people in the group would notice.  Then we'd med up for a few more mobs, then do it again.  Wizards who only nuked once or twice per mob to avoid going OOM just wern't noticed by most groups, so were considered expendable.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to see that those days are generally gone, spell crits can be seen, the melees see and feel it when we are in the group, but the old, &quot;tank/cleric/enchanter&quot; core is still present.  As the player base learns how to tell the difference between a GOOD wizard and one that sucks, getting groups has become less difficult.  Many still don't know the difference between a wizard that hasn't hit Master yet and one that's hit Sage, but they are slowly learning.  The NEED to ride the agro line has gone down as we can pump out good damage without needing to push as hard as well.  Many still do it, but it's also a function of style at that point.<br>

Generally, it's best to back off when not nukeing to avoid problems with proximity agro.  If two people have equal agro levels, the person closest to the mob will be the one the mob attacks.  When we say to nuke from melee range, it's to keep the mob from running after you IF you get agro and making the melees run after it.<br>
<br>
The high end game gets a little strange when it comes to things like this because if you have a good level of hit points(1700+ unbuffed), with epic rune or force shield, in a group if a mob that hits for over 300 hits you, that's not a big deal.  There are times when a mob with low HP that has agroed will just inspire me to use draughts to nuke it down rather than be concerned.  It's also not unusual to find yourself with over 4k HP in the high level game when fully buffed.  Then you REALLY need to be careful of agro, but it's still generally not a big deal when a mob that hits for 600+ slaps you a few times before switching back to the tanks.  Concussion definately helps.  <br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind, the sooner you agro, the harder it is for a melee to pull the mob off you.  Depending on the damage output from the others in your group, you can either start to cast big nukes at 80% mob health, or you may need to wait until it's down to 60%.  It's really about judging agro.  Another thing that many don't realize is that a paladin or shadow knight will often get and hold agro a LOT easier than a warrior.  This is why Verant/Sony MUST work on warrior agro.  Taunt for warriors should do a LOT more than it does currently. <p>Targonis Manastorm<br>

The point is to be in melee range at the time that you grab agro.  It is okay to back off slowly when not casting, but then you will usually not be able to sit until the target you cast on is dead, or at least til it has been engaged for a little while after you back off.<br>
<br>
Ideally, you will not cast at target-X until you know you have enough mana to stand through the remainder of the fight with target-X. <br>
<br>
If you're going to have to get agro to keep up with your mana regen, and preferably not take damage due to skins, then the pattern would be like:  Med until you can start nuking and you have enough mana to finish the kill.  Stand close enough for target-X to hit you, but farther from target-X than the tank.  Begin nuking, possibly using concussion if you have it, and don't stop.<br>

So true. The &quot;wizards should never get hit&quot; thing is just so narrowminded. Wonder what they do when they get in the situation where you can do 7-8 times the damage of your melees, but only if you do get agro on quite a few mobs (aka pickup groups). <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35001" target="top"><br>

I agree that riding the razor edge can be fun and challenging.  Maybe it's because if I did that I would go OOM way to quick that I don't do it.  I'd rather contribute every fight than med though some.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   To each their own.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One thing to keep in mind, the sooner you agro, the harder it is for a melee to pull the mob off you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is not entirely true... it is for the most part though.<br>
<br>
If a melee gets a successful taunt, it will put them at the top of the hate list, just barely above the previous highest person.  Thus regardless of how much hate you have earned, if a warrior gets a successful taunt off they will be the monsters main target.  Unfortuntly taunt isn't always successful, and it doesn't really help any if you're chain nuking. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=511810">Mysthawk Nightcaster</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - 62 High Elven  Wizard <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.vbforums.com/images/smilies/cool.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

someone who is obviously inept and clueless advising me on how to play wizard aggrivates me to no end, naturally. it's like recommending that you drive a car that has no breaks. they don't know; they have little or no experience with wizards. their input would only reduce your effectiveness, which I think is what this thread is largely about. I do everything to have the maximum ability and expertise that I can while being a wizard, any incorrect suggestion naturally is an insult to all that a highly experienced wizard works to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1734<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/03 11:53:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25965.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: disagree!</span><hr size=1> One thing I think is important is to always keep an open mind.  Even though you have a great understanding of how you play your class if someone of anouther class or same class trys to give you advice don't get upset with them for telling you how to play your class.  There advice weather warented not warented good or bad can still be usefull if your open to the other persons point of view.  And if the advice is complete garbage educate the person nicely on how to play your class.<br>
<br>
There have been times when I have been grouped with other wizards and I saw them doing weird things out of the norm (or might be the norm in some cases <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  <br>
<br>
I remember one wizard kept getting agro and I was like what an idiot so I sent him a tell to see what the deal was, and he responded not with a lame I know how to play my class responce, but with a reason he was getting agro.  He informed me he was doing it on purpose to build defence skill and was of course in melle range to avoid ping ponging and didn't let his life get low enuff to realy need healed because he would just barely get agro to take a couple hits.  This was with my second wizard in 20's in ill omen (first wizard was level 46).  So I ended up learning something new that day.<br>
<br>
Then there was anouther time I was grouped with a wizard in higher levels and was wondering what the heck he was doing, and he realy didn't know what he was doing but when I offered friendly advice I got the please dont tell me how to play my class crap.<br>
<br>
So just a heads up to keep an open mind and don't get defencive if someone offers advice however they may offer it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinnjatorix>Sinnjatorix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/16/03 4:20:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25965.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://w1.853.telia.com/~u85304784/pics/eq/Stringius.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: disagree!</span><hr size=1> At 30 riding aggro like people suggest i would be oom after 2-3 mobs, been in overthere and pulls are to fast, shure i might be poorly equipped with only 195int. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=206618">Dark elf wizard</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->,<br>

I simply did more damage over time, in a group, not riding anywhere near the aggro line, just using spaced rain+draughts to layer damage without aggro.<br>
<br>
Currently at 62, with my 'pathetic' spell selection, I can't actually reliably dump mana fast enough to go OOM without getting my head torn off. Crossing the aggro line by more than a little bit in PoP is a death sentence, and if I start nuking a little later, my ISoS/draught of ro combos, or ISOS+rain will do about as good as I'm going to get without getting me summoned. Throwing an extra draught in (which could get me summoned) costs me the time for the NEXT nuke because I have to concussion it off. Keeping things spaced loses me some fraction of a draught's damage (I didn't cast the extra, but no time lost on excessive concussions, so more damage through the entire fight with less chance of a wet red stain where I used to be standing).<br>
<br>
It's also fight dependant. But I think the people who think we have to be constantly on the edge of summoned and beaten either have very large manapools, very narrow 'vision', better than average spells (say, EER and/or GSS at 60, AT-&gt;SoS for 63-65), or a combination of them all. Joe wizard with etherial parch spells or less, primarily using draughts, is going to be playing a different game than the folks wielding aggro magnet big ticket spells, from what I see.<br>
