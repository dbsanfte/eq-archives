I'd like to see some original spells. I love how SoE likes to flaunt the variety of spells in the game. Over 1,000 spells etc etc. Here's an example of 8 spells:<br>
<br>
Burst of Flame lvl 1<br>
Burst of Fire lvl 5<br>
Ignite lvl 9<br>
Combust lvl 29<br>
Firestrike lvl 39<br>
Starfire lvl 49<br>
Wildfire lvl 59<br>
Summer's Flame lvl 64<br>
<br>
I'll give you 3 guesses what they have in common. They are all fire dd spells. Each spell simply an upgrade of the one before it. I think the death of original spells came with Kunark. Wake of Karana, Call of Hero, Divine Intervention, Mark of Karn, etc. Nothing earth shattering. But at least they provided variety and new specialization to certain classes. Like druids became king of fire/cold resists. I want to see one original and useful spell come out for each class.<br>
<br>
I'm just pulling these out of my arse, but here are a few examples:<br>
<br>
Temporal Flux<br>
Class: Wizard<br>
Mana: 50<br>
Level: 63<br>
Cast Time: Instant<br>
Recast: 20 minutes<br>
Effect: This is difficult to explain so bear with me. Upon casting this spell the wizard jumps ten seconds into the future for ten seconds. The effects of this can be devastating. Upon casting the spell, the wizard will disappear from the site of the world for 10 seconds. After the 10 seconds are over, 2 wizards will be present. Each will be capable of a strategic event, both nuking same target, both run different directions etc. After the next 10 seconds are over there will only be one wizard present. The two wizards are in fact the same wizard. The way this would work in game would be after casting Temporal Flux the player would blink a random direction 10 ft away or so and the game world would freeze on the player's PC. The player has 10 seconds to do anything he likes, but none of the effects of his spells casted would take place... yet. After the 10 seconds are over he would reappear where he was 10 seconds ago, but the world would be in it's present state. A double of himself would appear and do exactly what he did during the 10 seconds the game world was frozen. Any damage done to the double will apply to the wizard because the double is in essence the wizard. Any spells cast by the double will be taken out of the wizards mana pool. If the double targets and nukes a target that died during the 10 seconds, then the mana is wasted from the wizard still. This is a double edged sword, while the wizard could do untold damage during the 10 seconds where he has a clone of himself, he is also twice as vulnerable to rampage etc. I understand this might be difficult to code, but I certainly believe it's possible.<br>
<br>
Frozen Time<br>
Class: Wizard<br>
Level: 59<br>
Mana: 500<br>
Cast: 2 seconds<br>
Duration: 45 seconds<br>
Recast: 10 minutes<br>
Limitation: Cannot cast spells or zone<br>
Effect: The wizard disappears, locked in time. The wizard can move freely for 45 seconds until time catches up. This spell is designed as a quick escape, or travel through dangerous area spell.<br>
<br>
Ethereal Nature Form<br>
Class: Druid<br>
Mana: 300<br>
Level: 62<br>
Limit: Outdoor Only<br>
Effect: The druid takes on the form of a spirit. (same model, but with white texture and see through). While in this form the druid can not cast any spells, but will also have nuetral faction to virtually all npc's. <br>
<br>
Tashania's Body Double<br>
Class: Enchanter<br>
Mana: 250<br>
Level: 58<br>
Cast time: Instant<br>
Recast: 35 minutes<br>
Effect: The enchanter creates an illusion of herself while simutaneously teleporting herself a random direction 30ft or so away while invising herself. In essence whatever was attacking the enchanter will think it successfully kills the enchanter, while she sneeks away invisible. The body double will have the same HP/AC the enchanter had at the time of the casting. The body double will continuously cast a hate increasing buff upon herself. The body double is incapable of doing any damage and will despawn in 5 minutes if not destroyed.<br>
<br>
Aid of the Arch-Magi<br>
Class: Mage<br>
Level: 62<br>
Mana: 100<br>
Cast: 5 seconds<br>
Effect: Think reverse CoH. The mage summons himself to someone in his group. This spell holds alot of obvious problems for designers. Think how easy it would be for a SoS rogue to go deep in a dungeon, the mage summons himself to the rogue once he gets in a safe spot and then summons the rest of the group/raid. If developers used this one, they would obviously have to limit the zones it could be used in, or come up with creative deterents. Outside a couple abuses, it could be a very fun spell for mages. no component, low mana.<br>
<br>
Unfailing Burning Hands<br>
Class: Mage<br>
Level: 64<br>
Mana: 500<br>
Cast: 5.5 seconds<br>
Effect: Mage summons himself to a line of site target and cast a 2100 fire lure dd. (think teleport and high damage burning hands in D&amp;D) The mana cost is justified by making it such a high risk spell. It also allows the mage to come up with some interesting tactics.<br>
<br>
Glyph of the Holy Servant<br>
Class: Cleric<br>
Level: 64<br>
Mana: 400<br>
Cast: 6 seconds<br>
Recast: 10 minutes<br>
Effect: The cleric summons a holy symbol that floats stationary above the ground. The symbol is visible to everyone and is inactive for 30 seconds. While it's visible it can be easily destroyed. After the 30 seconds are up, it is only visible to the cleric. (in pvp successful detect traps skill check makes it visible) Anyone who comes close to the symbol will activate the trap. The Glyph explodes with an AE stun effect. The stun is near impossible to resist and last 10 seconds. The cleric can only have one glyph up at a time. The explosion of the clerics glyph will destroy any other cleric glyphs in the area of effect. The glyph will despawn 30 minutes after casting. No material component necessary<br>
<br>
Glyph of the Oracle<br>
Class: Shaman<br>
Level: 64<br>
Mana: 500<br>
Cast: 6 seconds<br>
Recast: 10 minutes<br>
Effect: This spell is similar in nature to the cleric version. The only real difference is the shaman version will cast a powerful disease dot (breath of ulthor or something similar) on a single target that activated the glyph.<br>
<br>
Call of the corpse:<br>
Class: Necromancer<br>
Mana: 200<br>
Cast: 6 seconds<br>
Recast: 2 minutes<br>
Effect: The necromancer summons himself to a targeted corpse (PC or NPC).<br>
<br>
Enslavement of the Soul<br>
Class: Necromancer<br>
Level: 63<br>
Mana: 400<br>
Cast: 4 seconds<br>
Recast: 2.5 seconds<br>
Effect: The necromancer can attempt to forge a soul gem used for rezzing from a targeted NPC's coprse. 80% chance of failure. This allows the necromancer alternative means of acquiring soul gems. NPC corpses must be level 55+ <br>
<br>
Corpse Explosion<br>
Class: Necromancer<br>
Level: 62<br>
Mana: 400<br>
Cast: 5 seconds<br>
Recast: 2.5 seconds<br>
Effect: The corpse of a targetted NPC corpse explodes causing 1000 dd in the area of effect. The corpse that was exploded cannot be looted.  Corpses with magic items cannot be exploded.<br>
<br>
Mass Death Peace<br>
Class: Necromancer<br>
Mana: 500<br>
Cast Time: 3 seconds<br>
Recast: 15 minutes<br>
Component: Peridot<br>
Effect: Group Feign Death. This spell would give much more groupability to necros, as well as enhance their raid effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Mana Feedback<br>
Class: Shadowknight<br>
Level: 63<br>
Mana: 350<br>
Cast: 2 seconds<br>
Recast: 5 minutes<br>
Effect: The targetted pc/npc loses up to 500 mana. Any mana drained will cause 1.5 times as much life lost.<br>
<br>
Ranger- self only ports to druid locations at added mana and cast time.<br>
<br>
Translocate Self<br>
All Casting Hybrids<br>
Level: 58<br>
Mana: 600<br>
Cast Time: 20 seconds<br>
Recast Time: 1 minute<br>
Effect: Hybrid version of gate<br>
<br>
Valiant Guard<br>
Class: Paladin<br>
Level: 63<br>
Mana: 300<br>
Cast Time: 2 seconds<br>
Recast: 10 minutes<br>
Duration: 20 seconds<br>
Effect: The paladin will absorb 125% all damage done to the beneficiary of the spell. The beneficiary can not benefit from another Valiant Guard for 5 minutes after receiving this buff.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd love to hear what original EQ spell ideas you'd like to see implemented in the next expansion or suggested changes for ones I've listed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=radiantguy99>Radiantguy99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/03 10:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Won't work</span><hr size=1> The wizard spells wouldn't work.

<br>
While I agree that the vast majority of spells in EQ are not original to eachother, and that a little more variety would certainly be a very good thing, I don't believe you have thought alot of your ideas through, with the wizard ideas being top of the list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some Ideas I think could be looked into-- I make no claims on proper classes, though some obviously have a bent to one class or another.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Utter Concentration</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->--  Buff that locks the recipient in place, and causes all spells to be un-interuptible for the duration.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Know Terrain</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Spell that instantly maps out for your minimap the zone for 500' in all directions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Transport</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Spell that pops up a dialouge, asking for a Loc, then sends you to the location of your choice within the zone.  Only works in outdoor, non-planar zones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>7 League Boots</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- a tradecraftable or summoned pair of boots that gives Sow speed.  Boots have no stats however, so there is a trade off. Possibly might not work indoors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Know Allies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Spell that gives a list of the targets positive factions.  A second spell in this line might provide all negative faction hits provided by the mob. Usefull for knowing before you kill a mob what hits you will take.  A third variety might provide all mobs or factions the target will assist in battle.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bloodbond</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Links caster and target so that a percentage of all damage take by the caster is instead applied to the target.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Freezes a target in time for 30 seconds, making it unable to move, attack, and makes it invunerable for the duration.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Force Wall/Summon Wall</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- creates a targetable wall that can be destroyed directly in front of the caster.  Wall will break LOS for spells, mobs will stop to bash it down rather than pass by it unless there is a way around, ect...   HP and AC of the wall would depend on the effect desired, with Summon:Wooden Wall having perhaps 500hp and an AC of around 400, Summon:Brick Wall 4000Hp and 800ac, Summon:Stone Wall 10000hp and 1500ac--- or Ice Wall 5pt damage sheild with same stats as wood, Force Wall 15pt damage sheild with stats as Brick, and Wall of Fire being like Stone Wall, with 30pt damage sheild. If possible, in the energy version, only creatures able to hit magic can damage the wall, and a dispell will bring them down instantly...   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This idea might strain the engine however, I do freely admit.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pierce the Veil</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->--  The target enters into the spirit world, becoming completly invisable to the living.  Those in the spirit world are still fully visable to undead, and may interact with undead normally without the living being alerted to the targets presence.  An alternate version could be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Protection from Undead</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, doing the same thing only vs undead mobs.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As a personal note, I believe either or both of these spells to be perfect for Clerics and Necromancers. Possibly the first form of invis I've seen yet that actually makes sense for clerics in fact.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chaos of Zek</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Buff that gives a percentage chance of any incomming damage to reflect to the attacker or an ally of the attacker instead of hitting the recipient.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gift of 1000 hands</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- gives a percentage chance for additional attacks to be carried out with each swing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jump</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-- Radically increases the height that a character can jump, and reduces falling damage.  Disabled in zones where you don't want rocketeers circumventing content, while allowing an alternative to gate when leaving Kaesora or similar dungeons.<br>
<br>
Gatestone-- creates a portal stone that lasts for 30 seconds.  Any who click on the gatestone are sent to the location that goes with the spell, for instance Gatestone of the North would send you to North Karana, Gatestone of Knowledge would send you to PoK, Gatestone of the Soul would send you to your Bind...<br>
<br>
Warded Invisablity-- Same as invisabilty, except that any creature breaks the invisablity is hit by a massive nuke.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This would probably need either expensive reagents,long recast, or to be written off as a bad idea as I can think of lots of ways to exploit this. Probably not so bad if Nuke is replaced with auto-mez or snare/root instead.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
In any case, those spells were designed with a penalty in mind and to negate that would make them VERY overpowering - the reagents aren't incredibly hard to come by but difficult enough that one would conserve the gems (imagine the solo'ing possiblities if you could zap yourself to FM with a reagent off a mob you just killed).<br>
<br>
Group FD - they tried to give bards this, it totally would have broken all existing content as most content relies on a concentration of aggro in one place and finding ways to keep it off of others (such as emp and tallon with de-aggroing debuffs.).  Overpowered, never work.<br>
<br>
Time shifts - not feasible within the engine, the closest they've come to this is the way Saryrn splits and that's because they can design the area and the encounter specifically so that it's always the same.  When dealing with PC's, nothing is constant and there'd be no way for the game to compensate, even if it was just an illusion.<br>
<br>
Basically the closest to original I see this thread coming is short duration buffs that perhaps give a greater crit percentage  (akin to Yaulp in duration) or whatnot.  Basically the game's spells fall into a few categories, but the useful categories are all DoT, Beneficial Buff, Direct DD and pets.<br>
<br>
Personally I thought it was very creative to put weapons in that proc pets so there's extra damage but it's not always predictable and will generate less aggro overall if I understand the principle right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lornick65>Lornick65</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/25/03 7:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> spells</span><hr size=1> I knew there was going to be some confusion with the wizard temporal spell.  I apologize for that, please allow me to clarify my intent.  The server/zone doesn't actually stop or freeze when the wizard casts the spell.  To everyone else, the wizard simply disappeared.  No amount of see invis will allow anyone to see the wizard because in all reality he isn't in that 'time'.  The wizard who cast the spell will see the world frozen in time for 10 seconds.  Perhaps the wizard would see everything besides himself as with out color and slightly blurry.  The actions the wizard takes will 'write the script' for his future self.  When the ten seconds are up, the wizard will be exactly where he was ten seconds ago and a clone of himself will replicate his actions during the 10 seconds while he is free to perform any actions he wishes as well.  The idea is that the wizard leaps 10 seconds into the future to help his future self out for 10 seconds.  For everyone else this will appear as:<br>
<br>
1st round:  Wizard disappears.<br>
2nd round:  2 wizards appear<br>
3rd round:  1 wizard disappears.<br>
<br>
I absolutely believe it would be possible to make this spell and that it wouldn't be overpowering.  It just adds to the tactics useable by the wizard community.  Notice the refresh on this spell.  It's not meant to be used constantly.  Actually, most the spells I suggested have a realitively long refresh for balance purposes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Basically the game's spells fall into a few categories, but the useful categories are all DoT, Beneficial Buff, Direct DD and pets.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's kinda the whole point of the thread.  I think we should get more for our 13 bucks a month.  I didn't get to lvl 65 so I could cast higher level versions of the same spells I had at lvl 1.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I want and expect more.  I'm not going to say all my ideas are ready to hit the server live.  Obviously SoE would have to see if it's even possible to code them, and then they would have to playtest and balance them.  But all those saying &quot;won't work&quot;.  That's not good enough for me.  Suggest some thing better that you think will work then or a modification that would balance the spells.<br>

Having your actions 'write a script' is not very feasable, since in 10 seconds what your fighting is likely to be dead, and there's no way to keep the situation as it is.<br>
<br>
A better idea might be that of the Homonoculous.  Effect is that the wizard splits his mind in 2 or more parts, each capable of simultainously casting.  Game effect is that gem refresh is instant, and 2 casting timers are allowed, so you click Ice Comet, then click it again right away, 6.5 seconds later 2 IC hit the mob.  This would seem to have more of the effect your looking for.  Also handy if it's a targetable buff, imagine giving it to clerics who could CH and reserve the Homonoculous for the fast heal before CH lands...<br>
<br>
And thanks, Oaklenia.  I like Bloodbond too, though it might get a bit out of hand unless you be sure to make it target PC's only, as redirecting the mobs damage back on itself is just plain mean...  I was thinking top end 60+ version of this might go as high as 85% damage redirected, though I'd be happy if it was just 25% if it was available.  Casters in PoP are meat unless the mob misses as things stand, I don't have the HP+skin+buffs usually to survive a single round of PON creatures. <p><br>

<br>
Let me add some constructive criticism to this post.  All of these ideas are imaginative, but none of them address the real issue of what makes a class unique.<br>
<br>
First of all, I think it goes without saying that many caster classes are well balanced right now with their hybrid counterparts.  Druids, Shaman, Clerics and Enchanters, wouldn't change a thing.  I think they are fitting perfectly in to what they are doing.<br>
<br>
Mages and Necromancers have to be nerfed.  There isn't any two ways about it.  When you can nuke nearly as well as a Wizard, and have a pet on top of that, and a heal/rez AND FD or summon mana rods, ID devices, etc. etc.?  I think the nerf bat will swing hard on these classes really soon (before the next expansion), they are WAY out of balance (in my opinion and from someone who plays both of these classes).<br>
<br>
That leaves us, Wizards.  And I think that we are almost there.  The Manaburn thing was a bunch of crap that won't ever be fixed now to be what it should (a span of time between casts of manaburn would have been sufficient, but they did that and much more).  Your need to port taken away by Luclin, PoK.  Nerfed nukes.  Huge resist tables on mobs targeted specifically toward reducing wizard damage, an epic with massive aggro...etc. etc. the list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
BUT, there is hope in wizards yet.  And no kind of silly &quot;I am gonna translocate myself 10 seconds into the future&quot; is going to do it, or any other kind of toy spell.  What we need is more bane spells, like their melee-counterparts.  When you have Porlo's Fury, Hsgara's Wrath...great spells, need more of them.<br>
<br>
Bane of Thule - Which would work on Cazic Thule, Terris Thule.<br>
<br>
etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
And some questing that goes along with them, and not running your ass off killing stupid mobs, or finding inane places.  I am talking about things you should be doing in the normal course of your day to get those spells.<br>
<br>
Want Bane of Thule?  Collect pieces from Fear and Nightmares...if you can't collect the pieces, you probably shouldn't be killing the end mob anyway.<br>
<br>
Some other options for high end fire nukes like Sunstrike and Strike of Solusek that most people never see.  Or, have Sunstrike drop from more mobs.  <br>
<br>
I would love to see Wizards have their damage be seen by other members of the party, seperate from crits.  My favorite line someone said to me the other day &quot;I like playing my wizard.  I go AFK for an hour and nobody notices&quot;<br>
<br>
A direct target snare, instead of an AoE snare.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is let's look at what's wrong before we start piling on the silly toy spells and such.<br>

You may think so, but I suggest asking those classes what they think about the subject.  Druids lack distiction, Shaman buffs are not so usefull, Clerics need more depth, Enchanters want reimbursed for key abilities that have been hit with nerfbats, Rangers still tank like wet tissue and archery has issues, Beastlords still arent finished, Paladins are not Cleric-lite, Bards get broken weekly and their powercurve is much flatter than everyone elses.  All this may or may not be true, but that's some of what they seem to think.  Regardless, the topic was new ideas, so current issues are a secondary consideration, except where a new idea can patch a current hole.<br>

<br>
Not only is calling for nerfs to others extremly poor taste, most of this information is misrepresented or just plain wrong.<br>
<br>
Mages nuke near as well as wizards, and have a pet.  They also summon the foci and Mana rods--which are perhaps about as useful as harvest.  They lack any way to lower their aggro, Manaskin spells, even rudimentary crowd control.  They have their weaknesses, though their spell line up is indeed sweet.<br>
<br>
Necromancers have nukes... but they are not near as good as a wizards.  They have FD and a Pet, and thier dots do lovely sustained damage.  Heal comes out of their own hitpoints, and is HOT only unless you want them to use a spell that not only costs more mana that greater heal, but also heals less and still takes hp. Thier rez is at the expense of someone else's unrezzed death, and only exists at the 55+ part of the game.  They are also one of the arguably most nerfed classes in the game, and much of what people see as them needing nerfed got nerfed years ago but the uninformed don't stop crying.  The nerfbat needs to stay in the locker for a while.<br>
<br>
At this point, Wizard is the prefered topic.  You like the idea of more bane spells.  Personally, I think they are OK.  However, that would not be the only new thing I'd like to see added, as boss mob fights don't happen nearly as often as xp grinding, and indeed, there's a whole 59 levels below where banes come into the picture that can be added to as well.<br>
<br>
So, tell me, What makes the wizard class unique.  Certainly it's not DD's, everyone and their mother gets them.<br>
<br>
I think wizards unique focus is in being master of energy type magics, and translocation.  This is distinct from mages, who are master elementalists, and all others are much more clearly distinct.<br>
<br>
My new suggestions for wizards are:<br>
1.Reverse Damage sheild.--helps grouping, does not help soloing.<br>
2.Near instant mana Regen spell.-- Stops working upon aggro, or standing, refills mana in 30 seconds. Helps downtime, addresses the disparity between mana and healing spells, does not help soloing, helps grouping, helps break up the holy trinity, while not making 'chanters useless.<br>
3. Homenoculous- Just seems like fun, fits burst damage role, certainly something new.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm all for nich quest spells, your bane idea is fine with the quests involved and such, I'd just hate to see it be all a wizard got, with only 60+ wizards getting to see them.  <br>
<br>
The problems exist at all levels, with all classes.  I don't believe there will ever come a point when everyone is perfectly balanced, this is *supposed* to be a dynamic game after all.  But don't get stuck up in the high levels and forget where you came from, and don't get tunnel vision thinking that wizards are the only ones with issues, and finally, don't think that everything new has to be usefull at the endgame or solve some kind of &quot;problem&quot;. <p><br>

And through out the levels, not just at level 60. Just like there are weapons that effect certain creatures, we could have a wide range of spells that effect only certain creatures. And they could be comprable in damage to whatever level they are gotten at.<br>
<br>
I would like a reverse teleportation spell. Instead of teleporting someone way, it teleports them to you. Sort of like a CotH, only it reaches across zones, much like rez's do. Only the person has to already be in your group.<br>
<br>
I would love a single target snare, but don't see that happening. However, a snare/dd would be nice. And in line with stuff we already have, like Entombment. Which is an other spell line they could continue. How about this, a root spell that puts a mob in suspended animation. They can't move, they can't attack. But the side effect is they can't be hurt either. No snares or buffs will land, no damage, the duration is uncertain. It would be great as a back up crowd control. And should have high aggro. By also making the target invunerable to any spells or attacks, it still makes mezzing better, because enchanters can debuff a mob while it's mezzed. But it also is a great crowd control. I don't know how many times I've rooted adds, only for the tank to stand there anyway and get hit by both mobs, even after I shouted move back, i've rooted the add.<br>
<br>
The shadowstep spells need work, Give them an aggro reducing effect after the first one, and people will actually use them. In a group, over nuke, shadowstep and lower your aggro some. There are all the normal risks invovled with shadowstepping. It would even be nice if we got one that we could cast on other group members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gherad>Gherad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 616<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/27/03 5:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spells</span><hr size=1> No way are they going to add drastically new spells to the game at this point.

<br>
Maybe it is in poor taste.  But, I do submit the following:<br>
<br>
When I started my wizard I looked at everything I could get my grubby paws on.  Screenshots, mob info, downloaded every map from EQ atlas, would watch what other guilds were doing to learn, etc.  My wizard has always been my main focus and always will be.<br>
<br>
Really, all I want to do is play, and if that means that I have to solo, although ideally not what I want to do, I will do it.<br>
<br>
I have a Necromancer, Mage, Ranger, Enchanter, Warrior, most of them higher than 52.  And I know that when I sign in with any one of them, I have several options:<br>
<br>
1.  With my Mage and Necromancer I can solo really easily.<br>
2.  With the others within 30 seconds of putting up LFG I get tells for groups.<br>
<br>
With my wizard on the other hand, the character that I love the most, I can either:<br>
<br>
1.  Kite or Solo, hope that I don't have to eat too many deaths (and maybe I am not doing something right).  Hope to not get that one resist that will get me killed.<br>
<br>
2.  Put up LFG and go watch a movie.<br>
<br>
I don't want to get into the symantecs of why this is, it just is.  And I am sure some folks will come on and say that they have no troubles finding people to play with, and I say good for them!  It makes me happy to see some wizard that has an easy time getting a group.<br>
<br>
But,<br>
<br>
Unless there are changes made, the grouping thing is a lesser option, the kiting thing is more difficult than what a Necromancer would have to do to solo.  The fact that there are some really talented wizards at kiting makes it more difficult for those who want to group &quot;Ahh, he can solo, why is he LFG?&quot;<br>
<br>
Which again I say good for them!  I wish I had that talent.<br>
<br>
So my suggestions were merely this. Give wizards some value added abilities for groups and raids.  I ask, would a nightmare bane give you more of a chance to get a group in nightmare if the spell were powerful enough and unresistable?  I think so.<br>
<br>
It's great to make me a master of the elements, but I get resists in PoP on high level malo'ed low ice resist creatures from Ice Spear than should be.  Verant's solution to this was to say &quot;Be in Melee range&quot; but then give me 3800 hitpoints fully buffed on a creature that quads for 1100 with a very low AC and I am one dead wizard.  But the only way I am going to land that spell is to get close...get aggro and die, even after 50% of it's health is gone, or to lose out to a massive AoE that debuffs and strips your epic rune.  I simply can't mitigate that kind of damage well.  At least, a Necromancer can FD.  At least a mage can sick the pet on the mob and have enough time to gate.<br>
<br>
And I have yet to meet one Enchanter who says &quot;Boy, do I have a hard time finding groups!&quot;<br>
<br>
And I am not a fool, I realise that everyone has their issues with their classes, but the question is that of what value do wizards add to grouping situation other than the unseeable direct damage?  In my 3 years of playing, it is rare to meet a person who truly sees this benefit.<br>
<br>
Really, like what was said.  We Evac, Translocate, and do Direct Damage, but I don't want a group simply because I can Evac, that's silly.  I want a group because they can use a massive amount of DPS, and even that in comparison to some other classes is negligable in the eyes of many players.<br>
<br>
And the concussion spells are a joke, level 39 spell that is very difficult to get and is ruined if you are a dark elf trying to get your epic, for example.<br>
<br>
Ancient: Greater Concussion?  Nope, don't think I will ever see that either.<br>
<br>
So, the point of all of this, and in complete relation to this post is to find a way to make wizards at least a bit more attractive to groups than they are...and this is what Verant wants, more grouping (they even come right out and say it with their new patch in test).  <br>
<br>
I ask you, besides the oft unseen direct damage, what do we have to offer.  If a tree falls in the woods, and nobody is there to hear it, does it really make a sound?<br>

<br>
Not sure how that became the solution. Range from the mob has no effect on resists unless the mob is flagged melee range only. Nothing in PoP that I have fought so far has that flag. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I just don't agree that Bane spells would do it.  Getting into raids? Sure, but groups? No.  Besides, look what they did to the first bane spells- 2 peridots to cast it, and it only works on a small handful of named mobs, and they were level 60 when that was the last level of the game. Sad.<br>
<br>
You have a point about people needing to see what we do.  They also need to see us doing it all the time--thus the need for something to eliminate excessive downtime due to mana needs. Do this, and nothing else for wizards might be needed, as we could nuke to our potential in every fight, and be ready for the next in a timely fashion.  This is part of why no one ever 'did' dungeons like they envisioned... 2 or 3 fights and you have to sit for about 10 minutes, which is just about when the respawn hits.  <br>
<br>
To that end, they need to provide Wizards with something that people can see all the time.  Casting a spell that suddenly has them doing +15 cold damage with each hit where they can see it in their own melee box would fulfill that.  Of course, granting some way of getting back mana after a fight would have us not casting that except on bosses in favor of just nukeing the Bejesus out of a mob in the first place.<br>
<br>
Not sure, I've not done a lot of killing in PoP as level 52 may as well be a leper in any of the pop zones I can get too, but Ice seems to blow in general for PoP.  I get almost no resists on Draught of fire, and even Tears of Druzzil does not seem to resist more often in PoP than it does outside, but Ice Comet is fully resisted often despite Malo and Bardsong lowering their Cold resistance--and the bard reported that the Cold chant was resisting fairly often as well.  Like Qaman, I've not seen where range has any effect on resists except on those mobs where they are apparently flagged for it. <p><br>
