I am here today to speak of an ideal, one that permeates all aspects of life and one that forms the actual basis of a wizard's power. Hate.<br>
<br>
Hate is often spoken of in less than glowing terms. It's disparaged, wrongly because of it's negative connotations. Poeple say &quot;it's wrong to hate!&quot; and certainly on the surface, that seems to make sense. Hate must be bad, right? Surely nothing good can come of Hate, right? Please... <br>
<br>
The definition of &quot;good&quot; has become skewed over the centuries by treehugging ninnies, druids mostly, who have aimed that word squarely at everything they hold dear. Tunare is &quot;good&quot;. Nature is &quot;good&quot;. Rubbish. &quot;Good&quot; is simply a subjective term, as is &quot;bad&quot;. It's all dependant on where you're coming from. Notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are just ways of framing the debate to the advantage of the popular.<br>
<br>
Here's reality. Wizards pursue power and knowledge. To that end, things which accomplish our goals are &quot;good&quot;. Things that obstruct us are &quot;bad&quot;. To Hate that which obstructs our goals is a noble thing, for it provides us motivation to surmount these obstacles. Hate gives us the advantage of fury, which in turn enhances our power. Unfortunately, many foolish people attribute this enhancement to Solusek Ro.<br>
<br>
The fact is, Solusek Ro is himself influenced greatly by Hate. When was the last time you visited the Desert of Ro? Does it look like a reasoned solution to the conflict with Tunare? No. It was savage, utterly motivated by Hate, and beautiful. Yes, beautiful. I've watched many sunsets in the Desert of Ro and they are still among the loveliest sights I've ever seen. Definite change for the better. I salute Lord Ro for his decorating skills. /salute<br>
<br>
However, when it comes to issues of power, Innoruuk is clearly the superior deity. Even Solusek Ro calls upon Hatred to perform his wonders. Strike of Solusek, for example, is powerful...but it is nothing but an overpowered match without Hateful intent. Those of you slavishly devoted to the Burning Prince(and I believe strongly that title came from certain other activities concerning Tunare, but we won't get into that here...) are no doubt foaming at the mouth right now, wishing to stake me out for your Inquisition. If you take a moment to think about it, you will see the Inquisition serves our mutual Lord's purposes well, even if you are somewhat fuddled as to whom you actually serve.<br>
<br>
All praise Innoruuk, our lord and creator! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vdou>Vdou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/28/03 2:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> Interesting.<br>

<br>
I am a child of Hate. Hate is a part of my heredity. Yet, I do not need to follow Innoruuk's precepts of destruction and death to attain the power I desire, nor do I need to attend his Church to understand the power of Hate. I have had many conflicts with the Chruch of Innoruuk on this matter, which incidently is why I make the Temple of Solusek Ro my permanent residence.<br>
<br>
What is the nature of power? Hate can motivate you to kill and destroy, but for what purpose? Pure Hatred is as simplistic a creed as you can follow. Furthermore, it is devoid of any redeeming spiritual qualities. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hate can motivate you to kill and destroy, but for what purpose?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What is the purpose of anything, really? It all comes back to that mystical &quot;Why?&quot;. I choose to kill and destroy for my own personal empowerment. As you bear the title of Wizard, you do the same, unless you claim to be First Circle in your studies.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pure Hatred is as simplistic a creed as you can follow. Furthermore, it is devoid of any redeeming spiritual qualities. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Simplistic? Hardly. Say clear, perhaps. Consistant. As for redeeming spiritual qualities, I daresay that depends which charlatan deity you allow to bend your ear this week. Each seems to have their own definitions of virtue and redemption. Most of them expound on ridiculous notions of self sacrifice and pointless servitude. For example, the only reward a servant of Mithaniel Marr can expect is death. They may paint it as &quot;valorous&quot; but the end result is the same...you are dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Innoruuk keeps no allies. That includes his followers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Indeed, quite true. I, however, understand perfectly where I stand with my god. Hailed Solusek Ro in his Tower lately?

Those who follow hate are in the exact same boat as the followers of love:  they sacrifice their One True Goal for a petty set of &quot;morals,&quot; they become so preoccupied with good and evil that they throw aside what should be their only purpose and clog up the void with emotions.

Foolishness! Hate is, in many circumstances, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, as my example of being spiteful to your colleagues shows. Hate those who oppose you, but do bring yourself to hate your fellows.<br>

You're preaching to the converted. Solusek Ro is not averse to hating entities, under any circumstances. He just refuses to allow emotions to get in the way of His search for Power.<br>

You see! FOOLS, the lot of you! You ADMIRE opposition, you LIKE being thwarted? You are nothing but masochists! Opposition is something to be UTTERLY CRUSHED, not to be admired or treated as noble!<br>
<br>
And in some instances fury is a good thing, but in others it is horribly counterproductive. For example, when in the grips of rage, individuals will say things and do things that at a later date they will regret:  for example, spitting on the feet of one's superior after given an unpleasant command may result in death or excommunication, which is far from conducive to power!<br>
<br>

<br>
He experiences hate, and he has strong hatreds, but NEVER, EVER is he motivated by hate. He is motivated by the search for Power, not by lesser emotions. If the search for power involves killing someone He hates, all the better, but never will it be a factor when He makes His Holy Decisions - for to allow emotions to cloud logic is worthy of Erolissi or Innoruuk worshipers, who have the mental capabilities of twelve year old halfling children, and not for mighty wizards or Gods.<br>

<br>
Nay, it was not MOTIVATED by hate! Indeed, the Great Lord hates Tunare and all of her vile followers, but He moved against them because He realized they would be a threat to the balance of the world - and ultimately, to His Own Magnificent Designs. He relished the action of destroying their homeland, He relished the death and destruction of an ecosystem, but He did NOT let emotion to be the deciding factor in His Holy Actions!<br>

<br>
Not so, the Great Lord calls upon Power alone to perform His Holy Wonders, not emotion and other hippy forces! Are you saying that a casual Strike of Solusek at a passing wolf would be in any way less powerful than one by an individual who strongly hates wolves? No, it wouldn't, if anything, the individual motivated solely by hate would be so furious that he would likely botch the spell! Hatred is all well and good, but you must never let it control you - for hatred clouds judgment just as well as love.<br>

Hardly. I said Hatred of obstruction, Hatred of one's enemies is noble, because it provides us motivation to surmount those obstacles. Without enemies and obstacles, you will grow into power without exercising it to the fullest. You will be crippled, mentally and magically. And then someone like me will come along and crush you utterly.<br>

<br>
From a source of reliable information: <br>
**Solusek Ro, Prince of Flame<br>
Before the time of the Combine Empire, Solusek Ro took a dislike to the elves of Takish-Hiz and their verdant forests. In addition to shifting mountains and slowly turning the forested city into a desert, he forged a powerful band of necromancers known as the Burning Dead. These grim warlocks, led by Marnek the Wicked, launched constant attacks upon the druids who were attempting to preserve the forest and the monks who were attempting to preserve the druids.<br>
<br>
In time, Solusek Ro won, although the Burning Dead were scattered before the end. The great elven forest became the Desert of Ro, and Takish-Hiz was buried beneath the sands. The few surviving druids and monks were driven mad by their loss, and still continue their fight against the drybone remnants of the Burning Dead army.**<br>
<br>
Not motivated by Hate? This was the equivalent of unleashing a flamethrower upon an anthill. There was no point to it, no search for power...he Hated those people. Not that I object to it...but please, don't delude yourself.<br>

This is apparently where I'm losing you. In the examples I gave you, the wizards in question lusted for ever greater power. Their mistake was in worshipping Solusek Ro, who does not reward cleverness and ambition, but instead punishes those who seek such avenues to power. PAY ATTENTION YOU CONE HEADED FREAK! Solist and Jiva are brown nosing scum. They achieved their power by sucking up to Solusek Ro. Servants of Innoruuk grow ever stronger and wiser by surviving the treacherous machinations of their underlings and superiors. Solusek Ro, in his weakness, feared their SUCCESS!

Not perfectly...merely carefully. Hatred is not the total recklessness you seem to think it is. True Hate simmers beneath the surface. You speak of generic notions of &quot;gaining power&quot;, but not of your underlying motivations. Power for power's own sake is mere potential, fallow and barren in and of itself. Power for Hate's sake has focus, action, and results. Let me ask you something...are you familiar with Alexander? Power is not an end to itself...it is a means. Without focus, a solid, measurable goal, power withers. It dies. I destroy life with Hate in my heart, and when I've extinguished every unfaithful life on Norrath, I will carry my mission to other worlds, if it pleases Innoruuk.<br>

Of course you don't, and I didn't mean to imply these men weren't stupid. Their choice in deity should bear mute witness to that fact. Innoruuk does respect a good, diabolical plot.

That is a matter of opinion. Others would say Innoruuk poses a far greater, more insidious threat than your penny ante, can't-get-along-without-Daddy's-power god you worship.<br>

Sticks and stones. It seems you plan much the same as my example above with the superior. Tell me...do you plan to seize his power as well after his threat is dealt with? You would do well to watch your back. Others have been harshly punished for such &quot;blasphemous&quot; thoughts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If those gnoll pups are allowed to grow into something more fearsome, their Hatred may indeed be your undoing. The thing you are missing is Hate's role as motivation. Hatred of you can eventually forge a gnoll pup into a powerful leader of his kind, bent on one goal...your death. He can motivate his people, by Hatred, to murder Erudites in massive numbers. The end result of a gnoll pup's Hatred of you could be the absolute destruction of your homeland. This of course won't come to pass because gnolls are notoriously stupid.<br>

<br>
I Hate people. Because I Hate people, I seek out the means to end their lives. I seek ever greater means to end even more lives. The means to that end is often magic. Hate is the motive, not the means. Innoruuk's blessings do, however, augment wizardly power. Anger and Fury do indeed strengthen magic. Several magical items carry this power, but are wrongfully attributed to Solusek Ro.<br>

I'm not pretending. If you can't see Innoruuk's influence among the pages of your own sacred text...well, far be it for me to interfere with your &quot;learning&quot;.

For it is the man who guides the Hate, but the Hate that guides the man.  Even the greatest masters will succumb to its unrelenting power.  You claim that Hate can be mastered and used for one's own gain.  Yet, like all emotions, it too will betray you.  You attempt to subjugate the unconquerable.  It will lead to your demise.<br>
<br>
The followers of Solusek Ro, however, know their place.  We seek power.  We gather power.  But we do not attempt to manipulate it.  We do not try to lord over it.  For the power we find is power given to us from the Burning Prince.  We submit ourselves to the power and to his will.  And through that, we are rewarded.  Instead of attempting to control the uncontrolable, we gather it around us and let it use us.  We are but mere vessels for the power and glory of Solusek Ro.  It is not up to us to decide how to use it.<br>
<br>
You attempt to control the power that your emotions give you.  And it is there that you are folly.<br>

Control, no. Harness, channel...yes.<br>

As for the rest...if you truly derive your powers from Solusek Ro...take off your robes and put on leather armor, for you are no better truly than a druid. Break your ties with Solusek Ro and seek out power that is yours and yours alone...and not bound to the will of another. Until it is so, you are little better than a slave on a leash. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eaminwhitefalcon@graffeswizardcompilation>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br>  Posts: 6369<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/29/03 10:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

And so, we see your heart! This is where we differ. A follower of the Great Lord believes that Power is the means and the end, the alpha and the omega, it encompasses the entire goal and not simply the last stage. By gaining power, one can gain more power, and more, and more, in a never-ending process. All other goals, be they the destruction of enemies, the saving of loved ones, or the gaining of knowledge, are mere distractions on the road to absolute Power, they are fools' gold in the mine, sent to cause the true Wizard's mind to wander from what should be his only goal.<br>
<br>
You worship a god of distraction and tricks, the nymph in the woods, who lures the warrior away from the maiden he is to save. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whizbangdustyboots>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Arcanist<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br>  Posts: 12244<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/30/03 1:49 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> Power is a tool to an end.<br>
