<br>
But really, it comes down to the definition of power.  What is power?<br>
<br>
I'm sure you all must agree on the importance of knowledge, however.  All wizards pursue knowledge as a means to power.  Some understand that power is a means to knowledge.  Knowledge is power, and power is knowledge.<br>
<br>
This is where both dogmas fail.<br>
<br>
The followers of Innoruuk will readily admit to oppressing truth and propigating falsehoods, destroying knowledge, when it serves their rhetoric of hate.  Thus Innoruuk stifles the power that presumably would promote his hate.<br>
<br>
And Solusek Ro clearly has no regard for knowledge.  There is some evidence, and reasonable conjecture, that Takish-Hiz had an excellent library.  Whether Solusek's destruction of Takish-Hiz was calculated or a hissy-fit is immaterial, the result was the destruction and loss of all that valuable knowledge.  Is that a proper course of action for one who espouses power?<br>
<br>
Enslaving oneself to these &quot;gods&quot;, or any of the others, is to place blinders on oneself.  I prefer to see.<br>

<br>
And furthermore:  the Great Lord had no need of the knowledge secreted away in the old Elven empire. If it was destroyed it would not have had any effect on His Holy Plans - it was old news. He knew it all. It was useless to Him.<br>
<br>
Also, you base your entire argument on the foolish premise that knowledge necessarily equates power. It does not. In many instances acquiring knowledge will enable one to gain power - but acquiring knowledge is but a means to the end, the end being power (power itself is also a means to gaining itself, as you will remember). Knowledge means nothing independent of power. THAT is the philosophy of Ro, and that is the philosophy of wizardry! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eedelia01>Eedelia01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/03 12:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> &lt;grins with a hint of antaginization&gt;<br>
<br>
But what about Karana's followers? They are able to perform the same sorts of arcane feats and yet he does not follow the path of neither Innoruk or Solusek Ro! I believe that your 'power in hate' theology is highly mistaken.<br>
<br>
Karana's followers believe in the raw power of storms. Does not the storm call forth the ice which covers the hills of halas? Does not the lightning spring forth fire whence struck upon a brush?<br>
<br>
The power from which we draw comes from the elements that surroudn us. As you'll remember, even the 4 most powerful wizards of their day, trained by Solusek himself no less, fell because they were blinded by their power. If Solusek did in fact teach his followers to reach out with thier hate to summon forth the Power, then he was ultimatly the undoing of his prided students. Fury may fuel our magic but as The 2nd wizard learned when challanging Saither, he let his Fury blind him to his opponents power. It cost him his life.<br>
<br>
I have no use for hate in my magic, it is counterproductive, and Innoruk no doubt knows this. Of course, if he hates all of his followers, why would he not tempt them to give into a force which would ultimatly be their undoing? Solusek may have noticed that Hate would spur the power of magic onward as Innoruk has done but as he was forced to strip the magic from his 4 greatest followers, I am sure he learned the true nature of what the Lord of Hate has been planning.<br>
Long ago he set his evil plan in motion, letting his followers call upon the powers of Hate, knowing that in the end, they would also perish. <br>
<br>
I am part of the few, the proud, the followers of Karana. I cannot use things which would require homage to Solusek Ro, but i have lived without them and quite happily let me assure you. I believe in the power of storms and the wisdom that Karana provides through his teachings, untainted by Hate and unfocused, untrained Fury.<br>

<br>
Speculation. I've made an extensive study of the Desert of Ro, and I will tell you conclusively that the assault on Takish`Hiz was meant to utterly consume the entire civilization, particularly the monastic, druidic and arcane orders. <br>
<br>
What means did Solusek Ro use? Necromancers and the undead composed the main assault force and was expressly intended to drive mad those that weren't killed. I think someone knew something about the Flaming One(any and all interpretations of this term are accurate) and his plans...something that he either needed to hide out of Fear or destroy because of Hate. In either case, your Prince of Fire is a puppet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Knowledge means nothing independent of power. THAT is the philosophy of Ro, and that is the philosophy of wizardry! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Knowledge is an end. Destruction is an end. Power is a means and ONLY a means. Power without motivation, will and purpose is empty and meaningless. Power is the means by which we acquire knowledge, and that knowledge lends greater power to acquire yet more knowledge.  Of course, you should be careful of what knowledge you acquire...Solusek Ro only likes knowledge that's safe to him. Learn the wrong things and your god will destroy you as he has so many others.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually, it was Solusek Ro's punishment of said wizard by stripping him of his power that cost him his life. Plainly there is one set of rules for Solusek(ones that use Hatred as Power) and another set for his followers(Hate is bad, mmkay?). I have personally seen wizards strike blows that would utterly destroy Venril Sathir. Solusek Ro's vindictive act of betrayal is what killed that wizard, and that is because the power Solusek's wizards use IS NOT THEIR OWN. It belongs to him. Seriously, look into a deity who isn't such a micromanager.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
To the best of my knowledge, the four wizards that Solusek stripped were not followers nor users of Hate. I contend, in fact, that if they were practitioners of Hate, their power would have come from deep within themselves from an infinitely replenishable source, in which case Solusek Ro would have had no ability to strip their power. Innoruuk's sole contribution to a wizard is the powerful focus that real Hate represents. He does not hold control over our power.<br>

Erm...what exactly IS a storm if not unfocused fury? Storms strike and destroy at random. The application of Hate gives fury a purpose. On this, as on one other point, Eamin is correct...Karana is indeed a druid god. The other point you may ask? <br>

Most of you are already applying these ideas to your everyday lives. I hope to convince at least a few fence sitters to take that plunge and embrace the Lord of Hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cold Hatred</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It is not necessary to burn with emotion to invoke Hatred. In the heat on the moment, mistakes can be made easily, and so it is best to avoid passionate encounters. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The principle of Cold Hatred teaches us that Hate is best used in a combat setting as a channel for magic rather than as expressed emotionalism.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Hatred is a potent conduit for magical energies but it is vitally important not to lose focus. There will be plenty of time to express your emotions when you're standing on your enemies smoldering corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Knowledge is Victory</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
One of the most important aspects of focused Hate is obsession. Know thine enemy as intimately as possible. Absolutely every living being has weaknesses and strengths, each of which are individually exploitable IF you know the proper methods. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Victory over one's enemies is most consistantly achieved through a careful study of their weaknesses and more careful observation of their strengths.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> These things will better enable you to choose a proper time and venue for confrontation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">A Season for all Things</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This principle of Hatred deals with opportunism. It's actually a corollary of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Knowledge as Victory</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> because it deals with certain knowledge of a moment when an enemy will be particularly vulnerable. The ugly death of a loved one, a specific day or time when a prayer is less likely to be answered, travel through hostile or simply unfamiliar terrain are all open doors for those who know how to exploit them. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fate hands you opportunity, it is your responsibility to judge the risks ands seize it.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Some opponents can only be overcome by taking advantage of transient weakness.<br>
<br>
I leave you with these things to contemplate. Hatred is not all spittle-flecked madness but is a focused approach to life's challenges when applied properly.<br>

<br>
First of all, the sexual orientations of the gods are totally irreleveant. Even if Solusek Ro were gay, as you and many others have implied, he would still retain the power to destroy all of Norrath. And as well he should, I am beginning to tire of the current gene pool of Norrath's denizens.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Of course, you should be careful of what knowledge you acquire...Solusek Ro only likes knowledge that's safe to him.

<br>
Destroy us (his followers)? Truth be told, I would gladly give my life to futher the cause of The Burning Prince. I know that when I die I will ascend to the Plane of Fire as an avatar of Solusek's desiring. This is a far better fate than any I could possibly hold while I occupy the Prime Material Plane.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the whole purpose of Solusek is power and the destruction of our enemies. Destruction of myself is part and parcel of this dogma.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Innoruuk's sole contribution to a wizard [is] the powerful focus that real Hate represents. He does not hold control over our power.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hate is an emotion. It is very basic, and very simplistic. Do I hate? Yes. Do I let my Hate consume me? No. Does my hatred for various species or dogmas force me to do things that I would otherwise not do? Not in the least bit. <br>
<br>
I am a child of hate. The blood of hate runs through my veins, this is something I have had to accept over my life. I was cast out of the Church of Innoruuk long ago, and I was taken in by the Temple of Solusek Ro. There is a great difference in practice and not so much in philosophy between the followers of Innoruuk and Solusek Ro.<br>
<br>
Yes hate can afford you great power, but at what price? If you cannot love another and your hate is all consuming, I cannot see having much depth to your soul.<br>
<br>
And I know what you would reply with. Power is all consuming, and it is. Yet the dogma of Solusek Ro allows his followers to make choices and alliances with others that Innoruuk would find reprehensible. Not to mention the torture one would endure within the walls of the Church.<br>
<br>
Hate may focus you somewhat, but it blinds you to other opportunities that might present themselves.<br>
<br>
I cannot see any more usefullness in following hate as I see in folllowing neutrality.<br>
<br>
While many consider Solusek a &quot;neutral&quot; god, make no mistake that Ro does not sit around like some spineless druid trying to make decisions all day.<br>
<br>
Followers of neutrality cannot make decisions for themselves, they have no dogma and no opinions. Hate can only do one better. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/~dking3/Vdou_sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
I am also a child of Hate, not by blood, but by choice. The Church proper rejects me utterly. I am a lone agent, with very quiet connections. In my youth I also was &quot;taken in&quot; by the Temple of Solusek Ro. I was deliberately set upon a path that would unquestionably have resulted in my death if not for blind luck. I met a young cleric(now a High Priest, no less) who saved my life and showed me the power that Innoruuk offers. At first, I rejected Innoruuk.

Somewhere along the line though...I began really looking at the facts.<br>
<br>
Yes, there is a difference in practice between Solusek and Innoruuk. Solusek will see the world taken to ash, everything gone. He cannot be permitted to succeed. Innoruuk will spread Hate to every heart that beats. He has, arguably, already succeeded. As for alliances, I am not instructed who to associate with.

I pay whatever price my power requires of me, as do you, as does every other wizard. As for my abilities to love another, that was not utterly eradicated when I embraced Hate.

Solusek Ro is not &quot;neutral&quot;.

I make no mistakes about SolRo's agenda or his ability to make decisions. By his actions, he has embraced Hate already or at least given it a firm, manly handshake.<br>

I assert that the undead and necromancers exclusive purpose was terror. Not only did they erode the elves morale, it shattered it, along with the sanity of tens of thousands of people. It worked as intended. Yes, climatic change eventually transformed the area into the now-familiar desert, but much of that is due to the fact that the Burning Dead annihilated the surrounding forest. As to the disposition of the Library...I've studied in Felwithe, in Erudin, in Neriak, in Shadowhaven, in Katta Castellum, in Sanctus Seru, in the Plane of Knowledge, and in countless other cities. I have visited all the great Libraries and I have visited an unfathomable number of pisspoor backwater puptents full of old books. Nowhere is there even a shred of evidence to suggest that any of the knowledge of Takish`Hiz escaped the apocalypse.

For example, how could I gain knowledge if I did not have the power to get up off my back and read an ancient tome? The chicken and the egg are matters of idle speculation, and nothing more. What matters is the end result:  power. Seeking knowledge without gaining power is a fool's errand - otherwise, would you not be satisfied simply learning to fish?

Of course, Solusek Ro just grants you your power, right? No need for you to &quot;waste time&quot; learning to be independant of the King of Candles, eh? It's all a sham. You aren't gathering power for you...you're gathering it for him...and he can strip you of it at any time of his choosing. Weak.<br>

So, we see the underlying jealousy of the Innorites, jealousy that spurs them to create conspiracy theories to justify their faith in an impotent and useless ideal.<br>

If a fire beetle approached you and began to attack you, would you simply sit there and let it? Or would you slay it promptly?<br>

Any opposition, no matter if it is a real threat or not, must be crushed.<br>

Applying your &quot;objective&quot; standard, Solusek Ro is evil.<br>

<br>
No, because to slay hundreds of thousands of beings wasn't his ultimate goal. It was simply a means to achieve his end - which was to curtail the influence of Tunare, and thus increase his own power. If his goal was to slay hundreds of thousands, he would be evil. But that wasn't his goal, his goal was to gain power - and just because you don't give a shit about what happens to hundreds of thousands of beings doesn't mean you fall on the evil end of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
It is intent that judges good or evil, not results. Innoruuk would have killed these elves simply out of malice. Solusek Ro killed them only to further his own ends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khaymus>Khaymus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/25/03 11:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sermon</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your priorities are out of whack.<br>

Ok. But as a great number of druids ARE Halflings, wiping them out would reduce druid numbers by a LOT. First Rivervale, then Surefall.<br>

<br>
Tempting fate is what we do. Sometimes you get the bear, sometimes the bear gets you. Then you leave the newbie yard, return later with far greater power and get the bear over and over. And sell his pelts. My point being that death is always with us, whether we are dealing it or being subsumed by it. Hatred is a potent fuel in the blood, driving one past mere survival to total victory. Death has no permanent hold on those who Hate. Ask Mayong Mistmoore about that.<br>
<br>
Since you don't already fish, I would suggest not bothering with it. It's boring. Destroying and usurping our enemies is the primary source of entertainment for a wizard for a reason and nothing adds flavor to the victory like Hatred. I savor the expression on the face of the defeated. The look in a Marr paladin's eyes when his faith cracks like a dry, brittle nutshell...the cringe of the druid being consumed by the fires of the sun...the slowly clouding eyes of the dragon whose millenia long existance just ended by magic his enemies taught me. None of these means anything in a cold, dispassionate murder. Only in Hatred can you truly appreciate the subtleties.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fear is a tool for the weak and stupid.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nonsense. Fear as a psychological tool is quite powerful...it can result in your opponent defeating himself if applied properly. Really, ease up on embracing the dogmas of lesser religions.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Spread Hatred? Amusing. How short-sighted and easy a task to accomplish! It is almost pittiful, a task for a young apprentice of the Dead for sure!<br>

<br>
True, if by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spread Hatred</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you only see the little hatreds. Wizards hate druids. Little Timmy hates brussel sprouts. My mission is far greater in scope. I aim to see a second Hole in Misty Thicket. I desire a Jappedpine canyon. By my designs, Kelethin will crash from the treetops and Kaladim will swallow the dwarves. Velious will melt and wash away Coldain, Giant and Dragon alike. Kunark will sink under the waves. These are Great Changes, wrought by the True Power of Hatred, not some pissant abstract goal of &quot;power&quot;. It will happen and my hand shall be among many that guide it. I have personally foreseen the sinking of Kunark and so that is where my current efforts are focused. Can you say anything of the sort in terms of your life? Oh, I forgot...Solusek Ro wizards just go through life with &quot;Ur gona give me pwr, plz&quot;, eh?<br>
