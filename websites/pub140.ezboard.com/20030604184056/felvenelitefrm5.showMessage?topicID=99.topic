<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The City of High Elves – Felwithe</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Travelers’ Inn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The High Priest of Tunare Jeez met the proprietors of the Traveler’s Inn with a generous smile and a nod of his head. His good mood was expressed in his shining, green eyes; the rosy glow in his fair skin; and the spring in his every step. It was in his voice as he paused to chat the inn’s proprietors and a the guests that happened to wander past, making pleasant small-talk before offering them his goddess’ blessings and moving on in the same fashion he had greeted them.<br>
<br>
Jeez quickly ascended the carpeted staircase and walked casually down a short hall. The inn was a quaint affair, by Koada’Dall standards. Not so grand that it was impersonal, and not so small that it seemed haunted by quiet. It was intimate with the understated elegance that served his personal tastes. His fondness for the establishment made him one its favored patrons. Hardly a day passed that one of its many rooms was not occupied by one of the cleric’s visiting friends.<br>
<br>
His current thought was on one such friend as he came upon the door to the inn’s finest room. He rapped lightly on the door.<br>
<br>
“Come in.”<br>
<br>
Her voice fell over his ears with the softness of feathers, though Jeez could hear an unaccustomed edge in its tone even now. He opened the door and gracefully stepped inside.<br>
<br>
She stood behind a dressing screen that was decorated with a scene of cherry tree in full blossom and the rain of its soft pink petals. The thin fabric upon which the work was rendered caught the room’s light and the guest’s shadow. Jeez eyed the curves of her silhouette and the grace in its motion as if hypnotized.<br>
<br>
“You were too kind, Jeez, to go through all the trouble of arranging this room on such short notice.” She said from behind the screen.<br>
<br>
“Nonsense. I would do anything in my power...”<br>
<br>
His words died away as Candra stepped into view. She wore an elegant, black gown he’d never seen before, with matching gloves that rose just below her elbows. Not overly formal, Jeez thought. He reasoned that she needed only finely crafted simplicity to compliment a radiant beauty that would outshine any accoutrements.<br>
<br>
“My goddess, you are ravishing,” he found himself saying. Candra smiled demurely with a subtle batting of eyelashes. Jeez basked in the obvious danger of her appeal. Her considerable beauty was both more and less than it seemed: more than mere physical perfection; less than completely candid. Her mystique was the crux of her powers. This Jeez well knew. Yet the stirrings of sentiment that her mere presence aroused in him were intoxicating. Passions moved that he had not felt in...well, ever. He moved closer, like a moth circling an open flame.<br>
<br>
“I doubt I’ll ever be able to repay you for all your kindness.” She said.<br>
<br>
He slipped around her, but then paused. There it was again, that slight tension in he voice that he did not remember from previous encounters.<br>
<br>
“The chance to feast on you in the sight of this dress,” he said, grinning wolfishly. “...is more than payment enough, my love.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>My love</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he repeated in his mind. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>How I indulge myself</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Only because he was attuned to the mysterious strain in Candra’s voice did he notice the muscles of her bare shoulders tense slightly at the word payment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She has debts outstanding that must be paid.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Jeez speculated. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps I can be of assistance? Perhaps I can find a way to bind her to me. But the cleric paused for only a brief moment</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
“I have taken the liberty...” he began as he produced two platinum earrings, intricately engraved. The metal was mundane, but the design was breath-taking. He reached around Candra and placed them in her hand. “Would you do me the honor?”<br>
<br>
She turned a ruddy cheek toward him and smiled as she put them on.<br>
<br>
“And of course...” he continued, presenting her with a matching necklace and locket.<br>
<br>
“Jeez, you flatterer.”<br>
<br>
“I am too smitten with your beauty to offer you anything so disingenuous as flattery.” He lowered the locket over her head. The locket was flattened and bordered on being large. Like her gown, it was elegant in its simplicity of form, yet it bore the markings of the earrings. For many women the locket would have been to much; not so with Candra.<br>
<br>
Jeez lowered it against the hollow of her breasts as he fastened the clasp behind her neck. Candra’s skin radiated warmth. The cleric breathed in her luxurious fragrance. He had neither touched nor laid eyes on the necklace in many years. It had been in his family for centuries, which wasn’t such a long time considering the lifespan of elves. Still, it was a meaningful gift. He had the urge – the desire, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> – to bring it tonight.<br>
<br>
As Candra turned to face him, Jeez breathed the sigh of a cleric who had long contemplated sacrilege and was relieved to have finally given in.<br>
<br>
She placed a slender hand on his cheek, “Jeez, it’s beautiful.”<br>
Jeez felt tears coming to his eyes. He leaned close and kissed her lightly on one cheek and then on the other. His lips burned with her fire.<br>
<br>
It was no coincidence that the inn was almost completely quiet. When Jeez had responded to Candra’s mental summons, he’d found her wrapped in robes that concealed her face and body completely. It was highly uncharacteristic behavior for the enchantress as he knew her. She’d not allowed him to look at her and she’d barely spoken to him. He’d heard the pain in her voice, the fear and when she’s refused to be taken to his home or the Temple of Tunare and implied that she needed a place to hide, he’d arranged this sanctuary for her. He took the liberty of arranging for the rental of most of the inn’s rooms to make sure Candra’s privacy was guaranteed.<br>
<br>
“Just a moment, Jeez, and I’ll be ready to go.” Candra stepped behind the wardrobe again, where she tended to some hidden possession. The slight tension in her voice was the only indication of her previous difficulties.<br>
<br>
Jeez knew Candra made her home in Katta Castelum, but couldn’t imagine what nightmare she’d just arrived from. And now, as he heard the locket click shut, and Candra rejoined him, he refused to broach the subject. He preferred simply to bathe in the nimbus of her glory. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 5/7/03 8:12:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AB8C5B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/7/03 3:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eden444/images/candra_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Possession</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The City of Dark Elves - Neriak</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Third Gate, The L`Ogrim Estate</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Eiluned L'Ogrim stood quietly at the rear of the ritual chamber that currently served as conference hall. For the single, flickering candle that cast a wan light against the cloying, dark heat of the room the dark elf necromancer easily sorted out the forms of the other three bodies that kept her company. Not that she needed any light to assist at all. Like any other Teir`Dal, her eyes were attuned to darkness and her vision easily pierced the deepest shadows.<br>
<br>
An amused look was cast over her indigo expression and her crimson-laced lips bent into a sneer of a grin. The smell of fear in the air always put Eiluned in the best of moods, but when that scent was tinged with a sense of looming death she was ecstatic. It was all she could do to restrain herself from tittering like a young elf after her first kill.<br>
<br>
She stood away from the others. Her role in these dealings was an observer and witness.<br>
<br>
The Tier`Dal necromancer PuppetM stood at the heart of the chamber. The robe that dressed him was a black shell, a simple accessory to the shadows that clung to him like a second skin. He was looking down on two figures kneeling before him, fearful and reverent. The smaller figure was the Tier`Dal shadow knight and the PuppetM's's own son, Myurr. The other was a troll warrior whose simple name pointed out his most intriguing facet, Twocoloreyes. Neither had the courage to look up and face their master's dread gaze. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Very wise</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Eiluned thought. She could see in her husband what so few could, heat and passion. She knew that both qualities had been pushed to their limit and any display of supposed strength from the two before him now would certainly push PuppetM a step beyond it. The outcome of such a thing would be...messy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You failed to capture the enchantress,&quot; PuppetM's voice was a cold thing, lacking in volume but powerful nonetheless. His expression held the same chill, inscrutable save for his blood red gaze. In them Eiluned observed the menace and bloodlust that won her attention first and then her affection later. She loved the monster she knew him to be. Among the body of Teir`Dal necromancers known as &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Dead</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;, he was addressed as Warlock. It was a title earned through blood, sweat and death.<br>
<br>
Myurr did not look up as he addressed his father, &quot;We almost had the mind witch, father, but her tricks...&quot;<br>
<br>
PuppetM cut the other elf off, &quot;You failed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eiluned hissed softly at Myurr, voicing her disapproval. It was the most she'd said so far. Her memory recalled the sight of Candra as she fled for her life. She had been ravaged by PuppetM's craft. The beauty that foolish men fell over themselves for had been peeled away to reveal the ugly thing Eiluned knew her to be; her flesh withered, that shapely form emaciated, and a generous flow of blood running from her thin, diseased lips. Eiluned smiled inwardly as she turned her attentions back to matters at hand.<br>
<br>
The junior of the L`Ogrim males went on, beads of sweat forming on his brow, &quot;We had her to rites, father and would have taken her, but at the last she managed some trick or charm that turned the tables...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You failed me,&quot; PuppetM repeated. &quot;I practically handed her to you, Myurr. She was weak and nearly depleted of her magical energies. You had only to move in for the kill. Instead you've returned to tell me that you and this worthless excuse for a servant that you dare call a warrior have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>failed me</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot;<br>
<br>
A deep silence filled the room, making the already small space seem even more crowded. Eiluned could sense the dark power flowing from elf at the center of the room. Her limited understanding of the Art she shared with her husband could not make sense of the spell he was enacting. Her mind was reeling, her will being tested against the backlash of magic not even directed at her. She feared she could not stand in the face of such power; that she would show her weakness and faint. She braced against that feeling of claustrophobia and made a great effort to remain on her feet.<br>
<br>
Her eyes widened at the display of dark magic evoked at the heart of the room. Tendrils of thick shadows rose from the floor to ensnare Myurr and Twocoloreyes. She could make out the sounds of their armor being crushed, the slow crush of bones and their choked cries of pain and protest as the tendrils slithered tightly around their throats. Eiluned's own voice was lost to the awe of that display.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it about you and failure, Myurr?&quot; PuppetM asked. It was a rhetorical question, of course. The warlock breathed a tried sigh as he walked a slow circle around the gasping, snapping, struggling duo. &quot;How is it that the enchantress managed to escape you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Myurr struggled with a reply. PuppetM acknowledged his son's effort with a subtle, dismissive gesture. With that the darkness retreated and dissipated. The troll landed to the floor in a wet, bleeding heap. Myurr landed on him and slowly rolled to the floor.<br>
<br>
Eiluned grinned as she watched the two struggle with their pain, gasping for breath and then choking on it. The troll vomited violently, blood bile and bits of dinner sprayed over the stone floor. Every twitch and spasm seemed to send a fresh, sharper wave of pain through. To his credit, Myurr showed amazing fortitude and managed to stand to his feet, though his ascent was slow and pained.<br>
<br>
PuppetM raised a brow inquiringly, &quot;Well? Out with it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Myurr spoke slowly as he described the pursuit through Nektulos Forest. He detailed a great battle against Candra's summoned protector and of her foiled efforts to open a gate to deliver her to safety. He recounted dismantling the animation and having his hand around her throat when a blow struck him from behind.<br>
<br>
PuppetM's expression soured further, &quot;This...Troll was your undoing?&quot; He darted a threatening look at Twocoloreyes. The warrior took a reflexive step backwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was charmed, father. Her powers were still great despite her injuries. She forced her will on Twocoloreyes, pitting him against me. As I raised my sword in defense...she escaped.&quot;<br>
<br>
Screaming terror seized the troll as PuppetM turned his full attention on him. Despite the fear that gripped him, Twocoloreyes could not run, he could not flee, and he could not raise a hand in his defense. The warlock's look alone held him in place. &quot;Such a weak mind is useless to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
PuppetM's features displayed a scornful look as he spat a curse at his victim. Darkness and disease put an end to the troll's life in the time it took for PuppetM to turn his red gaze back to Myurr. He spoke slowly, taking care to enunciate his words, &quot;Do not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>fail me</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> again.&quot;<br>
<br>
PuppetM dismissed his son with a hard look. The younger elf responded with a display of reverence and humility, dropping to his knees before taking his leave.<br>
<br>
Eiluned allowed a full minute to pass before she peeled herself away from the wall that supported her back and joined her husband at the center of the room. She looked into his eyes and regarded him with an impish grin, &quot;Candra is more powerful than you care to admit. You made a good lesson of the troll, but perhaps you were a little too hard on Myurr.&quot;<br>
<br>
PuppetM stared back into Eiluned's cool, pale eyes, saying nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is this bauble that she has taken from you?&quot; she inquired. Standing face to face with him, Eiluned realized that her husband wasn't looking at her all. His gaze looked through her. She could see the anger and desperation in his eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;She will pay for her treachery.&quot; Without another word PuppetM turned away and left Eiluned alone to ponder the thin line between obsession and possession. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 5/11/03 7:28:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#BA9F70><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Regular</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/13/03 3:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~eden444/images/candra_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Possession</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The City of High Elves - Felwithe<br>
<br>
The Pond</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The oracle Willius strolled casually along the cobblestone streets of Felwithe. It was the start of summer and a pleasant heat tinged the exotic night. Hints of festivity teased the barbarian's senses. Colorful, paper lanterns were strung across the facades of gleaming buildings and between them as well. Delicious aromas and the noise of mirth-inspiring music filled the air he breathed. With such sensation all around him, Willius couldn't help but channel the cheer that filled his spirit through the generous smile that split his handsome face. He allowed scent and sound to guide him through the winding streets and deliver him to the source of the merriment.<br>
<br>
Various faces were gathered along the banks of the city's shimmering pond. The light of the moon and hanging lanterns cast a flattering glow thatenhanced smiles and was partially dismissed a few grim looks. Still some distance outside the gathering of merrymakers, Willius took pause to survey the crowd before melting into it.<br>
<br>
He breathed a long sigh as he considered this body of mostly familiar faces that was the Elven Elite. It was the guild that had been his home until only recently. The Northman's memories came to celebrate with him, recalling the great battles, the hard struggles, and deeply satisfying victories of his tenure with the Elite. It was not an unpleasant moment to remember the good times and the bad. Willius was not a being to regret his past as he knew that it was the sum of his experience that made him the shaman he was today.<br>
<br>
&quot;Willius!&quot; a voice from the crowd interrupted Wilius' reverie. His thoughts returned to the present and his senses scanned the crowd briefly before finding the crier who hailed his arrival.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aryllyian!&quot; He greeted the shining, High Elf paladin with an enthusiastic salute before the two clasped hands, both chuckling at his formal greeting. At Aryllyian's side was the high priestess Irislilly, whom Willius greeted with a toothy grin and a respectful bow.<br>
<br>
Willius chuckled as humor re-shaped the Erudite priestess' smile, &quot;We've been friends too long to stand on airs now, Willius.&quot; She told him before seizing him with a hug as warm as the smile spread across her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;So true, Iris,&quot; he said, heartily accepting her welcome.<br>
<br>
Aryllyian waited for their embrace to break before speaking again, &quot;I'm so glad you could join us tonight as we honor the solstice and each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Willius replied, laughing loudly. &quot;Any reason ta celebrate with stiff drinks and good friends is just fine by me!&quot;<br>
<br>
The attention of the two brought on the notice of the many and Willius soon found himself on the receiving end of a line of welcomes, salutes, handshakes and hugs; and the majority of them sincere. The barbarian was no wallflower and responded with the humor that had won him such a list of friends and a few enemies. And though warmed by their greetings, Willius quickly tired of all the social niceties and found himself wishing the lot of them would just return to whatever distractions were being had before his arrival.<br>
<br>
It was quite a bit of time before his wish was granted. In the end he found himself standing against the wall of some quaint building, his fourth pitcher ale in hand, surrounded by a few laughing faces. His company consisted of the High Elf Spindley and his recent bride Lorrelei, and the Wood Elf lovers Giltaav and Kyeneia.  It was the ranger Giltaav who looked after the smiles that lit their faces with the telling of some recent adventure. Willius was only half-listening however. The bulk of his attention moved through the crowd, observing and searching through the various cliques.<br>
<br>
He considered Seyah, Krushh, Eillail, Sparkes and Laenyal as they conversed near the forge, noted their seemingly pleasant expressions and spent no time musing over the content of their discussion. He glanced a small assembly at the water's edge to find Wood Elf Wyture sandwiched between the contesting, hard looks of the Troll Nanbkek and his rival, the Half Elf Muzzic as a few others looked on with grinning expressions. Willius' thoughts lingered on the threesome at the heart of that group and he couldn't help but speculate on what words or regards were moving between them. He grinned as well.<br>
<br>
An explosion of laughter reigned Willius' attention back to his to the motley of friends before him. A light blush filled his cheeks as he realized the small group had swelled and now included the Vah Shir Nalitra, the High Elf cleric Spiritene and their respective companions, both Barbarians, Lucman and Jaered. Willius shook his head and secretly hoped his distraction was not so obvious.<br>
<br>
Where is she hiding? The question swam through his frustrated mind as he breathed what was meant to be a slight sigh, but sounded out as a hard grunt. More than a few pairs of eyes turned to regard him, the expressions surrounding them amused and curious.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to move around,&quot; Willius grumbled. He peeled away from the wall that supported his back and ignored the giggles of a few knowing souls in the crowd around him.<br>
<br>
Willius walked away from the crowd, away from the pond entirely and wandered further south through the city. It was his hope that a brief walk would calm the growing empty feeling that upset his belly. It was a futile exercise he knew, but he couldn't bear to stand still any more. He was not at all accustomed to waiting games. What little patience he knew was already spent and a knot of frustration had been left in its place.<br>
<br>
He moved briskly through the tunnel that bridged Felwithe proper with its south end only to find the object of his frustrations standing just beyond its egress. The sight of her brought him to an immediate stop. He absently muttered her name, &quot;Candra.&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius peered at the human enchantress before him, looking her up and down. Her long, dark hair was brushed smooth and fell down her back in an elegant line. She wore a black gown that teetered on the razor's edge between style and scandal and contrasted sharply with her creamy complexion. But all this was merely a frame for the twin masterpieces that were her eyes. It seemed to Willius that they caught the wan light and reflected it back a hundred fold; sparkling, mesmerizing violet.<br>
<br>
Willius knew he could lose himself in those eyes. What he didn't realize was that he already had.<br>

<br>
Candra took in the mountain of a man standing before her with an easy smile. His heart was beating faster than it should, making him ruddy and flushed. Beads of sweat wet the red moustache and the muttonchops that added to his barbarian flair and rough edges. She idly wondered if his excited state was the product of the liquor that she smelled on his breath, the thickening heat of the summer night, or the enchantment of adoring grace that always surrounded her. She made a guess that it was a combination of the three.<br>
<br>
Willius seemed satisfyingly surprised by her approach, although shock soon gave way to a wave of hungered emotions Candra took in with the pleasure of a gourmet sampling a new dish. &quot;Willius,&quot; she spoke his name the way he liked to hear it; soft and slow.<br>
<br>
The barbarian shaman responded with a hungry and boring grin of lust. His thoughts, in all likelihood never strayed beyond his most base desires. His only reaction was to shift his stance to shrug off his obvious discomfort. &quot;Good ta see ye again, lass. It's been some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Candra's cherry lips parted in a smile meant to thrill. &quot;It's been only a day since we last spoke, Willius.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A very long day,&quot; Willius replied. He peered about curiously then looked at Candra with a question &quot;And who is yer escort tonight? I doubt ya came alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Doubt? No, but you certainly hope</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The enchantress kept that thought to herself, but did not try to conceal the mischief that brought it to mind. &quot;I arrived on Jeez's arm, but it seems Fayeth has stolen him away from my side to discuss matters of faith and devotion. Having no genuine interest in either quality and feeling the onset of a mild headache I excused myself to take a quiet stroll away from the solstice celebration.&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius grunted his assent. Candra could read the frustration in his expression. It wasn't so long ago that the barbarian standing before her gifted her with a ring and the promise of his eternal, unconditional love. Despite her deep affection and the powerful passion she felt for him, Candra decided against marrying Willius. The two remained good friends still. Since then Candra had become engaged to the High Elf Jeez, though in the span of time leading from that announcement to the present moment that engagement had fallen apart and Jeez was now married to another. Candra kept both rings in a jewelry-box she purchased to hold her impressive collection of such keepsakes.<br>
<br>
Candra's skin prickled as Willius' jade-green gaze moved over her body. She could feel the heat of his regard scanning the curves of her body and the cut of the gown that dressed it. He seemed lost to the sea of creamy flesh immodestly displayed by a daring neckline. &quot;Carryin' on with a married man, Candra? Yer flirtin' with scandal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly,&quot; she laughed softly into the air between them, her eyes rocking slowly against their lids. &quot;We're just two friends enjoying each others' company at a very public affair. There's nothing salacious about the night's arrangements.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you say, enchantress. So you say.&quot; Willius' voice trailed off as if he was lost in thought. Candra couldn't but notice how his gaze lingered on her chest, but it was a few before she realized his attentions were not focused on her womanly attributes, but the locket resting against them.<br>
<br>
Candra flinched noticeably as she fought off the instinct to grasp protectively (or perhaps possessively) at the piece. A sense of growing desperation placed an ache in her belly and she struggled with the feeling for the sake of maintaining her cool, calm façade. There were more subtle ways to distract his attention from her latest acquisition.<br>
<br>
Candra brightened her smile and focused her attention on the larger-than-life Willius. Or, more properly, she focused his attention on her. The blood in her veins grew hot and she pulled his eyes to her. To her flesh, her eyes, her hair. Her voice breezed over his subconscious mind. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Am I not beautiful, Willius?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Willius reacted, certainly. She saw admiration, lust, even fascination, bloom in him. His pupils dilated and his neck produced a few beads of sweat. His hands shook just a bit. He licked his gaping lips to wet them and murmured absently, &quot;Most beautiful...&quot;<br>
<br>
Candra grinned at Willius like a cat with a belly full of mouse. &quot;You should go now, darling.&quot; Her voice was soft and sweet, even gentle. The power that rode it, however, was demanding. That power transformed her enticing request into the charm of command. &quot;You're awfully tired and it's so late. Go to your bed now and sleep. When you wake you'll remember only that you had a grand time in my company before taking your leave. You'll forget about my necklace along with any thoughts regarding its design or nature. Understood?&quot;<br>
<br>
Willius seemed transfixed as he replied, &quot;Yes, mistress. I should go,&quot; he leaned forward to place a kiss on her lips and Candra let him. Though she would never admit it, Candra savored the simple joy of being with him and felt the undercurrent of passion long denied building anew. She allowed the kiss to linger for longer than was prudent, but eventually found the will to break their embrace. She was more than a little surprised when Willius hold of her tightened and held her still.<br>
<br>
The barbarian grinned wolfishly at her, &quot;I said 'I should go', not that I would.&quot; He quickly stole another kiss before the enchantress could react. As her small hands pushed and her womanly shape struggled against his muscular form, Willius found it impossible to hold back the loud, bellowing laughter that had been building inside him since the enchantress' charm had faded. He finally set her free as her futile tantrum only made him laugh harder and his belly was aching from the excitement.<br>
<br>
Candra in turn reacted with an anger that brought brilliant color to her face. &quot;How could you?!&quot; the velvet was slipping away from her voice now and revealing cold iron beneath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy now, 'chantress. Let's not forget just who should be tha one upset here.&quot; Willius was still laughing as he attempted to arrest the situation. &quot;We agreed that ya would keep yer mind tricks to yerself.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was little to argue about and Candra was fully aware of that fact. The embarrassment for her folly and anger for her failure left her feeling warm and flustered. She took a moment to catch her breath before making a feeble attempt to save face. &quot;You kissed me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya let me,&quot; Willius countered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I didn't. It wasn't like that.&quot; An obvious lie, but she remained unwilling to live with knowledge of that truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;And ya liked it, I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Arrogant bastard!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Candra was losing ground with this argument and she knew it. She'd lost the upper hand and with that control of the situation. She needed time to think and that was the one thing Willius was not willing to give her. With a sigh she turned about and cast her gaze towards the heavens to take in the velvety night sky, the diamonds that twinkled against it and the silver sorcery of the full moon.<br>
<br>
Willius laid a hand on her bare shoulder and she shivered. His hand was rough, but still impossibly gentle. “Tha spirits grow restless in yer wake, Candra.” He turned her about to see her face, search her eyes. “They murmur of dark deeds and even darker sorcery. Tell me, lass, what have ye done?”<br>
<br>
Candra was barely aware of her arms folded over her chest or the tension that was moving through her body. She was uncomfortable under the scrutiny of the shaman’s powerful gaze. His Craft was something she could not fathom, born from a realm she could not access and entities she could neither charm nor control. Talk of spirits made her nervous. “I don’t have time for this prattle, Willius.” She started to leave, but Willius’ grip on her shoulder held her fast and forced her to look at him.<br>
<br>
“Yer a fool if ya think yer alone, Candra. The spirits surround ye, slumbering in yer home, nestling in yer clothes, kissing you through that comb in yer hair. They’re everywhere. Ye can’t see them, but I can. I can hear their cries,” his green eyes darted to the locket resting against her breasts then returned to her eyes, “I can feel their pain.”<br>
<br>
“Enough!” Candra clutched the locket against her chest and shrugged off the barbarian’s touch. “You don’t scare me with all this talk of nonsense, Willius.”<br>
<br>
Intense color crept into the rough edges of Willius' countenance, his ears and cheeks and neck. Candra could feel the heat radiating from his mountainous body. Still he showed remarkable restraint when he spoke. “Yer no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mystery</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ta me, Candra. I see ya for what ya are. Ambitious, lying, conniving. I’ve never once complained, never once thought ta interfere with your schemes, or to turn ya from these strange ways. But there comes a time...”<br>
<br>
Candra had heard enough. Her ego, her fear, her guilt and greed – none could bear the burden of shame that Willius was attempting to evoke. It took only a moment for the enchantress to connect with thoughts, the fiery passion that drove him and snuff it out like some candle whose light was no longer needed. He stood before her, mesmerized and impotent. A slick of drool ran from the corner of his mouth.<br>
<br>
“Remember nothing, Willius.” She commanded and he had no choice but to obey. The barbarian blinked as his memories fled and the enchantress along with them. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=candraverbena>Candra Verbena</A> at: 5/21/03 7:52:10 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=99.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=99.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.elvenelite.com/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=99.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.threadControl?topicID=99.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=99.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=99.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="elvenelitefrm6">Membership Applications<option value="elvenelitefrm4">Open- Events, Quests, and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm3">/OOC<option value="elvenelitefrm5">/Roleplay<option value="elvenelitefrm32">Guild Policy<option value="elvenelitefrm31">Allies<option value="elvenelitefrm2">/GuildSay<option value="elvenelitefrm20">Events and Raids<option value="elvenelitefrm35">Tactics<option value="elvenelitefrm33">Epic Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm21">Quests<option value="elvenelitefrm23">Kelethin Square<option value="elvenelitefrm9">Trade Skills<option value="elvenelitefrm37">Raves<option value="elvenelitefrm28">Problems and Issues<option value="elvenelitefrm26">Application/Recruiting Board<option value="elvenelitefrm19">Raid Leaders<option value="elvenelitefrm1">/GuildLeaders<option value="elvenelitefrm34">Archive<option value="elvenelitefrm7">Test Here</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#F5F5DC>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/belvenelite>Elven Elite</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/felvenelitefrm5>/Roleplay</a> <font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><a href="http://www.elvenelite.com">Elven Elite Home Page</a><font color=#F5F5DC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
