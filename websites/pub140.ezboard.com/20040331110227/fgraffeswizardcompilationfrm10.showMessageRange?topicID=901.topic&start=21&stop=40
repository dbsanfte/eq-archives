In other games I have played, fixes like this just lead to both the bard and the zone being fixed making the zone fix redundant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There has been much precident for nerfing an entire zone because of a single class ability in the past... don't think it won't happen again.  The way the new pathing works, and the way the Bards work, it's only able to work in that zone. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I dont agree with his extreme opinion that we are broken, I do agree that wizards are one of the least favorite group members of the bunch.

Heh, do you think people actually do /who LFG all?  No, they don't.  If you're not actively looking for a group you most likely won't find one... period.  I've never been in a single group where we've done a /who LFG all to find a group member, we always wait until people either ask us to join or until we see them in shout.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One simple question. Why didn't they just nerf whatever song bards were using to do that, if that was their intent?<br>
Clearly, their intent is to nerf overall soloing, since the change they made affects all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Like I said, if you don't understand the situation you probably shouldn't comment on it.  Did you look into how they did the kiting?  It would involve nerfing around 6 spells and 2 AA abilities.  Nerfing a series of spells because a few members of a class can do something obviously very overpowered as opposed to nerfing the zone would cause many, many more problems than it would solve.  Their only choice in this situation was to nerf a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>single zone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  <br>
<br>
Think of it another way.  Hypothetical situation; a few Wizards are using various quad kiting spells to somehow kill 30 mobs in 25 minutes gaining 6 AA per pull in Plane of Time... SoE sees this and says &quot;hey now, that's bad!&quot;  After looking over it they apply a patch that nerfs Atol's and every quad spell 51+ instead of PoTime soloing, would that be OK with you?  That's basically what you want done for Bards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Another point.. since this change does render this, and any other similarly nerfed areas useless for soloing, it puts even more people into the other areas, like PoS..

We can't afford to lose ANY places that you can fight in without the holy trinity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

They do not need to do a /who all LFG my friend.  The new LFG tool makes it very easy to /tell PrimeGroupingClass several zones away to join you where they are, especially in PoP where an exp group is 2 zones away for those classes in high demand.  I have done it myself when the slower logs and we need a replacement.  Last night I got a group from a Wizard logging for the night and when our slower logged I prodded the group to add a 65 Wizard instead of a slower (none in zone and I figured our DPS was sufficient to kill mobs w/o a slower).  I go a resounding /no_dice.<br>

I would not care if they made every quad spell stop working in PoP (except snare) if they made the wizard a sought after commodity in PoP.  I hate it when people use quad kiting as a reason that Wizards do not need any attention for grouping.  I prefer a group over soloing.<br>

<br>
There are places to solo, they are becoming more crowded.  I have made groups before, sometimes it works.  The making of a group depends on the key classes.  When the enchanter/cleric/shaman can walk in the zone and get a group inside of 10 mins, it is harder to keep them around while you find the other classes you need to round out the group and find a camp to everyone's liking.  It is frustrating to get half the group formed only to have the key classes /disband because they got a /tell across zone for group already formed or were tired of waiting.  Yes, this has happened to me several times.<br>

And they usually can get it.<br>
<br>
Again, can't speak for your server, but on mine, the good XP camps are pretty much perma-camped. You can't just walk into PoD for example, and expect the castle to be open. This applies to solo spots, too..  As I said in a previous post, even at 6 o'clock in the freaking morning(est), PoS froggies, PoV Outer Caves and the spots in HoH can be expected to be taken.<br>
<br>
I have also started putting a grp together, with limited success.  On  two seperate occasions I've gotten 3-4 people together, and had the other people vote me out of the grp in favor of A member_of_holy_trinity00. &quot;Sorry, man, but we need (insert class name to get killing).<br>
<br>
I realize that the perspective of a level 65 Wizard with well above average gear, flags, AA points, a full spell book, playing time and guild connections is going to be different from that of the average Wizard because of the many added opportunities the aformentioned attributes give you. More than a few times, I've had uber_equipped_wizard00 suggest one thing or another in these discussions, but that suggestion is not valid unless you have that level of gear. The size of Mana pool, access to FT items, AA points and all your high level spells are the first to come to mind. Before you suggest something, try thinking to yourself &quot;Could I do this suggestion myself if I didn't have these advantages?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myztic>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Born-Again Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 900<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/03 8:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amen Gwideon</span><hr size=1> Annoid, I'm not sure if you believe me, but I'll say it anyway. When I created Myztic, it didn't pop out to Greater Faydark with guild, 65th level, full spell book, flags and FT items. In fact, 51st level didn't exist, plane of fear didn't exist, full spellbook was not even spoiled on sites yet, flags didn't exist and sure as hell, FT items didn't exist.<br>
<br>
So while I post from current sorta uber viewpoint, I wasn't always there. In summer of 2002, I was 55th level with no AA, no FT, no focus items, no epic, no full spellbook for 55th, no flags. Surprising what one can do in 6 months, isn't it... especially with about 4h playing per day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I seriously don't believe, this. You put together a group and then they vote you out? After reading everything else you've posted about wizards being broken, all the whinning you've done, how you have shot down suggestion after suggestion, this seems like a fabrication to try and &quot;prove&quot; your point, because you just can't accept the fact that most people didn't jump on your &quot;woe is me&quot; wagon.<br>
<br>
When it was suggested in a different thread that you start your own groups, your response was to the effect that you don't have the time to put together groups. Now you say that when you do put together groups, you get voted out. Smells like bullshit.<br>
<br>
The only thing about wizards that are broken is you. Wizards may not be the top choice for an XP grinding group in the planes, but it's a lie that no one wants wizards. <br>
<br>
Guess, what, my normal every day playing group is usually two wizards. And guess what, when one of us isn't around, EVERYONE comments on what a difference it makes in the time it takes to take down a mob. Wizards rock. Simple fact. <br>

Guess what, I'm level 48. I have NO AA abilities. I have one flowing thought item, the earring of the solstice. At 49 I get the next familiar with 1 tick mana regen. With food, i now have an INT of 249. I have extended range 3, improved damage 3, spell haste 2, enhancement haste 2. All of which I earned or bought. <br>
<br>
My wizard is the first toon I every created. And since I didn't know what I was doing, I started him with an INT of 90! Yes, 90!. I didn't know that the amount of mana was based on INT. And I have survived with this all the way up to 48 and flourished. My friends all call me the best wizard they hav ever know. And some of them have been playing for years. Since EQ came out.<br>
<br>
I hardly ever go OOM. As I figure it, I have 2500 mana. And I'm working on getting my INT to 255 without food. I often see a Staff of the Morning Dew for sale in the bazaar (FV server, not much is No Drop). As soon as I save up enough, I'm buying myself one. After that, I'm focusing on DEX and AGI pieces. <br>
<br>
If you want improved damage, get yourself one of those new Robes of Tempest, which are player made. I got one for 20k. Yes, that's right, a level 48 player had 20k to spare. And I still have lots of money in the bank.<br>
<br>
Am I in a guild? You bet! Guess what, it's a guild I STARTED WITH MY BEST FRIEND IN GAME! Since I lead this guild, that means I'm not sitting around waiting for a raid to happen, I'm making them happen. I'm turning into a pretty good raid leader too. <br>
<br>
But see, the bottom line is, I'm working at it. Not complaining and not wanting others to do for me. And I'm not some super level 65 maxxedAA wizard. I'm a level 48 wizard that loves being a wizard! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 6848<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/03 9:58 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Get a clue</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They do not need to do a /who all LFG my friend.

If you want to make your point, never, ever, use that in any of your posts because that is simply put the most retarded, arrogant, misinformed, and self-serving sentence ever.  It's much easier to write people off as having a valid point when you can label them as an &quot;uber&quot; Wizard, isn't it?  Guess what... I have an alt which also happens to be a Wizard.  He's fully untwinked and working his way up as part of my &quot;experiment.&quot;  At the moment he isn't 60, he isn't 55... but he groups and solos.  He has few problems finding a group when he wants one and when he's in a group he performs well.<br>

As I have said in SEVERAL other of your whine posts I was not always &quot;uber.&quot;  I didn't become close to &quot;uber&quot; until around 58 in Kunark and got my Robe of Invocation.  From 1-54 I grouped almost all of the time and solo'd on the side.  From 55-60 I either grouped or AE'd, but I never solo'd.  I didn't get my epic until 60.  My HP and mana pool was significantly less than yours (without a doubt) until late 60.  I didn't even hit 255 INT... wait, make that 200 INT until after I got my epic.  I remember fully what it was like to level as a non-&quot;uber&quot; so please don't try to cop out of providing facts to back your statements by saying that I simply don't get it.  Nothing pisses me off more.<br>

Oh, and for the record, 65 in full Elemental save BP, been here, done this, and I still don't have a complete spell book.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Rombus , VT is a Bitch eh ?<br>
Just got meself a 65ish Wiz &quot;organized&quot; to play with Friends that leveled much faster than me =)<br>
<br>
Guess why ?<br>
I don´t like leveling by sacrificing profund knowledge of my class (and yes that contradicts organizing a 65ish Wiz).<br>
<br>
My Main is Level 55 and was Master upon dinging 55.<br>
I aquired 12 AAs after 52 while i tried to gather ALL my Spells.<br>
<br>
Yes im a Freak , i wont level till i have all known Spells for the respecting Level.<br>
I know i will stay 60 for a looooong time !<br>
BUT i will get my VT key and try to get a Pickup Group / Raid there (don´t laugh , our Uba Guild don´t bother anymore and others don´t even try).<br>
<br>
And i totally agree we are not much wanted in Groups ...<br>
Even in Guild its not easy to find one ...<br>
<br>
But then we CAN go solo OR start a Group !<br>
We just have to do it ourselves.<br>
<br>
If you don´t find a Group ... try to start a Raid =)<br>
Find a suitable Target thats up and there you go =)<br>

They are nerfing us</span><hr size=1> The main problem is that PoP zones are getting packed because Sony has dictated it as the only place to exp post 60. Sure HoH, nerfed our soloing abilities a bit, but that alone didn't make the other solo spots more crowded. It's not only the wizard class that feels the pain of being LFG, it's overpopulation in the 60+ crowd. I was LFG in BoT for maybe an hour last night, guess what, there a few LFG clerics there as well.<br>
<br>
Let's examine the typical soloing choices:<br>
<br>
PoS/PoV - has been and always will be crowded. Tier 2 what would you expect.<br>
<br>
PoI/PoN/PoD - not really a viable solo spot once you level past 63 but crowded nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Tactics - still a good solo spot for those with the flag. Even quadable for those that miss the action of HoH.<br>
<br>
Elemental planes - can't provide insight here as I do not have access there yet.<br>
<br>
EQ is getting old; with the server population being able to level faster than ever, it's no wonder why these zones are jammed during prime times. <p><p><P><p align="center"><strong><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55973"><font color="#00CC00">Sage Quikpick Emberlore</a></font><BR><font color="#999999">Sorceress of Chronology</font></strong><BR><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwideonthegnome>GwideonTheGnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/1/03 3:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You still say Wizards aren't broken?

It is a nice tool, especially when you can click on the name and start sending a message.  I think those that spend more time in pick-up groups are likely to use it than those who primarily build usually from guild members and friends mostly.

In reality I believe that if grouping were more available, fewer Wizards would quad and solo;  as a matter of choice rather than necessity.<br>

Wandor, I know you are trying to stop the whine-play, but quadding or soloing in HoH would be a matter of desparation not ability.  The methods you are alluding to take for granted that you know which mobs summon.  It is Russian-Roulette to pull a quad there now.  If someone else has already picked out non-summoning mobs to solo (read Necro and FD), you could end up with a higher than normal population of summoners in some of the more common solo areas.  This may be what happened to Phaedran, and would explain why there is a disparity in views as to how often a summoning mob spawns.  Anyway, according to another thread this may be a temporary stop gap measure.  Perhaps soloing in HoH will return. <br>

<br>
May as well nerf Bards... their power curve flattens out at 46 or so anyway. Bards have been so severely ignored by SOE that they may as well *already* be considered the most nerfed class in this game. But I digress before even getting started on my post...<br>
<br>
I agree that we as Wizards are not *considered* to be attractive group members to the average (read: clueless) player. However, we can make or break many groups that I can think of... but mostly on raids. For simple exp'ing, we have a problem: we tend, as a class, to PREFER to solo throughout most of our development. Why not..? Pulling quads solo in Cobalt Scar sure beats splitting the measly exp from single pulls with 5 other players. As a result, not many other classes get much experience in grouping with us as *they* likewise develope, either. So they are generally not all that &quot;up&quot; on what we can truly offer to the right groups in the right zones. And yes, that sux0rz.<br>
<br>
I agree (more or less) that SOE has not done much to make us more attractive at the high end to groups. 'Nuff said, since they clearly do not really care whether or not their customers are satisfied. Just their stockholders, hmmz..?<br>
<br>
I have an idea here for exp'ing: start a big write-in campaign, and demand that SOE set up a couple of zones at the high levels, for those who PREFER to solo, to go hunt in. Why not..? Why is forced grouping automatically &quot;the point&quot; of this game..? To further increase revenues for SOE..? Personally, I prefer grouping... but others may not. Fine, then set up an optional area for them to go solo in SAFELY... and WITHOUT pulling occasional, out of control trains all over the other players who just zoned in to the graveyard (like Druids seem to always do to *me* when I pop in to PoN). I see nothing imbalanced or otherwise &quot;wrong&quot; about having optional solo areas in the game for those who can do so. And the exp per kill could be adjusted accordingly to make grouping a still more attractive (but not the ONLY) possibility for leveling, doing AA grinds, or whatever.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp...<br>

What level are you?  I have not felt underpowered since I got Conflagaration at level 44.  I am now level 62 and I chart my damage all the time.  The only times I am not the leading or 2nd leading damage dealer in any group setting is when I have to take extended AFK's.

There is so much wrong with this statement it is frightening.<br>
<br>
I have FT1 (Solstice earring). I did not get it until level 62. I did not have my epic until 61.  So I will speak with experience on being an FT-less, drop spell less (GSS, EER, SS etc...), epic less wizard (The first 60 levels of my wizard life).<br>
<br>
At level 51 I started quadding wyverns.  With KEI (available for 50pp or one gem turnin) I was able to make about 1k every 2 hours.  I had approximately 2500 mana at the time.<br>
<br>
By the time I was 57 and moved over to otters I had bought a horse with my quadding profits, upgraded my gear to around 3.2k mana and made a lot of experience doing it.<br>
<br>
I dont understand how you can say that you need to be hardcore to quad wyverns?  Each quad takes all of  5 minutes, then you can port to the nexus to med (hopefully some enterprising bard is playing Chorus of Replenishment) then head back down or log out.<br>
<br>
You say farming is only easy if you waste a lot of time playing.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  You can log on, do a quad of wyverns, make 50-100pp, log out in all of 5 minutes at level 51.  <br>
<br>
If you want to say getting GSS, Ancient spells, Aten Robe takes time that the average wizard may not have, then I would agree with you.  But to say that it takes a hardcore player to make money or exp??  You are just dead wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wandork>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Warriors ph34r me!<BR>Gnomercy for Gno-one!</span><br>  Posts: 2108<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/03 10:47 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You still say Wizards aren't broken?

With comparable AA and equipment, and considering how easy it is to get a KEI, wizards are nice damage makers in PoP. Get 8k for a horse and you'll be a better addition to the group than most other classes.<br>
<br>
Once a group has a tank (war, pal or SK), a healer (druid or cleric) and a slower (sham, enchie, bst, bard or even necro in some places) there is room for 3 more, and what is expected from those is damage. If wizard post 60 are not a good damaging class, then there are very few... At same AA and equipment level.<br>

I have my epic and I am lucky enough to have most of my pre 65 spells.  One thing is to build up a reputation for being a solid group member, another thing is consistency, you can't quad half the time and try to the group the other half and expect people to know who you are and invite you into a group.  People invite their friends and classes they need.  If you're not a class they need, it doesn't hurt to have a rep for being funny or reliable.  I do believe my life would be easier if I were a chanter...but let's be honest, I like chatting with my friends and hanging back in the group.  I think wizards are awesome :-)<br>
