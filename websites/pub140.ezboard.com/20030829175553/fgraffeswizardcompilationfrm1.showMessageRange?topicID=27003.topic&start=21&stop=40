We are in the scrum of half the classes chasing half the spots, and we at least hold our own - in my experience I am embarrased by how much more dmg I do than my melee guildies who I love.<br>
<br>
We are awesome soloers and raiders so if we totally and clearly owned groups too would that honestly be fair with 14 classes in the game?<br>
<br>
Where the caster classes have an innate advantage is that if we dont recruit a tank we dont need a healer either. We can fill our whole group with caster dps and a support or two. And many do, though invites to all caster groups are *very* much based on reputation in my experience. They are incredible xp but they carry high risk too, especially if no resser, though usually someone has one boxed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
eg. I got invited to a 4 mage, enc(, wiz=me) group this week which was great fun. Afaik there arent any 4 mnk, enc, rog groups any more.<br>
<br>
There *used* to be that kind of group with the wussy luclin mobs (though it would prob be shaman rather than enc) but SoE put a stop to that with PoP, and some melee are still peeved they cant solo/duo/do non-trinity groups like we can. That's prob the main drive for extending the blue range again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pilsainsilverback>Pilsain Silverback</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 961<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 8:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bottom line on grouping today (no flames or whining)</span><hr size=1> I'm speaking as a casual player in a casual guild, at level 51.<br>
<br>
I have NO problems getting groups.  Now, if I run around with the LFG tag on, I rarely get invites.  However, people want to group.  So, I just start soliciting people to group.  In most places other than PoP, you don't need a tank, or a cleric, if you have the right mix (and the people who believe the same).  You really only need a cleric if you have a warrior (even though having one is always nice).<br>
<br>
We recently grouped in Dulak, killing dk blues, with me, two clerics, a ranger, a bard, and a rogue.  I also had a group (which was awesome) of me, two druids, two rangers, and a shaman.  I could barely cast IC twice before the mobs were dead.  <br>
<br>
Both of those groups were pick-ups (me and one ranger were guildies), and I had very little problem in getting them together. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7321<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 8:37 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> I've said it a thousand times before and I'll say it a thousand times again... it's all perception.

Hm but especially you were once again the visualization of our nuke damage, because (if i remember correctly) you were scared to make all of our resists official. And i was your opinion, too, Rombus.<br>
<br>
Anyway. Tanks see clerics, Chanters nuke for 1100 damage then and when. Then we come with our 958, 987, 1028 draughts... The gap is still too close, imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=veladorn>Veladorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>I have needs too!</span><br>  Posts: 1338<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 8:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure what solution you want.<br>
<br>
For me, I can't do more damage.  I mean, mana regen\efficency is not even an issue.  The #1 limiting factor to my damage output is aggro.<br>
<br>
Its aggro that keeps my damage from going up, not how hard my spells hit for or how much mana they use or my mana regen.<br>

<br>
First off, strange as it sounds, in an XP situation in tier 3 and lower a ranger can tank just fine (I have a 65 ranger as a tank alot, and they have no problems tanking with NO elemental gear - that includes mobs like Gaukr and his brothers in lower BoT).<br>
<br>
Secondly, hot keys are your friend.  A root and stun hot key that announces to the group you are saving the chanter/shaman/cleric from death by said action makes you more visible.  Our stun lands better than a chanters, and if nothing else will usually pull aggro off said person, giving your group time to recover.  Do it enough and you WILL end up on peoples mental list of 'People to Group With'.  <br>
<br>
Sure, aggro is seen as our downfall by some, but with some creativity it can be a tool to your advantage.<br>
<br>
As far as improvements, I would LOVE for flappy to affect my group.  That is easily the best improvement that would address group desirability for wizards.<br>

<br>
Most other classes have no means to reduce aggro or have to cast debuffs or use pets adding an uncertain amount of aggro. I think if wiz have any real 'mastery' in a world where everyone nukes, it's our precise control over our own aggro and I think that theme should be pushed forward.<br>
<br>

Personally speaking I still am against the visualization of damage very much as it brings the bad along with the good; don't know if that implies being scared though!  I never said I was for it, simply that hopefully it will help instead of hurt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 10:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> I agree with Rhombus, perception is everything. And understanding how other classes work, or what they do.<br>
<br>
Example, my group was hunting Vamps in the castle in Tenebrous Mountains. One of the named ones is a wizard that casts ice comet. He managed to get two full ice comets on the SK and down he went. <br>
<br>
The next day, me and the SK were hunting together, and talked about the night before. He pointed out that the wizard vamp could nuke for 1120, and that my nukes where smaller. I told him, I wasn't using the same spells, because two DoF did more damage then one ice comet in the same time. (I have ID3, Robe of Tempest).<br>
<br>
So, I loaded ice comet and showed him (Hit for 1140) and he was all, dam! The next mob I used two draughts of fire, and hit for 688 and 708. When he found out that for 430 mana, I did 1396 damage compared to 1140 for 400, he saw the difference.<br>
<br>
But from his point of view, ice comet was still better, cause it delivered over 1k damage all at once. And when I crit with ice comet for 18k (Love ID3) at level 52, people just say that is unfair. <br>
<br>
I was good at not getting aggro before I had concussion, and now with it, I'm even better. In fact, on the same hunting trip, when our tank got iced (ha ha) a monk broke the mezz on a corertie general (Whole seperat issue), and the other melees had trouble pulling it off the enchanter. I over nuked, on purpose, got aggro and the concussioned it off me. <br>
<br>
We all laughed afterwards, because in the past, the enchanter has saved our group many many times, and this time, the tables where turned on him. <br>
<br>
Not to say wizards don't have issues. There is something to the arguement that in the high end game, other classes outside of tank/heal/slow/crowd control can bring good DPS and more. <br>
<br>
Perhaps wizards do need something now to offer a group. Personally, I'm not to interested in being a buffing class. There have been many ideas posted on here, some of which I think could work with out overpowering, or stepping on others toes. It's been suggested that some of the effects from our familiar also effect our group. I'm sure that if the resists our familars give us were partially given to the group, they would like that very much, since they raise all resists, and are stackable. It could be an AA ability.<br>
<br>
Group Harvest would be usefull as well, since healers would love an instant shot of mana, enough to give someone that CH. <br>
<br>
One idea that came to me recently, if we really wanted a buff, was one that allowed us to improve anyones weapon damage. The only thing about it would be that some might feel it was more of an enchanters spells. But the idea would be that we could cause a weapon to burst into flames (or magic or ice) which would increase the damage, lower the delay, and add a fire, cold,magic damage bonus. We all know, melees love anything that makes them fight better, faster, and do more damage. Even at if the spell at best raised damage, say 7-10, lowered delay 2-4, and gave a fire,cold,magic bonus of +4, it wouldn't be over powering, so long as it would last a few minutes, and had a fast cast time, and low mana cost, so it doesn't eat to much into mana used for nuking.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A> at: 6/19/03 10:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jayteebushwacker>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 10:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> If you can see melee damage numbers you should see caster non-melee damage as well.

we often fill the last two spots with mage/monk or shaman/rogue or something like that... occasionally a cleric. This group works well in all of tier 1, most of tier 2 and parts of tier 3.

pre-PoP the conventional wisdom was &quot;sub-60 wizards have it rough, but at 60 life is rosey&quot;..... it seems the bar has moved up a little.... though I'd contend that at 51+ the only limiting factor to wizards finding a group is who you know. None of my wizard friends are ever LFG... now theres a dozen or so rangers that I know that couldn't find a group to save their lives... Don't go zone-to-zone shouting LFG... almost no one finds a group this way... make some in-game friends and start a group on logging in each night.<br>

<br>
- Im finding grouping to definitely be more profitable xp-wise, so that was good<br>
- widening the level range so that things dont turn light blue and green so fast was good<br>
- Im finding groups in PoP to be even harder to come by, so this is bad. Also the quality of groups has gone down, and get my ass killed more. I think maybe they should have made the minimum level for PoV/PoS 60 or 61 for people who dont have the flag, and higher for higher tiers.<br>
- Im finding soloing to be less profitable xp-wise in PoP but more profitable elsewhere, but only relative to the way it was. PoP xp still blows previous expansion zones xp away and at 65 it is a waste of ones time to go anywhere else, so I feel this change was unnecessary and irritating.<br>
- what they should have done instead was maybe increase some ZEMs on a few older zones, maybe toughened them up a bit too, or parts of them. The underlying issues with ZEMs which they havent really spoken about is the huge amount of xp that is needed for lvls 61-65, which I suspect was the reason for the original ZEMs in PoP in the first place.<br>
<br>
But thats just my opinion, I could be wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mookus>Mookus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 10:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> Im posting this so low on the thread, so i doubt it'll get much read but... <br>
<br>
It's my opinion that wizards have historically been the way they are because of what they used to be before kunark. Way back before group aggregate damage.<br>
<br>
Back then, as many will recall, it wasn't the group that did the most damage that got credit for the kill. It was the group that had the person who did the most damage that got the kill.<br>
<br>
One wiz could KS entire groups, easily. By doing as little as 20% damage for instance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Because of this... wizards were highly desired to be in your group. Because we were the insurance that some famous ks'er couldn't come steal your kills, exp and loot. Those were fun times i might add.<br>
<br>
The thing is, a lot of people made wizards. To many people in fact that healthy balance wasn't there. <br>
<br>
At first verant limited the wizard's power to prevent him from being able to KS groups so easily. And secondly, they made other classes better to encourage the better balance of classes they had envisioned.<br>
<br>
Eventually, group aggregte damage was put in place, and the number one reason i was always snatched up into groups immediately went poof instantly.<br>
<br>
But it still took them a few years to round out the wizard class. I guess the fear of wizzies was still well entrenched on the mindsets of the game's designers for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fqubedf3povar>FqubedF3povar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/19/03 10:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: grouping</span><hr size=1> I dont know if its due to vidual caster dmg or whatever but after the patch ive gotten ALOT more groups, ive not gone lfg for more then 5 mins and not gotten a tell, a bit frustrating waiting for a raid and turning down groups but i digress. <br>
<br>
Also on the wizza vs mage issue (ok so its not here but im posting now and whatnot) farming ME shard i was grouped with a ranger and a mage (others came and whent but we were the core) the mage passed the &quot;nuke&quot; torch to me, even tho he was higher lvl. as for who did the most dmg..... no contest. With them i can now count to get a group anytime anyday. <br>
<br>
Its a matter of precepcion yes. Now make ppl precive you as uba, how...... well before you get a group havce C3 and BotN also know your nukes and use them eficiently, dont draw aggro unless its called for ect.... basically the most important part is when the puller says &quot;mana?&quot; you can always say without lying, &quot;gtg&quot; you might be at 20m but if at 20m it means you can burn thru 75% of the mobs hps, then you are gtg. <br>
<br>
Then also make livly chat in group chat, you know the old social skills...... you have become better at socializing 13.... dear god this is gonna be long.<br>
<br>
oh well <br>

when fast burns are needed and the group sees 950 950 950 950 950 and the mob gets annihilated so they can get on the add i think they remember.<br>
even more fun if we pick up a mage bracer before getting group. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=664016" target="top">Baroness Xoshia Zensolar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Sorceress of 63rd Cycles<br>
