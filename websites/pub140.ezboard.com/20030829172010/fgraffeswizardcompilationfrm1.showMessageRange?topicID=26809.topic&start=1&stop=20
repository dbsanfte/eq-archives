<br>
     Most of you probably don't know me but I have been playing EQ now before Kunark.  I was introduced by an old friend who I spent many hours playing D&amp;D with.  My first roll (1999) was a wizard and I spent a lot of time trolling Graffes and I thought this was one of the best forum sites on the net from content and average intelligence of posts.  I retired from the game in January of 2003 with a 52 wizzy and a 51 shammy.  At the time I gave away my account to a friend who liked to 2 box.  In January of this year I came back and started a Shammy.  I am now at level 53.  I also have a level 25 Necro and a 35 froggy wiz.<br>
<br>
     I was grouped last night in PoJ and this post is based off a long discussion we had.  <br>
<br>
     We were discussing the changes that are do to come out soon and that have been implemented.  Additional XP bonus for groups, AA's, Foci items, spells, etc..  We were all original players having all started with the original Verant EQ before Ruins of Kunark came out.  <br>
<br>
     My question is does anyone else feel that EQ has become diluted to the point of mediocrity.  While the game itself is still fun, in a sort of Diablo'ish sort of way.  Does it not seem as though the shareholder, market driven mindset of Sony has driven the thrill and excitement from the game in order to attract more customers.  <br>
<br>
     While I realize that it is better to be 65 than 6.5 there was and still is a lot of content for all levels of play.  The whole point of EQ I felt was to adventure and to explore.   The thrill of moving deeper, the elements of danger, and the satisfaction of accomplishing a difficult and rewarding quest.  Not just trying to level as fast as you can or trying to build 300 AA points.  Most of the zones go unused because of the race to hit the &quot;high end&quot;. <br>
<br>
     Are there any old timers out there that feel that way.  It used to really mean something to be a high end player.  While all the changes are nice, the game itself has less value as a whole.  The world itself is huge now, but %95 of it goes uncamped.  The reason group play died is because they just made everyone too damn powerful.  Now with group xp bonus they are just making sure that you can go from 1-65 quicker than you can blink.<br>
    <br>
    I almost feel sorry for anyone who starts the game today.   Even though boats were not the funniest I still remember being awed by the sight of the boat going to Kunark and it gave me a chance to chill and chat while waiting for the boat.  The thrills of having to find my gear instead of popping into the bazaar and having it handed to me.  Though at times it did get tedious having to run through WK and Qeynos Hills and Blackburrow to go home to Halas it was still a rich world to see, and there was always people in the zones to meet.   I will never forget having to run from one side of the world to the next because I got tired of waiting for a gate.  Highhold was always fun to run a train through.  Progression has advanced to the point were it is so quick now that they will never see the whole game.  Yes I know you can still play the game anyway you want.  But new players never saw the way we used to play all they know now is PoK books, and KEI's and everything else.<br>
 <br>
     Please don't get me wrong.  I don't hate the game at all, I still enjoy it.  In many ways the changes that were implemented were nice.  To me now it allows me the opportunity to play other classes casually and have fun.  The changes also help bring more casual players into the game letting them enjoy the game more than was previous.  In many ways though I play mostly for nostalgia and to chat with old friends.<br>
<br>
     With all the MMORPG's out there, the niche that was EQ by being different, more difficult has died.  It is getting harder and harder to find reasons to distinguish it from other games.  While I don't plan on playing EQ2 since I think it would be nice to explore some different genres(WoW, I networked all the others).  I think that those of us that were fortunate to have been around during the original &quot;vision&quot; were lucky.  While the game itself, as admitted by Verant, was a fluke in how well it grew and developed was a milestone and an experience that we will find hard to match again.<br>

I had started playing EQ as a human monk before Kunark was released and I remember that Western Karana was a cool zone to be in and it had 20+ people in it. Now days, you're lucky to see 5 people there and most of them are just passing through to North Karana or to Qeynos Hills. And it's also a zone that's so huge yet has very little in it. <br>
While I as a Wizard, I enjoy the book portals, mostly because it makes me even more mobile than before. But for the new players, it steals something from them. And that's zone knowledge. I know of many people who don't know what zones lead into others simply because they've relied upon ports, TL's and now the book ports. And I'll admit that I'm quite ignorant of the luclin zone connections myself. <br>
<br>
I still love the game to be honest. I was recently taken to the City of Mists to complete my Brain Bite quest and I was thoroughly impressed. It looked forboding to me, and I knew I had a fight on my hands to get to the human skeleton. I had alot of fun there that night, not just the fact that I got an important spell added to my repetoire, but in the fact that I got to see someting I'd never seen before, spent time with my guildmates who did a great job there, and overall, had a fun time doing it.<br>
<br>
While trying to get to 65 as fast as you can may be fun for alot of people, I like to pace myself and enjoy the sights along the way. <br>

Hope this came out as being objective =)<br>

I agree and I think Brad quit partly because of quality control issues and SOE's determination to streamline a niche game.<br>
<br>
But there were some pretty ridiculous problems with EQ v1.0 and I'm glad alot of them are gone.  It's probably too late to reverse the damage done by Kunark's outdoor zones and the major balance problems caused by unrestricted twinking.  I give the new team credit for having the balls to change some major things instead of going with the &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; mentality.<br>
<br>
If I were on the team I'd set the goal on returning the game back what hooked their core base in the beginning: designing content that pushes a group of six players to the limit of their skills within a reasonable timeframe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1832<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 10:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ for the Masses</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you can use a griffen. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It all started, in my opinion, when they changed the newbie rules (level 10?).  I mean, come on, 10 levels of no risk?  5 was enough, got you out of the newb areas, and into some real things (like Orc Hill, or the gobbie camps in BB).<br>

The thing that made it so great was simply how new it was at the time.  Traveling by foot from Ak'anon to Kerra Isle was fun the first time.  After about my 20th time it got VERY VERY old.  The PoK books are a godsend.  It just kills alot of downtime.  Anything that kills downtime = a good thing.  Now, I'm not going to argue that some of the expansions have lowered some players skills considerably.  Spending 6hours on a corpse run definately forces you to pay more careful attention to what your doing, and how you play your class.  But DAMN it sucked.  Being a 23 warrior bound in high pass hold and grouped in splitpaw (pre-revamp) dieing sucked mad ass.  That was a nasty run for a naked, un-sowed warrior.  If you were deep in the dungeon when you died, summon corpse simply wasn't an option then.  You had to risk invis breaking to drag your corpse.  Likely, invis did break, you died, and you start over.  Now you need to drag two corpses.  A griffon aggroes on your way through EK.  3 corpses.  Invis breaks again.  4 corpses.  Remember, 29 cleric rez was 0% exp at the time.  39+ clerics were nearly non-existant.  So you died 4 times losing your level plus a yellow bubble.  Original death was due to bad pathing.  2 deaths due to invis breaking at an untimely spot.  1 death due to aggro from a blue con caused by lag and naked defenselessness.  No deaths due to lack of player skill.  Total time spent doing corpse recoveries considering slow zone times, large mostly empty zones, and no sow equals 7 hrs.  Now bear in mind this is a good day, because you actually found a group at all.  That was old school EQ.  And no it was not fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=murel>Murel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1472<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 3:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ</span><hr size=1> I retired a long time ago...they got rid of the boats? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The two things that made the game big for me was the boat trips, and the Karanas. I remember one trip I made through Karana...ah screw it. Old timers' stories, and I started post-Velious so I'm not even old. <br>
<br>
Nowadays, from what I can read now and even what I could sense in the atmosphere when I finally stopped played nine months ago or so, is that the game doesn't start till 50. And I don't mean in some cheesy &quot;Life doesn't begin till 40!&quot; way, I mean if you are under 50 then as far as 90 percent of the player base (and the developers) are concerned, you're just a player-in-training or some such.<br>
<br>
All the changes they've made for the &quot;low-level&quot; game are bullhockey -- they've changed the game for the high level people starting low level characters. That's what all this don't-lose-your-body-till-10, getting-rid-of-the-boats business is all about. If they really cared about real low levels, they would have left that stuff the hell alone and made the game more interesting,  not streamlined it even more to get to the end even faster.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Tyrant<br><br>Owned by Ikeya<BR>Destroying EverWars...<BR><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><u>Contact Rombus</u></font></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 7217<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 3:40 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ</span><hr size=1> It's Gryphon.

Wasting a half hour on a boat ride was not fun, you simply had no other option available.<br>
<br>
Coffining a guild out of a bad spot was not amusing.<br>
<br>
Stashing bodies outside Seb holding extra keys gave no additional dimension to the game.  It was simply bad design.<br>

Don't make the mistake of allowing yourse4lf the buggy-whip argument.  Just because you had to walk uphill to school in four feet of snow does not logically prove that everyone should go to school in northern Alaska. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quineloe>Quineloe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1833<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/6/03 4:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's Gryphon.

They promised faster combat than any current MMORPG, thats a good thing. I am not saying WoW will be like D2, but D2, and all the other blizzard titles, prove something.<br>
Blizzard really knows what they are doing. They know what people want to play and what is fun, from login to logout, to play. Somewhere around Luclin the EQ devs totally lost these skills.<br>
I doubt many people really dislike Diablo2, for alot its nothing they can play hours and hours, but for the first time playing through it it IS fun. <p>Sage Quineloe<br>

None of the games are 'server-side' only, because they can't really be and still account for lag induced via your connection. So they allow the clients to do things. The more things you let your client do, the more hacks are possible, especially if you can insert new data into the communication stream between the client and the server. It really won't ever get to be 100% because it would make the games unplayable. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380">Qaman</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
