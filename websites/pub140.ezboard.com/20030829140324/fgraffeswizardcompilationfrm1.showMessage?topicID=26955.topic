<br>
Zone: Overthere<br>
Time elapsed: 41 minutes<br>
Total kills: 44<br>
<br>
Lvl 40 Paladin(me): 32,766(not including DS)<br>
Lvl 36 Wizard: 11,226 non-melee damage(w/ mage dmg focus)<br>
Lvl 38 Magician: 13,730 total damage (6,743 non-melee damage + 6,987 pet damage) <br>
Enchanter: 3,437 damage(also C'ed, hasted, mezzed and slowed for the group)<br>
Druid(healer)<br>
Warrior(joined late)<br>
<br>
There's two problems with this parse.  Number one is both wiz and mage were casting a DS on me(they stack) so there's no way to give proper credit to their damage, although it's safe to say the magician's 15-point DS did most of it.  <br>
<br>
The second problem is both wizard and magician could have done a better job with their casting.  The wiz used Lava Storm alot which sucked and was made even worse by the fact that the mage focus doesn't affect it.  The magician was like most pet casters, a bit lazy outside of hitting the /pet attack button.  His spell selection was also poor, often using his level 20 and 24 DDs for some odd reason.<br>
<br>
So there you have a twinked paladin vs. two focused casters without KEI.  I think both of them could have pulled out better damage if they had used the right spells but I can't imagine either of them tripling their damage output.  I'll email the log to anybody who might want it.<br>

Also the fact that the pally is a bit twinked (by your own admision link didnt work for me) would have helped him out. Ill try to get some parses now that I can see all the dmg with my pally alt and a wizza in the group, but that requires me not being lazy and well.....<br>

Lava Storm is the best available rain spell at that level.  Is he a poor player for using rains?  Or is it that there is a balance problem with rains, at least at this level?<br>

<br>
It's a 5-point DS.  It's hard to blame the guy for trying maximize his damage output and there again, it's the best spell of it's type that he has.  Is he a poor player or is there a balance problem with the spell line?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>having no KEI<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's not his fault though.  The only thing this guy has going for him now as a result of &quot;caster balancing&quot; is a slight DD improvement vs. my high end Velious gear.  He had clarity and focus thanks to the enchanter and magician.  Suppose we had a shaman instead of an enchanter?  I would have really stomped his ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tsurok@graffeswizardcompilation>Tsurok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 12:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This is not surprising</span><hr size=1> Let's see, with mudflation, the paladin is probably using a very good weapon and has decent haste, while the wizard is stuck with his/her, umm, original release damage spells.  Adding a possible 10% ID still leaves wizards far behind what melee can do with today's even average twink weapons.<br>
<br>
The wizard is really weak grouping class at those level ranges because of their weak dd.  Until level 44 and conflag, the best damage spell in the wizard's arsenal is, by far, circle of force.  Even then, the wiz class lags behind most melees in groups until the high 50's.  I'm pretty sure my 51 monk with tranq staff would easily outdamage my wizard at 51 during most fights in a regular group setting.  <br>

4 levels is not that much really. The paladin is mildly twinked compared to what is avialable these days (my 39 paladin runs around with a 25dmg 24 delay weapon) and the DS barely does use mana at 36. and KEI, yeah. 25-50 wizards were balanced in group.. with KEI.

He's a poor player for using rains at that level.  The level 36 nuke (Ice Shock) has a slightly better ratio (1.95) at that level (36) than Lava Storm does at its best (1.92). So even before you factor in the ~20% rain resist rate, it's a poor spell choice.<br>
<br>
If your point was that rains are useless pre-50, you didn't need a parse to show that.  Just compare the best-case ratios of the pre-50 rains to the pre-50 nukes (assume 1 target - i.e. 3 hits, as split tanking isn't common at that level), and you'll see there's no point in using them at all.  Factor in the ~20% resist rate on rains, and they get even uglier.  <br>
<br>
I think using a parse to demonstrate this actually detracts from your point (if I have read your point correctly).  It's a parse comparing different levelled characters, admittedly doesn't catch all the damage (eg. DS), and as you said, the two casters were poorly played.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ya know, I had a lower wizard friend ask me about spell choice recently.  It was sad, but basically, I told her to stick to DDs until she hits 50+, unless she's quadding:<br>
<br>
PBAEs: don't use em - at lower levels, PBAE isn't a realistic option as your channelling isn't high enough at that level to reliably avoid interrupts <br>
Al'Kabor: riiiiiiiight<br>
Rains: ratios are worse than standard nukes - don't use em till 50+, (at which point, use 'em a lot!)<br>
Columns/Pillars:  great for quadding if you have snare/jboots/sow - haven't found much use for them outside of that<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll definitely agree that the pre-50 rains need looking at (not sure much can be done about the other AE lines for those levels, so I'd focus on rains).  I just think this wasn't the best way of making your point.  I'd be more interested in a parse of a well-played level 36 pally with a well-played 36 wizard and a well-played 36 mage.  That would be an interesting (and more useful) parse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=harrenga>harrenga</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 12:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> [quote]Did you see all the damage they did?<br>

<br>
Is this true?  I assumed that you had to stand near the mob in order to see the damage.  As the tank, and probably the puller, he would have been near the mobs the entire time.  I will have to test the above quote for myself.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the wizard was 4 levels lower than you.  If he were 40 also, he would get less resists and have access to another circle of spells.  That would have helped some.<br>
<br>
Finally, and most importantly, with how much you are twinked, how can you try to compare damage with casters?  Silver Chitin Handwraps:  Ok, that isn't too bad, they are pretty common, and there are much better purchasable haste items out there.  Still, you couldn't get in a group to camp them yourself.  The Massive Dragonclaw Shard, however, is huge.  To compete with your 28/30, Zlandicar drop weapon, you should give that wizard Ice Spear of the Solist, at least.  Of course, a level 40 twink caster cannot scribe level 60 spells like you can equip that weapon which would have gone to a level 60 tank when it was first discovered.<br>

I look at what the wizard did, and think he did the best he could do with the tools he had. I would expect the pally to do more damage in this situation. <br>
<br>
The part I look at is the mage vs. wizard damage. The mage does more damage than the wizard, but not dramatically more. Yes, add the damage shields in, and the mage opens up the gap more. In a group setting at the levels shown, this doenst suprise me.<br>
<br>
We would need to have several hundred logs like this, in all sorts of circumstances to really get any kind of real results. Interesting, but much more data needed.<br>

SO in conclusing this was a crapy done parse of damage for an unfair comparison were the paladin clearly has an unfair advantage to make the paladin look good.<br>

<br>
First thing to remind of is that, at these levels, solist icy wand is godly! You havent mentioned what the uptime was but it can be high at these levels. Since the pally did so much dmg I'm gonna assume that was the case - say 75% uptime.<br>
<br>
If the wizard had done *nothing* but stand and click the solist wand he'd have done 17k over the 40 mins. That's using zero of his own mana, so that is a real baseline. If he didnt have a solist wand he is severly undertwinked compared to the pally so it isnt unreasonable he did less dmg, even ignoring the 4 levels diff here. They are selling for 1k and less on my server now (I notice stuff like this).<br>
<br>
Now let's consider instead dmg from real nukes.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming the guy didnt have a horse; again, I think that would make him pretty undertwinked these days. But it is only fair to compare a twinked wiz with a twinked pally. After all, comparing a twinked wiz to an untwinked pally would be equally unfair.<br>
<br>
Nuking from a horse with c1 would give him a mana regen of (I think) 25/tick, 250/minute or 10k mana over the 40 mins. In addition he has his manapool of, perhaps, 2k. However I'm gonna ignore his manapool and assume he finished at the same point he started. But bear in mind we could inflate the dmg calc below by ~20%.<br>
<br>
Assuming the mobs dont resist ice badly, and assuming he is spec: evoc and has dd bracer and dd earing he could nuke for ~340 dmg for ~136 mana, which would be 25k nuking dmg over the 40 mins. This is irregardless of uptime.<br>
<br>
Now, offloading his 25k dmg wouldnt take the full 40 mins; he'd actually have a *lot* of time to click his solist. I am not gonna work it out but I'd be suprised if there wasnt enough time to do 5-10k more to surpass the pally dmg.<br>
<br>
To me, this log completely vindicates my belief that a mid level wiz could totally hold his own against a twinked melee with just 10k of twinkage plus kei. Now kei has been removed from him, tis true, but the descrepancy is far from terrible, as this example shows. Moreover the wiz can quad for xp while lfg. It's not that hard a life .. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A> at: 6/15/03 1:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 2:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> All this shows is that there are to many factors to consider. level difference, gear, and the mob you are fighting. A level 40 paladin fighting the same thing as a level 36 wizard is a big difference. If the mob is level 32, the paladin is going to land more hit because of his level, in the time of the battle.<br>
<br>
If anything, this would be an arguement for not improving melees like they are planning too. I'm not saying they shouldn't, so don't take me wrong on that. Melees need some upgrades, or more so, warriors do.<br>
<br>
Besides, the wizard at level 36 sure did alot of damage, in my book. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elasto>Elasto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist</span><br>  Posts: 1369<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 2:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> I dont think they are planning to upgrade melee's across the board.

<br>
Having a lvl 34 wizard myself I can guarantee that its a bad idea to nuke as hard as you can at this level.  No concussion, inefficient dd and rain spells, no AAs.  The 30's are a time to learn your class, not a time to be an overnuking ass and get yourself in more trouble than you are worth in a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br>  Posts: 651<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 3:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>SO in conclusing this was a crapy done parse of damage for an unfair comparison were the paladin clearly has an unfair advantage to make the paladin look good.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

For one, I never said the wizard or the mage were bad players just that I disagreed with their spell selections.  I don't fault them as much as I do the walleyed nimrod who designed these spells.  It makes perfect sense for a new player to assume their latest spells are the best ones to use.  Plus according to EQ Companion, the wizard took 0 damage.  It's a cold day in hell to find a wizard at that level who knows how to control his aggro.  The magician just played like most pet casters at all levels; lazy as hell and not exactly squeezing out every last drop of their mana.<br>
<br>
Second, the paladin being 4 levels higher...it's not that much improvement for a melee to go from 36-40.  I dinged 40 about a half hour before I started the parse and my skills were just starting to go up.  But I'll refer you to this old post... <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=641.">pub140.ezboard.com/fgraff...picID=641.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
...at the very bottom of the thread.<br>
Same level as the wizard, and pretty much the exact same rate of damage over time as I did today at lvl 40.  Note the date of the post.  And this is a paladin we're talking about.  A hybrid tank.  Not a pure damage dealer with backstabs or flying kicks.  I shudder to think what I could do with a rogue or monk.<br>
<br>
Coincidentally the enchanter had a white drogmor mount so I'll consider that viable twink gear.  But for damn sure I wouldn't buy a Solist Wand so I could click out 38pt DDs for hours on end.  I've never seen a wizard who has and never will.  <br>
<br>
You can come up with perfectly ideal circumstances and figures all day but this was a snapshot of what really happens ingame.  <br>
<br>
The link above is bad for some reason.  Look in the &quot;Class Balance and Bugs&quot; forum and click the &quot;Damage Logs: Graphing the total damage over time results&quot; thread.  My post is the last one on it.  It was done when my paladin was level 36, same gear. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkpaktgrimsoul>Darkpakt Grimsoul</A> at: 6/15/03 4:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1952<br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/03 6:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin spanks wizard in damage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For one, I never said the wizard or the mage were bad players just that I disagreed with their spell selections.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

*cough* <br>
<br>
Perhaps it was your title that pisses me off and everyone else about how this is an unfairly done comparison not on what spells they were using but as the title suggestion of whos better then who at doing damage.<br>
<br>
If you were truly trying to point out how some spells suck change the title from paladin spanks wizard in damage to, rains at low level need to be looked into.<br>
<br>
Or change the title to level 40 twinked out paladin spanks untwinked level 36 wizard not using his best spells for the situation in damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26955.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=26955.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26955.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26955.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General EQ Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
