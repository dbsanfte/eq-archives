Actually, my resists are comparable to Veleals, and he has more mana and about 300 more HP..  I don't care about HP too much as I have 200 doses of 300 pt heals that cast instantly (albeit expensively) .  I don't argue he has nice things, I argue that his perspective is not only insanely biased (IE The view is great from the top, so it must be equally as impressive as the valley ), but that he is claiming things about combat that is simply not true.<br>
<br>
I also have all focus IV things, and while I am not saying we are completely worthless, I am saying that a level 60 char with very few aa can give me a run for my money that is disproportionate to the amount of effort/gear they have acquired.  You may be right, Brillin, that the gap in his gear v.s. the gap in his foes hear is far greater then what we face on VZ.  Although, it should be noted that a marginally equipped healer, or a Melee with a formidable 2HB can pretty much kick anyones ass (including Veleal) indoors.  I am stating that Verant has worsened this situation, and DO have the capability to correct this, as they have broken it.  <br>
<br>
I don't want a DT every 2 hours 44 min.  I want a even palying field where effort = effectiveness.  Right now, it is far from that, and PvP skills have very little to do with the outcome in certain scenarios.  This simply should not be the case.  This isn't &quot;whining&quot;, this is about having a sense of fairness.  There are alot of easily correctable things that could be done right now:<br>
<br>
water dancing:  Lame, and really serves no purpose in PvP then to allow rangers to shoot you while being immune to spells, or to allow other classes to heal/med at will.  We don't receive the same benifit.<br>
<br>
Healing classes:  I still know for a fact that even the best equipped Wizard is garbage against a good healer.<br>
<br>
7-8 K HP characters:  I have yet to see a wizard survive the damage incured while trying to crank out this type of damage, esp indoors.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyway, as you said you are one of the best equiped wizards on EQ... how many people (not in Hate) can even come remotely close to your gear on SZ?

Unless I missed it, I don't see him make any such claims in this thread.  He used to be one of the best equipped PvP Wizards BEFORE he took his 3+ month long break, but I can tell you right now that's no longer the case.  SZ has at least one guild in the Elementals which means that there are likely several other Wizards equipped much better than he is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He doesn't have the Scpeter of Alkabor, and I bet that chaps his butt. /hug mine.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'll bet it doesn't, as he has FT15 (and Scepter doesn't stack beyond that~) and a signifigantly better mainhand. ^_~  Dagger owns Scepter!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I've done a lot of tests for resists.  PoP 60+ Draughts are rarely resisted with 500 in their respective resist and hence Draught of Thunder desimates healers and even Bards.  You don't need 1 shots to own in PvP... you're playing one of the best PvP classes out there.   CHIN UP, BUCKAROO! <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:xx-small;">Officer of Triton, Member of Team Ice, Povar<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=458434">Rombus, Arcanist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5702">Rommy, 61 High Priest</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> .:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/03 4:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wait a sec here</span><hr size=1> Wow, I guess I have found that a level 200 + MR seems to make DoT fairly ineffective..maybe I have had bad luck on these.   I mentioned the Scepter only because it allows me to focus on resists/hp vs FT, which allows for a slightly higher resist/hp setup.<br>
<br>
I am not here to get in a pissing match with anyone, in fact, I welcome any constructive advice.. I am sure there is much more to learn.  That being said, I have worked very hard (as I am sure the rest of you have as well) in trying to optimize my PvP chances, and do not appreciate the general unhealthy and condescending tones that were meant to be a personal attack, not a point of debate that Veleal resorted to.  Good luck Veleal.  I say that with genuine sincerity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rombusmindspire>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 6803<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/03 4:38 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: wait a sec here</span><hr size=1> Shrug, with 500 MR I resisted 3 out of 50 DoTs.

Also, about the resists and draughts.  You said many were partial resists.  How often did you hit for over 30% damage?  Maybe its just us VZers have gotten extremely unlucky.  I've just always found in high end its more effecient to use lures.<br>

I also agree, that the resist codes on PvP servers are significatnly different then on blue servers.  I have seen lures bounce on 320 + checks, and DoT will bounce more often then not on 200 + MR, and the problem is, if you get one full resist, they often have just healed back to full.<br>
<br>
Now, if they were to put a stronger -resist check on DoT, it may be an option.  As it stands now, I'll cast it 3x, and if I get full resists on it every time, I'll resort to the lures (which is 90% of the time), and pray for well timed crits.   <br>

I'm probably 4th or 5th in my own guild now that they are farming elementals full time and I've quit. Gear isn't everything, but it really makes some shit a lot easier.<br>
<br>
That being said, I've killed plenty of healers, and very well geared ones at that (the #2 guild on SZ is in Vex Thal - though no real gear yet, they have a ton of Ssra+ shit though). Draught of Thunder + Tears of Arlyxir is much more own than you give it credit for - the idea is to make healing so detrimental that they have to do something else, it doesn't always work, but it does a lot more than you give it credit for.<br>
<br>
I also call bullshit on you saying you are similar to Defiant wizards in gear, your guild hasn't even killed Cursed yet ... and you can't buy the kind of gear that makes up that gap. You have 3k unbuffed? I'd love to see it, you said you self buff to 2500 earlier - which is a stretch in itself. So basically you are giving me 1000hp in raw gear, as well as AA's and fun toys. I don't have the Staff of Al'Kabor. Guess what ... it sucks. I'd rather have 125hp in my main hand and it's not I'm worried where my FT goes ... all my FT items have 65+ hp anyways <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In the end, wizards are the best of all pvp classes. Not in all situations, but all around. With full spells, 100+ AA's and the gear that's available, you are almost god status. The only way I ever died was to manaburn, and that's nerfed now. I had manaburn for a long time, from Luclin release. When it was nerfed, I was glad to trade it in, and swore I'd never get it again, it ruined pvp. Instant kills are the worst thing possible for the game.<br>
<br>
I love pvp in RPG's, I loved it in EQ. I'd hate to see morons like you giving a bad name to pvp, by being whining cyring babies because they took your deathtouch away. It was the fucking best thing they could have done, glad to see that piece of shit gone.<br>

You will fight what is there.., and I want to you to challenge some healers, (decently geared and aa'd) and some melee's...I'll document the whole thing with screenshots.. Then we will come back here, post the results:<br>
<br>
If you are right, and you are a god in pvp, then hey, another feather in your hat, and you have proven me wrong..correct ?<br>
<br>
If I am right..then we have determined who is the MORON, have we not ?  Like I always say, never argue with stupidity - they drag you down to their level, and beat you with experience.  So, shut it, or prove it..it's really that simple. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A> at: 4/21/03 6:30:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=velaelsoulrender>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>The Snuggly SZ'r!</span><br>  Posts: 1048<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/03 10:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Put up or shut up.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     - this is true obsession: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub86.ezboard.com/fdarkprophecyfrm15.showMessage?topicID=54.topic">Neydini the Stalker!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Anyways, if you believe that pvp is defined by the bazaar, well - I almost understand you stating we suck as a pvp class. Only bards are more mobility dependent in pvp than wizards are, it's the class strengths. Small enclosed areas with no terain are the worst place you could pick .. half of being good in pvp is knowing when and where to fight, and when and where not to (though I've killed plenty of retards in the bazaar). <br>
<br>
PvP is two parts - in every game it's in. <br>
<br>
#1 - Killing people - doing enough damage, and doing it before they can get away.<br>
<br>
#2 - Not dying to other people - being able to absorb or avoid damage, and being able to disengage when you know you are losing<br>
<br>
Wizards in EQ excell at both those. For example, look at the only PvP server that keeps score.<br>

Now I might not be able to count, but that's 12 out the top 20 being wizards, and Kirban had more points than all but 3 or 4 GUILDS in Sullon history. There are a lot of situations wizards won't win one on one, but many more that a smart one will. I never was a super agressive pvper, fighting only when I had to for xp spots or raids, and yet when I quit I still get 1650 points a day for coins in my bank - that's 165 kills of people over level 50 and within 5 levels of me, and almost all of them were level 60+. Wizards flat out own folks, with or without manaburn. I'm glad to see no one has deathtouch anymore, that's a great move for eq pvp.<br>

On Sullon, the point of pvp is to make other characters camp or leave zone.  PERIOD.  The top guilds, ToW, Hate, and BP <br>
rely on pvp to manipulate the progress of their opponents.<br>
Pvp is very strategy oriented and geared towards controlling access to mobs, planes, or zones.  Also, all TACTICS are considered valid within that strategy.  <br>
<br>
On Vallon, well ..., we have people who believe in an ideal pvp environment, that the game mechanics really do not support.  There are restrictions self-imposed by the server population that limit the range and scope of pvp tactics employed.  Here is where the MB nerf will take its toll.  Tallon too I suppose.<br>
<br>
On the whole, Velael is correct, wizards are extremely strong in pk with or without MB.  The Sullon scoring system supports this assertion.<br>
<br>
And yes ... I spent a year on Sullon (ToW), but now I play on Vallon because of family and friends there.<br>

<br>
I´ve pvped as a bunch of 60+ classes on SZ (Wizard, Rogue, Monk, Druid) and as a melee I´ve gotten feedback by a bunch of people to be one of the best jousters they´ve met <br>
(Just mentioning to show that I´m not a clueless xp person who just xp 24/7 and never engage in pvp)<br>
and there´s no class in eq that can come even remotely close to wizard in pvp in general except Necromancers and Shadowknights, due to the huge damage output a wizard can burst out without getting hit alot (if you have some brains to not just stand still and mash your nuke button)<br>
And the fact that Velael mentioned, Wizards can escape in many many different ways and all the types of runes they can use helps them a ton<br>
<br>
Neydini, let me ask you, how do you engage someone in pvp?<br>
Just stand still at one spot, never moving and mashing your nuke button while he´s just standing there pounding on you? Judging from how you´ve spoken so far I´m gonna assume that you really do, so then yes, wizards arent powerfull if that´s how you want to do it, but if you fight a wizard with a clue you´re gonna have problems, no matter what class you are<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
You say you dislike &quot;manaburn ganking&quot; and none of your spells doesn´t do significant damage to your target, much less more then 75% of their total hp, then how the hell does this effect you? <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=645767</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vomtik>Vomtik</A> at: 4/23/03 7:25:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/03 10:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *clueless &lt;&lt;&lt;</span><hr size=1> Let's see.  <br>
<br>
Well, first of all, veleal also mentioned that wizards really kinda suck indoors.  See, we get interupted alot when engaged in melee style combat.  Care to argue this point ?<br>
<br>
So, that leaves outdoor zones.  Well, first of all, you'd best have 250-340 self buffed resists if you seriously want to PvP.  Secondly, you'd better have 100K horse, that has a no start /stop penalty.  Thirdly, you'd best have about 184 aa's, and have spent them exclusively on the PvP enhancing skills alotted to us.  Fourthly, you'd better have a way of healing yourself in case of an unusual crit.  (good thing I can instantly heal about 3 K in hp every 3 secs or so, although it costs me 1 K every 3 secs to do so).  <br>
<br>
How many Wizards do you think I have exlcuded in the aforementioned criteria ?  98 % of the wizards on a PvP server ?  I'd guess closer to 99%.  But yeah, I suck terribly.  <br>
<br>
Yep, Caster best of best was won on Vallon by a gimped, retarded old wizard named Neyfear..  He must be clueless.  Hell, look at the MB era tallies of Wizard kills Veleal pointed out..oh, that was pre-nerf btw..  In summary, if you are one of the top 2% geared wizards on your server, you will be able to easily kill other classes, as long as they aren't in the top 20% of thier class, and in some classes cases..top 50%..  If you don't understand that logic..then I am sorry, there is no hope for you.  See I also have a level 65 warrior, a level 63 mage, and a level 65 healing class..so i have seen the results from both sides of the fence, as many of you , apparently have not.  Get off me, I am fine.    You have your opinion (albiet biased as hell, I have mine..in my world, PvP isn't as easy as you mek it seem, and the majority of the wizard on MY server, agree wholeheartedly)  that is all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jefunky>Jefunky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/03 10:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just wanted to say OMFG</span><hr size=1> I have been trolling here a long time..I have read this entire thread..you guys have no fukin clue, I am sorry.<br>

NEYFEAR UALTALL  &gt; then all your srry asses.  I have seen this man have entire ZONES flee him.  He simply owned our server as a wizard.  Damn, one weekend, we had a PvP contest in our own guild .. he had like 85 kills over the weekend.  This guy knows his shit.  To call him clueless is the biggest line of BS I have ever heard.  Poor fukin guy, one of the nicest guys youd ever want to meet.  <br>
<br>
Listening to all you pre-madonna'd freaks makes me wish you were on my server so I could watch Ney shove that crap down your throat.  He simply is the best PvP caster this game has ever known, and HE DID IT WITH CLASS...a concept foriegn to most of you I'd bet..  Listen to what he has to say, you might learn something. <br>

The wizard I played was lvl 62, had crit 2 aa´s, that´s about it and I had no problem with killing people my lvl or higher then me (I never tried this in tier3 zones but I dont doubt it would be possible there as well)<br>
And seriously wtf, BoTB Wizards? 2 Wizards planted infront of each other who just mash dispell/nuke button and hope they get crits? wtf is the skill in that, alot of pvp is about using things such as waterdancing, hillbugging, be smarter then your opponent and place yourself so you can land a nuke and move out of his range/into water or whatever to avoid his incoming nuke etc<br>

And I´m not gonna comment on Neyfear since I dont know who the hell he is<br>
