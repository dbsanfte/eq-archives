<br>
Because we're craving an immersive interactive environment (and actually had received it for a while) and now we're getting a treadmill.  All we've been presented with is kill mob X for loot X.  The lore is always incomplete at best and without the lore there's nothing but pixels.  As far as features go I've been very impressed with some of the events that you have created, but why should I bother to do it?  Phat Loot?  That's cool but that gets old very fast.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm saying is that the elements of plot and fantasy are at best poor.  New challenges as far as mob difficulty is only one part of making a game and seems to be all you (the developers) are concerned with.  How can you even conceive of a fantasy/role play genre with such incomplete plotlines?  The city of Qeynos is incredibly cool with plot lines, all sorts of lore you can learn just by doing random quests throughout that city culminating with the Qeynos badge of Nobility.  Now let's compare LoY?  nuthin.  No immersion, just more stuff to kill.  <br>
<br>
Everquest has the potential to be incredibly fun, but the only reason I log on anymore is to hang with friends I've made from back when I was thrilled to learn of Kane Bayle's corruption, I'm looking for more of that magic.<br>

It'll never be finished, just like the morons in Qeynos won't realize that Antonious Bayle was kidnapped four years ago, or that Luclin, the goddess who brought ruin to the Akhevan Empire and trapped the Combine Empire there when Grieg would have busted them out, will never be defeated -- although several of the NPCs ask you to kill her, the poor bastards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dmccollum>dmccollum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/18/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because we're craving an immersive interactive environment (and actually had received it for a while) and now we're getting a treadmill.

What, FIVE new zones?  That could have been done in a free patch<br>
<br>
The Ability to tint armor(Ya, uhm k)<br>
More Bank Space(about the onlything in it thats useable to me, but could have been a free one)<br>
<br>
The Frog? ya, uhm they don't even have a new city and the Trolls are currently homeless.<br>
<br>
My favorite Expanson is still Lucin<br>
<br>
But they did sell the story of it, and it's yet unfinished or at least not progressing(not that the story is of any real intrest to me unless it can help me play the game or grow in skills)<br>
<br>
Glinlor tells his group : Oh ya, did you know this is where some troll came to kill his step brother in law for sleeping with his half elf sister?<br>
<br>
Group : Glin... Shut up and AE this stuff, we are a EXP group not yoru guild chat channle<br>
<br>
Glinlor Tells his group :/sigh<br>
Glinlor beginsto cast a spell(repeat this step 5 times a min every for about three to five hours, and a half a blue of exp is now mine)<br>
<br>
To tell the truth I still play(sorta) but I'm not really intrested, not like I was. I'v tossed around the very idea of retirement for good, heh and my wife is mad at me becuase she said she wanted Glinlor as a port hore and I said I'll delete him.  <br>

I don't want my wizard to turn into the port bitch that so many of my old wizardly friends are currently I'd rather just delete him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cantatus>Cantatus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 4:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> I don't really think EverQuest is on any sort of back burner.  We are still getting content at the same rate we always have (one expansion per year with a couple free zones in between) and patches are as frequent as they've always been (one ever other week about).  However, don't mistake that with me being entirely happy with the game.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of people here are confusing EverQuest being on any sort of back burner with their own satisfaction of the game.  To me, it's not a question of Sony doing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but that they are perhaps doing the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wrong things</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to keep people happy.<br>
<br>
Flipping through these pages I see people asking for improved CS (ie more GMs), finishing existing content, changing time sinks and several other odds and ends that would help renew the faith of various posters here.  This isn't necessarily that Sony stopped doing these things but that they don't see the importance in them (from either a financial or design standpoint).<br>
<br>
I think the problem nowadays is that after four years Sony has to do a lot more to keep the player base happy.  However, they aren't able to keep up anymore.  People want variety, but there isn't much at the high end game.  PoP exp zones are as boring and tedious as playing in Lake of Ill Omen and provide little challange.  While raids can be dynamic and fun, having to fight over what you can do (on a crowded server) makes the raiding experience more frustrating and blood boiling than fun.  Of course, I suppose this is why CS has been brought up here several times.  It's no more fun to petition and wait hours for a response from a GM than it is to call a computer tech person and be put on hold for a long time.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is they need to be working harder towards making the game more fun and challanging and less on trying to keep people playing with tedious timesinks.  Lose the perception that Sony is just trying to milk EQ for $$$ to the last drop and finish things like EQIM and PoWar.  Go back and redo unused content more often.  As the adage goes, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again.  Where is the everchanging world we were advertised?  GM events and lore in the game are abysmal.  If I wanted to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>read</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a storyline I'd pick up a book.  If I play a game, I'd expect to be able to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">experience</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> that storyline.  I don't expect to be able to see everything that goes on in the world of Norrath, but I should be able to run into some dynamic content every so often instead of just having Trolls just magically appear in Neriak after one patch like the world of Norrath is constantly jumping ahead in time with no care for the details.<br>
<br>
There is a lot they could do to make the game more enjoyable, fun and challanging.  I just hope when they try to prove that this game isn't on a proverbial backburner that they keep these things in mind.  The game, like a TV show, needs to evolve and change in order to keep us interested. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

remember acrylia?  im not saying bring back acrylia, but using it as an example, if you nerfed it because of the exp, then why didnt you make a huge ZEM change instead, thereby creating a zone PBAE'rs could enjoy and still make equivalent xp as say, a druid in PoS?<br>

<br>
Oh, there are new zones, but exploring them isn't a challange or rewarding. When you are able to move through them with a chance to survive, you won't get xp, and when you can get xp, you need so much back up, a single group ain't enough.<br>
<br>
Story lines are incomplete, quests are incomplete, zones are incomplete.<br>
<br>
Customer Service is non-exsistant. The hard work is done by Guides that have their powers limited to nothing, The GM's hardly show up at all, or take weeks to respond while any evidence has decayed by that time. This causes people to simply give up when that happens, and their friends along with them.<br>
<br>
The promised small/single group content never made it into the Planes of Power, because that content is limited to the annoying XP grind. <br>
<br>
There are no single person quests that are both challanging as rewarding anymore. You either need to spent hours to get some ultra rare item from a rare spawn, or you need to compete with 59 other people on a drop from a mob that needed 60 people and spawns once a week. With challanging, I do NOT mean time consuming. The Staff of the Wheel is a challanging quest, but it aint time consuming.<br>
<br>
Why is it that all the gifted designers, of both quests (ring, shawl, QBadge) and Zones (ToFS (unfinished still) Crystal Caverns (never finished, but changed)) were fired? didn't they give in to the management that wanted to feed the masses with Raw potatoes, while they wanted to finish their product before releasing it?<br>
<br>
What is the link between that Vampire girl in ToFS and the spirit stones from the cats/Kerrans in Stonebrunt?<br>
<br>
Why can't I still comlete the armor, and are the weapons no rent, and is this only an option for those with good faction, and is it impossible to change that faction, why is alot of major content removed from faction groups, without an alternate story line behind them (Katta)<br>
<br>
Who are those Dark elves in Rathe mountains, why don't they talk to a fellow dark elf, and why can't I up my faction with them? <br>
<br>
There are so many questions unanswered, and all we do is run into a wall of missing links and incomplete content.<br>
<br>
After PoP, there was a poll from EQ/SOE about what the customer wanted, about 85% voted for the Fixing of old content and Issues, what happened, another Incomplete expansion was released.<br>
<br>
There have been talks about class balance for several years now. I remember the huge posts about Wizards on the EQ formum when those were still open to everyone. Nothing ever came out of that. Patches were made for every class, but they skipped the wizards. The same with the previous class balance, and now you start over again with pure melee, skipping the Wizard class. All wizards want is some group friendly spells, several good ideas were brought up, none were implemented. In the mean time, wizards get shafted with small changes every time. Some we don't even know until we see some dagger that proc's one of our nukes, or other such things.<br>
<br>
But we are not talking about the wizard class here, we are talking about the Burn out. Well, we get the feeling that EQ is nothing more then a milkcow ready for slaughter. it has been over a year since there was a new issue of the newspaper in game. Content unfinished, Bugs unfixed (until they are used as you did not imagine, like the Eye of Zomm aggro)<br>
<br>
what to do to fix it.<br>
<br>
- Remove the time sinks<br>
<br>
High end Guilds have passed the key time sinks for VP, ST, VT, AC. now instead of 2 guilds, 12 guilds are competing against the same mobs for the same content, result is that it never opens up for those. Solution: increase spawn time from those mobs from once every week to every 20 hours. And make the keyparts common and multiple drops. <br>
<br>
- Fix content<br>
<br>
When does ToFS gets finished?, and PoMischief,  ...<br>
<br>
- Fix mobs, encounters<br>
<br>
Remove those annoying summon ability.<br>
If we can not summon an animal that is 14 levels below us, then that animal should not be able to summon us. Permarooted mobs (like Trees, and lotus flowers) may summon, but everything that can walk, run or fly should not be able to unless we are too. Every time we outsmart a stupid animal in the game, the developers (those that are left behind) feel insulted and give it summoning powers or make it immune to everything. The will o wisp was a nice mob in the beginning before Kunark. This mob could not be hit unless you had a magical weapon, and those were rare. Where are the mobs now, that are pure casters, and can not be hit with melee? nowhere, it is always the other way around, they only give it more HP, make it hit harder or faster and give it an annoying AE and Immune to spells. The mobs that summon companions or proc FD are nice though, make the fight more random and interesting, instead of gathering enough CH clerics and a few heavy hp tanks that hit attack and go to the movies to come back in 3 hours to see that the mob is almost dead. Fixes are made with a blunt object, instead of a scalpel.<br>
<br>
- stop catering to the top end. <br>
<br>
I know that everyone ends up there, but there can be so much fun for those of lower level if only the means was given that they would feel safe in case something goes wrong (Graveyards, close by portals). Mana dependant classes do not like to crawl to much, because they need their mana, but everyone likes to crawl through a dungeon if they know that they can get their corpse out. Risk vs reward can be solved in other ways, like crawling toward a quest mob that gives xp for turned in items you collect on the way. This prevents people camping the mobs for the xp, because half of it they only get on turn in, this also gives people reason to move along. Place a boss type mob along the way in a side room you can skip if you do not want to do him, and make him a challenge for a single group that gives a nice item. some flags and triggers to make the room one group only, and you can crawl. Alot of these things were implemented for PoP, but not for the 25 - 45 group that has nothing better to do then Grind in boring same zones.<br>
<br>
- fix quests<br>

Stop with the new content already.  Give us reasons to explore and enjoy the existing content.  Make it fun to start a new character.<br>
<br>
Introduce meaningful, and achievable quests.  Stop dumbing down the game.<br>
<br>
Give players the ability to create their own quests, especially those 60+.  Make tradeskills meaningfull.  Encourage roleplaying.<br>
<br>
But most importantly, fix the current game once and for all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jjakajuan>JJakaJuan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/19/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Branaman Starbinder: &quot;make EQ easier then any game in history!&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Almost all of the things that were annoying about having a lowbie have been fixed.  I honestly think the malaise many are expressing comes from staying with the same game too long.<br>
<br>
That being said, I still think Branaman touched on pretty much the key issues I care to see fixed at this point.  The exception is that I don't agree that SOE caters to the high end any more than to the low end.  And I think the timesinks are mostly a problem for the high end.  Removing them and making high-end mobs more available or more high end mobs in the game (like adding Luclin) would be great.<br>
<br>
Plus I'd like to see just one GM triggered event per month.  Heck, every other month.

<br>
Soe always claims the majority of the players are not high lvl.<br>
Maybe the characters not, but i think the majority of the low/mid level chars are owned by a player with already 1 or more HIGH lvl chars.<br>
<br>
Other thing is, people LOVE to twink. It makes the game relaxed for them. And it also allows them, to level up a char faster, so they don't have to do unnecessary &quot;what they call timesinks&quot; in low lvl zones, that they already visited for ages, when their first char was low.<br>
<br>
One way or the other, you can't make everyone happy.<br>
<br>
Most of the lower lvl chars are in the hands of high lvl players.<br>
Just chat a bit around in a lowbie zone and you barely will find any player, that is playing with main there.<br>

Thats why I quit after 3 years(ex-65 chanter charm nerfed)<br>
<br>
Second - Listen to class gripes more closely. Again using chanters as an example, half our spells dont work either at all or very inneffectively in POP!!  LISTENING?  [IE mezzing(root is better), dots(suck), nukes(again suck), charm(now sucks), stuns completely useless], etc, etc, etc. Had not my 1 spell of usage(charm) not been nerfed or my other spells actually worked I wouldnt of quit.  <br>
<br>
Third - GM's!!!  Get off your wallet and employ a few!<br>
<br>
Fourth - Gay expansions like LOY wont cut it in the current market, do better.  A few features were nice(bank space, dyes), rest sucked ass.  <br>
<br>
Fifth - Stop taking features like the map in LOY we paid for and giving it out to everyone else for free a few months later...wtf!<br>
<br>
Sixth - Tell us what your plans are ahead of patching to get player input.  <br>
<br>
Seventh - No one gives a shit how many doors you fix<br>

Eighth - Nerfing something then offering discount packages for EQ, EQ2, etc thinking that makes it all better isnt gonna hack it, its called WOW...heres the website, be worried...<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">www.worldofwarcraft.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izelin>Izelin</A> at: 5/20/03 8:28:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andraelarcaneumrunner>Andrael Arcaneumrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Hand Of<BR>The Cabal (tm)!!!</span><br>  Posts: 1877<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/20/03 8:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Back Burner&quot;</span><hr size=1> Speaking of maps...

<br>
Are you telling us that this is supposed to be considered a game anymore when there are ridiculous encounters like the Rathe which REQUIRES you to spend 2+ hours non-stop mezzing and healing without so much as a 30 second break since it would wipe the raid, and requires you to have 70+ people? And that's on a good day. What about 4 1/2 hours of non-stop mezzing and having all those 4 hours of work (fun? HAH) all get erased in 10 seconds simply because the wrong person got shadowstepped at the wrong time? Is that supposed to be fun and? Have devs become so blinded by the almighty dollar that they have forgotten what Everquest is about and that it's supposed to be a goddamn game? <br>
<br>
It seems more and more like SOE is more interested in cockblocking their unfinished expansions lately to stretch them out artificially as much as they can instead of actually bringing out finished content which would keep the masses busy actually progressing through smoothly. Velious was only fully beaten right before Luclin came out, and there was no absolutly retarded timesink to go through (you had to farm gear to progress but that is nowhere near as tedious as farming VT shards off greens or key pieces in Ssra).<br>
<br>
Tech support doesn't even have a 1-800 line anymore. Roving GM's instead of server GM's is somehow supposed to improve customer service? Where are the serverwide events? The Best of the best? Test of Tactics? Did all of these go with the departure of Lady Dae and no replacement was hired? Heck where are ANY events? Take a look at the events message boards on EQlive.com.<br>

Not ONE post by a blue name in over a year other then the 2 'guidelines' stickies on the top. Why bother to have that forum at all anymore?<br>
<br>
And what the heck was LoY all about? Charms were a novel idea, but very poorly implemented (only drops in LoY zones and are pretty poor at best?). Dyes woopedo. The frogs invading Grobb were a nice touch and a were a good example of the new 'EQ Quest Engine' which has been bragged about when it came out, but um now what? Was this 'EQ Quest Engine' a one hit wonder?<br>
<br>
There are just so many broken promises and what feels like half-assed broken concepts which keep pouring in that it makes you wonder if anyone at SOE even plays the game. Or better worded, LOVE the game. The original EQ team loved the game. As much as people didn't like some of Brad's ideas about The Vision (what happened to The Vision anyways?), he loved the game and it showed. Kunark was an amazing expansion which while it had lots of class balancing issues, the content itself was true to the game's core places like Sebilis and Howling Stones. DUNGEONS! Where did they all disappear to? The last great dungeon was Dragon Necropolis. The dungeons in Luclin had no heart and were mindnumbingly boring, and Planes of Power had no dungeon at all (Crypt of Decay is the closest thing to one and it's hardly a crawling dungeon)!<br>
<br>
PoP showed a lot of promise, but in the end content was artificially cockblocked yet again to keep players away from unfinished content like it was in Luclin, and the end result is lots of frustration and no fun. Luclin brought the gun. PoP pulled the trigger.<br>
