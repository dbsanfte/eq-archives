<br>
comments on trails here are good i guesse.. no idea.. i never see enough in PoJ to even attempt to put together a group let alone trials.. 6 -8 hours a day in EQ mon-fri .. doing a /who all lfg every 15 minutes for a week while online comes up with an average of 8.06 people at any time from lvl 1 to 65 lfg<br>
<br>
so please hold your comments on how lame and lazy i am.. considering that i've gotten this far with far less ingame help and resorces that most of the people posting here to the educated shows that i'm prolly a better wizard or at the least as good<br>
<br>
it wouldn't even be an issue to begin with except sony nerfed exp saying the old world is dead.. one day i'm working on starting alt points the next the world is light blue and i'm told to go to PoP<br>
<br>
there's a ton of ways to die that have zero to do with your ability to play a wizard and much more so considering PoP mobs<br>
<br>
there's comments here on options or other ways or work so where is it ? it's just spam no facts no information nothing here but rants from wizards posting up ha ha i'm better than you are<br>
<br>
for the epic comments there's the time spent<br>
<br>
going past 60 isn't an option.. i hit 61 the other morning just to con around and everything was light blue for no exp.. died and got a rez back to 60<br>
<br>
so there's the spell line, one day you got places to hunt the next sony kills exp and says to go PoP<br>
<br>
where's the choices here or options here hum ? <br>

not to mention LD.. at least old world there was the smallest of chances you pop out of game before you die<br>
<br>
i've got 1125 hp's not 3k and basically no ac in regards to melee.. i don't have any 65 cleric friends online at 4:30 in the morning with nothing better to do than buff me <br>
<br>
steelskin or manaskin if you can somehow afford a dot every single melee contact of any kind is a joke for PoP encounters<br>
<br>
so spammers ? where's the options here.. where's the hard work for reward you so love to spam about ? there WAS options before the exp nerf.. i've yet seen a single one posted here for all the spam put up<br>

I agree with the poster that said the epic is the level 60 skin spell. <br>
<br>
If your time frame doesn't conform to your speculation on VS spawn time, then maybe a transfer to a server based in another time frame (i.e. Europe) would be beneficial to you.<br>
<br>
I am a 61 wizard on Rodcet Nife.  I don't sit around in PoT LFG.  I'll /ooc in the zone and over guild then I'll head to Skyfire or other zones and quad.  At 61, the exp earned per kill is pretty much the same as level 59, but the mobs are more scarce.  You just have to go to various places and find a spot that works for your level of skill, whether that is expedition guards in GD, elder wyverns in Skyfire, or flies in PoD.<br>
<br>
In regards to my use of skin buffs, it really depends upon where I am quadding or if I am in a group how well the MT maintains aggro.  When quadding, I generally have 3 buffs on me (shield of the arcane, kei, familiar) and the occasional skin spell.  If I had my epic, then yes, I would have it up all the time.<br>
<br>
Also, you play at a great time to do bazaar shopping.  You can turn a lot of plat real fast by finding pricing errors and undercutting then turning it around and selling at market value. Instead of wasting hundreds of hours in KC, just play the market, make the plat, then buy the MQ for the staff.  On RN, the MQ's can be bought for 5-10k (some times cheaper). All you would need is one of the staffs, then buy the other two, complete your epic and there you have your missing level 60 skin spell.<br>
<br>
One thing perplexes me though, you accuse others of spamming you with their responses to your question.  You argue that opinion is spam.  Does that mean the premise of this thread is spam because it is your opinion that a level 60 skin spell is missing?<br>

<br>
just looking at the basic minimum<br>
<br>
in PoD for example.. you got a mob your fighting .. next your loading plz wait from a mob running past after someone else, you are dead before you even know something's there<br>
<br>
i dont' have much choice but to sit there and lfg.. i cannnot make up that yellow of exp per death and still somehow work on alt exp.. your doing nothing but making up real exp to keep lvl 60<br>
<br>
i've asked and asked and get the same responce from guide's and GM's that the exp nerf is for post 60 game.. but i'm not post 60.. one day you have choices and options the next you have nothing and are told to buy PoP so you can sit in empty zones all morning and that somehow gets you flags.. i have nothing from PoP, there's nothing from this expansion that i need, everything is old world and it's trivial.. so now what<br>
<br>
any new offense to help? nope.. any new defence to help ? nope.. anything at all ? nope<br>
<br>
you might be able to rip off enough people to get some plat in the bazaar... but your wrong about being a good time of the day for it.. everything's already purchased and bought in prime time.. the only high lvl PoP wiz spells for sale that i've seen so far wast AT for 86k, still no 60 spells from this research that's supposed to open up availability a little.. i check even though i don't have any cash just to see if it's there or not.. you can sit in the bazaar everyday for 6 hours sure but that gets you nothing when there's no buyers market at 5 am..<br>
<br>
i don't know about speculation on VS.. i think i've spent more than enough time to show that it's unavailable at these times.. was a patch yesterday.. up after patch ? nope.. up the next morning at the end of the 24 hour random ? nope.. big suprise there.. <br>
<br>
i could go on and agree with you and others that epic is the missing 60 rune however if it is then it needs to be available on a risk vs reward or at least a work for reward basis and it is based on nothing more than what RL hours you play<br>
<br>
making a fear raid every morning with the 8 people on the entire server who's lfg is a big enough challenge as it is, i can go for that sure.. that's work.. that's what i did for phinny.. might take 3 hours to get enough people rounded up to get to phinny but i got him.. took a ton of tries but it was fun.. met alot of people and got all types of people on the server who were just LFG their epic drops from phinny while i was there doing mine<br>
<br>
so looking at is as a whole then there simply it should be clear to any logical thinking person that epic cannot be used as a basic minimum for ALL wizards regardless of RL time played to use for a rune that might let you at least begin to cast a spell before your dead in the zones that sony now says you must hunt in at this lvl.. the jump from having fun in the mornings at say sun rev's in scarlet with whomever was online to nothing more than LFG in PoT cause old world is light blue is fairly harsh with absolutly nothing put in there<br>
<br>
well.. if you read em i've explained as i go what i consider spam.. <br>
<br>
*the guy who solo's to 65 without ever getting hit by melee ?<br>
*the guy who says to solo to 64 and dump a ton of cash for your rune spell so you can work alt exp at 60 ?<br>
*how about the guy who thinks if you solo to 62 then go to PoJ and click your heals together 3 times while saying, &quot;There's no place like Valor, there's no place like Valor&quot; and you get a flag<br>
*how about sab who basically starts his post off with &quot; i don't care what you say.. so in other words he's just ranting cause he likes to type<br>
*the guy who thinks that i havn't put enough time into VS yet ?<br>
*they guy who thinks all wizards have access to lvl 65 cleric buffs every 2 hours for free ?<br>
<br>
i personally have no problem calling this spam.. or at the least very situational and in no way relative to a basic minimum for all wizards<br>
<br>
i'm not even going to comment on the movelog suggestions.. nekkid at 3 am on a server in wich i know no one isn't going to get my any closer to any objective that i have in this game<br>

<br>
Look at me, im below you in your terms of life, but oh well, thats your point of view.<br>
<br>
I never used skin spells, not worth the cost to me.<br>
<br>
I now have my epic, click it all the time, just to have that extra damage to take.<br>
<br>
before i had my epic, i would quad with 3 buffs on...Sheild of Magi, Familiar, and KEI.....thats it........was actually that way without kei or familiar when i was lvl 34+ til kei and the familiar line came into play and 59 when i got my epic.<br>
<br>
You dont need any of these spells to quad or fight.<br>
<br>
First rule you figure out about fighting as a wiz is that if you start to get hit, you will most likely die unless you are grped.<br>
<br>
You get xp at toilers still at lvl 60.<br>
<br>
Flies in PoD, you are on at a perfect time to take the camp by yourself, i do it and rarely get adds or people comin in to take the camp.  I get 2% regular xp at flies still at 61 and have about 30% mana left over after a quad.<br>
<br>
there are plenty of places to get xp without epic or a skin buff.  In fact, i know a Wizard on Dro that is lvl 65 that does not have her epic, she has never needed it, she has friends and such to hunt with all the time, but still, she doesnt need it.<br>
<br>
If you are just ranting and raving about not getting your epic because of your play time, then thats fine, i understand it.  BUT, you do have the option of playing on the weekends which i dont believe you do anymore.<br>
<br>
Alot of people stay up late just to kill VS, i know i have numerous times.  Ive been up till 12 midnight to kill him when i have to get up at 5 am and go to work.<br>
<br>
If you choose not to make the sacrifice then thats all you man, but why try and make others feel guilty for the things you wont do.  Why blame others for the times they play.  Why be mad at the world because of what you do and think?<br>

Maybe its not everything in the world thats messed up, maybe its you................. <p>DAYAK DAEMONSPAWN<br>

In GD, (coldain) expedition guards con dark blue and are an easy quad...the quad trick for them can be found in another thread on this board.  *KEY NOTE* This is negative Dain and Coldain faction; however, it is positive hits to Kromrif and Kromzek.<br>
<br>
In SF, elder wyverns and some old wurms con db at 61 (a 62 druid told me about them and he said the elder wyverns were db).  Also, you can evac into SF and abscond to OT 99% of the time without aggro. Just have the spells ready. Then head towards VP.  Near VP there is an island with a dragon skeleton on it. You quad at the skeleton.  Since you never have kei since enchanters are never casting at the time you play, feel free to also tangle with mature chronos (the punks that dispel).  All you need is runspeed3, o'keills levity (helps on the pullling, don't need for the quad), and your nukes. If you get a guardian wurm ADD on a pull, just abscond.  Guardian wurms are level 60 and summon.<br>

There are just two spots. You can find other places listed in these forums as well.<br>

And that's a good thing.  Different abilities, different strategies, different experiences.  Yeah, maybe you think the skin line *should* be one of the constants all the way up.  But it seems like the game designers don't agree.  Wizards don't get bolt spells past level 16, either; but that's just a fact that we live with.  Enchanters get one general strength buff at level 4, and then never get a single upgrade.  There are no upgrades to the Gate spell.  Most melees go through levels 40-50 without an oportunity for a single skillup.<br>
<br>
So yeah, sometimes spell lines or abilities get dropped.  On the other hand, sometimes new abilities get unlocked.  Remember how from 1 to 49, every single new nuke took longer and longer to cast?  I doubt anyone would argue that draughts are a welcome break from that trend.  In the post-60 game, enchanters got their first componentless rune.  Why?  Because of the changing balance of the game at those levels. <p>Bayler - Marauder/Deceiver - Xev<br>

I'm a wiz on Dro, so let's start with the easy ones.<br>
<br>
Lvl 64 and under spells for wizards are routinely 20k and under(on our server).  This morning alone(yes THIS morning - 5am cst) Iceflame, AT were for sale for 20k or less, and most of the draughts were for sale for 1-9k as well.  2 copies of SoM were also for sale for 30k this morning as well.  Force shield routinely sells for 10k.<br>
<br>
As pointed out, on our server, VS is up alot of the time, he isnt widely contested.... <br>
<br>
Verant filled in the gap with our epic, and gave an alternative(Force Shield) for those who dont have the resources to get people into PoF.  Just because they added the spell 3 levels later than you would like doesnt make it wrong.....<br>

<br>
kiting flys till your 65 doesn't get you tens of thousands of plat for odd spells, and 30ish k for a spell isn't what is considered available<br>
<br>
i havn't said anywhere that vs isn't up alot on the server.. i've said that he's not up in the morning after patch, if he's not being killed then obviously i'd see him huh<br>
<br>
if your saying that the reason that this is a lvl 64 spell because of the fear part then what about vs ? <br>
<br>
he's coded not to be up after patch, he's killed during prime time by bored people farming at the least since no one really wants his loot anymore cause he's so trivial, then he stays on that spawn still not up in the mornings<br>
<br>
was never a prob before when you had mobs to fight that didn't one shot kill you<br>
<br>
as a base minimum for any type of realistic exp gain steelskin vs 1 shot kill makes no sense<br>
