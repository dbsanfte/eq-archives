I have spent many hours studying your writings here in this forum and am really impressed with the vast amount of knowledge you all possess in the area of &quot;quad kiting&quot;. I feel all of the classes have their advantages (Clerics can always find groups, Enchanters have a license to print money w/ C3, etc...) I feel one of our biggest advantages is our nearly unparalelled ability to quad kite. I recently returned to Norrath after a 1 year hiatus and decided to look into this &quot;quadding&quot; I always heard about. Well, I am very glad I came to these forums first to study up, because I am happy to say I have been having a really great time with it!<br>
<br>
However, I have noticed that there are a plethora of threads asking questions like (where should I kite at level 51...etc.) I would like to compile within this thread a comprehensive    kiting guide which I will later turn into a PDF of XLS for submission to the Graffe Library. <br>
I would like to draw on your knowledge and experiences in forming this guide as I think there are a lot of very intelligent wizards that visit this forum.<br>
<br>
I would propose the following information be submitted for this guide. If you could please reply to this thread and fill in the following. Let's try to limit actual discussion/debate and just post as much raw information in one spot as possible. Also, please feel free to &quot;repost&quot; information on the same spot if you have differing/additional information. I will do my best to consolidate it later.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you Sorcerors!<br>

Faction Affected: Hotwingz decreased <br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: This is a great quadding spot as it is nearly never camped. It is a great alternative to the usually camped Cobalt Scar, but is slightly more challenging. The biggest warning is to try to avoid most Sarnaks, which are plentiful here. They are typically SOWed and can provide some difficulty there. The best area to pull and rest is the burned out area down the hill from the nest. None of the hornets see invis (skeletons and gorillas do though). It can be a challenge to get a hang of where the good mobs spawn and you might have to mix in some gorillas and skeles. They are pretty safe to add in though some of the higher level ones have more HP than the hornets and will require a finishing off nuke. The Scoriae hornets also have a lot of HP and will require the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chiriko37>chiriko37</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/6/02 11:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 51-54</span><hr size=1> Minimum level: 46<br>

Availability: 4 (Come off peak times to have the whole place to yourself. Can be shared by several peopel though (lots of spawns)<br>
Loot: 4 (some plat)<br>
Difficulty: 3 (almost never resist, very easy to round up)<br>
Faction: Spiroc faction decreased<br>
One of the best camps at 51, these are quadable with a large mana pool from 46 or so if you stick to the smaller ones. by 51 ever thing is blue with a smattering of lt. blue from the lightfoots, and with KEI you can swarm kite them. They go down *fast* to Pillar of Frost. Xp is amazing at 51, not bad at 52, and pretty poor at 53.<br>
<br>
Minimum Level: 54<br>

Zone Name: The Grey<br>
Camp Name/Loc: Everywhere.<br>
MobList: Timeless Golems (perfect quad fodder), Sshissar Stalkers (faster than Golems, and more hp), Forlorn/Forgotten Slaves (undead that go down easy if you can get them in groups of 4...)<br>
Availblity: 10 (never camped. With all the nerfs to this zone, there's never more than 3-5 people here, and the zone can easily support 20)<br>
Loot: 5 (some coin from golems, organs/scales from Snakes)<br>
Difficulty: 9 (moving traps, large agro radius, viscious stone grabbers, summoning boulderlings and quick-casting worms make this zone a nightmare to quad in... but doable )<br>
Factions: Sszarra Temple decreased<br>
This zone is a nice, quiet place to get some xp, though the xp is no where near what I would call &quot;phenomenal&quot; its not awful... if you can manage to avoid the traps and the stonegrabbers. have abscond ready and keep sow up at all times and you should be fine here.<br>
<br>
Minimum Level: 54<br>

Zone Name: Timours Deep<br>
Camp Name/Loc: Raptor Islands<br>
Mob List: Raptors (blue til 57 (rare blue after that)) Vicious raptors (blue til 60), Dinus (lvl 48 I think, blue 60+)<br>
Availability: 2 (everyone comes here. Expect to have to get on a list.)<br>
Loot: 1 (abysmal, only research components)<br>
Difficulty: 3 (once you get it down, this place is CAKE. still, wide agro radius on the raptors means it has a learning curve.)<br>
Faction: none<br>
Raptors are probably the best xp anywhere from 54-58. Even after 58 with KEI you can hold both islands and still make darn good xp. With a little practice you can kite right on the isles, and with KEI you'll be right back at full for the next spawn. Finding an isle open can be tough though, I would recommend binding here and checking the spawn when you log in, then asking the person to send you a tell when they leave. Seems to work pretty well.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Often camped but very easy, Wyverns will not agro if you have a good faction with Claws of Veeshan, except for Yvolcarm and Azureake (the named Cobalt Drake). So stay away from them when they are UP, they are not snarable neither rootable and killing them will decrease your CoV faction. If you agro, just run then gate.<br>

Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 2 (great place to learn how to quad, plenty of room, easy to avoid adds)<br>
Faction Affected: Othmir up, Uthorks/bulthars down<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Avoid the rhinos, they run VERY fast, and are quite resistant to spells.  Begin with the walruses, and as they become light-blue, move up to Uthork Hunters and then Uthork Warriors.  If you can only find 2 dark blue mobs, you might as well mix in a couple light blue or greens to keep the spawns cycling and you'll be using the mana anyway, so it's extra kills for &quot;free.&quot;  Have something to make you run fast, and use bonds of force (lvl 29) to snare and the researched circle of force (lvl 34) to nuke.  There is an excelent guide on how to quad this area in the Library area of the Graffe's Forums.<br>

Good place to learn to quad.  The small zelniaks just north of the sseru zone line are easy and non social.  You can spread out to the middle of the zone as you approach 40.<br>

The exp is not that great because they have 8000 hp's.  It takes a ton of mana to finish them off, and that means lots of med time.  But there are two nifty things about quadding here: Camp is always available, and loot is great.  C3 and lots of +int/+mana gear is a must.  Only Pillar of Lightning works reliably.  Special care must be taken not to path them through a tree, as that will scatter the pack.  The terrain has a rough learning curve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slimbhcarvul>Slimb Hcarvul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/7/02 9:16 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 34-42</span><hr size=1> Question about the Suits - PoF not good on em?

Succulants - Non-social; if they're close and low and snared  they'll stand still.<br>
These will wander off if you leave a certain radius so keep them close when you're<br>
finishing a quad.  Get them all low and the same time and they'll all freeze in<br>
a group giving you an easy finish.<br>
<br>
Cockatrice - See Succulants<br>
<br>
The main dangers here are the adds.  Rhinos and cats are SoW speed.  If <br>
you pick one up, dart up a hill/rock and Shadow Step then gate or root it<br>
fast and zone out.  There's a ton of wandering mobs as well, so keep your<br>
eyes open.<br>
<br>
You can quad along the southern hillside with few wanderers between the FM<br>
zoneline (ledge) and the SE corner.  Another great line is along the gorge<br>
running N/S since it's almost devoid of wanderers.<br>
<br>
I've found that grabbing a mob then running ahead, invising up and then looking <br>
for more worked great.  It kept down the adds until I chose to break invis and the<br>
tagged mobs continued to follow.  Only Sarnaks will add on their friends, so it<br>
greatly minimizes your risk while tagging mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chifiir>Chifiir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/7/02 11:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dreadlands</span><hr size=1> Minimum Level: 46-48<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings<br>
<br>
Inside the building directly south of the Wizard spires<br>
there are 4 Plaguebone Thief skeletons.  They're semi-social, so you may<br>
have to duck inside the building to get all of them.  Often I'd pull a couple and<br>
run towards wiz spires, double back and duck inside to get the rest.<br>
<br>
No wanderers around the Outpost.  The ONLY tricky part about this quad is that they <br>
like to wander off if they're low on hps.  If you're close to them and they're<br>
snared they'll simply freeze.  This is a pain due to the low-damage of Circle of Force,<br>
but it's doable.  Root is your friend if the quad starts to break up.  Once you get<br>
your first Pillar at 51 this quad is CAKE.  Toss 2 Pillars, 1 CoF, then the final pillar.<br>
If you go straight Pillars then you end up right on their &quot;wander-at-low-hps&quot; line and<br>
you may end up with cleanup duty.  Loot is pretty dull, but they're spawn times are <br>
perfect for medding up.  With KEI you'd be sitting around a lot since there's only 4 of<br>
them.  Not many people seem to know about this set, so it's usually available.  I've seen<br>
a fifth one spawn, but no rhyme/reason and he's easily rooted.  If you get too far away<br>
from them they'll meander back to their spawn points but retain the HateList entry.<br>
<br>
They start to go Lightblue around 52 or 53.<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: 200 swimming and steelskin recommended to minimize damage on close pulls. EB not required but handy while scouting invis. Levitate up at all times, staff of tflux a must! There are 2 bloodgill goblins at each pillar (4 total), you can pull one pair, swim up and make some distance levving on the water with jboots/sow before pulling the 2nd pair. Once complete head towards the beach for roundup, snare and AE's (if SoWed, zigzag or you may lose them). Middle underwater building can also be pulled but are down deeper - hard to make a quad of this without taking a beating though, unless Marauder is up: in the doorway and hard to spot underwater, not having the blue skin that the Bloodgill Goblins have nowadays. Social, low aggro range underwater (might force you to tflux both goblins for each pair). <p>Traxam Kazam @ Lowland Elites<br>

<br>
Other Tips:   You need Pillar of Frost(lvl51) and SOW to quad the Drovlargs. Pull them from the South-east ruins area and quad them along the south side of KC. There is hardly anyone ever along the south side. <br>
In case of problems, such as a spider &quot;add&quot;, you can zone into KC to clear aggro.<br>
With KEI, you can get serious non-stop exp quadding the doggies, and you also impress the lower levels when you run by with four angry Drovlargs behind you.<br>
It helps to have the SOTF for pulling.  <br>
This is a great spot for someone to go 100% AA to pick up 3 easy points for Runspeed 3 . Once you hit 51, get your spells, go 100% AA, and start quadding your first 3 AA's.<br>
<br>
Keep your wizzy familiar up and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tunr ANON or ROLEPLAY on.  I made about 600pp+ a night between loot drops and TL requests.<br>

Rager Drovlargs are LB at about 53. At that point only the Ravishings are DB and they are few and far between.<br>

Tips:  Despite the changes to the Chromadracs dispell, SF is still a spot we can quad in.  It takes some time and skill but it is doable.  With the Changes to Chromadracs I seriously advise getting Run3 before making SF your home for quadding.  You get your SoW dispelled and you are in trouble here and will be dead pretty quick.  Also try to keep a skin up at all times, mobs hit pretty hard here.<br>
     The edges of the zone tend to have a few spots that are not filled with wanderers and tend to be flat without a lot of big boulders in the way.  Find these spots and do your quadding runs here.  I've done multiple quads with various mobs thrown together and am able to get them all snared with no problem.<br>
     If you get a resist or miss a snare on a mob, simply run ahead a little, root it, and then break root by tapping mob with Shock of Ice.  Proceed to round up the quad from there, you may or may not have to resnare before all of the mobs drop ( I do at 50% health just to be safe)<br>
     A note on Chromadracs:  While Verant gave them the ability to dispell at casting range this has merely taken them out of the lineup as quadding targets.  The Aggro on Chromas seems to be a very small area.  I run over the top of a hill and stop right in front of them all of the time, just be sure to turn tail and run like the wind in the opposite direction.<br>
     Make sure you put your important buffs like SoW, C3, Ageo, etc behind as many dummy buffs as possible.  This reduces the chance of accidentally losing them if you aggro a Chroma.<br>
     If anything, quadding in SF while teach you how to really drive a quad with finesse.  What I mean by this is that I prefer to have a full quad when I am kiting so I end up running around a bit tagging mobs here and there to make a full quad.  Dodging Chromas and steering my unsnared quad around Chromas has taken quadding to a whole new level for me.  Quadding in CS made me complacent, quadding in SF honed my skills to a sharp edge.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, one final note...  if you happen to see Talendor and are in the middle of a quad, take you quad away from him and with a quickness.  His aggro range is a tad large and you can aggro him by pulling near him.  Hope this helps.\<br>

Zone Name: Timorous Deep<br>
Camp Name/Loc: Raptor Islands (large and small)<br>
Mob List(HP): Raptors, Vicious raptors, Dinus<br>
Availability (1-&gt;10): 3<br>
Loot Ranking (1-&gt;10): 1<br>
Diff.Ranking (1-&gt;10): 4 (breaking the large isle is tough, but then it's simple after that)<br>
Faction Affected: None<br>
<br>
Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: Just south of the chessboard isle in Timorous Deep is the Raptor Isles. There are two, widely known as large and small (due to their size naturally). They are very close to eachother. The easiest way into TD is to go to Firiona Vie (or Overthere) and talk to the Translocator. He will pop you into the Timorous Deep zone and you can levitate, SoW and hike it to the isles. Assuming they are uncamped you have your choice of the two isles.<br>
<br>
Small- Easier to &quot;break&quot; as the sets of mobs are farther apart from eachother. There are a total of seven mobs for this island. Four on the &quot;beach&quot; side make set#1. Two on the north side of the island + 1 spare from large island make set#2. This is acceptable and expected to pull this straggler across the water to the small isle. He is on the northern part of the large isle and is all by himself. Simply pull one set of mobs, wrap and kite. Then you have a good 12 mins. to use that side of the island to med. All raptors are on a 12 min. timer. Get in the habit of timing them and be ready for the next spawn. If you spend the time breaking the spawn up you don't wan to get caught off-guard by another set spawning while you're kiting the other half of the island. Downside of this isle is you need levitate at all times to grab the straggler and you only get 7 spawns (as opposed to &quot;large&quot; where you get 8 for the same mana output).<br>
<br>
Large- Harder to break as the mobs aren't as separate. You need to get four and exactly four in your first pull to break the spawn. I don't have any good advice here except to be careful and scope out your pull before you do it. Levitate and use the water to your advantage. Try to kite in a tight area on one side of the island. Then you've got your 5-6 mins. to do the other side. Once the spawn is broken up you will be quadding every few minutes and should see some excellent XP!<br>
<br>
Warning: Careful when pulling Dinus, he's got a lot more HP than the others and you might need to sit-med-nuke a few times to finish him off. This has caused problems a few times as it screws up the timing of the spawns if you take too long to kill him. If you see Dinus up you are best to wait till you are full mana before pulling the whole quad so you can finish him quickly after the first three go down. This will keep the spawning/killing times consistent.<br>

this is an awesome camp, great money, and awesome xp. Now granted, when I did this camp from 44-48, there was no KEI in the game, so perhaps now its faster elsewhere, but without KEI, you can med up to full just in time for these guys to repop. I imagine with KEI you could quad these dwarves, then go quad the dwarves up by the docs as well, and still get back before a repop. The money here is excellent and really, do you even want dwarf faction? heck no.<br>

There are 4 spectres on the island on each corner. Just grab levitate and tflux them and run around in circles. Once they are snared you can quad them on the island, but if you are nervous just run them to the south shore and quad there. I have never had a spectre agro someone else during a pull and it impresses the hell out of some people.<br>
<br>
There are 4 MORE spectres in the tower, one on the bottom and 3 up top. You can target and pull the spectres up top through the walls, since you can see them sticking out through the walls. Just flux em and keep running. Mostly light blue to 49, but before that its all dark blue.<br>
<br>
2 quads per 15 minute respawn, can sell/buy bandages at gypsies or the inn depending if you are evil and good. Oasis is a fun zone too. if you get bored you can slay a Sand Giant for some pp.  Nice camp!<br>

Other Notes/Tips/Warnings: I learned to quad here, and made it my home from 35 to 42.  The southwestern side of the EW Bridge island is fairly flat and free of trees, which lets you learn how to wrap pretty well.  Just don't get spoiled on the vast, wide-open spaces!  There are some nice ice floes way down south you can sit and med on (and practice your fishing, too.)  Just don't annoy any turtles you see spinning around down there.<br>
<br>
You may have difficulty with your first few pulls if you've already tarnished your giant faction; roaming Frost Giant Scouts will force you to weave and bob as you try to snag that fourth Dire Wolf.  Jboots or some form of sow a must.  Just remember that safety is just over that bridge!<br>
<br>
Beware of the Dire Wolf Stalker, a higher-level wolf than the others which can throw off your quad, and a pack of Kromrif tracking wolves (who appear by the bridge when someone's doing the 8th shawl quest) which will be very very red to you.<br>

I suggest binding at the mill; it's a bit of a run to the ruins, but it makes it easier when your sow/clarity runs out, or when a pull goes bad. keep root and gate up at all times, and watch for roamers <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=284584"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/~dking3/AtelenSig-Copy5.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=618.topic&start=21&stop=37>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=618.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=618.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.threadControl?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=618.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19>Soloing and Quad-Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
