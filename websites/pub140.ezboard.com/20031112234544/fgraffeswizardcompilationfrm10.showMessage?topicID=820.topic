This is my perspective on the current state of the wizard class and how we are broken now that PoP has been released.<br>
*********************************************<br>
I play a level 61 wizard as a main.  I have to say that since PoP has come out wizard's are now very very broken as a class.  I will list my points below.<br>
<br>
1. Focus III items are now useless to us. which means half our gear is garbage now.  You didn't say to melee's oh the AC on your gear is now non-effective unless it's PoP gear recommended for 61+ is worthless.<br>
<br>
2. Our damage to mob HP's ratio is way off.  I tried soloing a mob in PoV it was a blue con mob. My mana pool is about 3700. I was only able to do 30% to this mob using full mana with KEI, FT 2, Epic buff, PoG, and Greater Familiar. <br>
<br>
3. Mages are now better at damage than Wizrad's.  They have much much more to offer a group than Wizard's. There pet plus there damage spells = more damage than wizard.  They offer focus items that groups want and the have mod rod's.<br>
<br>
4. Serious lack of availibity of our DD spells.  You made our 2 DD's with luclin only drop off the Thought Horror overfiend. and Emporer SSra not Only that you made them drop off these mobs loot table not the spell table.  DD spells define the wizard class it's what we do it's our Bread and Butter. I didn't see KEI dropping from Emporer Ssra off his loot table this is an enchanter's Bread and butter and class defining spell.  <br>
<br>
With PoP you've done it again we got 2 new decent DD's one we can get by turning in a parchment the other Strike of Soluesk as far as I know no one has been able to get it yet.<br>
<br>
What's with the lack of DD's we got a bunch of worthless spells that i know I will never use. Then new lures and rains are good but no knew PBAE's and only 2 normal DD's? Come on please.<br>
<br>
3. Wizard's are not wanted in groups anymore. Why? you might say Group's prefer Mage's there damage output is better. Our damage to mob HP ratio is out of balance.  We can't get Better DD spells because of there rarity and that you made them so hard to get.<br>
<br>
4. You seriously made our soloabilty hampered with PoP. We can't get groups. I can solo mobs in PoN and get 1% aa exp per kill but I have close to 15min of downtime even with FT2, epic, Greater Familiar, PoG and KEI.  so in 20 mins I get 1% AA exp. If I could ever get in a group in PoV i can get close to 20% aa exp for the same 20 mins.<br>
<br>
5. You took our ability to AE right out the window.  We can no longer make exp with AE groups. Mobs being unstunable they hit dang hard in PoP and the mobs that we used to be able to do AE groups with are now green or light blue and don't give hardly any exp.<br>
<br>
I have a couple of solutions to these issues. <br>
<br>
1. Make our spells in luclin drop off any mobs normal spell table no ther loot table.<br>
<br>
2. Make a zone or two in PoP AE friendly. like Fungus grove was in Luclin.<br>
<br>
3. To make us group friendly give us a spell line that adds damage to a melees hit with they hit a mob.  I recommend something of this nature 3 new spells lines fire,cold and magic that add a certain percent damage at a certain levels and then at higher levls maybe post 60 now combine the effects into one spell.  If you did this people would actually want to group with wizard's.<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
I hope to get there attention and address these issues.<br>

<br>
If you were only able to do 30% of a mobs hp in pop, what were you fighting in PoV, the dragon, the HP isn't that out of whack.  <br>
<br>
Mages have always been better at damage in a grouped situation than wizards, we keep up fairly well believe it or not, but considering you claimed we got 2 normal DDs and a bunch of worthless spells you will never use, I won't bother explaining how spells work or what you should use.  <br>
<br>
don't compare KEI to our nukes, people have tried before and the difference between out nukes and enchanter buffs is to great.<br>
<br>
If you think we only got 2 decent DDs in PoP, try logging in and using them.  SoS is gotten the same way any other 65 spell is gotten, multiple people have it.  Guess what, the other spells that you have written off as worthless are freaking amazing.<br>
<br>
perhaps wizards are not wanted in groups because of shitty, retarded posts like this that had to take a crack addict 1/3 of an eightball and about 10 minutes to write.  Our pop spells are as easy as any other classes to get.<br>
<br>
as far as soloability <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :sosad --><img src=http://rombusmindspire.tripod.com/sosad.txt ALT=":sosad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , wizards are one of 4 classes that can solo in pop, if you are getting 1% aa per 20 minutes, there may be a reason you can't get a group.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valisozephyrus>Valiso Zephyrus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/27/02 11:37 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> balance issues</span><hr size=1> I'm trying to get VI's attention to fix our class I know I'm not the only Wizard who feels this way and i'm not getting dragged into a flame war.<br>
<br>
Wizard's should be able to out damages mages. It's the whole concept behinds wizard.  DD is our bread and butter.<br>
<br>
Ok let's look at the spells we got with PoP one by one.<br>
<br>
Greater Fetter - Great upgrade we needed this a lure based root.<br>
<br>
Lure of thunder- New lure spell would be great if there were any high resistant mobs so far i haven't run into any.<br>
<br>
Resistant Armor - upgrade to our othe PR/DR resist spell ok but not really needed.<br>
<br>
Sheild of the Arcane - this is a good spell upgrade to Sheild of the Magi.<br>
<br>
Tears of Ro- Fire rain spell i admit we've needed upgrades to pour rain spells to many mobs resist them now to make them worthwile so this is a good one<br>
<br>
Draught of Ro - 950 DD damage Sunstrike is still better. granted if you don't have Sunstrike this is a good spell for you.<br>
<br>
Elemental Barrier - upgrade to Elemental armor not really useful if with other classes that have better FR/CR buffs.<br>
<br>
lure of Ro - low resist fire DD not very useful unless mob is very resistant to Sunstrike as of yet have not seen any mobs like this.<br>
<br>
Teleport - AE teleport to bind only useful at a raid.<br>
<br>
Agnarr's Thunder - One of the Best spells we get 2303 DD <br>
<br>
Draught of thunder - again not very useful if you have Agnar's thunder or Sunstrike<br>
<br>
Forceshield - absolutly useless spell most wizard's have epic by now. takes a dot to use this spell.<br>
<br>
Iceflame of E'ci - good spell self focus for DD's<br>
<br>
Draught of E'ci- as with the other draught spells pretty useless if you have other DD&quot;s<br>
<br>
Shield of Maelin- upgrade to Sheild of the Arcane very cool spell<br>
<br>
Tears of Arlyxir - another rain spell good damage to mana ratio if mobs don't resist it.<br>
<br>
Telekin - 900 DD stun spell not exactly a spell wizard would use much other classes much more efficent at stunning.<br>
<br>
Greater Decession - upgrade to Evacuate  again not a spell that was really needed.<br>
<br>
Shock of Magic - A good DD if someone knew the amount of damage it does.<br>
<br>
Strike of Solusek - The dream spell but it should have been a 3k at least damage spell.<br>
<br>
Tears of Marr - again another rain spell which is good if it's not resisted.<br>
<br>
Where are our PBAE's? or Pillars? no where i would glady trade some of the other spell types for those.<br>
<br>
I I still frimly believe wizard's are not wanted in groups more so now with PoP than ever because our DPS stinks due to the fact of our mana / damage ratios are so off.<br>
<br>
I will admit i'm not a good quadder so tell me where I can single pull mobs and solo them and make 20% AA exp in 20 minutes and i would be glad to go there. That place does not exsist and with our hampered abilities right now we are not wanted in groups.  We are charity cases only if there is not another class that has better dps will we ever be wnated in groups Rogues/rangers/monks/mages all have better DPs than wizards.<br>
<br>
Thwe point is we need some major balancing done to our class tro be desireable to group unless you got 5000 mana which if you in an Eliete guild like FoH you might have but for the average joe wizard it will never happen most of us will never be able to get EER or GSS either unless VI changes the way the spell drops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midgetgod>Midget God</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/28/02 1:31 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: balance issues</span><hr size=1> You need to be more specific in your arguments. Wizards do not and should not out dmg a mage in an xp group. Our nukes however should always outdmg the mage's nukes though.<br>
<br>
Also, get EER and GSS out of you head. PoP spells are much easier to get and better. The Draughts are nice. -10 resist check on em so they land easier. They are alot more mana efficient than our other spells. Its simple, if you have ID3: use sunstrike. If you  got ID4: use your level 60 nukes.<br>
<br>
btw, Telekin is pretty good 3:1 dmg/mana ration PLUS a good length stun, its a big plus in my book. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=papiboomboom>PapiBoomBoom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/28/02 5:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: balance issues</span><hr size=1> Wizard over dmg mage in group, i mean Wizard can over dmg mage in xp group, we have way less DPS but we can burn faster when group is in trouble.<br>
+ Some xp group need Evac, snare, root(if no mezz).<br>
Wizard dps with new focus dmg bard song/manasong/Potn(g)/Tranqu and some FT can be realy realy huge. I use IS/Destroction of ice/Draugh of Ec i (IS/IS2.0 are 60) With Iceflame of E ci bard song and ID3 (or even better cold dmg focus) and when i chain nuke i lose like no mana and IS/IS2.0 can hit for 2K w/o critical. I use Tears of Ro to which is good dmg/mana ratio, chain tears of Ro with KEI and potg i lose like no mana.<br>
<br>
Wizard can quad in HoH and get 1 aa per 45 min wich is HUGE, i  dont quad myself cause its realy to boring/ <br>
<br>
I feel that wizard are not liked in group like we allways been but i feel way more usefull with PoP because mob hit realy hard so have someone who  could do a lot of dmg in a lil time is realy more usefull.<br>
<br>
And of course 3700 mana ft2 will not let you do what 4K5/5K mana ft15 wizard can do but i m sorry bro but items help a lot in Everquest/<br>

I don't think I can say it better than Ikeya, but here it goes...<br>
<br>
<br>
1) If you wanted your Focus III items to stay top of the line to you, you shouldnt have leveled 61.  Heck, can I bitch about how my foci II items will become useless to me when I level 49? <br>
<br>
2) Can't solo a blue con?  Well, boo-effin-hoo!  There's classes out there who have trouble soloing some green cons, ya know.<br>
<br>
3) Mages cant evac, which , I understand, is once again a desireable ability in PoP.<br>
<br>
4) I thought an Enchanters 'bread and butter' in combat was mezzing, hasting and slowing.  KEI, and its moneymaking potential, is not a combat balance issue at all.  It just seems like an immense case of sour grapes to hear wizards bitch about this.  I suspect the ones who bitch loudest about it are also the ones who charged through the nose for ports for years prior.  Here's a newsflash for you : If you don't want to donate for KEI, DONT!  You will recover mana anyway.<br>

sorry 2 weeks ago i would have agreed with this, however as more and more people come to realise that we do fast decent DPS in exp groups in PoP with relatively low HP hard hitting mobs.<br>
For example i would never get random tells asking me to join a juggs group or velks groups pre-pop, but now i get random tells for PoN and PoD zones even without LFG on (usually when i'm camping some mob for my twink grrrr), so people are beginning to realise what an asset a wizard is to a group......<br>

<br>
End issue is, read the thread that Castaa has posted in ... uh originally Caster balance now into rants. There are some good points where you can revise your thoughts about wizards. I know wizards are not broken... altho still needs some retouching tho.<br>

<br>
Was at the wasps in PoStorms. We had 1 cleric, 1 enchanter, 1 warrior, 1 rogue, 1 wizard (me), and 1 shaman. Everyone was 60+, and well equipped. <br>
<br>
Total up time was 56minutes 57seconds. <br>
Wizard- 250,531 dmg total<br>
Rogue- 234,709 dmg total<br>
Warrior- 184,192 dmg total.<br>
<br>
DPS over entire uptime<br>
Wizard- 74 dps<br>
Rogue- 69 dps<br>
Warrior- 54 dps<br>
<br>
DPS over individual up-time (waiting to attack / cast for aggro reasons)<br>
Wizard- 130 dps<br>
Rogue- 82 dps<br>
Warrior- 62 dps<br>
<br>
Cleric pulled so thats why warrior DPS is a bit weird looking. Had several 4 pulls where we ran around rooting mobs and stuff so warrior DPS again is screwed.<br>
<br>
Had trouble keeping warrior and rogue in range to see melee dmg on a few fights. Their dmg is a little below what it is supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I used sunstrike and had ID3, SCF2, SCM3, conflag robe, and used a horse. Only twice did I get aggro and that was at the tail in of the fight. Do what you want with this information but if you think wizards are gimp, crappy, and seriously broken. Think again. <p>[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69194">Zuratuli</a> (Gnome) <<a href="http://www.insublimity.com">Sublimity</a>></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neydini>Neydini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/29/02 11:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Yes, but..</span><hr size=1> The glaring fact remains that 98% (on my server at least) of us are still using a Sunstrike spell that was first obtainable 3 expansions ago.  /ponder  <br>

Risk Vs Reward in gaining additional nuking abilities between classes is not even CLOSE to being balanced, and has not been for a long long time:  FBoT (Mage) , vendor drop /laughable   ..Moonfire..ever see this drop everytime you took out a MoB boss in Luclin ?  Oh yeah, they mages and druids get some pretty damn nice spells in PoP too, lest you forget, and new pets too..<br>
<br>
So to argue that there is relative balance and ignoring that the nerfs have sent us back comparitively speaking, is not warranted.<br>
<br>
I have FT 15, 85 aa's, NtOV &gt; loot..and I still think that a comparable Mage/Druid has much greater utility ..and now I am being outdamged in short bursts ?
