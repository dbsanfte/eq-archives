But if you talk to any serious enchanter in private, where verant aren't looking, they admit it is about as balanced as a Lennox Lewis/Britney Spears boxing match.<br>
<br>
Apparently some newbie enchanters who probably aren't of level enough to actually cast PoP charms, actually believe the anti-nerf propoganda posted on the chanter forums. I guess thats an unforseen sideeffect of the anti-nerf campaign.<br>
<br>
If verant undid the manaburn nerf, and made it mana-free, with a 10 second recast timer, it would be _less_ powerful than charm (though admittedly easier to use and more flexible).<br>

I'm assuming you aren't one of these serious enchanters, and I would further assume you haven't talked to one of them recently.  The &quot;nerf&quot; of affliction focus items makes charming a bit more difficult, although definitely not impossible, solo, and leaves the difficulty-level about the same in groups.<br>
<br>
Btw, the enchanter boards apparently are private -- Verant certainly isn't looking there with any regularity or it wouldn't have taken them the better part of a year to fix the affliction items. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One only needs Boltran's (low-50's charm) to realize the power of charm in PoP (and one only needs to make it to the mid-teens to realize the power of charm.)  Granted, it's advantage isn't quite as clearly delineated to Boltran's users as that of CoD, but the scale is easily seen.  Charm is powerful.  It's also risky.<br>
<br>
Overpowered?  I don't know.  I know quite a few solo 65 necro's who aren't lagging behind aa per unit of time with far less risk.  The factoring of resists (virtually non-existant) and short duration charms (much more existant,) deaths, downtime attributed to untimely charm breaks, pathing issues, and other deterimental conditions rarely take their place in the evaluation of charm by non-enchanters.  While it's easy to dismiss the claims of the enchanter who says &quot;No, it's not,&quot; it's also quite easy for those who aren't enchanters not to know what they're talking about.  Point being, the area is far more gray than you imply.  Perhaps the frustration some of the enchanter community feels is because they aren't considered 'serious' if what they feel doesn't correspond to what non-enchanters feel a 'serious' enchanter would believe. <br>
<br>
It doesn't really matter to me what they do to charm (although I'm partial to just making charms exempt from any focus effects.)  I'll still be charming one way or the other, and mostly in groups.  Soloing bores me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The two really aren't comparable. There is no risk associated with manaburn.  I don't think anything will ever be (or ever has been) as powerful as charm in the situations where it can be useful.<br>

Based on if the hits did not crit, but were not resisted, my dps in HOH quadding is 410dps when a quad is up out of about 540 possible. With flowing thought 15 allegiant flappy horse dagger of entrapment etc I'll finish that quad at 25-40% mana. That's with VOQ. At ~12 minutes realistically to a quad this is about 104,000hp dealt for 145dps.<br>
<br>
Compare that to the 900dps pets. I mean really, I saw 3 mages and 4 clerics and 2 enchanters kill emmerik skyfury(they had to pull pets back repeatedly with the portals down. 10 person kill. do people kill dain with 10?). The other guys just watched this bare minimum go and see if it could do it. I also checked into bastion of thunder the other day and watched a group from my guild go at it. Almsot the entire Sand wing of the zone had been cleared, I was able to navigate to them by following the corpses almost where sand started to close to the lord.<br>
<br>
This death thing doesn't seem to be much of a factor anymore, but a skill thing. At least this is so for the mages of my guild. The group previously mentioned I had checked with and watched for some kills. They didn't wipe for the 2 1/2 hours I'd checked with them, and using /time /time it was about 20 seconds to kill something, as in 2 minutes I saw 6 mobs pulled &amp; killed. I also grouped with a mage who died to a charm break once in 40 bot lord kills in about a week(no competition on kb) using muzzle/burnout haste.<br>
<br>
I haven't paid this much attention but this is what I'm getting at; this risk business is based largely on player skill. You can have a paladin or wizard stun a tashed pet on charm break and mage can gank it back. Quadding is similar, too. I'll admit that I die a lot less than these runs- actually one legitimate quadding death(non ld/crash/tech) in halls of honor in these 80aa spent at the spot when I was cutting it really close and got stuck for a half second on one of those rectangular prism things and the whole quad suddenly ran into my back - a feeble ~4800hps at that time for 500hitters - stunned and splatted me. When a wizard dies, he's got to drag a cleric or eat death, then find someone to VOQ or KEI him which of course is different than a group taking much longer than the setup for a group. But it also is a matter of skills- when youve quadded for long enough, I guess death can become something you don't run into very often. Same for some of the people I see charming. When they first go at it the GY in bot will be flooded with that mage's nude corpses. People experienced with charming I group with rarely die around their pet, and it's generally hasted.<br>
<br>
Later on I don't see many deaths, and checking with them confirms that. As for 'one' zone stuff... It's all you need at level 65, one zone. Having that limit hasn't prevented people from doing crazy aaxp... or basing all of their xping off of charm. None of what anyone has ever told me has indicated that charm is actually balanced. A good and practiced mage can make himself into a tDPS machine of 400 given deaths etc, from what I've seen. A 300 AA rogue with moderate ssra(guess) equip(basically someone taken over by my regular group as a bot who also raided but basically quit) was 153dps(72 seconds)s in this parse on most stuff, while Braan frienai was 654dps(70 seconds) and even had the charm drop midfight, though mage recharmed. I didn't even have to stun it.<br>
<br>
Obviously what you can do with charm way outperforms what anybody else can do. I would think that's unbalanced as there's people who, with some practice, are taking the sustained longer term tdps range to 300-400 when the next melee is not able to go over 200! <br>
<br>
Then again I got my strike of solusek while using charmed mobs to kill a named a long time back. I've benefitied from it but I am a fan of balance- and the devs are too I'd think by now. There can't be any question as to whether or not this is overpowered. I have seen what good mages/enc do with this, and if you can't power past a 'well formed'(pre pop) regular group, then I would assume you're not good at this. Even if it's not brought in line with wizards, look at rogues:<br>
<br>
They can't melee an AE ramping mob. Outdone by rangers there.<br>
Rogues don't outdamage me on raids, scratch high raid DPS.<br>
With graveyards, rogues aren't needed for CR.<br>
In groups, the sustained dps of a good mage parsed has been around 300-400. Since rogue dmg is pretty pathetic compared to this, I don't see a lot of them grouped so don't have good figures. Still, 37-50% as good dmg as a mage.<br>
<br>
While not picking on rogues, I'm looking for some sort of benchmark here. They used to be what was the top sustained dps, often doubling over wizards in graphs. Now if everything is balanced, someone explain to me what a rogue is the best for in POP, other than moving around and not getitng aggro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br>  Posts: 3375<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/03 6:11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm53.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mage dps with charm</span><hr size=1> Honestly I could care less about charm soloing.

While I agree that charm has problems your overall presentation is rather whiny.  After reading your posts I actually come out thinking charm is less overpowered than I thought before.<br>

They are different mobs, the strategies used to kill them are supposed to be different.  And how is Dain supposed to be a fair comparison?  Dain is the boss of his zone.  You want the boss of BoT go say hi to Agnarr.  Skyfury is a gimp Agnarr sycophant.  Besides I would not be surprised to see 10 people kill Dain.  Just people don't want to because Dain sucks.<br>

At least this is so for the mages of my guild. The group previously mentioned I had checked with and watched for some kills.

I also grouped with a mage who died to a charm break once in 40 bot lord kills in about a week(no competition on kb) using muzzle/burnout haste<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes but you can't write it off as a factor when babbling on about 900dps pets.  You need to give all factors their appropriate weight.  Assuming that charm-breaking is an ultimate balance factor is a mistake, but totally writing off its effects is equally problematic.<br>
<br>
But yes the 20 second kills are compelling.  I do believe charmed pets that can outtank any melee while doing the dps of a whole group are overpowered.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I haven't paid this much attention but this is what I'm getting at; this risk business is based largely on player skill.

Players working together is a good thing.  There should be more to the game than just mob-hits-tank, cleric-heals-tank, damagers-damage, chanters-buff-mez.  The issue is if relatively few people that need to work together to achieve far more than should be possible.<br>

Charm can accomplish so much in BoT that people never want to xp anywhere else.  <br>
<br>
Fleshing out this argument is critical.  Everyone should have situations where they are more powerful than others, but no ability should be so powerful that it causes whole groups to leech off that one skill for far more xp/loot than could be earned otherwise.  Not that I blame anyone for taking advantage of charm as it exists.  Not in the slightest.  I think it's the natural thing to do.  Unfortunately I think it is bad for the game.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They can't melee an AE ramping mob. Outdone by rangers there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am no expert but I'm told that AE rampage can be dealt with in ways other than simply having all the melees sit aside.<br>
<br>
One seperate issue when it comes to melees, is that charmed pets cannot hold aggro over melees, which makes melee useless in such fights.

Mages have always been good dps.  All-mage groups have kicked ass since the original game, and except for the disparity in difficulty of epics, mages and rogues have always been competitive in xp groups damage-wise.  Any number of periods went by when one was moderately more powerful than the other and there were no major problems.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cabottp>CabotTP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 476<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/03 11:00:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm53.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mage dps with charm</span><hr size=1> I just witnessed the BoT mage charm-killing a named thing last night for the first time, and it wasn't *as* bad as some make it out to be.  For one, the mage didn't do it solo, and probably couldn't have.  The group was Mage, Enc, Cleric it seemed (they were all anon, but that's what they seemed to be without getting too close).  The mob they were attempting was Gaukr Sandstorm (the south wing named).  They had at least one full group wipeout, possibly two, from charms breaking.  They did eventually kill the named, which dropped them 2 Runes, but it was quite obviously a very high-risk high-skill encounter for them.  After witnessing it, I would equate us bitching about it to other classes bitching about AE Seb back in the day - sure it sounds insanely imbalanced, but when you realize it's very risky and takes a fair amount of skill and luck to pull off, it's not so bad.<br>
<br>
The only thing I saw that kinda ticked me a little bit was that when the charm broke on the elemntal the mage would jump on the teleport pad to the courtyard and somehow escape death that way - but that's probably more of a mob/zone design issue that needs to be fixed rather than a mage problem. <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3741</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cabottp>CabotTP</A> at: 2/21/03 11:09:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=istari@graffeswizardcompilation>Istari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/23/03 10:28:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm53.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> rog v mag?</span><hr size=1> My aaxp rate: 95-125% aaxp/hr. This is halls of honor quadding(with ft15 2% mana pres and every xp boosting aa there is). One issue I see with 900dps pets is that a chain nuking wizard goes to the average of 502dps with full AAs and focus- whatever happened to being the masters of fast damage? I came back with a tdps including charm breaks that comes to around 400. You'll notice that my chain nuking dps is 410, under half of what mage pets are doing in bot. I'm also a gimp class in groups now, pro<br>
<br>
In days of pre-pop, rogue and mage dmg wasn't too far apart. Now a rog can be 150dps to something w/ similar tier status and quantity equip as a mage that can do 400tdps. What do you call close? I wouldn't call it 2 2/3 times as strong as the other. The pet alone is 400tdps, then you add in mage nukes at about 91% of a wizard's efficiency(but less mana gen), which makes that go up. It's often useful to read the whole post before responding. 900dps doesn't describe charm's xping power, but 400tdps does.<br>
<br>
All of this can be achieved indefinately in a character's XPing time. Once you reach 65, you can xp bot and never have it green out. People dont need to go elsewhere- they can do it all right there. Having it limited to this zone is not much of a weakness. What I see right now is that mage dps for xp has just blown past every other form of xp. I think that charm would be balanced for xp at around 220tdps in a group. Those are still really strong pets, and will help xp a lot for a group to take them on.  The difference though will be that charm won't be such a central theme to great xp- nor quite so overpowered as its current state. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anukia>Anukia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/24/03 2:22:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm53.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rog v mag?</span><hr size=1> Last night, our ranger in group tracked Leaf up in zone while we camping earth lvl 64 nameds (not Gaukr), we sent ppl to check if Leaf camped and found 8 ppl there trying to take Leaf down so we stayed at our spot.

Seems that we really shouldn't be all that worried about other classes abilities. More to the point, we should be worried about our own abilities. Manaburn being reinstated as it was, with a 15 sec timer instead of a minute (one can grumble about the amount of time, but a minute is too much). Exodus, should be lowered substantially in the recharge time, even at 50 minutes with AA lowering the recharge time, is too long. Something more along the lines of 30 minutes with AA. People love the 1/10 of a second cast time. It's the basic get out of jail free card.<br>
<br>
Do other classes have a lot of power? Sure do, I group with a chanter and cleric all the time, we own the top of floor tactics, and the AA exp rolls in. Do we die? Yep, sure do, but not nearly as often as others want to say that chanters die. Should chanters be nerfed? hell no. Should problems of the wizard class be looked at instead? Hell yes. Especially as someone pointed out the aggro that we wizards get, if I could get one thing fixed it would be that. Personally I don't want to pull other classes down, in order to elevate myself up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caelestor>Caelestor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/2/03 9:25:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm53.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pulling others down, in order to elevate oneself</span><hr size=1> lol, if youre crying about mages, you either havent got any necroes or chanters on the server or you've missed them.<br>

<br>
The wizard is my main and first character, so I feel I have been on both sides of the fence. I leveled these toons from lvl 1 up to 65, with exception of chanter (wifes) and warrior (sons). <br>
<br>
Mages solo'ing constantly die/train zoneout/or use portals. Without a healer a charmed elemental is good for maybe 2 kills, unless you can get casters which would stretch pet abit longer if charm lasts. The time it takes for one of these elementals to heal even a bubble, while charmed is longer than charm lasts. Mages don't slow. When charm breaks mage get's summoned by the thing your fighting and it with  your former pet have you back at bind point before your have time to read the text saying charm broke. It can be done and you can get positive exp doing it, but it's much more effective grouping.<br>
<br>
I would like to address the all classes should be balanced issue. Gads, let's just make everyone one class so there can be not dispute about who is more powerful. Balance is a hard issue to quantify when your dealing with different skill sets, does wizard evac and teleports make them too powerful? <br>
<br>
The fact mages have a 65 spell that can be used to get good exp at high risk in 1 zone doesn't seems like reason to start class envy. I frequently have charm break in less than 60 seconds 5 times in a row. Sometimes it breaks in less than 3 seconds. Bravo to those wizards that say wizards should focus on wizard issues. Like what the heck is the purpose of MB when I can crit for over 6k now? For those of you that really think mages are overpower, please create/buy/borrow one and try it for awhile. If it's everything you thought it would be play the mage. The main reason my mage goes to raids is debuff and summon focus items. The debuffs let my wizard tear stuff up.<br>
<br>
Because BoT is the only place this spell really works, it is VERY crowded on our server. Most weekends I can't find a camp open unless I log on before 6am.<br>
<br>
Even with taking many precaustions and being very skilled I die alot with this spell. Charm seems to break most often when your fighting stuff, which means mage normally dies. When my wife and I don't use charm, we can pull non-stop without danger. The exp is still faster with pet, over a period of hours, but not by as much as you'd imagine and the increase in danger is probably more than 20 times. <br>
<br>
In any raid outside of BoT my wizard will do 2-3x the dmg. Being lvl 65 wizard with SoS, really makes playing a wizard fun again.<br>
<br>
It's a great spell while in BoT, when it works right, when it doesn't (seems like 4 out of 5 times it doesn't), well you get good a meming your spells and medding.<br>
<br>

Charm IS powerfull. Just go to potactics and watch those enchanters who are sitting in the arena with a charmed pet NEXT to a click escape stone. That's right, no risk, they click and are transported out of the zone.<br>
