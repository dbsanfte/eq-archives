<br>
By the way staff of the wheel you need help with exactly one part.  The rod in lower guk.  The rest are easy to get on your own, though you will need to buy two potions of enduring breath. <p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td>Aelina</td></tr>

<br>
------<br>
<br>
This quest results in possibly one of the best mainhand items for a wizard, the Staff of the Wheel. The quest is about collecting ten NO DROP rod pieces from around the world, and is given out by a wizard named Sulgar in a white robe standing with two other quest NPC's along the north wall in Everfrost Peaks, at approximately 3000, -3000. Hail him, and he will talk about Tarton's Wheel. Reply to his sentences, and you can ask him to give you either the book of hints containing pretty mysterious and cryptic clues as where to find the rods, and / or the container in which you must combine the ten rod pieces. The container is no rent so ask him for it as the last thing you do (after you've collected the rods - they are *not* no rent), so that you don't lose anything in the container if you go LD or log accidentially.<br>
 <br>
The rods look like a Fighting Baton (small golden, decorated rod), and spawn on the ground. When picked up, it respawns in about 30 seconds, so if you're unable to find a certain rod, don't think that it's because some other person picked it up before you. They are all named 'A Rod', and are MAGIC, LORE and NO DROP. However, use your level 16 Identify spell, target yourself, hold the rod in your cursor and cast the spell - you'll get a message saying excactly what rod you're holding.<br>
 <br>
Most important of all: Be at least level 24, and have the level secured so you won't lose it from possibly dying once or more. This is because you will have all your self-only gates at this point, which makes doing the quest a LOT easier. They didn't place the rods all over the world so that a wizard doing the quest would have to ask others for ports. We are the masters of teleports. I have heard stories about people losing several levels while doing this quest, but I personally only died once, and I could easily had avoided that single death so don't worry.<br>
 <br>
Also it's often asked if you'll have problems doing this quest if you're a Dark Elf - and the question is...well, it depends on your religion. I'm an Agnostic Dark Elf, and I'm pretty much dubious in all 'good' cities (perhaps except the Wood/High Elf ones), which is good enough to get through. I walked through Highpass Hold without problems, Qeynos too (had to get to Erud's Crossing), and it actually helped to be a Dark Elf since it could have been very risty to get the rod in Neriak if I hadn't been a Dark Elf. However, if you've chosen Innoruuk as your religion, you might be KOS several places and will have to rely heavily on invisibility. Sulgar, the quest NPC is on the 'beta neutral' faction, and will con indifferent to everyone.<br>
 <br>
You'll also need some enduring breath potions, they'll come in very handy and you can't expect people to be around to give you enduring breath as the rods are located in very isolated areas of Norrath. There are many rods located in places where you will die if you can't breathe long enough, and drowning kills you FAST. I lost about 65 HP's per second from drowning and almost died at one point as a result. You can buy them from potion vendors found in cities, for example in Kelethin from the merchant outside the bank, for about 15pp. Also, bring some cash to possibly pay for sow's, camo's, etc.<br>
 <br>
Of course, you're helping yourself greatly by having maps of all the zones you're about to visit, so browse eqmaps.com and eqatlas.com and print out all the ones you feel are necessary. And...don't forget to bind yourself near the zone lines to the places you visit in case you die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
Now, where to find the rods....<br>
 <br>
[Aiza - Erud's Crossing] It's in the deep part of the sea, near the ship surrounded by zombies, on the right side of it. Enduring breath will come in handy, but isn't needed. I didn't see any sharks, they've been removed in a patch I think. The location of the rod is -1162, 2340.<br>
 <br>
[Beza - Everfrost Peaks] Need enduring breath. Jump down the hole in the frozen ice river at approximately 2400, -4000 and swim north, to the cave. Walk around a bit through the maze until you see a hut. There are 3 icebone skeletons inside that agro everything, but they're only about level 12 or so, so they shouldn't be a bit problem. Don't freak out when they start casting a weak ice dd on you. I had an sow, ran in and took the rod, then started running and they seemingly didn't follow, so I just gated out without a problem.<br>
 <br>
[Caza - Lake Rathetear] Need the following: enduring breath, superior camo. Asking a druid is good as they have both. There are some deepwater goblins (level 35, some see invis, some don't - hence the need for *superior* camo) and an ultra high level epic mob named Deep guarding the rod, so you're DEAD if you get seen, no chance out. I entered from South Karana, and headed straight south with levitate on, to the first island with the large tower with a flame on top of it. Now go right around it, and jump into the water - you'll see a tunnel going into the island and east. Swim through, and stay in top of the tunnel. You'll notice that the tunnel widens, but stay in the middle, until you see the undewater tower. Quickly go in and snag the rod on the top floor of it and get outta there.<br>
 <br>
[Dena - Dagnor's Cauldrun] Need enduring breath unless you're very quick and have good swimming skill. Rod can be tough to locate, but it's at -890 -740, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. Stand outside the entrance facing away from it, then head left. Stay near the slanting cliff so that you can see the ground, get the rod, and swim up. Also, watch out for goblins nearby, some were blue to me at lvl 24, they don't see invis though.<br>
 <br>
[Ena - Lower Guk] Walk through upper guk with regular invis on. I might add that it'll be a good idea to wait until peak hours with getting this rod, since most stuff will be camped and not much will be in your way, making it much easier. Now, get an invis to undead, and start walking. If you've ever been to the ass/sup camp with a rogue or bard, you head to that place, but turn right just before the ladder. Then you go through a pretty complex maze until you see some water - swim *up* and you get to the 'hand room'. There lies the rod on the ground.<br>
 <br>
[Fana - Oasis of Marr] There's a big visible tower guarded by spectres in the middle of the lake of the oasis, but that's not where you want to go. Needed: superior camo, it's guarded by more deepwater goblins. The *underwater tower* is located Southeast of the spectre tower. The goblins at the bottom of the tower don't see invis, the top ones do - and are casters and wiped me out in a few seconds. It's a small swim though, so you don't need end. breath. Rod is again located on the top floor of the tower.<br>
 <br>
[Geza - Highpass Hold] Invis if you're KOS here. Walk past the orcs, up to the bridge with the guard, over it, and walk down near the shop where two highpass citizens are standing near the water. Jump into the water on the left, and pick up the rod right in front of the waterfall.<br>
 <br>
[Heda - Qeynos Catacombs] Maze-like area, but that's what a good map is for. This is a newbie area, so you shouldn't run into troubles. Still, go invis to avoid trouble. Walk down to the shark pit located at around 700, -150. Take a dip into the water and get the rod.<br>
 <br>
[Izah - Neriak Commons] Risky if you're KOS since the guards will slaughter you quickly. However, a normal invis (which you can cast yourself) should be just fine. Walk down past the Priest of Discord, up on the bridge, and jump down into the water on the right. Look around for four square windows, the rod is on the ground in front of them along with a silver coin which isn't related to this quest.<br>
 <br>
[Jaka - Estate of Unrest] Lots of annoying undead here, but they should be pretty green to you, so no worries. Head right when you get in, and jump into the water past the hut. Swim right, and up where you'll find a small pad with the rod on it.<br>
 <br>
Now that you've collected all the rods, it's time to finish the quest. Head back to Everfrost, locate Sulgar, and get the container he talks about. Place all the ten rods in it, and hit the Combine button. Finally, you can harvest the award, Staff of the Wheel, along with the Star of Eyes which you can right click for a mana-free, instant-cast Identify.<br>
 <br>
You can turn in these two items to recieve the Rune of Frost and Rune of The Astral, but this is primarily something you'd do in the old days of EverQuest where the level 49 nuke Ice Comet was very tough to get the runes for and research. These days though, you can either buy the spell on the open market or even find the research runes on merchants, so that's nothing to worry about. Keep and enjoy this fine item. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub87.ezboard.com/utinkerbells.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tinkerbells</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/18/01 3:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lvl 25 Quests</span><hr size=1> Thanks for all the help... if anyone is reading this and is on the karana server and has done this quest(staff of the wheel) pls send me a tell anytime (Tinkerbells) or hey .. e-mail me! tynkerbells@hotmail.com<br>
