Really, he was probably much more limited by aggro than mana...It only takes one or two gaining aggro moments at that level to learn that getting aggro as a wizard == BAD. If he didn't, and everything died asap...then his group leader is in the wrong place.  PC is an &quot;I want to level ASAP&quot; zone.  <br>

<br>
I got my first KEI as a newbie at level 8... MGB'd in rivervale.  I went fishing, and thought my mana bar was broken because it wasn't going down as I was practicing my root/nuke on myself... hehe.<br>
<br>
Other than that one time, the first time I got it and knew what it was I was level 30, and it is like turning God mode on at that level.<br>
<br>
It makes you just like the guy in this post, Mr. Wheeler vs. Mr. Walker for anyone who ever watched that.  You want more more more mobs to kill, because you have enough mana to handle anything, you're the king of the world.<br>
<br>
My guess would be the rest of the group needed to med a bit, maybe the cleric, and you were screaming at them to pull more mobs, maybe more politely.  I'd imagine the group leader, being prudent and wanting the cleric to have mana, asked you to chill and &quot;tone it down&quot;.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
I think MGB and Group buffs shouldn't land on people under the level the spell is intended for, for KEI I think that is 45.  I am no hypocrite either, I thought that within half an hour of first getting it at level 30.  I posted about it at level 40, I don't think it would be that hard to fix.  Same with Ageo etc. simply should ignore the people under lvl 45 when MGB'd or Group cast.<br>
<br>
As for the guy comparing it to a fungi... well a fungi costs 50k on most servers, and just makes you last a bit longer in a fight.  It will not let you single handedly take down triple the amount of mobs you previously were able to.  Also C3 is a 25pp or less donation, so you don't need to be a twink to get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wandork>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Warriors ph34r me!<BR>Gnomercy for Gno-one!</span><br>  Posts: 2070<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 10:37:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25485.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning!!-Dont forget to Feed </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for the guy comparing it to a fungi... well a fungi costs 50k on most servers, and just makes you last a bit longer in a fight.

You're right, a fungi enables a melee to take down more like 10x as many mobs. My 34 monk can solo dark blue+ mobs nonstop with a fungi on.<br>
<br>
Many of the posters here are correct. PC is the the PL zone of choice these days. If other people wanted more action, pull more mobs - you can only nuke so much even with KEI on. I have never had anyone complain that the mobs where dying too fast or that exp was going up too fast. <p><div align="center" class="font-size: 11px; font-family: arial">

Even though lots of the low levels running around these days are twinks and/or alts, there is actually some small number of true newbies playing this game.<br>
<br>
About the last time I logged on my alt wizard (with KEI, heh), I wandered into a PC group similar to the one mentioned above which was made up of actual true newbies.  They had crap for gear and didn't really know a darn thing about what they were doing.  It was almost cute.  They were happy to have my KEI-enhanced nuking ability in the group though.<br>
<br>
Not much compares to the fun-factor of a lowbie wizard with KEI. <p>-<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4773">Ruldar Swiftnote</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> &lt;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqclanx.com">Clan X</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Maestro of the Rathe</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artillis>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Arcanist<BR>Enjoys Sheep Erotica</span><br>  Posts: 1737<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 12:40:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25485.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning!!-Dont forget to Feed </span><hr size=1> If i were in that situation and the group leader had asked me to tone it down and I wasn't geting agro I would have said to the group;  Hey what does everyone else think should i slow down my nuking so we get less exp or should I keep laying the smack down and frying mobs before they know what hit them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysthawk>Mysthawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/03 12:52:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25485.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning!!-Dont forget to Feed </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It will not let you single handedly take down triple the amount of mobs you previously were able to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Actually a Fungi Tunic does.

I disagree with the sentiment of many of the replies here. I don't like being in a group in which I am not needed. If someone is completely dominating a group so that I am just along for the ride, I will leave the group. I play to have fun, and gaining experience is not fun by itself. I seem to hold the minority opinion on the subject though.<br>

<br>
You are assuming that the people in question are massively twinked. Yes, PC is the current fast-leveling zone of choice in that level range, but it is also where people are told to go.<br>
<br>
All that I meant was that I will not stay in a group that doesn't need me. I am not interested in gaining experience by watching other people play the game. Contrary to what has been posted here, there are some people who would complain if it is a super twinked melee dominating the action. In game experiences and posts in this thread tell me that if I said &quot;I'm not needed here, I'll be on my way&quot; I should expect a response along the lines of &quot;You're getting xp, shut your hole&quot;<br>

I think in hindsight, since I was twinked above what the group was I should have just gone solo as i was killing the mobs fast and the group was lagging.  Maybe the others wanted to kill and work skills too and with me putting the mobs under quickly it was interfering.<br>
<br>
As far as KEI and it being overpowered for casters under a certain level, with todays gear available to melee that are faster and harder hitting weps and better armor, the game dynamics have changed and the mobs in new expansions are have more hits, so unless they have changed the amount of mana you gain at each level for start up wizards since eq release, I think KEI and other mana regen spells are sort of a balance and makes the game more fun for new players to stick, as it should be fun and not work.<br>

Twinked Melee easily do more damage than even a very twinked caster of the same level because of the disparity between gear and spells.  I believe this disparity should be corrected so that the classes recieve equal benefits from their gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
Melee get weapons and armor as guild quests.  This makes sense, as weapons and armor are the primary things those classes are after--- this is exceedinly true to the un-twinked melee.  When your looking at a Dragoon Dirk as an upgrade to your current stabber, and mourning that it's an incredible 40pp plunge into the bank, those guild quests are very hard, but they are at least (to them) worth it.<br>
<br>
Casters, on the other hand get weapons and armor from their guild quests..../boggle.  In the Pre-luclin era, this was to be expected, because there was nothing short of xp that could improve what a caster does, which is casting spells.  Now, with the introduction of spell foci and Flowing Thought items, there is something to help the lowbie caster.  Level 1, and possibly level 2 foci should be questable at your home guild.  A small amount of Flowing Thought should be questable too, for Higher level(30'ish) casters.  This is when KEI starts to become necessary to even hope to keep up with a group of average equiped melee.  The current guild quests for casters offers a few Int items(good) but very little else that is worth the time and effort even to a caster that is untwinked.<br>
<br>
I have no problem at all with balancing through gear, but there needs to be equity.  Armor and weapons do wonders for a melee, but do very little for us.  In truth, it has happened that people have banked or even destroyed end game items for lack of foci effects.  These effects are integral to what we do, so we want them very badly.  We should be able to get starting levels of these abilities at the starting levels.  I can not think of a single level 1 focus item that was retroactivly fitted with focus effects that is actually useful for the level that can reasonably aquire the item--most of those items would be a challenge for a group in the high 20's, yet they don't work on spells above 20.  Level 1 effects should be obtainable at the latest the early teens so the item see's some play before becoming obsolete.<br>
<br>
Also, since spells you can cast are determined by level, there should be buffs or items that raise your casting level.  If a level 1 melee can equip a Fine Steel Sword (not obtainable as loot till mid teens) and use it to it's full effectiveness, then a level 1 similarly twinked caster should be casting spells from a circle or 2 up as well.  Most will consider this a bit over the top, but unless they level restrict every item in game to slightly lower than the level it's obtainable, then they should make spells usable below their normal level as well. <p><br>

Was he twinked? Dear lord yes! Did he get power leveled....yup had my 54 druid with him the entire time. Was it fun....hell yes! For me the fun factor is the only reason to play a game. <br>
<br>
If you grouped with my alts would you be able to tell I do not know how to play the class? Probably not at all.<br>
<br>
I have a 65 wizard...we wizards love to research things so I research any alt I am going to play for weeks before I even create them. Learning all the tricks to the class and where and how they fit into a group or raid. <br>
<br>
Would I trade that 49 days I spent getting my wizard to lvl 50 for todays high speed journey to lvl 50? Not on your life!!! Those 49 days were amazing, filled with wonder, awe, excitement, fear, and sometimes incredible frustration and endless downtime. <br>
<br>
To keep the thread on track I think the group leader from the original post was in the family of somewhat twinked but it also being his first character. He wants to level fast but also wants the excitement of the journey. I have to agree with Whiz here PC is not the place he should be hunting. He should be in a group in the heart of the sarnak fort in LOIO wondering if he is going to get feared on the next pull and not hearding blues into the maw of the xp grinder. There is noting wrong with twinking but you cant have it both ways.<br>
