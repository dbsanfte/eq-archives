Realistically speaking, we're completely MELEE oriented.  Think about it.<br>
<br>
Monks have a special attack, in addition to their melee striking, and the special attack recycles over time.  They can heal themselves by 50% of their max hp in a certain period of time.  They wear magically reinforced cloth (usually), and drop out of monster aggro to avoid damage<br>
<br>
Rogues have Backstab: a super powered attack, which recycles over time, and they have weak armour.  They have very limited weapon choices, and make themselves invisible to avoid damage.<br>
<br>
Wizards have powerful magical attacks, really poor melee skills, crap armour.  Bad weapons choices.  We can restore a fixed amount of our mana at regular intervals (extended intervals)  It works out to a shrinking amount of restoration, from 20% to about 10%.  We seperate ourselves from the immediate vicinity of our target to avoid damage.<br>
<br>
The only difference between us and pure melees is our use of hp instead of mana.  We are still one of the core ingredients in a successful epic encounter, and a well-known stereotype.  All 3 classes are specialized to do exactly the same thing: we drag monsters to our group (which may just be us) and whup the living crap out of it.  Nothing else.<br>
<br>
The comparison breaks down, however, when you consider the innate abilities of the other two classes.  <br>
The monk can restore his &quot;fuel statistics&quot; very rapidly, through mend, bind wound, and sitting, and can be restored completely by a cleric in under 6 seconds.  <br>
The rogue is specialized to avoid taking damage in the first place, systematically removing himself from the monster's attentions.  Although he cannot bind wound past 50%, a cleric can fully restore him just as quickly as he can a monk.<br>
The wizard is capable of preventing himself from taking any physical damage at all, but it is not his primary source of fuel, and it has a platinum cost to do so, a cost that outweighs the amount of money to be gained by the wizard through its duration of use.  However, we don't run out of life (hopefully) in the course of completing our only goal.  We run out of mana.<br>
<br>
Our harvest ability, gained halfway through life, is -less effective- than the monk's innate healing ability which he has his whole life, and far far far behind the cleric's healing ability.  Our attacks deplete our primary source of fuel.  A rogue of our same level does not automatically lose 10% of his health every time he backstabs.  We are the only class that destroys itself -every time- we seek to do damage.  Necromancers and Shaman convert their hitpoints to mana to restore this supply, but both have a very viable way to regain their hitpoints as well (aside from being healed by a cleric)  Mages are pet oriented, and do not rely on their mana as their primary source of damage.  All Priest classes (which are primarily dependent on others for their damage output) can convert their hitpoints to mana using a mana stone, and then heal themselves at a profit.  Enchanters can enhance the mana regeneration rate of themselves and others, but are not primarily dependant on their own statistics for damage dealing.  Bards can enhance both hitpoints AND mana, at no detriment to themselves, and also do not depend on mana as their primary source of damage.<br>
Wizards, as a class, are dependant on our mana for all measurable damage we do (Aside from those who own 3 robes, unattainable by 95% of our class, and these are more than outmatched by items available to other classes, which give regeneration, healing, or DD) but are the only class without the ability to obtain reperation for it.  Every other class can be restored to combat readiness at a rapid pace, except for the wizard.<br>
If it is feared that giving us the ability to return ourselves to a contributive position will cause us to seperate from others, is it not reasonable to assume that, since direct damage does not cancel itself out, even directly making us more capable of dealing damage would increase our desire to group with each other?<br>
Necromancers, Druids, Shaman, and Bards function better by themselves than in large groups of like classes because their spells block out similar spells from the same class, or the other 3.<br>
<br>
If the worry is that a more powerful or faster recuperating wizard will fight by himself, then this is unfounded.  A group of 6 wizards is 6 times as powerful as a wizard by himself, because we are a MELEE class.  <br>
6 warriors= 6 times as powerful as a warrior by himself.<br>
6 monks= 6 times as powerful as a monk by himself.  <br>
6 rogues= 6 times as powerful as a rogue by himself.  <br>
These 4 are the -melee- classes.<br>
The tactics used change as you add more to the party, but performance is always enhanced by increased numbers.<br>
<br>
  Ranger abilities can cancel each other out, as can a Shadowknight's, Bard's, or Mage.  While these four are group oriented, a full group of the same class is less effective than substituting 3 or 4 of them for other classes, because of these overlapping abilities.  These are the Hybrid Classes.<br>
<br>
The Paladin is between melee and hybrid, as his hp/ac buff spells do not stack between paladins, but all of his melee and healing abilities do.<br>
<br>
Caster Classes: The Caster Classes are Cleric, Enchanter, Druid, Necromancer, and Shaman.  In the proper situations, these classes are absolutely vital to a group's survival.  However, they do not work well in large numbers together, because ALL of their abilities overlap with members of their own class.  More than two of any of these in a single group is folly, and detrimental to the group's success.  In some cases, you don't need this person in the group at all, and are actually better off just recieving the effects of their spells.<br>
<br>
Wizards only become more of an asset as you increase the number in a group.  We should be supported, not lessened.  As the situation now stands, our effectiveness is not on par with our fellow melee classes- something that needs to change, unless our class is to be redirected.  There is no reason to believe Wizards would become more solo oriented should our ability to perform be enhanced.<br>
<br>
If the barrier to improving any facet of our class is that we would make everyone progress through the levelling process too quickly, that is a seperate issue altogether, and something that has not been stated to us as a reason for our continued state of Neglect.  Please consider the above, and respond with your own thoughts.<br>

I agree that it is a very good analysis of the situation. I truely wonder what goes through the collective mind of Verant when they read such posts as presented in the defunct Official Class Balance thread. These posts never received a direct response and it leaves us to sift through the hints and evasions to put together a clear picture. I recently posted my observations and conclusions, but I still dream of cornering Verant, presenting them with the facts and figures and forcing them to address each and every item with an honest answer. Seems some have tried this at the Fan Faires and came away with few answers. Oh well, some desires will remain unfulfilled. <p>Merkus Stormcrow (40, High Elf, Wizard)

<br>
If a warrior takes x damage when he destroys a mob. Then two warriors will take a total of x/2 of damage when they destroy a mob since it will go at twice the speed. If you split that damage even on the warriors they will take x/4 damage each, making two warriors FOUR times as effective as one. In the same way 3 warriors would be nine times as effective as one due to the fact that they share the damage.<br>
On the other hand if 2 wizards destroys a mob they will still need the same amount of mana to do it, in effect you have a wizard with twice the mana pool.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=294.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=294.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=294.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=294.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=294.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=294.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm60">Graffe Forum News<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General EQ Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm59">General OT Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm58">Equipment Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm42">Tales & Accomplishments<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Retirement Notices<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm53">Planes of Power Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm57">Important Wizard Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quest Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm43">Spell Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm56">Spell Location Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing and Quad-Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">Grouping Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PvP Discussion & Tactics<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm45">Deleted Posts<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="www.graffe.com">Home</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
