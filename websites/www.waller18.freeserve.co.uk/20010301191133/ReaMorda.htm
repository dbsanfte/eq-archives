							<h2>The Dark Star House</h2>
							<BR>
							The first House of the Underdark city of Dyar'Turic, House Rea'Morda  (once known as the Black Spider Reavers) came to power through the sale of it's own specially concocted narcotic derived from Underdark fungus's and known as White Dragon.  White Dragon has made the House wealthy, but paranoid & thus it keeps to it's self  (which is however perfect for the way the House operates).  
							<BR>
							They see themselves as a traditional Drow House (the Matron Mother will only take a full blood Drow from within her own household as Patron for example, this also does not demean the House rank of Patron as some Matron Mothers sometimes do.  Also the House is properly named after it's Matron Mother unlike some Drow noble households)and are staunch worshippers of Lloth the Spider Queen.  
							<BR>
							The land that Dyar'Turic is built on was given to House Rea'Morda by Saravey Gereshen herself for services & arangements (Although very few whisper she just wanted the Rea'Morda household out of her city of Velddrinnsshar, but they are very quiet whispers indeed, but who knows?), But House Rea'Morda have mentained strong ties to House Gereshen ever since, not to mention the fact that Ilharess Rea'Morda's current House Patron was many years ago a member of the Gereshen household, before he joined the Rea'Morda household.  
							<BR>
							House Rea'Morda will have now attended the Gathering of Nations 5 times, each time expanding it's numbers and power, Rea'Morda agents are everywhere always watching, always listening, the many services it has performed for the Tarantula Faction will never be sung of.
							<BR>
							The Darkstar House shines unseen.
