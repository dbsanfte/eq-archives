  <P><B>1)</B> One must conduct themselves in the best possible manner at all 
  times REGARDLESS of their "role playing" or what is happening in their real 
  life (this includes drunken outbursts, stress, real life problems, etc). 
  Examples:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>i) if you are a Drow Cleric you must behave or find another guild that 
      allows your dark humour <BR>ii) if you get really drunk and have violent 
      outburst you will be added to the Smeg List and another outburst will 
      undoubtably get you guildremoved.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>2)</B> Anything that is considered abuse/harassment sexual or otherwise 
  is <B>NOT</B> an issue of the Guild or of members of the guild. It is to be 
  /reported or /petitioned to the EQ Customer Representatives. If you can not 
  deal with the persons continue attacks use /ignore to ignore the person. It is 
  NOT to be brought up on the boards unless an enquiry is made into someone that 
  is banned from the game.</P>
  <P><B>Conduct on the Boards</B></P>
  <P><B>1)</B> The boards are <B>NOT</B> to be used in a "flame fest". If I deem 
  a post to be an attack on another player you will be added to the Smeg List. 
  If you feel I (Feonyx) have attacked or flamed you please say so on the boards 
  in a non-offensive manner and I will ask other officers if I went "over board" 
  and yes add myself to the dreaded Smeg List.</P>
  <P><B>2)</B> The boards are to be used for Raid Planning, General Discussions, 
  Jokes, etc. etc. They are <B>NOT</B> to be used by passed members of the guild 
  in any other form other than that which benefits the guild, is a "HI! How are 
  you guys doing?", raid planning, useful links, etc. If you have a complaint 
  against the guild bring it up to me and I will post it if it seems 
  appropriate. </P>
  <P>Violators or the above rules will have their account frozen. Continue 
  violation will mean posts will have to read by me before they get submitted 
  (something non of us want to see).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=4>RAID RULES</FONT></B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>1)</B> You sign up for a raid. You attend. If a RL issue comes up, post 
  on the boards or tell the raid leader. This might add you to the Smeg List 
  (see below) depending on the frequency and/or the cause of you not attending. 
  <BR><BR><B>2)</B> If a raid is posted on the boards and: </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>a) You are of the required level. <BR>b) You are online. <BR>c) The raid 
    requires numbers (as deemed by the general consensus of the guild. In other 
    words use common sense. Kael does for example. Seb Key Quest doesn't and is 
    therefore optional). </P>
    <P>you WILL attend the raid. If you don't, you get put on my Smeg 
  List.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>3)</B> If you break any of the other rules on the rules list / Code of 
  Conduct you get put on the Smeg List. <BR><BR><B>4)</B> If you complain or 
  argue about anything to any other member or in guildsay or on the boards about 
  raiding or the lack of support or someone that bugs you in the guild WITHOUT 
  talking to me first. Leave the guild or you will be asked to leave (or guild 
  removed). I am always available either in game, PM or <A 
  href="mailto:Feonyx@hotmail.com">Feonyx@hotmail.com</A> </P>
  <P><B>5)</B> They will be no MORE than <B>two weekday</B> planned raids and no 
  MORE than <B>two weekend</B> planned raids per week. A planned raid is one 
  that is posted on the boards. Friday is considered a weekend day. The reason 
  for this new rule will mean larger numbers at planned raids. Ease of planning 
  for raid leaders. Less conflict of raids. Less people being added to smeg 
  list. Less people getting tired with constant raiding.</P>
  <P><B>6) </B>People that fail to attend another member 55+ Epic raid and are 
  of level to attend and are online and don't have a pre-discussed excuse for 
  not coming will be asked to leave. When the Raid Calendar is online you will 
  NOT be able to used "Sorry I didn't know" as an excuse. The Raid Calendar will 
  be added within the month.<BR>
  </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=center><B><FONT size=4>The Smeg List </FONT></B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you get put on my smeg list I will have a talk with you. If you 
  repeatedly get put on the smeg list and you test my patience I will ask you to 
  leave. DON'T test my patience. <BR><BR>
    People that stay off my smeg list, 
  attend raids regularly and help the guild in general have been in the past 
  noticed and received officership.</P>
  <P>Officers are asked to help maintain the Smeg List and be honest. Yes we are 
  all friends and its hard putting someone on the list, but its for the greater 
  good of the guild and its not the end of the World to be put on the list.... 
  just the beginning of the end of World :).</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>
