    Greetings, Fellow Brothers and Sisters.<br>
<br>
I come to you with both a heavy and joyful heart.  Like you, I have watched friends steadily level up to and past me.  So much so, that I often can't help them or hunt with them.  Thus, I miss out on the comraderie.  I have been campaigning since mid-April of 1999 and had the misfortune of achieving Level 35 less then 2 weeks before Kunark opened.  Those I had been hunting with in Lower Guk have mostly migrated to the new continent.  While I would like to join them, I put off ordering the expansion until I was closer to L40.  However, misery aside, I have never once regretted the class choice I have made (I occasionally bemoan my choice of race, Half-Elf, but that's a side-issue).  In fact, I didn't need much thought at all to select Paladinhood... I have played more paladins in AD&amp;D then any other class. I have always loved the chivelry and Honor demanded of my characters.  The eternal hunt to rid whatever realm I was in of ALL forms of undead.  The satisfaction of knowing, when I plant my battle standard, the whole army knows which way to run to (or by) when things go badly, for I shaltn't retreat from said location.  My group of knights and I formed a nucleus from which the rest of our forces could fall back to.  In several epic battles that riveled Agincourt, Lonely Mountain, and Bastogne, when all fronts were in full retreat, my knights and I stood fast in Harm's Way; an island of stability in the ocean of panic.  Many were the times when we alone remained on the field of battle.  Often, we held long enough to turn the tide of the battle by enabling our forces time to rally and regroup.  When Treachery struck at our flank and panic crumbled our formations, I led my knights in a charge.  That's right, not withdrawing, no!  We brought the battle to the enemy.  With the might of Truth and Justice, we dispatched the traitors to a man and then wheeled about to charge across the flank of the enemy before once again planting my standard in the center of the field of combat.  Only when the enemy threw their 4 remaining dragons (1 Red, 2 Blue, and 1 Black; all Very Old or Ancient) at us, did we fall.  Of the 30 of us in my command, only 6 survived... 2 who would never campaign again.  Myself and the other 23 gave our lives gladly, with the knowledge that our sacrifice gave our forces time to escape.  And, as Bunch &amp; Cole so elegantly stated in their awesome book/series STEN, '[we were] the most expensive piece[s] of meat they ever butchered.  (1 Blue survived the assault, only to fall when my comrades returned to the battle, spurned on by our courage and selfless sacrifice.)  In the same token, many were the times when I planted myself at the zone entrance or tunnel entrance in Unrest and stopped, deflected, or merely slowed trains.  (Even a L32 Paladin with GB has difficulty holding 3 Festering Hags...  &lt;fried&gt;)  Likewise, I can't count the number of times when my LoH restored our puller or cleric from sure death, which enabled our group to rally and dispatch the hated spawns back to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Are our sacrifices acknowledge?  Sometimes.  Often not.  Are they noticed?  Nearly always.  When the Warrior's strength fails  (HEAL PLS!!), when the Mage can't get that last spell to fire (EVAC!! &lt;Your spell is interrupted&gt;, when the Cleric has insufficient mana for that last heal (LAY HANDS, LAY HANDS!!!), it is the Paladin who saves the day.<br>
<br>
Take courage, my brothers and sisters.  Through Mithaniel Marr's guidance, we will bring the Light to Darkness.  Side by side we will stand firm against the onslaught of Hatred, Fear, and Evil.  And, should one of us fall, remember always that we know...  we know... the struggle, the pain, the hardships, the courage, the honor.  And we will never forget...<br>
<br>
Fare Thee Well.<br>
