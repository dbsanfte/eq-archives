<p>&nbsp; Here's an accounting of the final battle of one of my paladins, Lothor. 
  It was quite a mess. Took nearly 6 hours of RL-time to run it. Grab some popcorn 
  and a soda and ENJOY! </p>

<p>&nbsp;The Final Battle, Part 1</p>
  <div align="center">

          <p>&nbsp;Lothor looked out over the field of battle. Bodies lay everywhere, 
            twisted, broken, dismembered. The once green plain had become menagerie 
            of red and brown and black as the blood of thousands coagulated upon 
            the blades of swords and grass alike. Only a few hours ago, fresh 
            grass had grown there... </p>
          <p>For nearly a month, the war had raged. Three assaults of the enemy 
            had shattered great societies of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves alike 
            by the combined forces of the Orcs and Goblin tribes. Horrific casualties 
            were heaped upon them, yet still they came. Hatred was a powerful 
            motivator. And for several centuries Man, Elf, and Dwarf had learned 
            to hate the Orc and Welshat. But it wasn't until the unholy alliance 
            with the goblin tribes that gave them the strength to sweep down from 
            their distant mountain ranges and ravage all that stood before them. 
            Seven Human, 4 Elven, and 3 Dwarven cities had ceased to exist before 
            that ever-advancing wave of death and destruction. Now, it was down 
            to this, the Plain of Norlgar. The bottleneck of a vast and forbidding 
            mountain range that separated the last cities of the Humans, Elves, 
            and Dwarves. And so here the 3 Forces of Light combined the remnants 
            of their armies to make a vital last stand. No quarter would be given 
            nor asked for. </p>
          <p>When dawn had brought warmth to the pass, the Forces of Light numbered 
            just over 7000: 3000 Human infantry, 1000 Dwarven infantry, 1200 Elven 
            pikemen, 800 Elven archers, 600 Human heavy cavalry, 400 Dwarven Engineers, 
            170 clerics from all 3 forces, and 90 Human and Elven wizards. Arrayed 
            against them was a combined force of nearly 12000: Goblins formed 
            infantry companies and sapper units, Orcs ran on foot or rode the 
            mighty felines Welshat, mages and shaman priests wove spells around 
            their allies and prepared to hurdle Death into the midst of their 
            hated foes. </p>
          <p>Before the sun had cleared the horizon, the blare of warhorns signaled 
            the attack. What appeared to be a patch of midnight that stained the 
            Plain of Norlgar surged forward, eagerly seeking the Elf and Dwarf 
            and Human. The orcs riding the Welshat quickly outdistanced their 
            allies and seemed to double their speed with each stride. The walls 
            of pikeman parted ranks long enough to let the Human cavalry slip 
            through. Forming ranks, the cavalry advanced at a slow and even pace 
            towards the tide of Orc and cat. A signal from the commander brought 
            the force to a trot. A few moments later the trot increased to a gallop. 
            When the archers lining the cavern walls could no longer see separation 
            between the two forces the Knights' Battle standard dipped forward 
            to halfway to horizontal and the cavalry finally rushed into a sprint. 
            Lances lowered and shields set, with hardly any space separating one 
            knight from the next, the wall of steel and muscle slammed into Orc 
            and Welshat. Battle cries turned into shrieks of pain and death as 
            horse and cat were crushed from beneath their riders and Orc and Human 
            hacking at each other with sword and ax and mace. Lines wavered. For 
            an instant the Forces of Light held their collective breath as it 
            seemed the mighty Knights of Tioslar would be swallowed beneath the 
            sheer numbers of the enemy. Suddenly a ragged cheer began from the 
            forward most archers. As more caught sight of what was happening, 
            the cheer became deafening. Not only where the Knights holding but 
            the center, led by the Paladin Lothor, had driven completely through 
            the Orc/Welshat charge. Through the breach, the remainder of the Knights 
            flowed past. The Orcs on the flanks tarried, left in disarrey after 
            their center's nearly complete destruction also lost their leaders. 
            Their confusion become a death sentence as the Elven archers on the 
            canyon walls began raining arrows with all the terrible accuracy they 
            had earned for decades. Flight after flight torn through armor, limb, 
            sinew, and bone. Moments later, the survivors wheeled about and fled 
            towards their still-advancing brethren, desperately seeking to get 
            out of range of the deadly arrows. Few, if any, realized that the 
            arrows had stopped being fired as soon as the whole of the survivors 
            where in full retreat. The archers had been given strict orders to 
            NOT waste any arrows. They would need ever last one, this day. </p>
          <p>Far ahead of the fleeing Orcs and Welshat, the Knights continued 
            their charge. Even from the great distance involved, the Forces of 
            Light could see the confusion and mounting panic in the fore-ranks 
            of the advancing infantry. Where the Orcs and Welshat were suppose 
            to be tearing into the enemy's fore-ranks, here came a veritable wave 
            of shining steel, covered in the blood and gore of their brethren 
            and allies. The Knights formed into a spearhead and plunged straight 
            into the center of the infantry. Though too far away to hear, the 
            clash had to be fierce as the Knights seemingly passed through with 
            little resistance. Driving into the enemy's 2nd, then 3rd, then 4th 
            rank, the Knights suddenly dividing and angled away from the center. 
            With half of the force going left and half going right, the Knights 
            swept back upon the 1st through 4th ranks and re-emerged from the 
            infantry. Returning to full gallop, the Knights had just enough time 
            to return to an organize formation before they ran into the fleeing 
            survivors of the Orc/Welshat charge. All remains of organization and 
            cohesion were shattered. The snares and cries for blood of the infantry 
            were now audible to the remainder of the Forces of Light. Though hurt, 
            the enemy infantry was now enraged beyond mere hatred and ran forward 
            in a vain attempt to catch the Knights. The signal was given and the 
            Knights disengaged and headed toward the relative safety of the defensive 
            positions of the Forces of Light. Though out of range of the Orc and 
            Goblin archers, a handful of Dark mages arrived close enough to cast 
            their spells. Finally, Knights were seen to fall. A particularly savage 
            lightning bolt struck the Standard Bearer and blew him completely 
            out of his saddle. Lothor and a handful of Knights turned and dismounted 
            to retrieve the standard. Lothor himself bodily heaved the former 
            Bearer into his saddle and the knights began to retreat again. Too 
            late, they realized that Lothor would not have enough time to re-mount 
            himself. A single trumpet blared from the fore-ranks of the Knights. 
            Nearly as one, the Knights pivoted and raced to reach their beloved 
            leader before the enemy would. In horror, the canyon archers (who 
            were masters at gauging and calculating distances and velocities) 
            knew in an instant the Knights would not reach Lothor before then 
            Orcs and Goblins. Though no order was given, the archers began firing 
            arrows in an attempt to slow or even stall the assault. Though numerous 
            targets were felled in the volleys, their bodies merely vanished underfoot 
            as those behind them rushed by. &quot;Remember Mathalon! Remember 
            Roglar! Remember Solthalus!&quot;, the Knights shouted both honoring 
            the largest city of each of the 3 races to fall before the fiends 
            as well as slow the advance enough for them to reach Lothor. Though 
            the cries cause some to try to slow, the momentum and numbers ensure 
            that the speed kept up. </p>
          <p>Lothor had made no attempt to re-mount his steed. Ever-faithful Rainrunner 
            would not leave his master, though, and stood nearby ready to Lothor's 
            flanks with hoof and teeth. Lothor had his shield and hand-and-a-half 
            bastard sword ready. Evidently he struck quite an image, because those 
            in who's path he stood nearly managed to come to a complete stop. 
            None were eager to be first to make contact with him. Unsurprisingly, 
            the first 3 who did were felled quickly. A blindingly fast combination 
            of skill and their own fears make short work of their attacks... and 
            their lives. Those further out continued past and soon Lothor and 
            Rainrunner had disappeared in the ocean of evil. </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal>Though the Knights didn't slow at all, there was 
            concern that they were already too late. Suddenly glimpses of Rainrunner 
            rearing and striking with powerful fore-hooves spurned them on. What 
            few lances that remained were expended in the charge to reach Lothor. 
            Some skewered 3 or 4 opponents before shattering or simply being dropped 
            by their wielded as their weight become to great to hold onto. Again 
            the wall of steel and muscle buffeted the wave of evil and slowly 
            made headway through their ranks. Arms flailed, hooves churned, the 
            dead and dying falling in great heaps. At last a group of 6 Knights 
            were able to break through to Lothor. They found him covered with 
            blood; some his own, most not. Bodies and limbs surrounded him so 
            much that he had difficulty maintaining his fluid and dynamic swordsmanship. 
            Any that broke past his guard were quickly felled with a precise blow 
            from Rainrunner, shattering arms and skulls alike. The 6 Knights fanned 
            out so as to give Lothor time to re-mount, time he wasted not a sec 
            of. As soon as he was up, they turned and began hacking and slashing 
            their way back towards the Forces of Light. In groups of 2 and 3, 
            other Knights joined them until, as they broke free from the enemy, 
            the entirety of the Knighthood had reassembled. Greeted with thunderous 
            shouts of praise and gladness, the Forces of Light knew courage and 
            strength that day as none of them had ever known. Against unsurmountable 
            odds, the Knights had shattered the Welshat charge and wreck great 
            havoc on the advancing infantry. With many a smile, the Knights passed 
            through the opened ranks of Elven Pikemen. Back to friends and allies 
            and safety, for now.</p>
