<p>THE RANGER THEME SONG (To the tune of Stayin Alive) </p>
<p>(disco instrumental... naked ranger on corpse retrieval strutting down the 
  pier in Fironia Vie) </p>
<p>Well, you can tell by the way my hitpoints go,<br>
  I'm a ranger man: AC's too low. <br>
  Blade is sharp and shield is worn. <br>
  I've been tankin' mobs since I was born. <br>
  And now it's all right - it's okay. <br>
  And I may snare and run away. <br>
  You can try - to understand - why mobs only hit ranger man. <br>
  If you are in danger and if you're not a ranger, <br>
  You're stayin alive, stayin' alive. <br>
  Feel my bones a-breakin' and my ivy helm a-shakin' <br>
  and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. </p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin alive.<br>
  Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin alive. <br>
  STAYIN ALIIIIIIIIIVE... yeah! </p>
<p>Well now, I get spanked or I get beat <br>
  But if I don't get either it's really neat. <br>
  Got low delay blades in each fist <br>
  I'm a dual-wield man - and I get mobs pissed. <br>
  You know it's all right, it's okay. <br>
  I'll get my corpse another day. <br>
  You can try - to understand - why you chain-heal ranger man. <br>
  If you are in danger and if you're not a ranger, <br>
  You're stayin alive, stayin' alive. <br>
  Feel my bones a-breakin' and my ivy helm a-shakin' <br>
  and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.</p>
<p> Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin alive. <br>
  Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin alive. <br>
  STAYIN ALIIIIIIIIIVE... yeah! </p>
<p>Life goin' quickly. Somebody heal me. <br>
  Somebody heal me, yeah.<br>
  Life goin' quickly. Somebody heal me, yeah. <br>
  Stayin' Alive --- (to beginning and fade... Well, you can tell.... ) </p>
