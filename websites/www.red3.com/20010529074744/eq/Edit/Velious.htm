            (HTML by Feonyx)<br>
            <br>
            </font></div>
          <p>I will begin this guide by saying that it is a work in progress.  
            I have sent quite a bit of time there since the release but I am a 
            player that enjoys groups and quests and solo, etc. So I have not 
            single-mindedly set out to learn all that can be learned by non-stop 
            mapping. Since much of Velious is still unexplored, I used maps from 
            Eqmaps.com as they became available and added my own notations. I 
            recommend this to all who play EQ – nothing is worse than getting 
            into a zone, getting lost or killed and wasting time corpse hunting.;</p>
          <p>Before you set out make sure you are stock with things that you need 
            – spell components may be difficult to get for a while. If you use 
            the bow for pulling make sure you have enough for a while, it make 
            take some time before you are comfortable going to Thurgadin.;</p>
          <p><b>Entry zone is the Iceclad ocean</b><br>
            This is a marvelous place to hunt for anyone in there late twenty’s 
            to about level 36. You jump the pirate raft just down the beach from 
            the Barbarian Fishing Village in North Desert of RO. The raft will 
            stop after zoning in and will stay offshore for a bit before coming 
            to the dock. Many who are returning from Velious go ahead and swim 
            to shore since the wait before coming to the dock is complete dead 
            time. After coming to the dock the raft will pause for a bit and then 
            proceed down the shore and zone to Iceclad.;</p>
          <p>Once in Iceclad it may seem that you are not moving – Doh! – That 
            is because the raft pauses here after zoning in. It will start moving 
            shortly and proceed to the Desert Island. Always smart to do a shout 
            when you are coming to the island to let other travels know the raft 
            is incoming. I usually also shout a query as to the whereabouts of 
            the Icebreaker &lt;boat from the desert island to the first Velious 
            island – usually referred to as Cougar Island&gt;. The raft comes 
            to shore at the Desert Island – jump off and proceed direct across 
            the island to the opposite side – you will see a dock with large black 
            stones that look like teeth. This is where the Icebreaker docks that 
            makes the run from the Desert Island to Cougar Island.;</p>
          <p><b><i>One note</i></b> – if you are returning from Velious to Northern 
            Ro – the stupid Raft can be difficult to get on. Many miss it their 
            first attempt.  There is a gnome that stands where the raft comes 
            to shore. If you stand right behind him and look to the ocean – there 
            is a small finger of sand that goes out in to the water farther than 
            the rest – stand here and when the raft stops – you can step directly 
            on.;</p>
          <p>Standing on the Icebreaker docks, you will first see the Icebreaker 
            coming from the right corner of the dock looking toward the sea.  
            It is still one of the coolest things I have seen in EQ. You will 
            understand. There is a ramp that comes to dock level – just go up 
            it and hop on the boat.;</p>
          <p>I usually try to stand toward the front so I can see when we are 
            coming to Cougar Island.;</p>
          <p>There is one strange bug you may notice on the raft or Icebreaker 
            – your stamina bar may start to drop – My guess is the game thinks 
            you are swimming – just move around a bit and it will jump back to 
            normal.;</p>
          <p>You will see many icebergs on the way to the main island but eventually 
            you will see the black teeth stones marking the incoming dock – on 
            the left side of the boat. Go to the side of the boat and find the 
            exit ramp – you have to jump up there and go down the ramp to exit 
            to Icebreaker.</p>
          <p><b>Welcome to the Velious!</b></p>
          <p>Cougars – Cougars and more cougars.</p>
          <p>If you are a high 20’s to low 30’s level look for a group if you 
            have not brought friends with you.  You can not bind here if a melee 
            class so that can be a major pain because FP was you closest bind 
            point for a while. So try not to die – lol&lt;like we try too- eh?&gt;.  
            Snow cougars roam all over the island and they are aggressive. They 
            will join others in a fight if you are too close – so pay attention 
            – as you hunt you will begin to see definite patterns to their pathing. 
            The dock is usually safe unless some dummy trains a bunch in. Dummy 
            because many think of this as a zone line – it is not. Things will 
            still chase you even if you go for a swim. If you must die – best 
            to do it where you know where your body is. Since this is a higher 
            level zone often there will be a cleric with at least revive.</p>
          <p>*** I have played many many hours with clerics. It can be a major 
            pain for them to constantly be rezing folks. Luckily most of the folks 
            that role-play clerics are very nice folks – be nice to them. Some 
            suggestions:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Always offer to donate – they will tell you if it is not needed 
            – they are often medding when others are looting</li>
          <li>If you put out a shout for a rez and no answers do not hound them 
            by blanket tells to the anon folks. I am a paladin – I had a guy beg 
            me for 15 minutes for a rez until I finally removed anon just to shut 
            him up.</li>
          <li>Make friends when in-group – make sure they get equal loot and thanks 
            them if they do a good job.</li>
          <li>Bring the corpse to them if you can – they are using mana on you 
            that could go to their group.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There are three main islands to hunt on. I will discuss each.</p>
          <p><b>Cougar Island:</b></p>
          <p>Many folks start here by dragging Cougars back to the Dock. While 
            this works ok – it can be a problem – there is poor visibility and 
            you can pull more than you want by running over something or getting 
            surprise spawn.  Standing on the dock and looking up the hill  - if 
            you go up to the hill you will be in the pathing of several cougar 
            spawns. You will see three gnomes under a tree to you right – good 
            landmark. You left down the plateau you will find the igloos – the 
            other good landmark. Many, many folks use the igloos as a place to 
            pull to – not bad if there are folks hunting the area. If the area 
            is not busy – you will get spawns coming close to you fighting that 
            may aggro. Check the igloo vendors our to see what you may need – 
            they have the lower Velious spells for many classes.</p>
          <p>The best place to pull on the island is the bluff that is northeast 
            down the small valley away from the igloos.  This buff is not on any 
            of the spawn pathing.  Casters can med right at the bluff drop off 
            to the seaside in safety. Going toward the igloos from the buff – 
            is a small hill from here you can pull any of about 6 spawn points 
            – during low player activity this is non-stop pulling to fight with 
            the right group.;</p>
          <p>East of this spot is a tree under which three cougars will spawn 
            and hold – be careful of a pull here unless you have harmony – or 
            you will have three in your lap. Bow or stun pulling is a definite 
            plus here.;</p>
          <p>Very good experience for the 29-35 set here. I blasted through level 
            35 one weekend just doing these guys. Cougars have no use for Plat 
            so you will have to be happy with occasional Cougar Claw Earring or 
            Bloody Fang a good low level piercing weapon.;</p>
          <p>You may also see Midnight a named cougar that drops a Bloody Bone 
            for the Garou Bone Club quest.;</p>
          <p align="center"><img width=298 height=121

            <br

            If you go down behind the buff to the ocean and run west you will 
            see the ice flows that lead to the second island were the Tower of 
            Frozen Shadow is located.;</p>
          <p><b>Tower Island:</b></p>
          <p>Cougars, Dires, Dervs and Guardians</p>
          <p>Once you cross the Ice Flows – or some folks can swim almost as fast 
            – Many come here if Cougar Island is crowded or they just want a change 
            of pace&lt;it can be boring&gt;. Many things to aggro you here. Snow 
            dervs are another cool graphic as well as Dire Wolves and Shadow Guardians. 
            Best explored during daylight so you can see around. As usual the 
            island edges are usually less populated – but can have bad guys also.  
            Remember the gnolls here can be your friends – I kept them that way. 
            The two best places to hunt that I found were the two Gnoll areas.;</p>
          <p>Balix Misteyes is a solo Gnoll directly north of the tower – good 
            spot to pull things and whack them.;</p>
          <p>Other is the gnoll camp South if the tower easily access by running 
            along water until you see the ice flow to the main island then north. 
            Remember no Area Effect spells in either area or you will die – period 
            from the gnolls.;</p>
          <p>I have been told that you can zone into the Tower in an emergency 
            since the zone inside has a safe spot just inside – but I have never 
            tried it. I was pasted the level that I would get exp from most things 
            in the tower by the time I got over here so I have never been inside 
            – You will have to look for another guide there.</p>
          <p><b>Main Island:</b></p>
          <p>Frost Giants! O My!</p>
          <p>This is where I saw my first Frost Giant Scout and I have loved whacking 
            them ever since!;</p>
          <p>You can see the Dragon Circle on the top hill on the east side of 
            the Island. This is the TP area for Druids and Wizard. There is stuff 
            pathing through here all the time so it is not a place to hang out 
            in.;</p>
          <p>Mainly I just go through here to get to the Dragon Bridge to go to 
            the Eastern Waste. Best way to do this is along either shoreline – 
            be careful because there are some long damage inducing drops around 
            here on the way to the bridge. There are FG Guards in front of the 
            bridge – but if you approach carefully from the sides you will be 
            fine. Mid span is the zone to the Eastern Wastes.;</p>
          <p>We whacked a few FG Scouts here but by the time you have done the 
            other MOB’s in this zone you are ready for a change. FG Scouts hit 
            hard and you will need a good group. We found better hunting in the 
            Eastern Waste without Green MOB’s that aggro in and either waste you 
            time or KILL YOU - lol.</p>
          <p><b>Eastern Wastes:</b></p>
          <p>Mammoths!</p>
          <p>Dang these guys look cool. We came here to hunt them at the foot 
            of the bridge. The good news is that I never saw anything go up the 
            bridge that was not trained there. Unfortunately I did see folk’s 
            train Frost Giants and assorted bad guys up there. FG, Dires, Orcs, 
            Snow griffins, Snow Cougars all aggro.  I never had a Wooly Rhino 
            or Mammoth aggro me. This was some good exp for my regular group. 
            There is a Thurgadin Quest for a prayer Shawl that requests Snow Griffin 
            Eggs. They are no drop so before you loot them makes sure you have 
            a need. Also if you loot them make sure you do not put them in a slot 
            that will cause them to be consumed &lt;they are food&gt;. I neverfound 
            a NPC that would take Mammoth Tails &lt;source of endless playground 
            humor&gt; or tusks.</p>
          <p>Travel north around the shore from the bridge and you will see then 
            normal wildlife you have come to expect. You will also encounter Ulthroks 
            – humanoid animals based on the waldrus. They are good exp up into 
            the 40’s and do not hit as hard as the Frost Giants. They also drop 
            some nice armour that is usable by many &lt;including Druids&gt; so 
            you may want to start a set for you next twink character.</p>
          <p>Also about this time you will have a hankering to have a bind point 
            somewhere close. Well get that map and print of a copy of the Eastern 
            Waste and the Great Divide. By staying along the water for two thirds 
            of the vourney and watching carefully &lt;and listening for giant 
            footsteps&gt; you can get to the Great Divide Zone line.;</p>
          <p>I will be updating this guide with information soon about the rest 
            of this zone. I am going to the Orc Fort to work on Rygorr armour 
            which drops there and also visit the Crystal caverns that are accessed 
            from there.;</p>
          <p><b>The Great Divide:</b></p>
          <p>Giants and Coldains!</p>
          <p>I came to GD really for one reason – to get a closer bind point and 
            to have a place to sell.  By this time I had whacked quite a few Frost 
            Giants so my faction with the coldain was good. Strangely to me that 
            also helps with the Claws of Veeshan – Dragon faction. From all I 
            read right now this is a good thing – I will update if I find otherwise. 
            Be careful coming into the zone – folks often train in bad guys while 
            zoning out. When exiting the slot that the EW zone is in there is 
            often a Frost Giant stationed where the valley comes out. Going to 
            the left puts you in the FG Fortress – bad idea. Go to the right and 
            follow the wall. The area before this turns west has a tree right 
            at the flat spot meets slope area. This is a good place to kill giants. 
            You can see them from quite a distance and they do not path through 
            here.  While killing giants here we have had the Drakkel IceGrinder 
            and Icereaver drop.</p>
          <p>Very nice weapons &lt;we are still using them both at level 40&gt;. 
            They also drop Velium weapons &lt;sell to NPC&gt; and some Drakkel 
            Forged Weapon which can sell for 50-100p in surrounding Freeport zones 
            – if you can ge there.;</p>
          <p>Travel due west from this spot and you will see a valley that runs 
            east to west  with a monument at the bottom . Going west you will 
            see the river that leads to the waterfall that has the entrance to 
            Thurgadin.;</p>
