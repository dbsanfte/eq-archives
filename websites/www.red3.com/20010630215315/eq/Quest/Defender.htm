      <tr> 
        <td>Based upon the log with Inte Akera, these are the items you need for 
          the fiery avenger. <br>
          <br>
          Note. To get the blessings, you need to talk to Inte Akera. He is located 
          on the Fourth Island in the Plane of Sky. You first need to talk to 
          Dirkog Steelhand in the quest cave and give him 500 pp to cause Akera 
          to spawn. Although technically this is the start of the quest, I would 
          suggest you get the head and robe of Miragul, Ghoulbane and Soulfire 
          first before doing this step, as Akera is very difficult to reach. Also, 
          I have been told that Akera will despawn pretty quickly, so you might 
          want to be at the island and have a friend hand Dirkog the money so 
          that you don't lose the spawn. <br>
          <br>
          1) The Blessing of Nobility: You need a high faction with Akera, who 
          is a Deepwater Knight. This blessing is given to you by Akera in return 
          for giving him Soulfire. The details on getting Soulfire are here. <br>
          <br>
          2) The Blessing of Sacrafice: You need a high faction with Akera, who 
          is a Deepwater This blessing is given for giving him Ghoulbane. <br>
          <br>
          3 and 4) The Head and Robe of Miragul: Each dragon drops a half of the 
          book of scale. You need to take the books to the bartender in the Blind 
          Fish Tavern, who will combine them into the Book of Scale for 1000 pp. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Give the book to the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears (he is usually camped) 
          and he will give you back an artifact called Miragul's philactry. You 
          must then head to everfrost caves, which you get to by going through 
          a hole in the ice at the river (enduring breath is very useful for this 
          trip). In order to give the lich back his soul, you need to get him 
          so that he will not KOS you. I have been told that you can complete 
          the Azraxs' Legacy quest in Paineel to get faction with the lich, but 
          can't confirm it, and tend to believe it is ter charm the liche and 
          then hand him the Phylactery. This will spawn the true Miragul, a 53 
          plus necromancer who is as hard to kill as a dragon, so make sure you 
          have lots of friends with you. When you kill him, he drops the robe 
          and his head. </td>

      <tr> 
        <td>
          <p>To get this weapon, you have to release a tormented soul. To do this, 
            you need to find his old armor, sword and shield. These have to be 
            purified by light, gem and water. <br>
            <br>
            THE GEM <br>
            <br>
            These 2 NPC's are found in Kaladim, Jark is in the mines and Nella 
            is outside of the temple <br>
            <br>
            You say, 'hail Jark' You say, 'some' <br>
            <br>
            Jark says 'Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich 
            but it'll sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine 
            was supposed ta bring me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my 
            dinner? I aint got nothing ta pay ya with but I <br>
            sure would appreciate it. <br>
            <br>
            You say, 'I will get your dinner' <br>
            <br>
            Jark says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out 
            there somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple 
            so maybe shes there. Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have 
            everythin ready fer me. <br>
            <br>
            You say, 'hail Nella Stonebraids' <br>
            You say, 'dinner' <br>
            <br>
            Nella Stonebraids says 'Ach! I forgot me husbands dinner. Im so sorry. 
            I was sendin my wishes ta Brell for health and long life. I was just 
            floatin coins into the wishin pool. Usually its for children but things 
            havent been so good lately. Here, please take this to him and tell 
            him where I was. <br>
            <br>
            After you take him his dinner, Jark says 'Har har! No time fer eatin 
            now! While you were gone I struck me a rich vein. Lookie here. Ya 
            ever seen a gem so pure? Its <br>
            tiny but clear as glass. Ya take it Holyomen . Ya showed me some kindness, 
            least I can do. Besides, still a share here for me. <br>
            <br>
            THE BREASTPLATE <br>
            <br>
            The Breastplate comes of a Thought Corruptor in the Plane of Hate 
            and is called a Tainted Darksteel Breastplate. <br>
            <br>
            THE SWORD <br>
            <br>
            The Sword can be found on the Keeper of Tombs in The Hole. <br>
            <br>
            PURE WATER <br>
            <br>
            Talk to a peasant woman near the monk guild in West Freeport. You 
            say to peasant woman &quot;what water&quot; then &quot;I will take 
            it&quot;. You get a bucket of water. Hand it in to her brother Joshua 
            and it will be turned into Pure water. Joshua is in the bakery near 
            his sister. <br>
            <br>
            THE SHIELD <br>
            <br>
            The tainted shield drops off Kirak Vil in Nektulos forest. He is a 
            lvl 56 Dark elf, no faction losses for <br>
            killing him. <br>
            <br>
            Now the steps to assemble the items <br>
            <br>
            1) &quot;The sword must be dipped in water pure.&quot; Give the Tainted 
            Sowrd and the Pure Water (blessed by Sacrifice) to REKLON GNALLEN 
            in the temple of Quellious, Erudin. You receive a Gleaming Crested 
            Sword. <br>
            <br>
            2) &quot;Light of clean spirit to cleanse the shield.&quot; The Tainted 
            shield goes to Elia the Pure in Felwithe. You receive a Gleaming Crested 
            Shield. <br>
            <br>
            3) &quot;A gem of clarity unlike any other for the breastplate.&quot; 
            The Tainted Breastplate plus the Pure Crystal received from Jark (blessed 
            by compassion) is given to REKLON GNALLEN in the temple of Quellious, 
            Erudin. You receive a Gleaming Breastplate. <br>
            <br>
            4) Gleaming Shield, Crested Sword and Breastplate go to REKLON GNALLEN 
            again. You receive a &quot;MARK OF ATONEMENT&quot;. <br>
            <br>
            5) The Mark of Atonement and the old Fiery Avenger go to IRAK ALTIL 
            (wandering NPC zombie) in Plane of Fear. </p>
          <p>You receive the Fiery Defender </p>
