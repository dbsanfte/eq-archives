<p>Oh Shin lord, crafty and never popping in your froglock way,<br>
  Hours and days in your must room i fear I must stay,<br>
  in order to obtain the illustrious weapon they call the ghoul-bane,<br>
  killing those stupid frogs in the next room every 17 minutes is a pain.</p>
<p>And how, after all those hours inside that accursed room, could i forget the 
  viz,<br>
  applying the froglike smackdown has become my characters personal biz.<br>
  <br>
  afk while i take wizz</p>
<p>And now i am back, to find my group has faltered, one guy down, the other link 
  dead,<br>
  while visions of that crafty shin lord and his magical ghoul-bane dance in my 
  head.</p>
<p> i run now, through endless halls of uncamped frogs and their friends,<br>
  need to find that lower guk zone, else i shall meet a bittersweet end.<br>
  The chase is on, vis urd and ton hot on my everquesting trail,<br>
  i can't frickin run i am encumbered i am about to once again fail.</p>
<p> In what has become an ever camp for a sword that will by the time i get it 
  depreciate by half it current market price,<br>
  i can't tell you how happy i am for that level 50 wizard who camped the very 
  same room and within an hour saw the ghoulbane twice.</p>
<p> loading...please wait<br>
  has become my ever fate.</p>
<p> As i count the number of frog meats i currenlty posess,<br>
  i am beginning to feel love for frogs less and less.<br>
  F for i am bound not in freeport but greater faydark,<br>
  camping for special items has certainly made its mark.</p>
<p> As my computer monitor takes it's very first flight.<br>
  no more everquesting this fine spring night.</p>
<p> end.</p>
