<p>This is quest starts in The Temple of Ro. Blaize the Radiant and Gavel the 
  Temperant are the quest givings. You need to fetch and return the corresponding 
  icon and ingot along with the bars of the specified type of platinum to get 
  the item. The icons and ingots only spawn a few times each day.</p>
<p><font size="4">Boots of the Reliant: (Blaize)</font><br>
  You need the ingot and icon of Reliant and 1 bar of enchanted platinum. Go to 
  Kithicor Woods, in one of the burnt houses you will find a book (looks like 
  a bag on the floor). The book will reveal that Turgan the Reliant lived here 
  once, and his brother perished in the fire that burnt the house. It also states 
  that one of the items is hidden in Kithicor. This is the Ingot of the Reliant. 
  Look for it on one of the tree stumps in Kithicor Woods (it is among a group 
  of stumps). It is at loc -70, 3275. You need to jump off a fallen tree to get 
  onto the stump, or use levitate. The book also states that Turgan has moved 
  to Lake Rathetear. There, he is situated off to the left of Gnoll Camp at 3626, 
  112.. Hailing him is useless, as well as asking him about the Icon of the Reliant 
  (he will shout at you and tell you to go away). Give him the book and he will 
  give you the Icon.<br>

<p><font size="4">Bracers of the Reverent: (Gavel)</font><br>
  You need the ingot and icon of Reverent and 2 bars of enchanted platinum. Speak 
  with a Gypsy named Lianna Ferasa in the Rathe Mts. Ask her what has become of 
  Regis the Reverent and she will tell you that he was killed in the N Karanas 
  by an evil man named Zahal the Vile. She says if you go kill Zahal the Vile, 
  Regis' body will rise from the dead where he was killed along the NE tree line 
  of the zone. She also asks that if he has her flute on his body to bring it 
  to her. Zahal the Vile is a ghoul around level 30 or so who spawns in the NE 
  part of NK. Use sense undead to find him. When you kill Zahal, Regis will appear 
  at the tree line. He is a zombie. You need to kill him and loot his corpse to 
  get the ingot and the flute. Take the flute back to Lianna in the Rathe Mts. 
  and she will give you the Icon.<br>

  8.0, Magic item]. </font><br>
  He needs the ingot and icon of Sacrament and 2 bars of magnetized platinum. 
  The Icon of Sacrament is in MistMoore, in the back of the graveyard. There is 
  a room through the illusionary wall that has 4 doors. Opening one of the doors 
  (the only one you can) causes all 3 of the other doors to open. There are things 
  behind the doors that are kinda ugly (mid blue to 34). In the center room (these 
  rooms are no more than closets) on the floor is where the Icon spawns. It is 
  on the floor and looks like a small doll until it is picked up. The Ingot of 
  Sacrament spawns on a Giant Skeleton in the ruins in Rathe Mountains. This skeleton 
  is a darker color than the ones that normally spawn at the ruins.<br>
