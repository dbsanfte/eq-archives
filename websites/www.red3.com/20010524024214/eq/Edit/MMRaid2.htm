  <p>Mistmoore Raid Review - 2nd August</p>

        <p>The MM raid was fun, but overal it ended quite swiftly due to the lack 
          of any Clerics. While Penwig's group held the Garg room Kalamith, Kanisah 
          and myself tried to hold the bridge and the Tower room (the lift was 
          broken so we camped the bridge and "pulled" from the tower). After a 
          massive train of casters swept through the room and bridge we all retreated 
          to Lesser. </p>
        <p>After a little debate we figured MM was too dangerous and decided to 
          take out the Dark Elf Dragoon (yeh that's not dangerous right!) Well 
          the fight against the Dragoon was about even until the whole camp decided 
          to join in. With the help of Kalamith we managed to take most of the 
          greens at the camp (and the priestess), but the Dragoon proved too strong 
          and we retreated back to MM. I only just managed to make it (with 36hp) 
          and Penwig fell near the Orc camp along the southern border. </p>
        <p>Vengeance... </p>
        <p>We regrouped, healed and medded. We then pulled the camp one by one 
          until all but the Dragoon stood. The Dragoon fell this time after a 
          decent fight and dropped some AMAZING loot... Wyvernwill is still reeling 
          from the stuff :). He drop one bottle of Fish Wine.... thanks Verant... 
          After waiting a little too long for the spawns to pop (and also after 
          we experienced a great enchanter show thanks to Kalamith) we charged 
          the Brownie camp. </p>
        <p>These little guys were tough, but not tough enough for the strength 
          of TWC and they fell with speed. After waiting for one more Guard pop 
          and meeting a Sots member hee hee (calm down Wyvernwill) the group all 
          but disbanded leaving WYvernwill, Kanisah and myself to run rampant 
          through the Pixie camp (the ground monster hits Feonyx for 120 damage). 
          We maimed and destroyed all until the ranger with us got the last arrow 
          he needed for his Quest Armour. </p>
        <p>I exclaimed "DOH this is pixie dust, not Faerie dust!" at which Wyvernwill 
          said we should go and beat up the faeries too to continue the onslaught.... 
          After completely laying to waste those most troublesome and evil little 
          guys and most of their Smurf Village the night grow dark and we decided 
          after a long day of adventuring we would call it a night... </p>
        <p>Thanks to all who showed up and hopefully next time we do MM it's a 
          little easier to hold the Garg room. Feonyx... over and out..</p>
