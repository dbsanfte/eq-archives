  <p>9. Head back to Valeron Dushire in Freeport and say &quot;I have all the 
    bones&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p>10. Head to the South Wall in West Freeport and find Ping Fizzlecutter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ping.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p>11. Tell Ping Fizzlecutter &quot;Tell me about the coffin..&quot; (NB you must 
  include the dots) and he will give you a bag and request the following (prices 
  approx):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. a diamond. (900pp)<br>
    2. a star ruby. (100pp)<br>
    3. a pearl. (40pp)<br>
    4. a &quot;special&quot; fire emerald. (100pp)<br>
    5. a sapphire (100pp).<br>
    6. a fire opal (100pp).<br>
    7. 1 enchanted platinum bar (100pp).<br>
    8. 1 enchanted platinum bar (100pp). (in otherwords don't stack them)</p>
  <p>Head to Firiona Vie and head to the Jewelers Hut (-3600 2400) and buy all 
    the jewels (the diamond you will probably have to auction for) from Brisha 
    Fyrestone. After buying the fire emerald give it to the Drake Mountainstorm 
    and he will give you the &quot;special&quot; fire emerald back.</p>

    <i>The Jewelers</i></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>12. Combine all the items in the bag and give it to Ping Fizzlecutter back 
  in West Freeport and receive the Coffin.</p>
<p>13. Place all the bones into the coffin and hit combine.</p>
<p>14. Head to meet Simon on the North side of the West Commonlands Lake.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="simon.jpg" width="320" height="240"><br>
  <i>Simon</i></p>
<p>15. Give him the Coffin.</p>
<p>16. A Tortured Revenant (Darak Lightforge lost soul) will then spawn and attack 
  you from behind. Make sure you have a full group of 50's for this guy. He is 
  very tough (as unfortunately Sanek, Xeroe and I found out) and heals himself. 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="revenant.jpg" width="320" height="240"><br>
  <i>This guy hits HARD and has VERY HIGH resists.</i></p>
<p>17. Kill him, loot him and give the Revenant Ash to Simon the cleric and he 
  will reward you with your new spell.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Ash.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p><b>The Reward: Divine Might is a self targetting enchantment that adds a random 
  Melee Proc of 65 damage. This proc is not just to your primary weapon but to 
  all your combat attacks (bash, fists, etc.). It lasts for 16 minutes and 30 
  seconds.</b></p>
