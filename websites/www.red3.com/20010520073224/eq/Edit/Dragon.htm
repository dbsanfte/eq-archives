        <p>Last night I awoke deep in the bowels of Lower Guk with an adventure set before 
          me, for I was to set out to find the illustrious travellers WW and Kanisah. 
          Picking up my new EE Satchel with a months worth of loot in it I ran 
          to the zone (dropping off a few pieces of equipment and loot onto fellow 
          Crossians). <br>

<br>
I stopped off in the tunnel and with the sage words of the Trademaster (Santoki) in my head I sold my Ykesha for 1.3kpp and a +7 Poison and Disease necklace. After visiting the bank and jogging back to the Druid Ring in W Commonlands I ported to DL and jogged over to the FV to meet the island hopping couple somewhere I might find them a little easier.... the bank ;0 (If you know me you know I get lost in towns hee hee).
<br>

<br>
After Kanisah had become "unlost" (it seems Kanisah gets lost easy too ;0)we where all set to head to CoM to partake in some "cleansing of the denizens" when we saw TWC symbol in the sky. It was time for the dynamic trio to meet up with Maniacal Man of War (Melegant), The Penguin (Penwig) and The Portable Pally Duo (Kelendor and Siff) to vanquish a DRAGON!
<br>

<br>
We ported to LS.
<br>

<br>
After training all manner of things around SOLB we finally stood facing a dude in a red dressing gown...
<br>

<br>
Now this is where I got a little lost as to what was going on... first of all... I thought we where going to kill Nagafen and here was this guy indifferent to me standing there, smoking his pipe. Surrounded by about 60 of the strongest Norrath had to offer he seemed to stare blankly into space as if nothing bothered him.
<br>

<br>
The gatherers then partook of the "crap buffing" which confused me a bit until I realised (thanks to Melegant) that the dragon (of which I still saw none of) AOE debuffed and we didn't want to lose the good ones (in the end we lost most because it took so freaking long to start the fight)
<br>

<br>
We waited... and waited and your FL accidently /disc resistant not knowing that it... um.. it wears off long before you can reuse it ;0. oh well...
<br>

<br>
Finally the raid leader yelled about how some guy was going to hand in some stuff and the fight was about to begin... I told the group "Well it's been fun knowing you guys" and Melegant in his typical cheery optimism said "Don't worry we won't die".. hee hee I was hoping not to lose 51 again :).
<br>

<br>
Suddenly, as if in slow motion the fight began. 25-30 Melee types all swarmed over the poor Huge Hefner look-a-like and proceed to duff the poor guy in. I shrugged and jumped into the fray. He fell fast and I said to myself is that it?
<br>

<br>
I looked around for a split second and notice I was standing there looking at his corpse all alone.... Worried I looked up and above me I saw a VERY Large Tail... I slowly turned around... eyes popped out of their sockets, hit F8 and autoattack and ran at the underbelly of a LARGE RED DRAGON.
<br>

<br>
The rest was a blur of blasts and what not. I managed to get in a few nice 100+ combos in there until I realised the groups life bars where all at about 1 1/2 and Siff was desperately trying to heal us all back up. I also noticed a bunch of people just walking off with LD above their heads and realised Fear!
<br>

<br>
As soon as I muttered the word... up you guessed it! I was doing the dead mans walk over the bridge... luckily it wore off fast... unluckyily I turned hit the dragon one last time (he was at about 1/3 life) and received a large AOE blast and fell to the ground way too fast to LoH.... and unfortunately too fast for everyone else in my group... even Melegant couldn't get his off in time...
<br>

<br>
I popped in Thurgadin... YES I KNOW! I need to BIND somewhere else :), but I wasn't alone... Siff and Kelendor where there with me :).
<br>

<br>
We ported to Lavastorm and as soon as we were there I received the Res Popup window clicked YES and stood next to my corpse deep in SOLB. I looted up fast and then looked around to evaluate what happened... the dragon lay dead...
<br>

<br>
People where yelling about the loot dissappearing in 20 seconds... boy was I confused. Kanisah and some-other-melee-type's name where yelled to loot and when the count ran to 2 it dissappeared. People started yelling about how yet ANOTHER drop has gone to fast, but realised fast that someone had in fact looted it in time.. (heck if I had know I would have looted it hee hee)
<br>

<br>
WW stood there looking blankly into space...
<br>

<br>
The roll for the diamond went up... I thought nah... I don't need one.. and then thought... well I did die maybe I will roll after all :). it was outa 825.... I rolled a 820... my group congratulated me... and then some smeghead rolled a 823... oh boy :) hee hee oh well :).
<br>

<br>
WW stood there looking blankly into space...
<br>

<br>
After we where all ressed and standing around medding... we finally realised... or at least I finally realised that WW had gone LD and probably couldn't log back on. I immediately "/petitioned Could you please BOOT Wyvernwill he has gone LD and can't log back on".
<br>

<br>
Melegant ran off saying something about how he hadn't died enough today and needed to taunt a few Fire Imps and go for a swim... so we sat there watched him run off and sure enough a few minutes later down goes Mels life bar and bingo... he's swimming with the lava fishes.... Good 'Ole Mel we said....
<br>

<br>
After having one of the weirdest conversations with a guide about how WW might be mad with him when he logs on, "Tell him to give me a tell". I was like "Oh great... well thanks", but WW finally depopped and relogged and with that we decided we would all port to LS... well everyone but WW :).
<br>

<br>
1) Siff hit port.
<br>
2) Penwig (or someone) asks "Wyvernwill will you be ok?"
<br>
3) Wyvernwill shouts TRAIN TO ZONE
<br>
4) I say "Guess not"
<br>
5) We all arrive in Lavastorm ;0.
<br>

<br>
The timing on it was beautiful ;0 I got a screenshot I will put up later ;0
<br>

<br>
Anyhoo! the GF walked in at that time and I said "HOLY MOLEY time flies when you getting killed.. I mean having fun!" and I had to go....
<br>

<br>
***********
<br>

<br>
It's the most fun I have had in EQ in a very long time! Anytime you guys need me to die.. I mean attend a raid like that just give me a tell and I'll be there asap ;0.
<br>

<br>
HOPE to see all you crazy kids on tonight and I hope we will once again group up and "keel stuff" (as you Mel and Pen like to put it) because I had a RIOT of a time!
