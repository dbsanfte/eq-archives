	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Kargak Redblade is standing next to a Dwarf named Wenden in East Freeport.
	To get to them, head in the gate from North Ro and follow the left wall.
	They both start the quest. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Hilt # 1 - Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Head to Lake Rathe to get the unjeweled dragon head hilt. You can find it
	spawning on the lake floor underneath the 3 aviak spawn tower. Now, you need
	to get a Diamond, Black Sapphire, and a Jacinth. You'll find them in the
	planes, high lvl dungeons such as sebilis, or from the dino in the ocean
	of tears. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Take the Unjeweled dragon head hilt Diamond, Jacinth, and black Saphire to
	the dwarf Wenden. Hand him all 4 items you will recieve the Jeweled Dragon
	Head Hilt. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Hilt #2 - Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Head to Timorous Deep. It is best to have a druid cast levitate and sow on
	you to do this. Run down to the southwest corner of the zone, where you'll
	find the chessboard (loc approx n6k p4k). At the base of the king peice,
	there is a small bag dropped on the ground - pick it up and you get the Damaged
	Dragon Head Hilt. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Next, head to the Plane of Fear. The item you are looking for is a Ball of
	Everliving Golem. This drops from the named golems Fright, Dread, and Terror.
	It may also drop off of cazic and the dracoliche. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Now go to the Dreadlands, to the Giant castle just west of Karnor castle
	zone. Kill every giant you see, in hopes of getting the Mountin Giant Patriarch
	to spawn. One of his rarer drops is the Giant Monocle (this is not no drop,
	so you can also trade for it). Take the Monocle to Frontier Mountians. Get
	to the giant fort and get inside. When you get to the very end of the Mine
	you will see the giant named Mentrax Mountainbone. Hand him the Monocle he
	will give you Rejesium Ore. Now run back to Freeport east with the ore and
	the ball. Hand the ore, ball and Damaged Dragon Head Hilt to Wenden and he
	will give you the Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Sword Blade # 1 - Ancient Sword Blade 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Talk to Denken Strongpick, on aviak island in the Ocean of Tears. He'll tell
	you what he wants for this rusty old blade he found on the ocean floor: 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a) A keg of vox tail ale - bought from alot of vendors around the world.
	(100-150pp). A good place to buy one is the sandfishers in north ro or the
	freeport port authority 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	b) A Block Of Perma frost - Dropped by Ice giants. While you're here, kill
	some goblin wizards and pick up the frozen goblin heart ... you'll need it
	later. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	c) Rebreathers - Tinkered by gnomes. Expect to drop as much as 4k for getting
	two rebreathers. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Turn the 2 rebreathers, the keg of vox tail ale, and the block of permafrost
	in to the dwarf and you will get the 1st blade. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Sword Blade # 2 - Ancient Blade 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	This is dropped by the Queen of Chardok. Bring along a large group. You will
	probably have to kill here several times before she coughs this up. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	The Red Scabbard 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Talk to Kargak Redblade in east freeport - next to Wenden and say [I will
	do you a favor]. You get a letter ( wax sealed note). Take this letter to
	an Ogre in Ferrott named Oknoggin. He hangs out between the Stone bridge
	and the Fallen totem. Hand him the letter and he gives you a Tiny Lute. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Run back to East Freeport And give the Tiny Lute to Kargek Redblade he gives
	you a book. Now take the book over to his brother in East Karana - Tenal
	Redblade, who is at the very end of the canyon next to the ramp to Highpass.
	Hand him the book,and he gives you a Frozen War Totem. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Hand him back the totem and the Frozen Goblin Heart that you got from perma
	(YOU DID remeber to get one while you camped the Ice Giants right?) and he
	gives you back the Totem of Fiery war. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You then need to return the totem to Tenal Redblade, along with a Green Dragon
	Scale (dropped by Severlious in the Emerald Jungle ) and a Red Dragon scale
	(dropped by Nagafen or Talendor in Skyfire) and he gives you The Mark of
	the Sword. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Now head to the Plane of Hate and kill the Maestro. You need to get his hand,
	which is a rare drop. Bring that back and give it to Tenal aong with the
	mark and he gives you a note to Kargek and yet another, final quest. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You need a Spiroc Wingblade from the Spiroc Lord in the Plane of Sky. You
	then take the Winglbade and the note to Kargek where he gives you the Red
	Scabbard and instructions to combine the Ancient Blade, Ancient Sword Blade,
	Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt, and Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt to receive
	your reward. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	The Two Handed Sword splits into the two One Handed Swords, which can then
	be recombined into the 2HS. </TD>
