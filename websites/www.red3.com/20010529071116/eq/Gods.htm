	      <p>Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they are not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that world. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow Erollisi Marr.

	    <blockquote>
	      <p>Followers of Quellious seek peace. They are not strict pacifists though and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about. The peace they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there is to know about themselves and the world around them. They thirst for knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained. If every creature fully understood itself and its neighbors there would be no need for conflict and war. Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to find themselves along the way.</p>
