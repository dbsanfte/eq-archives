	PART I - TEST OF PATIENCE 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	1. Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout
	(green con at level 54, one ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn
	where he's killed, hail the spirit. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Capt Surestout died. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak..
	They will avenge me.. Unngh!! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this
	fight 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail a lesser spirit' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'yes' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life, Waring ? Did
	he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to
	you in some way? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'he threatened my life' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but
	his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass
	now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'who are you?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who,
	WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'i wish to know more' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a lesser spirit says 'That is good, Waring . Take this gem. It is a part
	of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather.
	Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some
	call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give
	him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	2. Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the northwestern part of town,
	a little ways in on the inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give
	the gem to him. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool!
	You have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	&agrave; Give the tiny gem to Bondl 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink
	for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to
	see how much I can get for it right now! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You gain party experience!! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying "you
	can buy booze" at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No
	need to travel back to OOT. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land
	outside, there he will stop and speak to you. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with
	this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do
	with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let
	me buy some booze with this or not? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'you can buy booze' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman,
	please come with me.' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	After this you can follow him to the Jade Uncerground Inn or just go there
	yourself. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll
	find a greater spirit waiting. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail a greater spirit' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice],
	[War], [Fear], or [Hate]? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'i follow justice' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you
	are, then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next
	room. Farewell, Waring . 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Go to the room next door at the end of the hall. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail a greater spirit' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you, Waring . We're glad you trusted
	in our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This
	fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not
	understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah]. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what true spirits?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you
	if you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend
	to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe
	and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know
	us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in
	an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what very few?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy
	to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl
	is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to grasp
	our existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We
	seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health
	of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important
	to you. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what wisps of consciousness?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for
	we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that
	drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When
	you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The
	ox is the personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you
	do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of
	understanding. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what trust do you speak of?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts
	others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves.
	The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts
	effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with
	his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys
	the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what heyokah?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are
	our 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek
	nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept
	this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish
	what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test.
	We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path
	of the Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will
	be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	&agrave; Recieve the opaque gem from the greater spirit 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Note: DO NOT say the following line until you receive the gem by saying the
	above line. The next line will cause him to immediately despawn but will
	start the next quest for you. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'i will walk the path of the Heyokah' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	a greater spirit says 'That is good, Waring . You will need to walk three
	paths before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom,
	and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage
	to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans
	there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn
	the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've
	learned about trust. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	3. Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island.
	Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours.
	Give her the gem. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	NOTE: As of now this quest is bugged. Before handing in the gem go to loc
	0,0 in Erud's Crossing, if you see a naked human female floating above the
	water with no name then you NEED a gm to come and despawn her. Otherwise
	the quest npcs will not spawn and you'll have wasted that effort. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail Ooglyn' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, Waring . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz
	say you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me
	put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put
	test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, Waring
	, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	&agrave; Give the opaque gem to Ooglyn 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry
	you missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I
	like you so I take you there. We goin for a swim, Waring ! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You gain party experience!! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn begins to cast a spell. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn feels much faster. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn begins to cast a spell. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn is surrounded by a brief lupine aura. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn begins to cast a spell. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn's body pulses with energy. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Then she starts to run away, follow her until she disappears into the water.
	Then go in the water (make sure you have some sort of underwater breathing
	on) and head to loc -1600, 2400. She'll be waiting there for you in the water.
	Wait down there with her. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn says 'Ok shaman, let us be off. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Ooglyn says 'Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman! 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	She then wanders away&#133; DONT follow her, be patient ! NPC`s will start
	spawning one after the other 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail Srafen the Soaked' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Why hello there! Ahh, it's good to see a new face
	down [here]. So you've come to [wait] with [us] eh? That is splendid! It's
	been getting very boring lately. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'Where is here?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Oh! Well this is where [we wait]. It's not much for
	looks but if you're lucky, a pretty fish will swim by. Oh, and once Dillon
	said he saw one of those fish women, a mermaid, he called it! Although, I'm
	not so sure of his state of mind, hehehe. He's been waiting here much longer
	than I. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'Who is us?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Well, there's me, Srafen. I've been down here for,
	can't quite remember, a number of years, I guess. If my wife saw the condition
	my clothes are in, she'd whack me, I'm sure, heheh. Although I'd bet she's
	long since dead, probably. Then there's Dillon. He says he's been here since
	those people up top in Erud blew that big hole in the ground. Not sure what
	happened but I guess it was a long time ago. Hmmmm, who [else]? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What do you wait for?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'We've been waiting quite some time, really. I have
	been here the least amount of time, but that doesn't help keep the boredom
	away, heheh. What are we waiting for, you ask? HehehHAahahah! What are we
	waiting for?? Heheheh, what a silly question! It's quite obvious if you take
	the time to think about it. Heh. Ummm.. I'm really not sure. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'Who else?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Ahh, yes, there's also a really old guy I've only
	seen a couple times, name's Froham. Whew, he is really old, and not much
	of a talker. Mostly mumbles from time to time. Dillon says he's been here
	since Erud first took his people across the sea. Not sure who this Erud feller
	is but Froham isn't in the best of shape, so it must have been a LONG time
	ago. Froham did mention there's one other guy but we've never seen him. He
	apparently had something to do with the Combine Empire, no idea what that
	is though. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	These 2 NPC`s Spawn at the same time and are speaking to each other as well
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Well met again, Srafen. How goes it? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail Dillon the Drowned' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey Srafen, who is this weirdo talking to me? Or
	is it another one of those funny illusions Froham keeps talking about? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked looks around frantically a moment then laughs and says,
	'Ohhh, them! Hehehe! This is a friend of mine come to wait with us. Isn't
	that exciting, Dillon? And it's not just an illusion, I don't think! Say,
	are you [an illusion], shaman? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'I am not an illusion.' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Awww, well that's too bad. Although illusions and
	real people don't seem to be much different at times, so, please stay and
	keep Dillon and me company. We could use it, right Dillon? 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey Dillon, why don't you tell us again about what
	happened up top? You know, where they blew that big hole into the ground.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Again? Oh I don't know Srafen, I don't want to [bore]
	our company, even if it is an illusion. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'You won't bore me' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Well ok, I was sent here a long time ago to wait.
	When I got here, I couldn't believe all the violence going on. Why would
	the spirits send me here to wait when all this fighting and commotion was
	going on, I wondered. There were great battles on the ocean in splendid ships
	made of pine and shining with [magical enhancements]. While I was waiting
	below, blasted, bloody body parts were floating down to the bottom of the
	ocean all around me. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What magical enhancements?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Yes, their ships were very strange, constructed
	in very unusual designs and all seemed to shine with a multicolored glow.
	I heard there was even a ship that could stay completely underwater for long
	periods of time. It had huge steel spikes protruding from the top of its
	hull used to 'swim' under enemy ships and puncture their hulls. I always
	thought that someday all this magic would cause something [disastrous] and
	eventually, it did. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What was disastrous?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Dillon the Drowned says 'Well, one time, I was here waiting as usual. The
	fighting was particularly heavy up top, lots of banging and rumbling around.
	And suddenly there was a tremendous screech! I had to cover my ears, it was
	so loud, even down here. It felt like the water itself was being torn asunder;
	I could imagine what was happening above. After a few seconds of the screeching
	came a terrible tremor and rumbling. Great cracks opened up around me and
	water rushed to fill them, almost dragging me down into the gods know what.
	It calmed down a little while after that and there hasn't been any real fighting
	ever since. I suspect they're all dead now. For weeks afterwards, the water
	had a kind of dead taste to it. I became ill during that time. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	At this point Froham the Forgotten comes in&#133; 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	(&#133;) Missing logs 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'who is abe' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Froham the Forgotten says 'Yeah, Abe's an old guy. Well, he's kinda beyond
	bein' old if ye know what I mean. Not all together either. His mind floats
	all over like the sea around us. But he's got enough sense to wait here like
	he's done fer, well, fer dang near ever. If ye see him, and he ain't much
	fer talkin straight, ask him about [a broken arrow]. Not sure what it means
	to him but it seems to bring him around. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Note : The skeletton swiming in the water named Froham the Forgotten, will
	wander off talking about a mermaid and a treasure&#133; DONT follow him its
	a test. Dont be greedy is the test Few minutes later another NPC will spawn.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'hail Abe the Abandoned' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come
	into focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in
	front of his own face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs,
	'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [ABE]!' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'who are you abe?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only
	know where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me
	if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend
	you mine but I don't wear the same size. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what eyes?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although
	it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods
	approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught
	but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine]
	fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud.
	And now we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.'
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what is the combine?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah,
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'what broken arrow' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned 's eyes suddenly come into focus, looking deep into your
	own and says, 'There was a time when we cared for the world and trod with
	the spirits along the paths of the cosmos. We built many great things and
	worked to preserve what was. I came here to wait for an answer when we began
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	to die off. We could not figure why this was and I was chosen to come here
	and commune with our friends. We carved an arrow, and everyone who was left
	shaved a sliver of wood from it. We let it drop to hallowed ground and our
	highest shaman stepped on it, breaking it. I've been waiting here for so
	long. So, so long, to give it to the spirits, and thank them.' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	&agrave; Sit down there for a few more minutes, then Abe will talk. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I
	will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken
	arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You
	will know who to give it to when it is time. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'i will give them the arrow' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	hands it to you without a word. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>

	The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't
	need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known
	to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none
	were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all been confirming that
	the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided
	the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon
	and our orders will be back to normal shortly.

	Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen,
	Neh'Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding
	countries for her trail. The lord Rak'Ashiir also authorized the hire of
	mercenaries to venture into Froglock Territories to search for traces of
	the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's
	office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us.

	Well it appears our Lord Rak'Ashiir in his "wisdom" has cut our church's
	donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison
	as many were wiped out during the Froglock incursions. However, I see more
	and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped
	in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent
	replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber biliaz leads me to
	suspect our King is planning on all but destroying the church entirely. I
	don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad.

	Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy
	sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange
	class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll
	be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch
	Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so.
	I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows
	with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass
	as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again.

	Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis
	have a saying that goes "Neh`s chances". We all know this is used to define
	an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in
	the early years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis
	there were that many theories regarding Ne Ashiir's disappearance. Others
	say there were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much
	so that she had to leave to escape death. And for good measure a few pointed
	to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing
	all agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple
	was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between
	the two implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances.
	Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade of Kim into the disappearance
	of Neh as Kim left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many
	texts that the visage of Rak`Ashiir reflected his dispair over his wife's
	vanishing although it is a well know fact that it was mostly an act played
	by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will
	find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public.

	discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and
	discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot
	decide whether to place it ourselves with help of our Black Guard, or to

	Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to
	practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kim was given
	the hallowed title that contact between sexes became tolerated. While Kim
	wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great
	victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle know as the
	Bone Rending when Kim lost his fabled whip. Thriaxis' Tail, and was still
	able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only. Before this battle
	many believed Kim could not fulfill his duties as a leader and patriot for
	the people. However Kim's might and his lecture on the use of females in
	religious crusade and duty convinced the puclic that celibacy had its place
	in divinity but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church.
	A shrine depicting Kim among many women was constructed in remembrance of
	his controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial
	as it was lost far across the ocean among distant brothers in faith

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger,
	the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath,
	Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known
	magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of
	dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer
	was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a
	mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself
	had willed into existence one of these [black holes]. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What of thease Black Holes' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to
	experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately
	for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new
	black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence.
	The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything
	within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were
	threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped
	forward and struck against Miragul's mantle.

	You say, 'What powerful shaman?'

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the
	timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct
	a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the
	sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found
	a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using
	nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft,
	lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails
	of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an
	aviak elder. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What of the cosmos?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought
	into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness.
	Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition
	of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create
	enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
	volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get
	close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the
	wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across
	the planes. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You say, 'What of the breach?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough
	negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was
	so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle
	and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process.
	All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground
	where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to
	have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose
	as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle.
