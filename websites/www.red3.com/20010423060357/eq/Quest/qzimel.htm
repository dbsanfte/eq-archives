  <p>Obtain the mighty Soulfire through this great quest. For roleplaying reasons 
    you might want to start from Step 1, but if you are in a hurry to get Soulfire 
    you can start at Step 10.</p>

  </font><font color="#000000">Hail Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">2. Say &quot;I wish to serve the wills of 
  the truthbringer&quot;.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">3. Receive the note and go to Freeport Militia 
  House find the spy (Guard Ayle) on ground floor outside under terrace.</font></P>

  response.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">6. Run out of place before you get squashed

<P align="left">7<font color="#000000">. Go over to Groflah's Forge in East Freeport 
  and give him the note.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">8. He will tell you to meet at the docks

  him the note again.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">10. He gives back and Tykar (a beggar) should 
  spawn. Give Tykar 4 droms champagnes (they are lore so you either need a friend 
  to buy and give you them as you give to the beggar or buy and them really fast 
  and give them to him). Also as a side note I was KOS to the male bartender, 
  but not the female one. So once again get a non-KOS friend to buy them for you 
  or buy from the female bartender.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">11. On the forth Drom's he will give you 
  g</font><font color="#000000">ives you the Zimel's blanket (it's named something 
  like bunker blanket).</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">12. Go to West Freeport and either kill 
  rats, beetles and snakes for the Rat Ears, Fire Beetle eyes and Snakeskins or 
  simple buy them from newbies (10 of each should be enough).</font></P>
<P align="left">13. Buy a empty bottle (sold in the Brewery in North Freeport) 
  and combine a snake skin, a non-foraged water flask and the empty bottle. Keep 
  doing do until you make bog juice.</P>

  goo. </P>

<P align="left"><font color="#000000">17. Give him the Bog Juice, Edible Goo and 
  a Blanket. He gives you a key in exchange.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font color="#000000">19. Give key to clerk behind the counter. 
  She gives you a note to deliver Brother Hayle in Splitpaw.</font></P>
<P align="left"><img src="SFNote.jpg" width="518" height="389"><br>
  <i>The note</i></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">20. Go to Mistmoore Castle. Camp the Garg 
  room (with a full mid 40 group) and kill Xicotl who spawns in the bath room.</font></P>
<P align="left"><img src="xicotl.jpg" width="518" height="389"><br>
  Xicotl the Shadowknight is mean, but not mean enough for the White Cross :).</P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">20. Loot the Hilt of Soulfire (looks like 
  an ice cream cone).</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">21. Set up a raid on Freeport with about 
  twenty mid 40+ people (&quot;kill team&quot;), one or two any level non-KOS 
  people (&quot;hailers&quot;) and suicide runner (&quot;puller&quot;). With the 
  &quot;puller&quot; invisible and the &quot;hailers&quot; standing directly West 
  of the West Gate. The &quot;puller&quot; runs into the guard house, bops Lucan 
  Delere around the head and runs like the wind West out of Freeport towards East 
  Commonlands. While a huge train of guards chase the &quot;puller&quot; to the 
  zone the &quot;hailers&quot; pound the &quot;Hail&quot; button stalling Lucan 
  in his tracks a good distance out from the gates. The guards go back to their 
  respective posts leaving Lucan all alone in the desert because the &quot;hailers&quot; 
  are still stalling him. When the coast is clear one of the &quot;kill team&quot; 
  runs up to Lucan and either twangs an arrow into him or bops him around the 
  head and pulls him to the rest of the &quot;kill team&quot;. After Lucan dies 
  his Skeleton form spawns in his place. Finally when he hits the dirt he drops 
  his testimony and two bone chips (woo hoo), hand this in to the Paladin guild 
  leader in NFP and receive the Brilliant Sword of Faith.</font></P>
<P align="left"><img src="Lucan.jpg" width="518" height="389"><br>
  <i>Lucan's final moments. The South Wall is a common pulling place.</i></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">22. Do the <a href="qtest.htm">Testimony 
  of Truth quest</a>.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">23. Go to the Qeynos bank and get out all 
  the Gold you have and head to East Qeynos to the Priests of Life. If Novashine 
  is on the platform on the way up to the spaceship go to step 25 otherwise go 
  to 24.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">24. Head to the East Qeynos and go along 
  the path about a hundred yards and then head North. Novashine should spawn here 
  or be already wailing on the local dogs, bugs, etc. If you give a &quot;/shout 
  Anyone seen Novashine?&quot; or watch for Novashine &quot;Turn from your evil 
  ways&quot; zone wide shouts you should find him.</font></P>
<P align="left"><img src="LashunNova.jpg" width="518" height="389"><br>
  <i>Lashun Novashine usually hangs out on the platform</i></P>
<P align="left">25. Once you find Novashine. Give him 2GP... repeat... in fact 
  repeat ALONG time. I calculate it takes about 400GP to change your faction with 
  the Priest of Life once. Once your faction with the Priests has reached Warmly 
  you can head to Splitpaw for the final step.</P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">26. Head to Splitpaw in Southern Karanas. 
  Bring a friend that can invis to head deep into the Jails (one that can port 
  out is always useful as well).</font></P>
<P align="left"><font color="#000000">27. Before you enter the jail with Brother 
  Hayle in it have one of your friends stand and stay by the levers to open Hayles 
  Cell. <br>
  **If you don't have a friend to open the cell after you enter it you better 
  have a port out or you are stuck in the cell with Hayle until someone in zone 
  lets you out**</font></P>
<P align="left"><img src="SFLevers.jpg" width="512" height="384"> <br>
  <i>The Levers to Hayle's Cell</i></P>
<P align="left">25. Enter the jail and drop invisibility if you still have it 
  on (Hayle will be indifferent to you otherwise). Hail Brother Hayle. Hand him 
  the note and he should hand it back. If he does not, you do not have enough 
  faction with the Priest of Life (repeat steps 10-19 and do step 25 alot).</P>
<P align="left">26. Hand him back the note he just gave you, The Testimony of 
  Truth, The Brilliant Sword of Faith and the Hilt of Soulfire.</P>
<P align="left">27. Receive the Soulfire. Either port out or become invisible 
  again and get your lever friend to pull the according lever and head out a free 
  and holier Paladin ;0 (or you could do what I did and try and fight your way 
  out and end up training the whole zone, getting out by the skin of your teeth 
  ;0.)</P>
