      <td>The Final Battle, Part 2<br>
        <br>
        With the Knights safely inside friendly lines, the Forces of Light prepared 
        to meet the enemy. The clerics were busy healing the critical and serious 
        wounds of the valiant cavalry, while assistants bandaged minor wounds 
        and tended to the horses.<br>
        <br>
        Girad watched the Orcs and Goblins mill around in confusion. Slowly, they 
        seemed to regain some of the confidence and order and the massive body 
        began to approach the lines of the Forces of Light. Girad watched and 
        waited. Only when the Orcs and Goblins were WELL within range did he give 
        the signal. With the swing of the yellow banner, the archers released 
        their drawn bowstrings. Flight after flight rained down into the advancing 
        body. The screams and shrieks were horrific, so close. Bodies could be 
        clearly observed as they suddenly pierced with 2, sometimes as many as 
        5 arrows. Many simply dropped where they were. Others lay twitching and 
        writhing. The advance was stalled and soon turned into a retreat. Though 
        their enemy fled before them, there were no shouts of triumph or joy from 
        the Forces of Light. They knew the day had only begun. <br>
        <br>
        Girad motioned to one of his runners. "Please ask Lothor to come see me 
        at his convenience."<br>
        "Yes, Your Majesty." <br>
        It was several minutes before the runner returned. "He will be here shortly, 
        Your Majesty. He is seeing to his injured. And will be along presently." 
        <br>
        "Very good. Thank you, Carmyr." <br>
        Lothor found the King leaning over a detailed map of the canyon, conversing 
        with several advisors and officers. Though his tall and powerful build 
        was covered in platemail, it was several moments before anyone noticed 
        Lothor waiting at a respectful distance. A discreet cough and nod diverted 
        Girad's attention to the Paladin. <br>
        Taking two paces forward, Lothor bowed and saluted in the modified form 
        he gave to those rare superiors whom he respected. <br>
        "Still not kneeling, I see." <br>
        Lothor, sensing the playful test, displayed no reaction to the comment. 
        "You are well aware of my thoughts and beliefs on such matters, my liege." 
        <br>
        "Yes, that is true. It's good to be able to have you here to remind me. 
        There were several times that I feared our friendship would pass Beyond, 
        today. What of your brave men, Lothor? How did they fair during your fantastic 
        attack?" <br>
        "We have 57 dead or missing, among those 3 officers and 8 sergeants. 22 
        wounded return to our lines, though 2 died shortly there after. 4 more 
        won't likely ever see combat again. 12 sustained injures to prevent them 
        from rejoining us again today. A total of 39 horses were lost or had to 
        be put down. The rest of my command are combat-fit. Given a few more minutes 
        to rest and re-organize, we will be ready to take to the field again." 
        <br>
        "Any of note among the fallen?"<br>
        "All of my men are noteworthy, Sire."<br>
        Girad flinched under the unyielding gaze of the Paladin. "That's not what 
        I meant and you know it. I am know full and well how tight-knit your command 
        is. Certainly, after this morning, there are none here would dare say 
        otherwise. Very well. You and your command will be held in reserve ready. 
        You are done much already and I have no doubt you will take the field 
        again." <br>
        Just then a runner approached. "Your Majesty, Forward Watch reports the 
        enemy is again on the move."<br>
        "Thank you, son."<br>
        "Lothor, return to your command. I'll send for you when you are needed, 
        though I suspect you will already know."<br>
        Lothor again bowed and saluted. As he walked away, the King called after 
        him. "And Lothor, get some rest yourself, my friend. We are getting a 
        bit old for this sort of thing.&quot;<br>
        "Yes, Sire." <br>
        <br>
        This time, without the demoralizing presence of the Knights, the enemy 
        would gain the ranks of the Elven pikemen. Though the archers were hard 
        at work, they merely slowed the advance along the flanks. The Pikemen 
        were ready, arranged in 3 ranks, the first kneeling with their pikes planted 
        in the ground, the 2nd and 3rd standing with their pikes mobile to thrust 
        and finish off those enemy that become impaled on the 1st rank or got 
        past them. The others remained in reserve. As one fell, the pikemen behind 
        him would quickly take his place so that no hole in the line could be 
        exploited. Aides were on hand to drag the wounded out of the battle and 
        to the clerics' area.<br>
        <br>
        As the Orcs and Goblins raced towards the hated Elves, their front rank 
        stumbled and fell, throwing the pace off enough to prevent the full brunt 
        of the charge from hitting the pikemen. The Dwarven engineers had timed 
        well their throws of axes, maces, and stones. Though the attack wasn't 
        even slowed, the inconvenience of having to step on, over, or around the 
        bodies of the first rank caused many an Orc and Goblin to lose speed. 
        Quite a few tripped and were crushed by those behind them. And then there 
        was no long time nor space for any thought. Orc and Goblin hurdled against 
        the bristling wall of pikes and died. Impossible, the wall held the initial 
        charge. Though many of the first rank could no longer maneuver their pikes 
        due to 4 or 5 bodies impaled upon them, still they held their positions. 
        The 2nd and 3rd ranks flowed back and forth, jabbing and slicing. Finishing 
        off those already dying and driving others back. Yet, there was no chance 
        of withdrawal for those Orcs and Goblins in front. Their brethren and 
        allies behind continued to push forward, so eagerly seeking to blood of 
        Elf and Human and Dwarf they forced many of the front ranks onto the pikes. 
        Soon, the 1st Pikemen rank was forced to abandon their weapons, as the 
        bodies of the enemy became so numerous as to actually reach the hands 
        of the Elves holding them. Unwittingly, the enemy had provided a makeshift 
        bulwark they were forced to scale to reach the Elves. Clamoring over 12 
        or 15 bodies that are stuck on a long, sharp stick tends to make things 
        very difficult for mounting an adequate assault. With the 1st rank reduced 
        to using their longswords and daggers, the 2nd and 3rd ranks had their 
        hands full trying to limit the number of Orcs and Goblins which successfully 
        scaled the bulwark of bodies. For hours, they assaulted the Forces of 
        Light. They were simply unable to bring the bulk of the forces to bear. 
        The wall of bodies now measured well over 10 feet in height and the withering 
        archery fire from the canyon walls nearly ensured that hardly any of the 
        enemy would escape unscathed. When the sun was directly overhead, the 
        Orcs and Goblins heard the eerie tunes of Orcish battle horns calling 
        them back. Sentries were posted and the majority of the Forces of Light 
        took a much needed rest. Servants and aides darted back and forth bringing 
        water and food to as many as possible. Others hauled carts loaded with 
        bundles of arrows for the canyon wall archers, many of whom had exhausted 
        their supply. After an hour, runners brought word of movement from the 
        enemy. The leaders of the Forces of Light watched on, the Orcs and Goblins 
        aligned for battle, yet made no move forward. They merely stood in place, 
        as if waiting for something. For more than an hour, they stood still. 
        Nerves were frayed thin, when word came the enemy had finally begun to 
        move forward. Not a rush this time, but a slow, semi-orderly march. When 
        they finally came into range, Girad gave Thodrick a nod and the Head Dwarven 
        engineer raised his personal horn and blew 2 mighty blasts. From each 
        canyon wall, a newly constructed catapult launched a boulder into the 
        enemy's formation, scoring bloody grooves into their ranks, before being 
        swallowed by those still coming. A shrill horn call sounded from deep 
        within the Orc/Goblin force and a wide corridor opened in the center of 
        their formation. As Girad and his advisors watch with great interested, 
        huge creatures wielding titanic weapons came sauntering down the cleared 
        path. "Ogres," Thodrick said with a Dwarven curse. "Ogres. This is a mighty 
        force that Evil has arrayed against us. We must be wary for I doubt this 
        is the last surprise we shall get," Girad stated with passive conviction. 
        "Runner, please tell Lothor the enemy has added Ogres to the center of 
        their formation and ask him to have a detachment of Knights ready, in 
        case they reach us." "Yes, Your Majesty," the runner managed as he hurried 
        away.<br>
        <br>
        The thuds of the launching catapults doubled in volume as the 3rd and 
        4th engines acquired targets within their range. Though trying to be slow 
        and orderly, there were now brief surges in the speed of the enemy formation 
        each time a catapult fired, as they tried (some in vain) to get out of 
        the way of falling boulders. Just as the 5th and 6th catapults neared 
        launch time, a horrific whistling shriek filled the air. The Orc/Goblin/Ogre 
        formation surging forward in a dead run, even as the 1st and 2nd catapults 
        exploded in flames with their operators burning and/or punctured by flying 
        debris. Almost immediately thereafter, the bulwark of bodies also burst 
        into flame as 2 columns of fire descended to ravage the area from opposite 
        sides of the canyon. Screams of pain and terror were torn from many of 
        the Forces of Light. Smoke filled the air, stifling and obscuring. "What 
        has happened?!?" shouted Girad. Lothor suddenly appeared out of the billowing 
        cloud. "Dragons, my Liege. They have unleashed the Dragons."<br>
        <br>
        "Heaven and Light protect us," Girad said breathlessly, even as the shadow 
        of one of the great beast past overhead... <br>
