          <p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:278.75pt'>He was dead, he thought.  
          </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:278.75pt'>He had died from the great 
            battle-ax that came crashing down just as he witnessed light had turned 
            to darkness. </p>
          <p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:278.75pt'>He had entered into a 
            new world.</p>
          <p class=MsoBodyText>Then the pain set in, he wasn’t dead.  He lived, 
            yet his skull pounded as if it had been rent in two.  He nearly groaned 
            aloud, yet some instinct kept him silent.</p>
          Sorting through his thoughts, he relived the last few days, trying to 
          figure out what went wrong.  How could this slaughtering have taken 
          place 
          <p>Sabashjon Teisiskan then felt the ripping of his heart all over again.  
            For it was on this day he lost his lifetime friend and trusted leader 
            of the light bringers Lord Soulfury. </p>
          <p>While exploring in West Commons, two regions over from Freeport, 
            Sabashjon overheard two men talking about the corrupt leader of the 
            guards of Freeport Sir Lucan.  They spoke of how he had been plotting 
            to once and for all rid Soulfury, and his kind from the face of the 
            earth.  Sabashjon, having stayed just long enough to hear the details 
            realizing that time was of the essence, he quickly made his way back 
            to camp. He informed his men of the urgency in which they must ready 
            themselves, for what could be the greatest battle of their lives.  
          </p>
          <p> He then went in search of his wife Keizah. The lifeline of pure 
            goodness into his soul, he has loved her since the first moment he 
            laid eyes on her.  It was during an expedition into greater Faydwer 
            just ten years earlier. Their love for one another produced their 
            greatest joy, the birth of their daughter Kanisah, now eight years 
            old.</p>
          <p> After bringing Keizah up to date with the news, she secured a druid 
            so that he and his men could move with the Spirit of the Wolf to reach 
            Soulfury in time.</p>
          <p> Remembering now, the sounds of battle, and how his men immediately 
            joined those fighting Sir Lucan’s army of corrupt guards. Accessing 
            the sight. Looking for his friend and leader, Sabashjon spotted Soulfury 
            battling with Sir Lucan himself.  Wounded and exhausted, Soulfury 
            was in dire need of assistance.  Sabashjon tried healing him from 
            where he was but, he was still to far out of range, he began his advance, 
            it was at that precise moment Sabashjon was hit from behind with a 
            battle-ax, as he began to topple and fall to the ground, the last 
            image he saw was Sir Lucan’s slaying of Soulfury. Then nothing but, 
            total darkness where light had once prevailed.</p>
          <p> The land was covered with sad and grotesque carnage of battle. As 
            it had been before, he realized dimly. As it, would be again.</p>
          <p> Looking about for any sign of life Sabashjon spotted a fire burning 
            in the woods to the northeast. He rose carefully, healing his wounds 
            the best that he could, slowly he made his way to the fire. There 
            he met with an enchanter who was meditating in stunned disbelief.</p>
          <p> Sabashjon, recounted the events from his end, with the enchanter, 
            leading up to having arrived, to late to give warning. The enchanter 
            then shared news of an Orc uprising in the West commons area. </p>
          <p>&quot;What are you saying?&quot;<br>
            &quot;I’m saying, that the Orc Legionaires have begun raiding the 
            nearby camps. It is as though corruption now ruled and darkness would 
            once again be ever present.&quot;<br>
            &quot;My wife and daughter are camped there.  We have been in the 
            area for the past 2 weeks without a hint of fear or serious problem 
            from those Orcs!&quot;<br>
            &quot;Aye nothing is as it had been prior to today&quot; replied the 
            enchanter.
          <p>The enchanter went about casting clarity and celerity plus greater 
            shielding.  In addition, he summoned food and water for this man already 
            consumed with so much grief.  For what he had not told Sabashjon, 
            was that the order of the Legionaires was to leave no survivors.  
            Sabashjon with severe wounds from fighting and his heart filled with 
            great sorrow then turned in the direction of West commons, hoping 
            to find his wife and child. </p>
          <p>Please Marr let them be safe
          <p> Yet even as the hope flashed through his mind, so did fear and a 
            certainty of knowledge. He continued his painstaking journey. </p>
          <p>Upon arriving back at the remains of his camp, he found his wife 
            lying in a pool of her own blood... lifeless.
          <p>The tears within his eyes fell unashamedly down his cheeks.  Sabashjon 
            knew his grief coupled with his wounds suffered in battle, were too 
            much for him to survive.  He closed his eyes and prayed to the heavens 
            above, with every ounce of his being that their only child somehow 
            survived this onslaught of darkness. </p>
          <p>He then let out his last breath of life.</p>
          <p>Keizah instinctively knew, upon hearing of Lord Soulfury’s death, 
            that she would never see her Sabashjon again.  For almost immediately 
            darkness loomed all around. Her last mission would be to save their 
            daughter’s life. She drew Kanisah a map, foraged enough food and water, 
            placed a letter and the few platinum pieces she had, into a hidden 
            pocket she had sewn into her backpack. </p>
          <p>Then she said:</p>
          <p>Take with you all that your father and I have taught you. Survive 
            this your darkest hour, and you will grow strong enough to bring Justice 
            to the feet of Evil.  Spread truth of what really happened this day.  
            Become a beacon of light in this land of dark. Now go, do not look 
            back, go quickly and remember always, you were the one constant light 
            source in our lives. May Marr be with you and guide you safely. </p>
          <p>The Orcs circled the trees just outside the Firelight.  Their dark 
            green skin blended in nicely with the dark green of the low trees 
            and high grass.  They used the cover of darkness to hide their numbers 
            and movements.  They could smell the smoke from the well kept, campfire, 
            but there was more.  They could smell fear.  Fear from the trapped 
            people inside the camp who knew that they were doomed, even though 
            they could not see them inside the blackness. Quietly, like an assassin, 
            the large leader slowly removed his war axe from his belt and gripped 
            the handle with anticipation.  He howled like a mad man possessed 
            and dove through the underbrush and exploded with his raiding party 
            into the light to extinguish it forever.</p>
          <p>The run to safety was one of the hardest things she had ever had 
            to endure.  Hearing screams of the women and cries of the children, 
            knowing her mother was among those being slaughtered, convinced her 
            that never would she ever run, from the fists of evil again. When 
            silence gripped the night, she had time to burn-in the memories. There 
            and then, her destiny had flashed before her eyes.  She reflected 
            on the words her mother had spoke,
          <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent> 
          <p>Survive this, your darkest hour, and you will grow strong enough 
            to bring <b>justice</b> to the feet of Evil, Spread <b>truth</b> of 
            what really happened this day.  Become a beacon of <b>light</b> in 
            this land of dark.</p>
