<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><font size="3">Ingredients for Ronium</font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"> Sands of Ro:<br>
    Found in Oasis of Sand Giants. Level 30 is bare minimum to group and that 
    with you as the lowest level in the group. Safest groups for Sand Giants are 
    around levels 33-37. Or you can just take the easy way out of bypassing the 
    Sand Giants and paying someone 10pp (changed from 15-25pp) for the sand. I suggest you spend the 
    pp because nobody but us needs the stuff and lot of people save it to sell. 
    <br>
    Difficulty 5.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mistmoore Granite:<br>
    Rare drop off Leering or Jeering gargoyles and the occasional super rare drop 
    off a floating gargoyle in Mistmoore. This stuff is no drop so there is no 
    way buy this stuff off other people unless you plead to loot after them. So 
    the gargoyles are level 35 or so and we suck at soloing so you need a full 
    group of level 34's or better to camp the 2 spawn gargoyle spot or you need 
    to be in the castle with some high level 30's or low 40's inviso or with grouped 
    getting like no exp. Each granite weighs 2.5.<br>
    Difficulty 8.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">2 Bars of Enchanted Platinum:<br>
    These are by far the easiest to get all you have to do is find an enchanter 
    level 34+ to enchant you some platinum. The bars themselves cost 105pp each 
    and the enchanters charge different fees a level 50 charged me 60pp for 2 
    bars and a level 40 charged me only 40pp so find the right person maybe they'll 
    enchant them for free.<br>
    Difficulty 4.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Soil of Underfoot:<br>
    This stuff takes the second most time to get you first have to have kindly 
    or better faction with the dwarven clerics then you have to go to lesser faydark 
    and group kill fairies at around <font color="#FF0000">level 25</font> or 
    sit next to a group killing them and ask to loot the fairy dusts that's what 
    i did at level 28. You need 4 dusts per soil of underfoot and the soil is 
    lore no drop so you can have only one at a time. You give the dusts to Priestess 
    Chalea if she is high amiable, check by asking &quot;What is soil of the underfoot?&quot; 
    if she responds with give me four portions of powder you are fine. If she 
    responds by saying &quot;Go and talk to a Paladin&quot; you need to get LOADS 
    of bone chips and hand them into the Paladin all the way in the back left 
    of the Paladin guild in stacks of four.<br>
    <font color="#FF3300"> </font> Difficulty 9.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Meletite:<br>
    This stuff is the reason Paladins hate their armour quest this stuff is really 
    rare drops off clockworks (X and M class) in SOL A. It is tradable but expect 
    to pay from <font color="#FF3333">50 to 100pp</font> it all depends who selling 
    it. Each bar weighs 5.0 but it's worth it to get your armor. The bizzare in 
    East Commons and Sol A is the best places to try to buy this. Group level 
    to camp it is from 34-38 give or take a couple levels. <br>
    Difficulty 10.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Cauldron of Ro:<br>
    This comes from a dwarf by the name of Lord Searfire himself. To get this 
    wonder of the game you must have at least amiable faction with the temple 
    of solsek ro. The quickest way to get this is to take the flower on the casket 
    in the graveyard in the house in mistmoore and give it to the flying book 
    behind the house never kill it or suffer a faction hit. Say to Searfire "I 
    wish to make a bar of alloy". The cauldron weighs 7.5. The cauldron dissapears 
    every time you make a bar of ronium so you must go back to him every time. 
    The temple is right across from Sol A you zone in from lavastorm to the temple. 
    <br>
    Difficulty 7.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF3333">To make a bar of Ronium place all the ingredients in 
    the Cauldron UNSTACKED. In other words separate the bars of platinum or you 
    will fail! (Thanks Verant!) Also do NOT use a kiln only use a FORGE.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial">Molds for the Armour</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">The Paladin Camp is found in the Rathe 
  Mountains (I HIGHLY recommend a map) and is at loc (3000, -770). I suggest hailing 
  each of the Paladins to check to see if they will give you the mold. Also as 
  a side note make sure you have at least indifferent faction with all the Paladin 
  guilds because a few of the Paladins might want to beat you to death with the 
  mold rather than give it to you. You start with indifferent so if you haven't 
  done anything crazy you should be ok.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for the Greaves of Ro:<br>
    You must either group kill the Nightfall Giant that spawns in west commons 
    between 7pm and 6am game time and also South Ro at the roughly the same time 
    or pay someone for his head when they kill him. They will gladly take your 
    pp since his head weighs 20.0 and can't be put in a weight reduction bag. 
    Most people either give you the head or charge you up to 40pp. Take the head 
    to the paladin camp and give it to Elisabeth and she will give you the mold. 
    <br>
    <font color="#FF3333">To gain faction </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="#FF3333">with 
    her if she does not give you the quest</font><font color="#FF3333">, purchase 
    shark skins from the Port Authority in Freeport and give them to Theron in 
    the Hall of Truth in North Freeport.</font><br>
    AC 13 +6 STA +10 Cold.<br>
    Difficulty 6.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for the Boots of Ro:<br>
    You must find the rare spawn level 26-28 Sand Giant in South Ro. I kill him 
    with the help of a level 16 healing me at level 35 so i didn't have to use 
    my lay hands hehe. He always drops the kilij plans which you take to Nicholas 
    in the paladin camp in rathe mts. and he will give you the mold for the boots 
    of ro. <br>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><font color="#FF3333">To gain faction 
    </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="#FF3333">with her you need 
    to gain Clerics of the Underfoot faction, which you already have otherwise 
    you would have the soil of the underfoot.</font></font><font color="#FF3300"></font><br>
    AC 11 +35 hp.<br>
    Difficulty 8.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for the Breastplate of Ro:<br>
    You need to collect 2 dark cauldrons off anicile cooks in mistmoore. These 
    cooks pack more the skillets they can blast you down real good with there 
    harm touch yes the are shadow knights. Suggested group level to be killing 
    the servant side of the castle in mistmoore is 37-42. And if you don't have 
    enough healers or 40's in your group there not going to want to kill them 
    beacuse of the harm touch they'd rather kill the miad and bulter but on with 
    our armor. These cauldrons are no drop so you can't buy them at an auction 
    but if a group is killing on the servant side of the castle you can ask if 
    their are no paladin in the group to sit and wait to loot the cauldrons they 
    weigh 3.5 if i rember right. When you get the 2 dark cauldron take the to 
    the paladin camp in rathe mts. and give them to Abigail and receive the mold 
    for the brestplate of Ro. AC 20 +4 STR +10 Fire.<br>

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold For The Helm of Ro:<br>
    You must collect 2 undead cyclops heads ultra rare spawns in south karana. 
    Level i don't know haven't seen one since level 28 and didn't know i needed 
    his head then. They are tradable but know not the price people pay for them. 
    But if you do get 2 heads take them to thomas at the paladin camp in rathe 
    mts for the mold.<br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="#FF3333">To gain faction

    AC 13 +7 Wis. <br>
    Difficulty 10.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for the Gauntlets of Ro:<br>
    You must find Sentry Alechin who alternates spawn as a VERY aggro VERY rare 
    werewolf in South karana and take his locket to Sentry Joanna in the paladin 
    camp in rathe mts. I heard he's reallly hard to find and it's easier just 
    to kill him when he is sentry alechin still drops locket but you don't have 
    to wait for him to change into grimtooth if he does supposed to at night but 
    friend trailed him for 2 EQ days and he never changed so he took faction hit 
    and killed him. <br>

    Difficulty 10.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for Bracers of Ro:<br>
    You must kill goblin net masters in lake rathe i haven't done this yet but 
    their in the level 30's range and you need a tracker to help find them. Also 
    you need to breath under water for a long time to kill them to get an auqua 
    lung for a tinker person or get fish gills to have a shaman give you shallow 
    breath. Take their 2 nets and turn them into David in the Rathe Mountains 
    for the molds for bracers of Ro. AC 9. +5 magic prot. Wt. 2. Here is a <a href="netmaster.htm">map</a> 
    of their path and some info. (thanks to Kyle Reed for this).<br>
    <font color="#FF3333">To gain faction to receive this quest you must be in 
    wolf form or find a way to receive positive faction with the Erudite Paladins</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial"><br>
    Difficulty 8 with tracker 10 without.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Mold for the Vambraces of Ro:<br>
    You need 2 plagued shark portions from the plagued sharks in erud's crossing. 
    Again you need a tracker and a cast blaster this time cause a level 50 paladin 
    told me he can't take the sharks by himself. Plus there is a bug right now 
    that our plagued sharks are getting killed when they spawn by the normal sharks 
    so try to stagger the sharks spawns with the plagued ones. Give these to Marianna 
    in the Rathe Mountains.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial" color="#FF3333">To gain faction with 
    her if she does not give you the quest go into the West Karanas, slay bandits

</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Making a piece of Armor once you have 
  a mold and bar of ronium: Go to a forge and place the bar of ronium and the 
  mold and hit combine note NO WATER NEEDED if you put water in their it will 
  mess up. You no long need any skill in blacksmithing to do this but it has only 
  been tested down to skill 20 so i suggest your be at least that high.</font>
