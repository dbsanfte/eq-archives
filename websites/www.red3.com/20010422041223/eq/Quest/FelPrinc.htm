<p>This quest starts in Felwithe.  It is very long and involved, and results in a relatively weak item for all the effort you need to put into it.  </p>
<p>1. Go to the Felwithe Paladin guildmaster, Tynkale.</p>
<p>2. Hail him and reply "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"</p>
<p>3. Say you are experienced (ie. reply to the question other than I am inexperienced) </p>
<p>4. Go to Innothule Swamp and slay Jojoojojgogogoguna, the  huge Kobold lord in    Jojongua's Tower.</p>
<p>5. He is a rare spawn and drops a pelt called a Very Large Hide.</p>
<p>6.  Take his pelt to Tynkale for experience, faction and an item.  The following factions go up:  Clerics of Tunare, King Teristhex and antimage.  </p>
<p>7. Ask the innkeeper who is Tolon Nurbyte. He is found at a local inn (Golden Rooster Inn).</p>
<p>8. Go to Tolon Nurbyte (after he spawns) in High Keep and tell him the key phrase "The glory of Mother shines bright".</p>
<p>9. Tell him the phrase and he will tell you  to go to highkeep and tell Tearon Bleanix "All is not bright above the clouds". 

</p>
<p>10. To get to Tearon you need a lottery ticket.  In East Freeport go into Hallard's Resales (located in the "bad" part of E Freeport behind the import store) and talk to Tohsan Hallard.</p>
<p>11.   Bring him 4 orc pawn picks  and he will give you  a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket (NO DROP and LORE ITEM), which he tells you is a non-winning ticket from last year's lottery. You get the following faction changes for turning in the picks:  Coalition of Tradesfolk, Knights of Truth, Merchants of Qeynos and Coalition of Tradesfolk III all go up. </p>
<p>12. Take your new lottery ticket to Highkeep to the basement near the bank.   </p>
<p>13. Go talk to the person near the bank (not the banker) about something like the "highkeep lottery" and he will send you to talk to Casino Treasurer Lynn who is nearby.</p>
<p>14.  Give the ticket. Some tickets get you nothing, some are a "runner-up" and gets you a few coins and tiny amount of XP.  If the winning number that he gives you is on one of the tickets, you get the key to the Royal Suite on the 3rd floor, a nodrop lore item. </p>
<p>15. There is a locked door on the third floor, opened it with a key, and where you will find a paladin skeleton named "Tearon Bleanix" who responds to questions about "Princess Lenya". 

</p>
<p>16. He will give you a bracer and tell you to take to the Highpass Anna on floor 4.</p>
<p>17. Anna tells you to seek out Tylani and Marlin (she tells you to kill him; but you dont have to).  You do need to kill Tylani.  She drops a fishfood container.  </p>
<p>18. Mix in it 3 fairy dusts and 1 sand of ro to make fish food.  </p>
<p>19. Find marlin in the Rooster Inn in Highpass.  He is upstairs in the last room on the left.   He will ask for a silk evening gown found in qeynos.  </p>
<p>20. Bring him the gown and you will get a key.  Now, go to lake rathetear and find the "royal fish"   Feed the royal fish the final fish food product, and it turns out that it was in fact Princess Lenya Thex.  </p>
<p>21. Give the princess the bracer and the marlin key and she then gives you an amulet. </p>
<p>22. G back to Tearon Bleanix and give him the amulet and the highpass key #3 and for ALL this effort you get a paladin only shield called "Shield of the Silent Watch" [AC10 wis +10].
