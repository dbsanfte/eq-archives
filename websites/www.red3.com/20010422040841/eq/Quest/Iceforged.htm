      <td><u>What you need: </u> 
        <p></p>
        <p >I suggest to be at least level 50 to do this quest solo, also you 
          will need flame of light for it, divine might can help, but I did the 
          quest without it, so it is not necessary.  However, if you are below 
          level 50, you should bring a tracker with you or another tank. Two people 
          lvl 45 should also be able to do this quest, but one of them will have 
          to be a tracker (Druid or Ranger). Even if you want to do this quest 
          solo, you will need someone to port you to Wakening Lands (if you already 
          have the tooth of that place) or bring you through Kael Drakkel. </p>
        <u>How to do the quest:</u> 
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p >I suggest first to get <b>A strong wooden branch</b> from <b>Holgresh 
          Elementarists,</b><b> Holgresh Conjurers</b> or <b>Holgresh Elders</b> 
          in Awakening Land. </p>
        <p align="center" ><img src="a_holgresh_elementalist.jpg" width="258" height="171"> 
        </p>
        <p >If you have a tracker, you should hunt for <b>conjurers</b> through 
          the zone, they don’t nuke as hard as the elementarists and they also 
          drop the branch. If you have no tracker, you will have to go to the 
          holgresh cave. </p>
        <p align="center" ><img src="wakeningland.jpg" width="550" height="424"><br>
          (original from www.eqatlas.com)</p>
        <p >You can get there by following the right wall from Skyshrine zone 
          the zone entrance is at loc: -3500 2000 be sure you either are lvl 50 
          yourself here or have someone lvl 50 to pull for you, because you won’t 
          want to aggro more than one of the holgreshs. It usually takes about 
          20 holgreshs untill you get a strong wooden branch. <br>
        </p>
        <p ><b>NB</b> Pathing in the caves is atrocious according to Wyvernwill. 
          Pulling outside sometimes ends with the Holgresh becoming stuck underground. 
          Attacking them in the cave is the way to go he says.</p>
        <p>Once you get the branch, go to skyshrine zone. Left outside from the 
          zone there is a Tigeraptor camp. The <b>Tigeraptors</b> were peanuts 
          for me at lvl 50, so you should not have problems killing them. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="a_tigeraptor.jpg" width="287" height="191"></p>
        <p><b>NB</b> Beware of the named <b>Tigeraptor</b> that spawns there called 
          Rapticor, he is really tough and a lvl 49 Ranger and had to reverse 
          kite (fear it and beat on it while it runs) it. I also took it with 
          a lvl 53 warrior, Rapticor beat the Warrior down to 1 bubble of hp, 
          I hope that’s enough of a warning for you guys ;) However Rapticor is 
          a placeholder for other raptors, so if you got the people to kill him 
          its worth it. I am not sure if he also drops the <b>strong raptor gut</b> 
          but it could be since he also drops all the stuff normal raptors drop. 
          The gut seems to drop more frequently than the branch does, so this 
          should be rather easy, half an hour and you should have a strong raptor 
          gut. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Once you got both the items you were looking for, get someone to port 
          you out of Wakening Lands and move to Iceclad ocean. Find a <b>Snowfang 
          Fisher</b> and talk to him, if he tells you something about a “curse” 
          and that he needs some gifts, he is the guy you want to talk to to complete 
          the quest. Go through the stuff he tells you and at the end he tells 
          you he needs <b>strong raptor guts</b> and a <b>strong wooden branch</b> 
          (he wants to make a fishing pole) hand the two items in to him and right 
          after you completed the trade, a enraged walrus will spawn right next 
          to you. The fisherman and all guards around will attack it. Once you 
          killed the walrus, a irritated gnoll will spawn. (note he will replace 
          the fisherman, so if you accidently attacked the fisherman, he will 
          despawn now and the irritated gnoll won’t aggro you, happenet to me 
          hehe) hail him, he tells you something about a magic item, tell him 
          “I want the magic item” he then will despawn and on your curser there 
          will be a <b>chapter P</b>  put it into your backpack and run to the 
          gnome igloos near the docks where the ship arrives. Give the <b>“chapter 
          P”</b> to <b>Ami</b>, she is a female gnome standing outside an igloo 
          in the small village, pretty easy to find her. As reward she will give 
          you <b>The Pirate Book</b> give that to <b>Nilam</b> the chef, he is 
          sitting in an igloo next to <b>Ami</b>. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="NilhamChef.jpg" width="211" height="265"></p>
        <p>Once you turned it in to him, you will receive an ice forged shackle 
          stats: ac 10, str5, dex5, agi5, hp30 , if you right click it, it procs 
          velium shards, a 12dd spell with a 3 second cast time which you can 
          only use in melee range. ENJOY!</p>
