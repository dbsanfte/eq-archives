<p><font size="4">The Deepwater Harpoon Quest</font></p>
<p><font size="3">1. Go to the Temple of Marr in Freeport. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">2. Hail Serna Tasknon and learn about Sentry Xyrinn.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">3. Recieve a potion bottle.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">4. Bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in alphabetical order. 
  The guards and the order are as follows: ANDLIN (Walks around outside wall); 
  BORIS (Downstairs stationary); GALLIUS (Outside by front door); JANEAL (Downstairs 
  stationary); MEIGHAN (Outside by front door); THEO (Patrols inside on upper 
  levels); WARREN (Patrols inside on lower levels); XYRINN (final sentry in OoT 
  -7000 -1000). If your faction is not high enough you can't get the bottle. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">5. When you give it to the Warren he will tell you that she 
  went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi. The sisters will tell you she is either dead 
  or stranded on a nearby island.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">6. Go to the island where she is stranded (-7000 -1000) and 
  give the bottle to her. She will give it back to you to take back to the temple, 
  after which you will be done. If you help kill all of the spectres and other 
  undead that he was going to kill and then give him the potion, he will stand 
  there for a while and then drop the Deepwater Harpoon.</font></p>
