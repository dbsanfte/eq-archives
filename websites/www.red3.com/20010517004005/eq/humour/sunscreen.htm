Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2000:<br>
Play EverQuest.<br>
<br>
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, getting an OC-3 fiber<br>
optic connect to your gaming rig would be it. The long-term benefits of<br>
fiber optic speed have been proved by LPBs everywhere, whereas the rest of<br>
my advice has no basis more reliable than my own lag filled experience. I<br>
will dispense this advice now.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the power and speed of your computer. Oh, never mind. You will not<br>
understand the power and speed of your computer until you've tried to play<br>
Darklands on a 486-50. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at<br>
screenshots of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much<br>
possibility lay before you.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as<br>
effective as trying to take on a hill giant at level 6 with a rusty dagger<br>
and rabies. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never<br>
crossed your worried mind, the 50% packetloss that blindsides you at 9 p.m.<br>
on some Thursday while you're running from a gorge hound in East Karana.<br>
<br>
Do one thing every day that scares your party members.<br>
<br>
Spam.<br>
<br>
Don't be reckless with other party member's lives. Don't put up with party<br>
members that are reckless with yours.<br>
<br>
Play all Day.<br>
<br>
Don't waste your time on ping envy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're<br>
behind. The game is long and in the end what matters is the satisfied grin<br>
on your teammates faces while you're sitting around the campfire roasting a<br>
lion patriarch steak.<br>
<br>
Forget all the times your spells fizzled. Remember the times you killed that<br>
wisp with your last spell.<br>
<br>
Keep your old demos. Throw away your old Voodoo1.<br>
<br>
Don't respawn camp.<br>
<br>
Don't feel guilty if you end up on the wrong end of a Blackburrow train and<br>
spam to keep alive.<br>
<br>
Get plenty of armor. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're<br>
hacked off.<br>
<br>
Maybe you're a powergamer, maybe you aren't. Maybe you like to PK, maybe you<br>
don't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40 because your wife thinks you play too many<br>
video games, maybe you'll both be playing Team Fortress Classic on your 75th<br>
wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't take losing too seriously, or<br>
winning either. Your defense was probably be half assed. So was your<br>
offense.<br>
<br>
Get to know your cleric. You never know who she might heal when both of the<br>
tanks have gone under two bubbles.<br>
<br>
Do not suffer from level envy. That 38th level wizard is probably only 15<br>
years old and on summer vacation. Plus he has acne.<br>
<br>
Talk to people while you fish.<br>
<br>
Understand that guilds come and go, but only a respectable few live on in<br>
memory. Work hard to bridge the gaps between servers, because the older you<br>
get, the more you'll miss the people who hunted with you when you were<br>
young.<br>
<br>
Play in the Arena once, but leave before it makes you hard. Go hunt wisps on<br>
Erud's crossing once, but leave before it makes you soft.<br>
<br>
Use hotkeys.<br>
<br>
Accept certain inalienable truths: Pings will drop. People will steal kills.<br>
You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were<br>
young, pings sucked, guilds were noble and everyone played nice.<br>
<br>
Respect your leaders.<br>
<br>
Don't expect anyone to heal you. Maybe you have a good cleric. Maybe you'll<br>
have a kick ass monk. But you never know when either one might piss off a<br>
griffon.<br>
<br>
Save newbies. Don't kill monsters that con green to you. But remember that<br>
they might con red to someone else.<br>
<br>
Be suspicious about the little moving shape on the horizon, but be patient<br>
with the ranger who takes you on a 5 minute detour around it. Leaving<br>
corpses unlooted are a form of territorial pissing. Picking up loot off a<br>
monster someone left is a way of fishing money from the disposal, wiping off<br>
the blood, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's<br>
worth.<br>
<br>
But trust me on the OC-3 fiber optic connect.<br>
