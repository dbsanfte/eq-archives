  <p>     Target and hail Hasten Bootstrutter.  This sounds easier then it is 
    for Hasten is one fast little gnome.  He will easily outrun a player with 
    a 50<sup>th</sup> level Spirit of the Wolf.  He does have a static route that 
    he travels so please refer to the included map.  I have never seen him initiate 
    combat with another player, but that doesn’t mean he can’t so becareful.  
    Also I have been told, but never it, he MAY occasionally get stuck under a 
    rock or other obstruction, when this happens you wont be able to target him 
    nor talk to him.  If this happens you can try to petition a GM or get a player 
    to pull him out. 
  <p><b>Conversation Log:</b> 
  <p><font color="#FF3333">You say, 'Hail Hasten Bootstrutter' </font> 
  <p>Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Stopped I have done. Greet you I will. What business 
    do we have? Hmm? Speak up!! 
  <p><font color="#FF3333">You say, 'What journeyman's boots' </font> 
  <p>Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Jorneyman's Boots are what you seek? Ha!! I have 
    those upon my feet and disintegrate will they if my life is taken. Extra pair 
    have I and [rare trade] can we make. 
  <p><font color="#FF3333">You say, 'What rare trade' </font> 
  <p>Hasten Bootstrutter says 'I call for three things and Journeyman Boots are 
    yours. I call for a [Shadowed Rapier], call for the [Ring of the Ancients] 
    and call for Gold,.. 3250 Gold Coins!! This the trade that I call.
  <p><font color="#FF3333">You say, 'What shadowed rapier' </font> 
  <p>Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Shadowed Men, foes to all, have appeared. Many 
    lands do they walk. Invisible are they, but items they wield can be seen. 
    Seek them out and return to me a Shadowed Rapier. Return it with haste before 
    'poof' goes the rapier!! No time to camp have you. 
  <p><font color="#FF3333">You say, 'What ring of the ancients' </font> 
  <p>Hasten Bootstrutter says 'Ancient Cyclops do march the land. Long have they 
    lived and crafted the Ring of the Ancients have they. I must have one and 
    you shall go and fetch one for me. Seek the lands of the oldest Cyclops clans. 
    Seek the plains, seek the island in tears and seek the dunes for there is 
    one who is last. His clan was blown from the sands.

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Obtaining the Ring of the Ancients is by far the most frustrating and time 
    consuming part of this quest.  The simple fact is you will need to camp for 
    the Ancient Cyclops, there is really no way around this.  There are 3 zones 
    where the Ancient Cyclops is reported to spawn Ocean of Tears, South Ro and 
    South Karana.</p>
  <p> <b><font size="5">Ring of the Ancients </font></b>(NO DROP)</p>
  <b><font size="4">Ocean of Tears (a.k.a. OOT) –</font></b> 
  <p>     This is my personal favorite zone to camp 
    the Ancient Cyclops.  There are generally 
    fewer people here because of the boat trip then in South Ro.  Fewer people translate into fewer KS’rs.  
    As with all Ancient Cyclops spawn sites there is a better then average 
    chance someone will be camping him.  Also 
    remember a group that can gain EXP from the various mobs in the spawn cycle 
    have greater <i>rights</i> to the spawn compared to someone 
    who can’t gain EXP, according the Verant’s Play Nice Policy.  I have seen instances where 35th to 45th level 
    groups forcing higher level solo’rs to give up the spawn with a GMs help, 
    of course.  If you do find a group 
    camping the Ancient Cyclops you can hunt the Sea Furies (39<sup>th</sup> – 
    42<sup>nd</sup>) depending on your groups level.  
    The Sea Furies are located to  *insert direction * 
  
  <p>Pros: Known spawn position with 
    small Placeholder list, Better EXP and Loot potential
  <p>Cons: higher level, heavily camped,

  <p><b>Strategies:</b> 
  <p>     Nothing special….  This is a straightforward camp.  Kill the placeholders until he spawns.  The Cyclops (both versions) are by far the 
    hardest NPCs at this spawn location.  You 
    don’t need to worry about wanderers since this is the only spawn on thi side 
    of thee island excluding the NPC vendors at the Mage tower.  If you wish to solo, use the “standard” class 
    based soloing methods.
  <p><b>Kill Stealing:</b> 
  <p>     Generally not an issue at this spawn location.  A groups right to the 
    spawn is generally recognized.  There are always exceptions to this rule however, 
    so kill it as FAST as you can.  This is what you came for; you don’t need 
    to really worry about the next spawn. 
  <p><b>Rumors:</b> 
  <p>There really aren’t many rumors regarding the Ancient Cyclops spawn in this 
    zone.  It is a long and straightforward camp. 
  <p class=MsoHeading8><font size="4"><b>South Desert of Ro (a.k.a. SRO) – AC 
    Rumor Central</b></font>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><b>Pros:</b> Lower level, spawns more often
  <p class=MsoHeading8><b>Cons:</b> Very Random spawn time, HEAVILY KS’d (FFA)</p>
  
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent> Because of the amount of Ksing in this zone, I dislike 
    camping for the Ancient Cyclops here.  There is no verified spawn point or 
    placeholder list.  However the reduced spawn time is very attractive and the 
    recent spawn rumors make this zone possible more worth while.  Refer to the 
    spawn methods section.

  <p><b>Rumors:</b></p>
  <p>The AC may not drop the Ring of the Ancients.  (Never seen this happen.)</p>
  
  <u><b>Spawn Methods:</b></u> 
  <p></p>
  <p>There are several rumors as to how to make the Ancient Cyclops spawn in South 
    Ro.  I will start with the most intriguing and one that has been done by several 
    people I know.  Using this method, one individual has been able to make the 
    Ancient Cyclops spawn within 15 minutes from his arrival in the zone, while 
    killing three mobs: 1) a mob named  “crypt mummy” 2) A random spawn of Sand 
    Giant and or a Mummy of various types and finally 3) the Ancient Cyclops.  
    Although this seems to be a very rare case, this method of killing the place 
    holder, its spawn and then the resulting SG or mummy spawn does seem to lead 
    to the Ancient Cyclops spawn much quicker than annihilating the entire zone.  
    Let start with this “3 Spawn Point Method”</p>
  <p><font size="6"><b> <font size="4">Spawn Point Method</font></b></font></p>
  <p>First in the series is a spawn at a half-buried temple near the sand and 
    grass line of the zone.  The loc is ENTER HERE.  Inside this temple, in the 
    center of the floor, spawns one of the following: a ghoul, dry bones skeleton 
    and the important one “crypt mummy”.  According to several player reports 
    the Ancient Cyclops spawn seems to be linked to the “crypt mummy” spawn.  
  </p>
  <p><b>1)  </b>       The spawn rate for this temple mob is 26 mins.  After killing 
    the “crypt mummy” a Sand Giant and or one of the various kinds of mummies 
    seems spawns within the zone.  This spawn appears to help and or is directly 
    linked to the spawning of the Ancient Cyclops.<br>
    <b>2) </b>        The second spawn is the Sand Giant and or Various Mummy 
    spawns mentioned earlier.  The following types of Mummies spawn within the 
    zone: A crypt mummy, lesser mummy and mummy. Search and destroy these four 
    types of spawn within the zone.  Although these don’t seem to be a placeholders 
    for the “crypt mummy”, it does seems to assist in the spawning of the AC. 
    <br>
    <b>3)</b>         The third spawn, should you be as fortunate as player mentioned 
    earlier, would be the Ancient Cyclops.  All statistical information on the 
    Ancient Cyclops can be found in this guide.  Upon the death of the Ancient 
    Cyclops it will yield the “Ring of the Ancients”.  LOOT IT!  </p>
  <p>While 
    this method seems to have the ability to reduce camping time, it DOES NOT 
    mean you will be in and out of South Ro in 20 minutes.  I also know of several cases where this method took between 3 and 
    6 hrs to yield the Ancient Cyclops.   This 
    does seem to be below the average spawn time for the Ancient Cyclops, which 
    is often 6 to 12, hrs of straight camping for players.  Remember this does in no way mean this is the 
    only way to make the Ancient Cyclops spawn or the best.  Only the Verant Coders know that information.  
    This is a player-derived technique that does seem to encourage the 
    Ancient Cyclops spawn.  
  
  <p><u><b>Kill Em All Method</b></u>
  <p></p>Although, I will mention it in this guide, it is of 
    course the most obvious and most blunt of the methods I will talk, about you 
    can always resort to the “Kill Em All and Let God Sort Em Out” method.  Although this can produce the Ancient Cyclops, 
    I hope you are saying to yourself, as I once did, “there has to be a better 
    way.”   This Question is what prompted 
    me to begin my many, many hours of information hunting on this subject.  Killing everything in the zone is not only 
    time consuming and attention demanding, you will also begin to thank the Gods 
    of Norrath for the /ignore command.  This 
    zone is home to many 15<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> level players and 
    all of who seem to know how to use the repeat last tell feature.  
    They will begin to use it on you at will, when they find out you are 
    the one raping the zone of all the viable targets.  
    Many, aren’t aware that this ISN’T the only zone in Norrath that spawns 
    20<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> level mobs and will let you know how much 
    they don’t like what you are doing.  Explaining 
    the circumstances, which have forced you to become Jboot crazy and are currently 
    causing you to annihilate the entire zone, does not seem to appease them.  I recommend either camping during the off hours 
    of EverQuest and (2 to 5 am PST) or choosing an alternate course of action.    
    
  
  <p><u><b>Personal Comments</b></u><b>:</b> 
  <p>If South Ro is your choice of camping locations I would 
    combine with most recent spawn rumor (3 spawn point) with a limited “kill 
    em all” approach.  I recommend hitting 
    the spawn points outlined and thing depending on your level, time and resources 
    killing Mummies and Sand Giants.  Many 
    times there is already a Sand Giant group in the zone, which has its pros 
    and cons.  The nice part is you won’t 
    have to hunt and kill all the Sand Giants that spawn.  However, if the Ancient Cyclops spawns, you will have more competition. 
  </p>
  <p>*NOTE* Keep 
    the Ancient Cyclops spawn away from the Dark Elf Merchant Camp, The WILL kill 
    the Ancient Cyclops and Oooooh what a waste that would be! </p>

  <h2>South Karana (a.k.a. SK)</h2>
  
  <p></p>I have very little to report on this zone.  Because of the size of the zone and the fact 
    that the Cyclops who are reported to be placeholders wander all across the 
    zone, you rarely see anyone camping here (I personally have never camped this 
    zone for the Ancient Cyclops).

    zone without ever seeing the coveted Ancient Cyclops

  <p>The 
    various Shadowman are all considered “summoned” creatures so the Expel Summoned 
    Series spells will work against them.  Shadowman 
    have a relatively small aggro range but are social defenders (Harmony, Lull 
    series).  My personal favorite hunting 
    spot is West Commons, wide-open area, large camp, and zoneline near by.

  <p>After you are lucky enough to get both the “Ring of the Ancients” and “Shadowed 
    Rapier”, the next step is to return to Hasten and give him the items.  With 
    the items you need to give 3250 gold pieces.  This can be a problem for some 
    characters and we will discuss several ways to solve it.</p>
  
  <p>First the gold weighs 81 stones.  So if you have a Strength buff that can 
    provide you with a STR higher than your normal weight plus 81 stones, you 
    are all set.  If you cant get a buff from a kind player, if you are a good 
    race you will most likely need two buffs to make the run to Rathe Mountains 
    from freeport/Qeynos/Rivervale, then here are some other options. 
  <p>If you are a caster and can bind yourself to any area you can….. Bind yourself 
    to a safe spot near the Ferrott zone line and that is also in Hasten’s run 
    path within the zone.  Refer to the Rathe Zone map  (I recommend Loc ENTER 
    HERE).  Get a friend, of sufficient level to be able to kill you with you 
    playing the role of a punching bag, to meet you at this loc.  While your friend 
    is running there, you are running to a bank.  Freeport if you are good and 
    Oggok if you are evil and will be allowed in the city.  Once your friend is 
    there, gate back.  Put one trash item in your main Inventory screen.  Have 
    your friend kill you in a duel.  After you recovery from the embarrassment 
    of a duel death.  Go over to your corpse and loot ONLY the money and the ONE 
    trash item. &nbsp; 
  <p>1) Now you have a choice, if Hasten is up and in the zone, you can also loot 
    the ring and the rapier from your corpse.  You should be able to run around 
    the zone and find Hasten with your items waiting for you at your corpse.  
    This is somewhat more dangerous than the next method but faster. &nbsp; <br>
    2) This next method picks up just after you looted the one trash item and 
    your money from your corpse.  Next, give your friend a good reason to want 
    to kill you.  You will need to die in another duel.  After recovery from the 
    duel, go over to your original corpse holding all your gear and loot it.  
    Now you are fully equipped and you have a personal bank on the ground… i.e. 
    your second corpse.  DON’T LOOT IT!   You want to drag your corpse in the 
    opposite direction of Hasten’s run path.  Shouldn’t take long to run into 
    Hasten along this path.  However, he is short and fast and if you don’t have 
    track or don’t have a tracker with you, I would recommend waiting at loc  
    ENTER HERE 
  <p>Regardless of the method you use for transporting the gold, once you find 
    Hasten give him the Ring of the Ancients, Shadowed Rapier and 3250 gold pieces 
    and he will return the Journeyman Boots to you.</p>
