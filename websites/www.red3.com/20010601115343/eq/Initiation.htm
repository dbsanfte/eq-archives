<P align="center"><b><font size="5">INITIATION RULES</font></b>
<P><b>1)</b> All applicants must be of 25th level unless it is an Alternate of 
  an existing member and then the level minimum is 20.<BR>
  <b>2)</b> All applicants must be of one of the following classes: 
<P>Bard <BR>
  Cleric <BR>
  Druid <BR>
  Enchanter <BR>
  Magician <BR>
  Monk <BR>
  Paladin <BR>
  Ranger <BR>
  Warrior <BR>
  Wizard<br>
  Shaman<br>
  <br>

<P><b>3)</b> All applicants must be of one of the following races: 
<P>Barbarian <BR>Dwarf <BR>Erudite <BR>Gnome <BR>Half Elf <BR>Halfling <BR>High 
Elf <BR>Human <BR>Wood Elf 
<blockquote>
  <p>NB. Two exceptions to the rule are <b>Dark Elf Clerics</b> and <b>Wood Elf 
    Rogues</b> (<b>Scouts</b>) which in order to be admitted must be guildinvited 
    in the Temple of Marr in North Freeport. The initiate must not be invisible 
    or be masked by any illusions. If the initiate is received well by the followers 
    of Marr they will be received into the guild (if they have met all the other 
    guidelines to membership as well). <br>
    <br>
    <b>Rogues Addendum</b>: <br>
    a) They must from now on be called <b>Scouts</b>. <br>
    b) They are allowed to use <b>all</b> of their class abilities, but must only 
    use them for Justice and "The Cause". (My thoughts are that I don't care how 
    you kill a spawn of Innothule just as long as you kill it before it harms 
    the path of Justice and her followers).<br>
    c) <b>No</b> pickpocketing unless agreed to by all members of a group. <br>
    d) They must be able to enter and be in good standing with the Hall of Truth 
    and the Temple of Life. <br>
    e) They must regard themselves with the upmost of honour and truth at all 
    times. Not just because they are members of The White Cross, but also because 
    their background is questionable and others must see they share no side with 
    their Rogue cousins. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<P><b>4)</b> The applicant must be "grouped with" / "shadowed" on no less that 
  2 nights before consideration. </P>
