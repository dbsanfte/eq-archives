<p>Inte, in the Plane of Sky, will tell you that he needs four things and upon 
  you handing them to him he will give you the blade he wields. These four things 
  are two blessings, the head of Miragul and the Robe of Miragul. </p>
<p>1) The Blessing of Nobility: You need a high faction with Akera, who is a Deepwater 
  Knight. This blessing is given to you by Akera in return for giving him Soulfire. 
  The details on getting <a href="http://www.red3.com/eq/Quest/qzimel.htm">Soulfire</a> 
  are here. </p>
<p>2) The Blessing of Sacrafice: You need a high faction with Akera, who is a 
  Deepwater Knight. This is given to you by Akera in return for giving him Ghoulbane. 
  You find Ghoulbane on the Shinlord in Upper Guk or a high level smegheadselling 
  it close to 1k pp.... no comment.... </p>
<p>3 and 4) The Head and Robe of Miragul: Each dragon drops a half of the book 
  of scale. You need to take the books to the bartender in the Blind Fish Tavern, 
  who will combine them into the Book of Scale for 1000 pp. Give the book to the 
  Oracle in the Ocean of Tears (he is usually camped) and he will give you back 
  an artifact called Miragul's Phylactery. This is the lich's missing soul. The 
  Lich Spawns in the Caves in Everfrost, which you get to by going through a hole 
  in the ice at the river (enduring breath is very useful for this trip). In order 
  to give the lich back his soul, you need to get him so that he will not KOS 
  you. I have been told that you can complete the Azraxs' Legacy quest in Paineel 
  to get faction with the lich, but can't confirm it, and tend to believe it is 
  unnecessary. The best way seems to be to have an Enchanter charm the liche and 
  then hand him the Phylactery. This will spawn the true Miragul, a 53 plus necromancer 
  who is as hard to kill as a dragon, so make sure you have lots of friends with 
  you. When you kill him, he drops the robe and his head. Turn in these four items 
  for the Fiery Avenger.</p>
