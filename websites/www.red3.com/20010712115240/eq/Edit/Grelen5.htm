        <p>The Final Battle Part 4</p>
        <p> The pikemen had withdrawn and the combined Human and Dwarven infantries 
          prepared to meet the tidal wave of evil that surged toward them. Occasional 
          pauses in flight allowed a few of the remaining catapults to launch 
          boulders into the masses of Orcs/Goblins/Ogres.</p>
        <p> The wall of bodies had completely vanished sight; quickly overrun 
          and trampled as the enemy eagerly sought the Forces of Light. With an 
          all-too familiar sound, bodies, armor, and weaponry collided. This time, 
          the Forces of Light couldn't not withstand the massive charge and the 
          line buckled and swayed. Whole sections were forced backwards; Human 
          and Dwarf dying for each and ever yard they yielded, Orc and Goblin 
          slaughtered gaining that same yard. When the Ogres finally reach the 
          action, the line finally snapped. Swinging huge swords with reckless 
          abandon, Human, Orc, Dwarf, and Goblin alike were cut down like wheat 
          before the scythe. A huge hole was ripped into the Forces of Light, 
          and the enemy raced to exploit the breach. The thundering of a hundred 
          horses drowned out the battle sounds for by a moment, before a section 
          of Knights plowed straight into the breach. Sword and ax and hoof met 
          flesh and armor and sheared through. Bones shattered, muscles ripped, 
          and blood flew in all directions. Even the Ogres were sore-pressed by 
          the combined attacks of Knight and horse. While immensely strong, the 
          dim-wit of the Ogre was readily identified by the veteran Knights and 
          exploited. Pairing off for each Ogre, the Knights descimated the Ogres 
          within minutes as their dismounted comrades at first held the Orcs and 
          Goblins before finally pushing them back.</p>
        <p> A flash-bang annouced a close-range offensive spell. The entire right 
          side of a horse's torso disappeared in a spray of tissue and liquids 
          along with the riding Knight's right leg as a Fireball detonated just 
          behind the horse's foreleg. Horse and Knight crashed to the ground with 
          a terrible shriek-yell of pain and death, swiftly dispatched by eager 
          foes greedy to kill. The massive form of Rainrunner came surging through 
          the enemy with the same reckless abandonment of a normal horse would 
          rear and plunge through water that was too high for it to run. Lothor 
          had spied the originate of the spell and had chosen to personally send 
          the Ogre-mage Beyond. Even as the Ogre-mage prepared a second spell, 
          casting ingredients in hand, arcane words muttering, Lothor drove his 
          sword through bulging neck muscle, shoulderblade, ribs, lung, into the 
          right half of its black double-heart. Shocked pain was etched on its 
          face, as the Ogre-mage toppled backwards. Lodge so deep in it's torso, 
          Lothor's broadsword was ripped from his hand. With a curse, he tossed 
          aside his shield and, speaking a quiet word, drew from a seemingly normal 
          leather sheath a dagger. The instant the tip cleared the sheath, however, 
          the weapon expanded into his two-handed Holy Avenger. Upon returning 
          to it's natural conformation, the Avenger's blade flashed blue with 
          ripples of dancing fire/lightning. Those enemy surrounding him shied 
          away from the sword as if they knew their doom was engraved upon its 
          blade. With all of his tremendous strength, Lothor cleaved completely 
          through the Orc and 3 Goblins in front of him. With grace far belittled 
          by his size, Lothor veritably danced out of the way of an overhead swing 
          by an Ogre. Lothor took full advantage of his opponent's opening, and 
          swung back-handed. Though the hit seemed glancing, the Ogre's outcry 
          indicated a telling blow. The return swing took off the Ogre's left 
          leg just above the knee. As the behemoth fell, Lothor stabbed the Avenger 
          from his off-side, driving completely through the torso. With a flick 
          of both wrists, Lothor gave the sword a quarter of a turn to ensure 
          the wound would not close when he withdrew the blade. A gout of black 
          blood gurgled out of the Ogre's mouth. With a final tremor, the body 
          when limp and crumpled to the ground. Giving a swift battle prayer for 
          Blessing, Lothor bellos at the top of his lungs, "Set Standard!"</p>
        <p> "Lothor, by Tiosler's Hammer, what are you doing?!?" shouted Thodrick. 
          "Our lines buckle. We are moments away from collapsing. We must fall 
          back and regroup." </p>
        <p>"Pull the infantry back, if you must. We'll still be here when you 
          get back."</p>
        <p> "You pompus ass! You can't possibly hold off this horde for long."</p>
        <p> "Then don't take long. Now, go!" Hurdling Dwarven curses with the 
          fury of Dragonfire, Thodrick disappeared over the throng of bodies that 
          were rapidly piling up around Lothor. </p>
        <p>True to their training, the Knights fought furiously to reach Lothor's 
          side. Once they had finished off all opposition behind him, the Standard 
          Bearer planted the Knight's banner deep into the ground about 5 paces 
          behind Lothor. Arranged in a wedge formation, the Knights slowly extended 
          their flanks until forming an spearhead. Slowly yet steadily, as if 
          fighting through the enemy was no more difficult than wading through 
          calf-deep mud, the formation continued to maneuver until it formed a 
          double V. This enabled any given Knight, except for the tail flankers, 
          to be supported by at least 2 other Knights. This mutual support greatly 
          increased not only the effectiveness of each Knight, but his morale 
          as well. Sensing the panicked flight of the rest of the Forces of Light, 
          the enemy doubled their efforts to sweep away the Knights.</p>
        <p> Under explicit orders from Lothor to NEVER launch over the Knights' 
          formation, the 2 catapults on the plain's floor continued to fire into 
          the flanking sides. The tightly packed numbers of the enemy ensured 
          that at least 20 were killed outright with each hurl. Arrows continued 
          to rain down from the canyon walls, though much closer to the mouth 
          then before. The missiles dwindled the numbers by 50s and hundreds, 
          yet the bodies were swept away in the constant press of the enemy. The 
          casualties made no noticeable reduction in the vast size oor speed of 
          the enemy army.</p>
        <p> They just kept coming. The Knights were finally being hard pressed 
          to maintain their formation and soon were forced to shift again, to 
          prevent flanking. The outer "wings" folded back into a dimond-shape. 
          Out of the pressing masses of Orc and Goblin, the Ogres appeared and 
          lumbered straight for the Knights. Apparently oblivious to the presence 
          of their cohorts in evil, the Ogres trampled several score of Orc and 
          Goblin in their eagerness to reach the Knights. They were within a hundred 
          yards when four of them in a line were felled by a makeshift ballista 
          bolt. The responding cheer from the Dwarven engineers sounded like a 
          faint and distant roll of thunder. Puzzled by the sudden loss of several 
          comrades, the Ogres failed to reach the Knights as a single line. The 
          sporadic contact enabled the trio of knights in a supporting fashion 
          to deal with individual Ogres. So it was that the Knights continued 
          to hold their position, instead of the anticipated collapse that many 
          had foresee, both friend and foe alike. At last the bulk of the Ogres 
          arrived and began attacking the Knights. Seemingly for the first time 
          in the battle, the Knights began dying in number. The massive strength 
          of the Ogres would tell against the Plate-armored Knights so that even 
          the solid contact of a punch or a kick, let alone the swing of a club 
          or ax, would send a Knight sprawling; slow to rise, if at all. The Knights 
          responded with grim determination, years of training, and months of 
          battle-honed experience. Though out-numbered, the Knights were able 
          to use the large mass of the Ogres against them. By presenting such 
          a small area of combat, the Ogres were forced to fight nearly side-by-side. 
          Naturally, there were numerous jostling and interference among them, 
          which led to quite a few pushes and shoves and bickering. These distractions 
          were nearly always fatal, though occasional due to one or the other 
          of the Ogres themselves, more often than not an attentive Knight would 
          utilize the opportunity to slip a sword between the ribs or a timely 
          hamstring to be taken advantage by the Ogre's opponent. Though such 
          actions are normally frowned on by the Knights' Code, in such times 
          of mortal combat exceptions are made. Not that there were many officers 
          or sergents would could take the time to view the conduct of their men. 
        </p>
        <p>When the stamina of the Knights seemed to be strained to the point 
          of breaking, a great cry rose from behind their formation. A mighty 
          clash of steel on steel and the cacophany of multiple battle calls being 
          issued in multiple languages announced the return of the Forces of Light. 
          Human and Dwarven infantry plowed into the unsuspecting ranks of Goblin 
          and Orcs who had assembled a picket line to prevent any Knights from 
          escaping the Ogres slaughter. Unfortunately, nobody bothered to inform 
          the Knights that it was THEIR slaughter, not the OGRES, which was supposed 
          to take place. So the picketers had become bored and complacent. Many 
          died where they stood, without a clue as to what happened, as the Humans 
          and Dwarves sliced through their ranks and rushed towards the broiling 
          sea of bodies that marked the Knights' position. With a ferocity that 
          match their own, the Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres were became daunted by 
          the return of the Forces of Light. At first in ones and two, but with 
          ever-increasing numbers, they broke contact and began retreating. As 
          the infantry sweeped up their flanks, the Knights pivoted formations 
          again and returned to the double-V. Without the support of their comrades, 
          the Ogres were forced to retreat themselves to prevent a complete reversal 
          of their situation with the Knights. As the last few broke contact or 
          were killed, the 200 mounted Knights who had been ordered to reserves 
          charged onto the field of battle. What might have been a retreat became 
          a rout as panic and chaos dissolved what little organization remained 
          amongst the enemy. Red and blue fireballs and lighning bolts sailed 
          from the recesses of the canyon, striking death and carnage among Orcs 
          and Goblins yet advancing. Superstitious by nature, bearing the brunt 
          of a wizard's pent-up wrath was all the convincing most needed to joining 
          their fleeing brethren. Seeking to fight spell with spell, the evil 
          casters began their own mystic assaults and counterassaults. In a sinister 
          turn of events, a group of evil wizards and shaman were able to combine 
          their powers to cast a massive fireball the hue of sickly green and 
          swirling black. As this sphere of promised death sailed across the battlefield, 
          Orc and Human, Dwarf and Goblin paused to watch with horrific fasination. 
          As the sphere reached it's apex soon after casting and began to descend, 
          anyone with a vantage point could see the target was the concentration 
          of Knights. It was going to strike full in the center of their formation 
          and strike at the head. With no time to evade, the Knights as one raised 
          their shields and prepared to meet their immediate future. All, except 
          Lothor. With 3 mighty strides of his long, powerful legs, Lothor step 
          away from his men. With the Avenger held as if in mid-overhead swing, 
          Lothor faced the sphere alone as if he could cut through it. A quick-thinking 
          Light wizard cast a Dispel Magic spell at the sphere, but missed, sending 
          the energy bolt into the ranks of the Dark casters. A 'whomp-flash' 
          sent a concussion wave projecting out from the impact site for several 
          hundred strides, tossing aside caster and warrior with the fury of a 
          bull tossing an intruder. Seconds later the sphere reach Lothor... and 
          vanish with a bitter hiss a mere ten feet in front of him. Shouts of 
          relief and joy echoed off the canyon walls from every command of the 
          Forces of Light. </p>
        <p>The King himself rode out with his entourage to thank the Knights in 
          person. With his battle Mages maintaining strong auras of protection 
          and warding, King Girad had little to fear from the still distancing 
          enemies of Light. He found Lothor and Thodrick near the center of the 
          re-established lines, in heated debate. </p>
        <p>"Sire, let me lead the charge! We can sweep these vermin from this 
          bloody field for once and all!!" shouted Thodrick.</p>
        <p> Lothor continued to shake his head.</p>
        <p> "My liege, the Knights are unable to support such a charge after so 
          long a fight. Even if we could, that mass of 'vermin' could turn at 
          any moment. We would be easily surrounded and annihilated. We must make 
          use of this respite to see to the wounded and the dying. Perhaps even 
          the dead, if we are given enough time. Make no mistake, though, they 
          will be back. It may take several hours or even, Tioslar-willing, the 
          remainder of the day to reform their ranks. But they will do so. Only 
          our complete destruction will make them quit this field." </p>
        <p>The grave look on Girad's face nearly match Lothor's. </p>
        <p>"Fear you are correct, old friend. We have only a few hours of daylight 
          left. We must devise plans for how best to defend the night and seek 
          what rest we can. I'm sorry, Thodrick, but I must ask you to stay your 
          courage and lend your engineers the cunning and detail of your battle-hardened 
          knowledge." </p>
        <p>"Aye, sire. I will do so." With a bow, Thodrick walked away. Muttering 
          something about species given long legs but lacking the will do use 
          them. </p>
        <p>"Do you think he is offended?" </p>
        <p>"No, my liege. Merely deflected. He will soon return to his old, sour 
          self." </p>
        <p>Thodrick's booming voice shouted the names of the chief Dwarven Engineer 
          and several leiutenants, giving orders on the distribution of supplies 
          and troop placement. </p>
        <p>A not-so-grim smile creased the King's face for the first time of this 
          day. 'Here we are, on the verge of obliteration, and Thodrick has never 
          seemed happier,' Girad thought. 'If this fight be our last, better to 
          be of good cheer and fulfill our duties as well as our destinies than 
          to despair and cloud our minds with fear and doubt.' </p>
        <p>"If there is one thing that Dwarves love more than metal and gems and 
          drinking, it's combat. And if there is one thing they do better than 
          mine and forge and cut, it's fighting. I wish we had more of them, my 
          liege." </p>
        <p>"Aye, Lothor. More of them and more of your Knights. And while we're 
          at at it, I wish we had a few good dragons." </p>
        <p>The two leaders looked at each other with renewed grimness. </p>
        <p>"Still no word, I take it."</p>
        <p> "I ordered a fresh batch of riders to seek out the few that we are 
          aware of. Many are now deep behind enemy lines, if they still exist. 
          I fear we are on our own this time. Would that all the Wyrm had receded 
          back to their dream realm and left us mortals be. Would that it were 
          day and the night safely behind us."</p>
        <p> "Dawn will greet us soon enough, my King. All that remains is how 
          we will greet it."</p>
        <p>"Well said, Lothor, well said. Let us about it then."</p>
        <p> Amidst the organized chaos if Dwarven engineers at work, the King 
          and his entourage retired from the battlefield. Lothor watched is boyhood 
          friend ride towards the rear, with the weight of the world as they know 
          it pushing at him from all sides. Kneeling, Lothor rested his head against 
          the pommel of this Holy Avenger. Closing his eyes, Lothor whispered 
          a Prayer for his King. 'Tomorrow will be terrible enough. Let him sleep 
          peaceably.' The gentle wave of tingling washed over him, answering his 
          request. 'Your servant thanks you, Tioslar.' </p>
        <p>Opening his eyes, Lothor beheld the last of the Sun as it slipped silently 
          behind the mountains that gave quiet witness to this Final Battle.</p>
