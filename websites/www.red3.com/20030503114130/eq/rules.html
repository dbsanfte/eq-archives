<P align=center><font size="5">The Rules and Codes of Conduct of The White Cross</font>
<br>
  (revised 5th February 2001)
<P align=center><b><font size="4">CONDUCT RULES</font></b>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>1)</b> One must conduct themselves in the best possible manner at all times REGARDLESS of their &quot;role playing&quot; or what is happening in their real life (this includes drunken outbursts, stress, real life problems, etc). Examples:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>	 i) if you are a Drow Cleric you must behave or find another guild that allows your dark humour <br>
      ii) if you get really drunk and have violent outburst you will be added to the Smeg List and another outburst will undoubtably get you guildremoved.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2)</b> Anything that is considered abuse/harassment sexual or otherwise is <b>NOT</b> an issue of the Guild or of members of the guild. It is to be /reported or /petitioned to the EQ Customer Representatives. If you can not deal with the persons continue attacks use /ignore to ignore the person. It is NOT to be brought up on the boards unless an enquiry is made into someone that is banned from the game.</p>
  <p><b>Conduct on the Boards</b></p>
  <p><b>1)</b> The boards are <b>NOT</b> to be used in a &quot;flame fest&quot;. If I deem a post to be an attack on another player you will be added to the Smeg List.
If you feel I (Feonyx) have attacked or flamed you please say so on the boards in a non-offensive manner and I will ask other officers if I went &quot;over board&quot; and yes add myself to the dreaded Smeg List.</p>
  <p><b>2)</b> The boards
are to be used for Raid Planning, General Discussions, Jokes, etc. etc. They are <b>NOT</b> to be used by passed members of the guild in any other form other than that which benefits the guild, is a &quot;HI! How are you guys doing?&quot;, raid planning, useful links, etc. If you have a complaint against the guild bring it up to me and I will post it if it seems appropriate. </p>
  <p>Violators or the above rules will have their account frozen. Continue violation will mean posts will have to read by me before they get submitted (something non of us want to see).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align=center><b><font size="4">RAID RULES</font></b>
  
<blockquote>
<p><b>1)</b> You sign up for a raid. You attend. If a RL issue comes up, post 
    on the boards or tell the raid leader. This might add you to the Smeg List 
    (see below) depending on the frequency and/or the cause of you not attending. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2)</b> If a raid is posted on the boards and: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a) You are of the required level. <br>
      b) You are online. <br>
      c) The raid requires numbers (as deemed by the general consensus of the 
      guild. In other words use common sense. Kael does for example. Seb Key Quest 
      doesn't and is therefore optional). </p>
    <p> you WILL attend the raid. If you don't, you get put on my Smeg List.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>3)</b> If you break any of the other rules on the rules list / Code of 
    Conduct you get put on the Smeg List. <br>
    <br>
    <b>4)</b> If you complain or argue about anything to any other member or in 
    guildsay or on the boards about raiding or the lack of support or someone 
    that bugs you in the guild WITHOUT talking to me first. Leave the guild or 
    you will be asked to leave (or guild removed). I am always available either 
    in game, PM or <a href="mailto:Feonyx@hotmail.com">Feonyx@hotmail.com</a> 
    </p>
  <p><b>5)</b> They will be no MORE than <b>two weekday</b> planned raids and no MORE than <b>two weekend</b> planned raids per week. A planned raid is one that is posted on the boards. Friday is considered a weekend day. The reason for this new rule will mean larger numbers at planned raids. Ease of planning for raid leaders. Less conflict of raids. Less people being added to smeg list. Less people getting tired with constant raiding.</p>
  <p><b>6) </b>People that fail to attend another member 55+ Epic raid and are of level to attend and are online and don't have a pre-discussed excuse for not coming will be asked to leave. You will NOT be able to used &quot;Sorry I didn't know&quot; as an excuse. <br>

  <p> If you get put on my smeg list I will have a talk with you. If you repeatedly 
    get put on the smeg list and you test my patience I will ask you to leave. 
    DO NOT test my patience. <br>
    <br>
    People that stay off my smeg list, attend raids regularly and help the guild 
    in general have been in the past noticed and received officership. This will 
    happen more so now. </p>
  <p>Officers are asked to help maintain the Smeg List and be honest. Yes we are 
    all friends and its hard putting someone on the list, but its for the greater 
    good of the guild and its not the end of the World to be put on the list.... 
    just the beginning of the end of World :).</p>
