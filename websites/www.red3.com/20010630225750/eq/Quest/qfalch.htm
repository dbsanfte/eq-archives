  <P><FONT size=5>The Falchion Quest</FONT></P>
<P>NB You need to gain enough faction with Lord Jyleel to start the quest. Do 
this by killing Orc Oracles in CrushBone and giving Illegable Scrolls to him or 
by giving the Cleric Guild Bone Chips.</P>
<P>1. Talk to the Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin 
guild in Felwithe. </P>
<P>2. Kill the Orc Runner that runs from the entrance to Greater Faydark in 
Butcher Block Mountains along the path towards the crossroads. (you must be at 
least level 8 to solo). A trick to getting him at a higher level is to sit down 
on the path near the two buildings and he will attack you. Some times he has an 
assistant and also may not always drop the pouch.</P>
  <P>3. Loot for the sealed letter pouch and keep hunting until you get the letter 
    from Dvinn and give it to Jyleel or get really good faction with the clerics 
    and paladins by doing the bone chip or illegible scroll quest. </P>
