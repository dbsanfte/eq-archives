  <p>Mistmoore Raid Review - 6th July</p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <p>First of all I would like to thank all the White Cross members that 
          showed up and I would especially like to thank all the officers and 
          members that went that bit further to make this event work. You guys 
          all make me so very proud... </p>
        <p>Part One - Getting to the Garg Room. After hacking and slashing our 
          way into the Graveyard we decided that instead of splitting into two 
          groups (one in Garg Room the other the valley by the castle entrance) 
          we would stay close by one another for safety and fun :). The evil of 
          Mistmoore parted and without almost my holy blood split we made it to 
          the Garg room. </p>
        <p>Part Two - MM Granite and SF Hilts for All After dulling our blades 
          on the hard stone bodies of the gargoyles for quite some time I think 
          almost all who came for Granite recieved some. The SF hilt was another 
          story altogether :). One hilt (hee hee or Ice Cream Cone as we came 
          call it) was dropped and the morale was running high. This alas was 
          the last that TWC would see tonight, but our spirits were never dampened. 
          Deciding that 10 odd members of the White Cross in one room was a little 
          more than MM could take, my group set off for the tower (a scream and 
          a yell away from the Garg room...hee.. hee) </p>
        <p>Part Three - RETREAT! Well the yell and scream came about 20 minutes 
          later and unfortunately all but the cornerstone of the group (Bonadin 
          you rock you!) fell even after many attempts by my group to taunt and 
          bash and heal and scream "RUN". The hoard from the pits of Hell pushed 
          the White Cross back to the zone (must have been at least 20-30 all 
          from the center of the Castle thank Marr Mayong wasn't around :)) and 
          we ran to regroup. Hee hee on a side note I still remember seeing Grelen 
          jumping from the bridge and saying there is no way he is going to make 
          it :) and LoHing him in mid air :) hee hee aaahhhhh the memories... 
        </p>
        <p>Part 4 - Feonyx looks at clock and decides he needs food and goes home. 
          Anyway... after regrouping and almost carbon copying the last assault 
          (I picked up new initiate Yurei as well WELCOME!) we decided to hold 
          the Garg room for safety. At which point I left and went home to grab 
          some food and then log back on. </p>
        <p>Part 5 - Upon my Return Upon logging on I was met by a train... not 
          surprisingly... but Xycotl was IN the train. I hack and slashed by my 
          fellow brothers to vanquish these foul beasts and watch them fall one 
          by one in typical White Cross fashion. X dropped the hilt of which went 
          to the honourable Olwen of Fate's Hand. Part 6 - Feonyx goes Sleeptime. 
          Looking once again at Father Time, Feonyx decides to camp and leaves 
          the brethren to coat the walls of Castle Mistmoore with evil's blood 
          once again... </p>
