        <p>The Final Battle; Part 3</p>
        <p> Through the smoke and chaos, Girad and Lothor strained to determine 
          the number of Dragons they were faced with.</p>
        <p> "3 of each Red, Blue, and Black, Sire."</p>
        <p> "Where and how could they find, let alone enlist, so many of these 
          ancient foes? We are doomed for sure."</p>
        <p> "Hold, Sire. Behind us are only the Plains for Solethil and the last 
          of our cities. We either hold here or we lose all we have left."</p>
        <p> Panic spread amongst the Forces of Light, fed by the Dragon-Awe/Fear 
          that eminated from each of the terrible, yet magnificent creatures. 
          The two Reds wheeled around for another pass along the now-burning wall 
          of bodies, while their brother led the Blues on a direct assault upon 
          the ground forces. The Blacks headed for individual catapult targets. 
          The monstrous ground forces of Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres flowed towards 
          the mouth of the canyon like a sentient river of oil, smothering anything 
          and everything in its path. It was then that the miracles that were 
          so desperately needed happened. A chance shot of from catapult 3 struck 
          the lead Blue full in the head and the mighty wyrm instantly plummeted 
          to the ground, crushing many an Orc and Goblin, as well as a few of 
          the Ogres. The remaining 3 Dragons of that flight, broke formation and 
          clawed for altitude, and safety. The alert archers on the opposing canyon 
          walls shifted their focus from the infantry below to the immediate threat 
          of the Black Dragons above. With the innate skills and vision of hundreds 
          of years of Elven breeding, the archers loosed their death upon the 
          Blacks. Though fierce fighters, Black Dragons are renowned for the stubborn 
          and independent natures. Which was why two mistakes happened: the Blacks 
          were completely oblivious to the aborted run by their Blue and Red cousins, 
          and their own attack was not a coordinated event against a single canyon 
          wall, but a near-simultaneous assault by 2 against the North wall and 
          1 against the South. The first of the North attack and the South attacker 
          were closest to their targets, thereby closest to the archers, and took 
          a full brunt of more than 300 arrows each. Though strong and heavily 
          armored, even the best suit of Full Platemail has weaknesses. So to 
          did the natural armor of the Dragons. Leathery wing-skins were punctured, 
          muscles were ripped open, torso and tail alike became pin-cushions to 
          the needles of Elven arrows. No longer caring about the catapults, the 
          Blacks were fighting to stay aloft. It was a battle they lost, as their 
          attack dives gave them too much momentum to divert. With a sickening 
          "thump-splat", the first Black dove straight into the canyon wall. Immediately, 
          a nearly detachment of Dwarven infantry moved in to finish it off. The 
          2nd managed to pull out enough to more land than crash. Dazed and badly 
          wounded, it should it's great head, trying to get rid of the double 
          vision it now had. It's final image was filled with the sight of a descending 
          Dwarven battle ax.</p>
        <p> The 3rd Black managed to spiral out of its attack in time to avoid 
          most of the arrows directed its way. Spidery language uttered and part 
          of the vanished into magical Darkness. Shouts of anger and confusion 
          quickly erupted from the sudden patch of night, as Elf and Dwarf became 
          disoriented. Some continued the way they were headed, others turn to 
          one side or another; all seeking to escape the Darkness. Even as the 
          Black swooped down, a few could be seen leaving the confines of the 
          spell. Some running, some tumbling. A few, lost, emerged and promptly 
          fell off the canyon wall, screaming and cursing until that first gut-wrenching 
          bounce. Then, only the body continued the pell-mell descent to the canyon 
          floor. The first body hadn't even come to rest, when the Black released 
          its breath weapon into the Darkness it had cast. A harsh hissing sound 
          immediately changed most of the shouting within to horrific screams 
          that seemed to increase with each passing moment, growing in volume 
          and in horribleness. Minutes passed and finally the screaming tapered 
          off to moans. The Black continued to circle overhead, like a massive 
          scavenger waiting to see if its prey was ready for eating. A lone Dwarf 
          stumbled out of the Darkness. Even from the distance of the King's post, 
          the Dwarf's body was terribly altered. The left arm was missing and 
          much of its helm and breastplate were gone. The Dwarf managed another 
          few steps before pitching face-first into the ground. Those running 
          to assist stopped short of the body; several turned away and emptied 
          their stomuchs. Abruptly, the Darkness vanished. Bodies lay everywhere. 
          The catapult was hardly recognizable as such, merely a collection of 
          blackened timber. Even the nearby boulders were scarred and burned. 
          Though not an effective range breath weapon, the Blacks' acid breath 
          had dissolved a full score or more of Dwarf and Elf caught in its path. 
          Liquified bodies, armor, catapult, and rock all ran together in nauseating 
          rivers of gory ooze as gravity pulled them down the canyon cliffs. With 
          a last glance at its brethren, the Black hissed in anger and smug satisfaction 
          before heading back towards the camp of the Orc/Goblin/Ogre force.</p>
        <p> The remaining archers and Dwarves scrambled to pull back to the relative 
          safety of the rest of the Forces of Light. Dwarven engineers worked 
          feverishly to both move and modify the remaining catapults to fire make-shift 
          bolts. Ballista were said to be quite effect against Dragons, but there 
          wasn't time to built them. So jury-rigging a few of the catapults was 
          their only option. The gruesome demonstration of the Dragons' various 
          powers served well in re-doubling their efforts.</p>
        <p> The stench and heat had driven the Forces of Light back from the former 
          wall of bodies. While this helped consolidate their lines, it also shortened 
          the area they had to maneuver in. When the Orc and Goblin horde burst 
          through, over, and around the charred bodies, the Forces of Light were 
          mortified at the blazen disregard for they showed for their fallen comrades. 
          The pikemen were unable to hold them at bay this time and were forced 
          to trade ground for time, desperately striving to keep the enemy occupied 
          until the infantry behind them could finish assembling their ranks and 
          commands. The bleat of a single horn started such a massive rumble that 
          many, friend and foe alike, feared an avalanche was beginning. The Knights 
          swept past each flank of the pikemen and cut straight across their ranks, 
          not ten strides in front of them. Ten abreast and 50 deep, each wave 
          of knights cut down their foes with eerie accuracy. With all the precision 
          of a parade demontration, the two companies met in the middle, with 
          the last 3 knights of each group passing through the ranks of the other 
          without breaking stride or forcing their counterpart to do otherwise. 
          The wave of a signal flag and the hoarse calls from their sergents sent 
          the pikemen in full retreat. A third company of Knights was on hand 
          to dispatch those Orcs and Goblins who had evaded the first two groups 
          and pursued the withdrawing pikemen.</p>
        <p> The criss-crossing of the two Knight groups cut a swarth of dead and 
          dying more than 30 strides deep. Barely scrapping the surface of the 
          giant oak's bark, but giving the pikemen precious seconds to race for 
          their comrades and their very lives. The galloping Knights reached the 
          infantry as the last of the pikemen reached safety. This signaled the 
          infantry they had but a few moments left before the full brunt of the 
          snarling, shouting, blood-thirsty mass of evil.</p>
