        <p><u><b>What we both remember…..</b></u></p>
        <p>They came in a rush, swarming over the defenceless farmers, killing 
          all, and showing no mercy. We were just 5 years of age, but still we 
          remember that terrible day, will carry the sounds of screaming and dying 
          men, woman and children to our graves. No one was spared, except us, 
          two small boys, too young to understand what was occurring and yet old 
          enough to remember the slaughter that occurred. And old enough to remember 
          the name of the man leading the slaughter…..Lucan</p>
        <p>We do not know why he spared us, but it was the last time we saw one 
          another for twenty years. Both of us thought the other dead. All we 
          knew was the names, Raren and Rayke, our last names had been forgotten. 
          People called us Raren and Rayke, so that was what we went by. </p>
        <br>
        <p><u><b>What Rayke remembers….</b></u></p>
        <p>It turns out that when we were separated after the killing and destruction 
          of our small farming village, the leader of the group sent me (Rayke) 
          to slave mines run by Orcs to work, doing jobs such as water runs for 
          the thirsty slaves until I was old enough to start mining. The next 
          10 years passed in a blur of pain and fatigue. Many were the times I 
          received whippings for trying to escape or not mining fast enough for 
          the orcs’ liking. My back bears the scars of many lashes. The whippings 
          served not to cow me, but to more firmly set my resolve to one-day escape. 
          So I quietly bided my time, watching as others, men and women, dwarves 
          and elves, fell before the cruelty of the orcs in those slave mines. 
          I learned after I escaped that the place that I spent 10 years of my 
          life was known as Crushbone. </p>
        <p>Over my years there in the mines there was a particularly mean orc 
          named Taktoth, who took a cruel delight in administering punishment 
          on me. Over the years he became slave leader of the section of the mines 
          I worked in. This Crushbone orc took any opportunity to lash me; there 
          was a time when I saw an elderly elven lady on water duty stumble and 
          fall near me. I went to her assistance and Taktoth was nearby, he saw 
          me helping the elderly elf, and whipped me for trying to assist her 
          escape. I learned later on that Taktoth had killed the elf because she 
          was too slow to do her tasks.</p>
        <p>The day I escaped was one of both monumental joy and sadness. It was 
          in the deepest hour of night, and there was a storm raging in the land, 
          lashing the countryside with torrents of rain, peals of thunder and 
          flashes of lightning. The place was murky with smoke and dim light from 
          the few torches as the night teams worked the mines. I had not been 
          given a break during the day for something as usual that Taktoth had 
          seen that irritated him about me and my punishment was to do the morning 
          and night shift. The ongoing thunderstorms had left the mines scarcely 
          populated with orc slavers and guards, most preferring to huddle in 
          the dryness of Crushbone Keep, rolling dice and drinking their cheap 
          wine and spirits. </p>
        <p>Throughout the day I had quietly worked my pickaxe and hammer at the 
          shackles binding my feet, working away at them when no orcs were about. 
          It was deep into the night when I finally heard the click of steel breaking 
          and the shackles fell away. For the first time in ten years my feet 
          were free of any constraints. Hiding the broken shackles in the recesses 
          of holes I had been digging in the rock that day, I made my way quickly 
          and quietly through the mines that I knew so well, hiding in the darkness 
          as orc slavers passed, moving ever onward to the surface. The slaves 
          I passed looked at me and quickly looked away, they had also seen many 
          slaves try to escape and seen them die in their efforts. If the slavers 
          had even an inkling that any slaves knew of an escape they would quickly 
          torture and kill them for any information they had. I knew many of the 
          faces of the slaves as I went by, some I even knew names and had struck 
          up friendships as I helped them through the years when I could, giving 
          them food or helping to bind their wounds after a whipping. It tore 
          my heart apart that I could not take any with me, but I needed to get 
          out myself and find help to return and free the rest of the slaves.</p>
        <p>I came to the tunnel entrance, remarkably without incident. At last! 
          Freedom so very near, I made to step furtively towards the entrance 
          when a voice behind me stopped me cold in my tracks. “Where do you think 
          you are going Rayke?” It was the guttural snarl of the orc slaver Taktoth. 
          I whirled around and pain lanced through my face and head as the orc 
          slaver’s whip lashed my face, taking one of my eyes as it struck. I 
          fell to the ground and he flailed at me with his whip, laughing mercilessly 
          as the whip cracked down on me. Through the agony a steely resolve grew 
          and soon I felt no pain, just an intense hatred to kill the orc and 
          claim my freedom that was just a short distance away.</p>
        <p>Arrogant in his surety he could kill me himself, and totally unprepared 
          was he for my surge upward at him, shrugging aside his whip blow and 
          hammering the mining hammer I had carried with me from the deep within 
          the mines. My desperation gave me strength I had never dreamed of and 
          the orc was totally unprepared, his eyes gaping wide in astonishment 
          as my hammer caved in his skull. Renewed hope and thrill coursed through 
          me, quickly replaced by the dull agony of fresh whip lashings and my 
          ruined eye. I was hurt, but the sight of the entrance so near and freedom 
          gave me the strength I needed.</p>
        <p>I staggered out into the driving wind and rain, thankful that no lightning 
          strikes occurred to light up the night. Thunder crashed in the night, 
          as if the caves were protesting my escape and trying to alert the orcs. 
          The next few hours were a blur of pain and running, always pushing on 
          when exhaustion and pain threatened to pull me into unconsciousness. 
          Eventually the results of my escape took its toll and I fell to the 
          ground, lying gasping in the muddy grass. The sound of horses in the 
          near distance coming toward me made me weakly raise my head, trying 
          in vain to struggle to rise and escape. But the efforts of my escape 
          had taken too much of a toll on my body and the last thing I saw as 
          unconsciousness claimed me was of the blurry silhouette of 4 horsemen 
          riding towards me through the driving rain….</p>
        <p>I awoke covered in blankets and in a room I did not know. Immediately 
          my senses kicked in and I struggled to rise, urgent to know of my surroundings, 
          questions burning in my mind; how did I get here, did the orcs recapture 
          me? Where is here?</p>
        <p>A crinkled elven face came into my vision and a gentle, yet firm hand 
          was placed on my chest. “Rest easy young one, you are safe and in good 
          hands. You need not worry”. As he gently pushed me back down into the 
          covers of he bed, the pain and aches from my escape came back in a rush 
          and a soft groan of pain escaped from me. The old elf smiled in kindness, 
          “You are in Felwithe, city of the elves. A patrol found you and brought 
          you back to us here. Your wounds are many my young friend and you require 
          rest to regain your strength and get better.”</p>
        <p>“My eye..?” I asked hand reaching up to the bandages that covered half 
          my face. </p>
        <p>“Our magics are strong, young one, but not strong enough to replace 
          an eye, unfortunately” Said the elf with sadness in his voice. “Most 
          of your wounds have been healed, but you need rest to regain your strength.”</p>
        <p>The next week passed and I regained my health and my strength. The 
          elves allowed me to wander freely through their city. It turned out 
          that when the patrol rescued me they brought me back to an inn that 
          was run by an old elf that was, as he said, “in my younger days, a proud 
          paladin and noble warrior of Tunare”. </p>
        <p>“What is a paladin?” I asked him one night as we sat quietly by the 
          fire of the inn after the close of business one night. Since my rescue 
          and recovery I had been helping him out in the inn, serving food, cleaning 
          plates and anything else he wanted me to do. </p>
        <p>The old elf sat back for a moment, eyes distant in thought for a moment 
          before answering. “Well, Rayke, a paladin is a holy warrior, a person 
          who stands up for what is right, helps out those less fortunate than 
          him. A paladin fights for the good of Norrath, with spells of healing 
          and defence at his disposal, and the faith and blessing of his god by 
          his side.”</p>
        <p>“A paladin is a warrior?” I asked</p>
        <p>“Yes, a paladin is a warrior. But they are also healers, teachers, 
          they will help out in any way they can, trying to bring a better way 
          of life to those less fortunate than them.”</p>
        <p>“Then I am a paladin, too” I said. I had told him of the many exploits 
          of my time down in the mines, of my kindness and unselfish deeds to 
          the other slaves in the mines.</p>
        <p>The old elf laughed for a moment. “Aye young one, you may be considered 
          a paladin through some of your actions, but you have not been trained 
          in the ways of being a paladin, you do not know the full extent of a 
          paladin, all of the wondrous deeds we can do”. He laughed again and 
          ruffled my hair fondly. “But if you like I know a person who can show 
          you the ways of being a paladin”. He looked directly at me this time, 
          all signs of mirth gone from his wrinkled face. “My time on Norrath 
          is soon going to end, and I see a great potential in you, young one. 
          I am having a visitor here tomorrow, someone who I apprenticed in the 
          paladin ways many years ago. I would like you to meet this man, talk 
          to him about what you would like to do”.</p>
        <p>That was the start of my life of being a paladin, throughout that all 
          one name remained etched on my mind, Lucan. I became apprenticed to 
          the old elf’s student, who was now an experienced veteran human paladin 
          of many summers. He was also looking to pass on his knowledge as he 
          neared the end of his useful paladin days. And the time he was at the 
          inn in Felwithe, he saw what he needed in me to apprentice me, and I 
          learned from him, and the old elf, about the life and training involved 
          in being a paladin.</p>
        <p>The next few years passed as I learned the ways of the paladin, he 
          took me back to his home town in Freeport and I lived there in the paladin 
          guild, training and honing my abilities. During my time there I learned 
          of the evil of the Freeport Militia and of the leader of the Militia, 
          Lucan Dlere. Was he the same man that was the leader of the band of 
          men that killed my family and torched my home and town all those years 
          ago? I did not know, and my talks with the paladin leader of Freeport, 
          Valeron Dushire, led me to no firm conclusions as well. I could only 
          speculate about this Lucan Dlere and wonder, knowing of the evils that 
          he has committed here in Freeport, was he also the same man that ruined 
          my childhood and young teenage hood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
          These thoughts still cross my mind now, as I travel down the road of 
          life, of the Paladin life.</span></p>
        <p><b><u><br>
          From the eyes of Raren…..</u></b></p>
        <p>My story is a sad and violent one; from the time of separation from 
          my brother I was sent to Blackborrow, home of the Sabertooth gnoll clan. 
          They enslaved me and made my life a living hell, many beatings occurred 
          and I was used as a gladiator in their pits to fight. </p>
        <p>Then one day when enough blood would have been spilled onto the ground 
          of the arena I might have found a Gladiator stronger than me and it 
          would have been my blood that coloured the sand in the arena red – blood 
          red and I would have left this world with the last thing I saw and heard 
          gnolls cheering my opponent for entertaining them well. That’s how I 
          was supposed to end, but it all turned out totally different. When the 
          gnolls took me to Blackborrow with a huge plane wagon where they used 
          to transport the treasures they took off their dead enemies and from 
          the villages they destroyed or burned down. With many other slaves I 
          was forced to follow them, bound with chains onto the back of the plane 
          wagon. Suddenly a man dressed in a black robe with a strange looking 
          sword stood in the middle of the road and the wagon had to stop, the 
          gnoll leader told him to get out of the way or he would end up lying 
          in the mud with cut off legs, arms and ears. </p>
        <p>The man looked deep into the gnolls eyes and smiled. “Are you sure?” 
          he said. The gnoll suddenly stepped back and I could see the fear in 
          his eyes. The man touched the gnolls shoulder and the gnoll fell onto 
          the ground dead. Another gnoll ran towards the man shouting “baaaaark! 
          Death to you! All enemies of the Blackborrow clan must DIE!” I could 
          only hear the hiss of a sword pulled out of a sheath. Then I could hear 
          the unlucky gnoll gasp, a sword was run through his chest and blood 
          ran out of his mouth, one last time he barked loudly then he fell to 
          the ground. I could hardly see what the man did, he was so unbelievably 
          quick. </p>
        <p>The other gnolls panicked and started running away in all directions. 
          Many of the slaves came free; I was one of the lucky ones who regained 
          their freedom. The man looked at us, “I do not care what the Blackborrow 
          Gnoll clan does, but when this scum enters my homeland or crosses my 
          way, I kill them. I do not care if they slave you, that’s bad luck. 
          Do not think I didn‘t do this because I am your friend or because I 
          wanted to free you. Maybe some people think it is not right to enslave 
          people, everyone has the right to be a free man blah blah, I just don’t 
          care, all I care about is my own life, and you guys watch after yourself, 
          do not rely on people that are stupid enough to wast time on helping 
          others. Anyways, you just regained your freedom so head back to your 
          hometown and do not ever tell anyone about me!” The people started walking 
          away, and soon I was the only one who was left standing in the wide 
          planes of Karana all on my own. The man turned around and said, “You 
          are free, didn’t you hear me? Go back to your family or hometown or 
          whatever.” </p>
        <p>“My hometown was burned, my family was killed I have nowhere to go 
          sir, I am all on my own”, I replied. </p>
        <p>The man chuckled and started walking away. “Sir I do not even know 
          where I am right now, could you help me?” He sighed, “Boy, I don’t care 
          if you are all on your own”. He suddenly stopped and turned around and 
          cold blue eyes stared hard at me. “What is your name?” he suddenly said.</p>
        <p>“People called me Raren in my hometown sir”, I replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
          He lifted an eyebrow: “Raren? I know you little man, I am a old friend 
          of your father, he knew me a long time ago.” He smiled, his smile still 
          something I remember to this day. It was not a happy smile; it was a 
          cold smile I always shivered when he smiled that way. </span></p>
        <p>“What is your name sir?” I asked out of curiosity. He looked deep into 
          my eyes, I felt as if I said something wrong. “I... I am sorry if I 
          said anything wrong sir” Again he smiled at me, turned around and started 
          walking away. I kept following him, not knowing if I had said something 
          wrong, and what would happen to me now. Would he keep an eye on me for 
          a while? Would he leave me in the next town where some woman might have 
          mercy with a poor soul such as me and raise me up? I really could not 
          say what would happen, but yet I was thankful for that man to save my 
          life. </p>
        <p>Again the memories of my hometown in flames returned and people screaming, 
          corpses everywhere, my parents slaughtered in front of me. A tear rolled 
          down my face and hit the ground. Was there still a reason to live for 
          me? </p>
        <p>“Vincent” the man suddenly said.</p>
        <p>“Umm, what sir?” I asked slightly irritated. </p>
        <p>“You asked for my name, I just told you my name, it is Vincent.” </p>
        <p>“Oh .... ok, sir Vincent“ I said. </p>
        <p>“Hmm, no, sir Vincent that does not sound right” He shook his head, 
          “just call me Vincent, Raren.” </p>
        <p>“I will sir... err Vincent.” He chuckled and kept walking.</p>
        <p>When dusk broke we arrived at a small house in the great planes that 
          we had walked through for the entire day. Vincent asked the owner of 
          the house if he could rent a room for the two of us, and luckily the 
          owner just had a room free for rent. As soon as I climbed into my bed, 
          I fell asleep and for some time I could forget all the cruel things 
          that happened to me and destroyed my life. The soft blankets felt good 
          and gave me the feeling of safety. </p>
        <p>The next morning I woke up and recognized the sun was shining right 
          into my face. A bit blinded by the sun I walked towards the small and 
          only window in the room. I saw Vincent fighting with his sword, but 
          I could not see any enemy. I opened the window and asked him what he 
          was doing there, he replied it was a practice to keep his fighting skills 
          honed and at their peak level of efficiency. Suddenly I realised that 
          if I was able to train very, very hard and put all my strength and willpower 
          into it, I might actually one day be able to take revenge on the man 
          that killed my parents, my brother and burned my hometown. </p>
        <p>“Vincent, can you teach me how to fight that way?” I asked him, very 
          directly. I was surprised the rough way I asked him this and was a bit 
          scared of the answer I might get. </p>
        <p>He stopped fighting the invisible enemy and looked at me. “You want 
          to become a fighter?”</p>
        <p>“Yes I do.” I replied.</p>
        <p>“A fighter is not what you may think of him, it is not about honour 
          and all that crap, you have to win a fight, there will never be a second 
          chance, so make sure you kill your enemy, no matter how. When you want 
          to become a good warrior you will have to make fighting your life, you 
          will embrace violence Raren! Either you become a fighter with all your 
          soul or you better let it be, I will not waste my time or effort on 
          someone who just practices and fights with half attention, you really 
          got to want to become a good fighter. You will have to kill people you 
          like, but you can not make a difference between them and your most hated 
          enemies.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
        <p>I nodded and said, “I lost my family, my friends, my hometown and my 
          brother by a cruel bunch of thieves that raided our hometown, and this 
          is the only way I can take revenge.”</p>
        <p>“No!” He said, “I will not train you just to take revenge for someone 
          who did harm to you or your family. My first lesson is NEVER let feelings 
          influence your decision, and don’t let them influence the way you fight. 
          A fighter who stays cool will always emerge victorious when fighting 
          someone who is blinded by hatred, even if the other fighter’s skills 
          are better. Hate, love, hate is a good feeling, it’s all about hate 
          in the world! Hate is what we live and what we die by, but it does not 
          belong to a battlefield, you fight just to fight and to improve your 
          skills you do not fight to take revenge or anything else. Fighting is 
          an art and it is the most difficult one to master Raren, It is very 
          difficult to keep feelings out of a battle, I know that, but if you 
          start with the aim to take revenge, you will never make it far.“ </p>
        <p>I thought about that statement for a moment before answering. “Still 
          I wish to follow the path of war,” I said. </p>
        <p>“Well now then we need to get you a sword,” he said, and again there 
          was the cold smile in his face. The next day we travelled to a big city 
          called Queynos. I had never been to such a big city before in my life; 
          so all the things that happened in this city surprised me. We walked 
          straight towards the Arena there, where we immediately started training. 
          <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
        </p>
        <p>The following 2 years where full of training, pain and lessons I am 
          still using when fighting. It was a busy time and I worked improving 
          my fighting skills. I would sometimes see Vincent walk down deep inside 
          the catacombs of the Arena building. I did never follow him there though, 
          after all he was my master and I had no right to behave like a spy and 
          watch everything he did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
        <p>When it was my sixteenth birthday he suddenly pulled out a sword while 
          I was doing strength exercises, holding up two large bricks of iron, 
          one in each hand and standing in the Arena like that for about an hour. 
        </p>
        <p>“This is yours my friend, now you know how to wield your sword properly 
          and what is even more important you have the right mental strength to 
          become a grandmaster of fighting, the rest of your strength you will 
          gain by becoming more wise and by learning how to use your skills properly.” 
        </p>
        <p>A few days later we had to leave town and walk through the planes of 
          Karana again, Vincent said an old friend of him had asked for help. 
          We moved through the huge planes of Karana, through a city inhabited 
          by humans high on the mountains, we went through the Kithicore Forest, 
          which is known to be populated by undead creatures at night. Then we 
          kept walking east and made a turn left. After a long travel we entered 
          a really strange looking city, it was mainly dark and many different 
          races were in there, the race I saw most people of was Elvin in features, 
          though with a dark skin. “I can feel the evil in this city Vincent, 
          it is all around us. Are you sure we are right here?” I whispered. “Trust 
          me!” was his reply.</p>
        <p>We arrived at a throne room where Vincent saluted the elf sitting on 
          the throne. </p>
        <p>“My lord!”, he said. “I report back after several years of being away 
          from my fellows and friends here in Neriak”. The elf smiled the same 
          way Vincent used to smile. “I have your reward here Vincent”. </p>
        <p>He gave him a small bag with something in it and a roll with writing 
          on it. That night I could not sleep because I could feel evil in this 
          city stronger than I ever did before. I shivered and decided to walk 
          around in the room Vincent and I were sleeping in a bit, out of curiosity 
          I took a look at the scroll Vincent was given by the elf…</p>
        <p>&lt; Dear Vincent my friend, thanks for your help at our raid on the 
          village of farmers. Here is your reward. </p>
        <p>Sir Lucan. </p>
        <p>PS: I wish you luck with your new recruit and I hope you can find him 
          before the Gnolls kill him or eat him or whatever those stupid creatures 
          are doing with their slaves. However, it is always good to have many 
          allies and the gnolls are always willing to fight for you when you give 
          them money and slaves&gt; </p>
        <p>I could not believe what I had just read. The man who had saved me 
          from my fate with the Gnolls, the man who had trained me and instructed 
          me. I whirled around and saw Vincent kneeling in a meditation like pose, 
          his back towards me. </p>
        <p>Full of hate I reached down to my ankle, to the secret sheath that 
          contained a dagger in it. With a broken sob I lunged at Vincent with 
          the dagger aiming at the centre of Vincent’s back, aiming for his heart. 
          The dagger’s shaft broke suddenly as if it had been thrust at a massive 
          brick of iron. </p>
        <p>Vincent raised himself to his feet and slowly turned around with a 
          smile, that scared me to death, his eyes were glowing light red and 
          I saw more demon than human being in those eyes. With a dark and very 
          strange voice he said “You will not be able to kill me if you use my 
          own source of power for it – hate!” He looked at the parchment lying 
          at the ground next to me. “So you now know. My own fault really for 
          leaving the parchment out, I hoped you would never find out the truth 
          about this. You have a willpower that is amongst the strongest I have 
          ever seen and there is a light burning inside you that made me unable 
          to convince your soul to follow the dark path of Innoruk, the prince 
          of hate, lord of the dark legions. That light inside you must be quenched!” 
          He spat on the ground near my feet. “That silly thing some weak people 
          believe in – goodness, light, honour and strength. Let me tell you one 
          thing, if there is anything we believe in that does not exist on this 
          world it’s good. The power of evil is so much stronger, but silly people 
          like you will never get it! I had hoped it would not come to this, hoped 
          that I could change your ways. However, I was wrong. You could not be 
          turned and now I will have to kill you, my former disciple. </p>
        <p>“So it is true, you were one of the people that burned my hometown, 
          Vincent” I said full of hate from the bottom of my feet to the top of 
          my hairs. I felt as if I would explode any second.</p>
        <p>“Yes, but what neither you, nor Lucan ever knew, is that because of 
          your father, the Paladins of Freeport selected your brother and you 
          to undertake training in the ways of the Paladins. Of course, as a Shadowknight 
          I could not see the talents of the two of you wasted and so I joined 
          Lucan’s band of men for a small payment to support him and find the 
          2 of you and turn your abilities, your as yet undiscovered and potential 
          powers to the dark path.”</p>
        <p>He smiled, “Don’t worry about Lucan, he is just another fallen Paladin, 
          too weak to follow the path of light, he has just been a marionette 
          in my play. I planned to convince the two of you to become Shadowknight 
          and fight for the legions of darkness for eternity, soon you would have 
          been known all around the world and people would not even have said 
          your name without being afraid of you. And Innoruk and his servants 
          would have ruled the world till the end of eternity!” He sighed and 
          looked at me with a coy smile, “You have to admit that was a pretty 
          smart idea, wasn’t it? Oh well too bad the orcs claimed your brother 
          as their slave before I could get to him. I guess his corpse is probably 
          rotting in some orc mine now, still holding the mining pick in hands 
          that had dug tunnels for the orcs for all his life since he was caught.” 
          Again he that cold smile and immediately I jumped at him trying to kill 
          him with my bare hands. In a matter of seconds he managed to overcome 
          me, using the same skills he had shown me but that my hatred had blurred 
          into forgetfulness. I lay on the floor with his sword at my chin. </p>
        <p>“You learned absolutely nothing! I could overcome you like a small 
          child that never in his life even heard the word fight! Do you remember 
          anything I taught you at all? Oh well I guess you are better left dead 
          than alive”. He chuckled, “And they said to me that time will wear you 
          down...I guess it didn’t”. </p>
        <p>He raised his sword arm to strike the fatal blow. Suddenly Vincent 
          froze in that position, unable to move it an inch forward or backward. 
          “W..w..what the...?” he said. Suddenly the room was full of a bright 
          light and both of us where blinded, when the light faded, I saw 5 men 
          in polished white armour, their swords pointed at Vincent. “You!” spat 
          Vincent with such hatred in his voice. He spoke a soft word and then 
          he could move again. </p>
        <p>One of men near Vincent said in a quiet voice “Here ends your path 
          of hate Vincent, you have brought enough evil to this world and too 
          many people died by your sword. The name Soulreaper shall no longer 
          fill the people’s hearts with fear, it shall be a name that Paladin’s 
          will always remember as one of the most evil creatures that walked across 
          the face of Norrath that was vanquished!”.</p>
        <p>Vincent laughed loudly “No Lashure Novashine, it is not going to end 
          that easy for you. I do not know how you got into this hallowed place 
          of evil. More of your kind will have to die and one day I will come 
          for you to spill your blood for Innoruk, then you will see the true 
          power of the dark side! Start counting your days, sooner or later we 
          will meet again and then we will see how long you can survive fighting 
          me. I am looking forward to see you again. Until then”. He laughed, 
          made a gesture and suddenly was gone. </p>
        <p>One of the knights spoke to me then, “Follow me Raren, I shall explain 
          more to you shortly. You can be at ease with us, we are Paladins of 
          the light and we mean you no harm. We will talk later”. Another of the 
          men standing in the room made a gesture with his hands and a few seconds 
          later I stood near the gates of Qeynos again.  </p>
        <p>Novashine lead me to the gates of the temple of light, a place Vincent 
          had always avoided to show me and had kept a very wide distance. Now 
          that I thought about it, I recognized that Vincent had never walked 
          close by a Paladin or Clerical structure or even talked to them during 
          the two years I had been with him. Vincent had hardly left the arena, 
          or at least I did not see him leave it. As we walked to the temple the 
          knight spoke “We listened to what Vincent told you, at one point he 
          was right, there is a fire of justice and light and good burning in 
          you, it is so strong that even the squire paladins can feel it. That’s 
          why we will take care about your training of becoming a Paladin. Your 
          father probably did not tell you, but he was a very well respected and 
          noble paladin of our order. We sent a member of our guild to do a delivery 
          run to Freeport and ask for their agreement, but no doubt they will 
          agree with us”. He smiled at me “Now you finally have met the right 
          people”. </p>
        <p>“Sir Novashine”, I asked, “I would like to know who this Vincent actually 
          is”. </p>
        <p>Novashine looked at me and said, “He probably is a powerful Shadowknight, 
          and a smart and cunning adversary. I do not know how old he is or where 
          he comes from, all I know is that even my father told me stories about 
          him when I was still a youth. And as you have seen he does not seem 
          to become any older, probably because he is one of Innoruk’s chosen. 
          He lives to serve Innoruk and enlarges his influence wherever he can. 
          If all the people he killed during his life so far would be put on a 
          large pile, it would probably be way larger than this building”. He 
          pointed towards the huge arena. I gasped. </p>
        <p>“So all the time I was trained by a person more demon than human being, 
          more butcher than fighter?” </p>
        <p>Novashine said “I have heard told that there is a certain sense of 
          honour about this man, he has never killed anyone without giving him 
          a chance to defend himself, he has overcome all with his own abilities, 
          evil as they may be. He never stabs someone from behind from what I 
          heard. Still if you think of evil, he would be a good person to imagine 
          how evil might look. And he is after us Paladin kind; fortunately we 
          are protected by Marr, which makes it risky for him to kill a Paladin. 
          You would be hard pressed to best this man in combat, such are the tales 
          of his skill in battle that we have heard. If he is after your blood, 
          you should better be very wary and alert. Make sure you either fight 
          perfectly or have another Paladin with you because he cannot overcome 
          the holy light of 2 Paladins.”</p>
        <p>“But always remember it is the same with us and Shadowknight. The forces 
          of good and evil are balanced, no matter what people tell you, that’s 
          the way it is, the earlier you accept it, the better. It can be dangerous 
          to underestimate evil. I have lost many brothers who did that. He has 
          trained you, which might give you a good chance being able to defeat 
          him in combat. I feel great strength inside you and he has instructed 
          you himself in the ways of swordsmanship. I feel a great potential in 
          you Raren.”</p>
        <p>Again it took years to modify and adapt my fighting style from the 
          way Vincent told me to a style more Paladin like, or, as I consider 
          it, a perfect blend of the two. Most of my time I spend learning the 
          codex of paladin-hood. I think when I was 21 my master said I had reached 
          the skills of a complete Paladin and handed me a sword. “Now go and 
          bring pride upon our name. And remember Marr is watching you”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  I nodded and turned around waving goodbye to all my fellow paladin mates 
          and started walking towards the gates of Queynos to see what the outside 
          world would face me with.....</span></p>
        <p>Concerning Vincent I kept hearing stories about him reporting where 
          he was seen, where he burned villages, killed people, laid waste to 
          the lands. I do not know how long it will take, but one day I will meet 
          him again and then either of us will take his last breath. Until then 
          I will walk across the face of Norrath protecting the innocent from 
          evil and encouraging my fellow brothers and sisters in the everlasting 
          fight of evil against good.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>The Final Battle – how the brothers meet up. A fight with Vincent….</u></b><br>
        <p>The sun was well into its decent towards dusk when the sounds of swords 
          clashing came to my ears as Rayke rode his steed slowly down the road 
          on the way home to Freeport. It had been a long week and Rayke was looking 
          forward to getting home to Freeport and relaxing for the night before 
          making my report to the Paladin leader Valeron Dushire. That week had 
          been hard and long, Rayke’s first trial as a full member of the Paladins 
          of North Freeport. Valeron had instructed me to ride to the far reaches 
          of the West Commonlands for a circular patrol and head to a small township 
          nested in the forest and deliver medical supplies that they had requested 
          from Freeport. The smiles of gratitude the young paladin had received 
          upon handing the much needed medicines had warmed his heart, and he 
          had enjoyed their hospitality for the night, eating real food for a 
          change instead of the dried food rations he had been provided for the 
          journey. Rayke had been careful for the first part of the journey back 
          to Freeport from the little village, mindful and aware of Freeport Militia 
          patrols. Rayke had heard that they did not take kindly to paladins, 
          though he was yet to see firsthand any of their evil, just stories and 
          rumours.</p>
        <p>Now Rayke was nearing the final stages of his journey home, guarded 
          wariness had been replaced by relaxed anticipation, thoughts of a nice 
          soft bed and a decent meal foremost in his mind. It was those thoughts 
          that were replaced by alertness as the sounds of the fight came to his 
          ears. It was up ahead, not on the main thoroughfare, but off a ways 
          into the trees. The late afternoon air was still and the sound, though 
          faint, carried to him.</p>
        <p>Rayke moved my horse quickly off the road and into the trees, thinking 
          that it was Freeport Militia involved, and concerned and curious of 
          who was fighting. His paladin instincts had taken over and he quickly 
          tied the horse to a tree and let it graze on the grass while quietly 
          and quickly making his way towards the sounds of fighting. Rayke had 
          his shield equipped but had yet to draw his longsword. He was not about 
          to do anything more until he had seen what was going on up ahead.</p>
        <p>There were only two people fighting, but it was a furious struggle 
          by the sounds of it. No quarter being given by either party. Soon Rayke 
          was able to make out distorted figures through the trees ahead.</p>
        <p>“Foolish Paladin!” Rayke heard the words spat out by one of the combatants, 
          as there was finally a lull in the fighting. “Your resistance to me 
          only makes the kill more pleasurable”.</p>
        <p>“You will find me no easy kill Vincent. Mithaniel Marr guides my sword 
          and my paladin training is true and thorough!”</p>
        <p>Again the fighting started in earnest. A fellow paladin was in trouble. 
          Needing no further encouragement Rayke quickened his pace and stepped 
          through the trees and into a small clearing with a creek running by 
          its edge.</p>
        <p>Both of the combatants were tall and clad in armour, though one was 
          a dark grey. The dark one was wielding a massive two-handed sword that 
          he swung with powerful and precise strokes, forcing the other back steadily, 
          who was fending off the heavy blows with sword and a battered shield.</p>
        <p>The one on the defensive was clad in steel mail and wore the insignia 
          of a paladin of Queynos over his armour. He wore a helm to protect his 
          head, so he could not yet make out his appearance.</p>
        <p>The grey one wore no helm, either through arrogance or confidence in 
          his abilities. He was a grizzled man who had seen many seasons, yet 
          was a solid and strong warrior still. A veteran of many battles by the 
          looks of it as he forced the paladin steadily back, his huge sword hammering 
          at the shield of the paladin, forcing him into a frenzied and desperate 
          defence.</p>
        <p>The grey armoured warrior laughed cruelly as the paladin stumbled over 
          a tree stump and fell, ducking as he did so. The duck saved his life 
          as the other’s huge sword, instead of cutting into the neck armour of 
          the paladin, crunched into the helm and knocked the paladin sideways, 
          the straps holding the helm on snapping with the force of the blow and 
          coming off. In a dazed heap the paladin fell and the other stepped up, 
          sword raised for a killing blow, and Rayke got a glimpse of the fallen 
          paladin’s face. A sudden tingling began in Rayke’s stomach; a feeling 
          of familiarity began to surface. There was something familiar with this 
          young paladin….</p>
        <p>“Hold!” Rayke shouted and stepped into the clearing more. The combatants 
          had not noticed the other paladin, caught up in their frenzied battle. 
          “What tis the reason that you attack one of my holy brethren?” Rayke’s 
          hand now rested on the hilt of his sword, a relaxed pose, but ready 
          to move into attack at a moments notice.</p>
        <p>The older man sneered at me. Recognition flooding his face. “So, the 
          lost brother returns to be reunited” The emotion in Rayke’s stomach 
          flooded into a burning reality and he looked at the other paladin slowly 
          climbing to his feet, wiping a hand across his head to remove blood 
          trickling down into his eyes. He was the same height as Rayke, and his 
          facial features were very similar. Thoughts of Rayke’s childhood came 
          back unbidden to him, of better times at play with the other children 
          before the town was destroyed. Thoughts of play with his brother.</p>
        <p>The other paladin was looking at Rayke with the same expression on 
          his face, one of almost recognition.</p>
        <p>“Yes. You are brothers, taken at a young age from your village, both 
          split up and given to slavery. You, Rayke” He even knew Rayke’s name! 
          Who was this man?! “You were given to the orcs before I could get to 
          you and spent many years down in the mines of Crushbone”. He turned 
          to look at the other paladin, “And you, Raren, you I took under my wing 
          from the gladiator pits of the Blackborrow Gnolls in the hopes of moulding 
          you into a Shadow Knight like myself. Bah! And now look at you! Your 
          father, if he were alive, would have been no doubt proud of you both. 
          But he was the last man to die in your village, killed by my sword. 
          Now you both follow in his footsteps and wear the colours of a paladin”.</p>
        <p>So many thoughts were abuzz in Rayke’s mind after that. This was his 
          long lost brother, the brother that was taken from him after his parents 
          were killed and he was taken into slavery. Raren was Rayke’s brother, 
          a paladin also? This man was the murderer of their father? This man 
          a Shadow Knight? Why did he try to train Raren in the ways of evil? 
          The same thoughts were no doubt swirling through Raren as well, judging 
          by his expression as well.</p>
        <p>“I have followed the progress of you Rayke over the years. My organisation 
          has eyes and ears in Freeport, in areas closest to your kind” He spat 
          the words out with such hate. “Raren, you would have been molded into 
          the likes of me, been my successor, I would have given you so much!”</p>
        <p>“Evil, Vincent. You would of given me so much evil. I am not like that, 
          nor will I ever be. I am grateful for you taking me from slavery, but 
          I can’t be a part of your ways. They are evil and must be stopped. As 
          a paladin it is my duty to bring you to justice for the crimes you have 
          committed”</p>
        <p>Vincent sighed. “And that is why I must kill you now. You are now a 
          scourge against my name. You have tainted me and mine with your knowledge 
          and I will forever end it.”</p>
        <p>Metal scaped as Rayke pulled out his longsword and went into combat 
          readiness. “Vincent, you will find two paladins now to stand against 
          your evil. I stand with my fellow paladin and brother.”</p>
        <p>Vincent laughed. “Good, I expected nothing less. At long last you two 
          are reunited, but it will only be for a short time. I shall enjoy killing 
          the two of you.” With that he lunged at Raren.</p>
        <p>A shout came from Raren’s throat, a paladin combat spell to give a 
          burst of strength and energy. He lunged forward and met Vincent’s powerful 
          overhead stroke with a solid blade arm, catching it easily and thrusting 
          Vincent back. Vincent turned with the push and easily caught Rayke’s 
          blade as it slashed at his back with a powerful defensive stroke, turning 
          the blade easily aside. Words came to his lips and suddenly Rayke felt 
          his strength being sapped. He had not encountered a Shadow Knight before, 
          but new of them through his paladin teachings. Like a paladin they were 
          in some aspects, though totally given over to evil. Warrior priests 
          of the dark gods they worshipped. </p>
        <p>Rayke staggered away and fended off another thrust from Vincent.</p>
        <p>“Call to Mithaniel Marr, Rayke” Raren yelled at him as he engaged Vincent. 
          “Let his powers help protect and ward you against his foul magics!” 
          They moved away from Rayke, engaged in furious battle as slowly some 
          strength began to return. Rayke called upon the holy powers of his god, 
          asking for strength and protection. With renewed purpose he joined the 
          battle.</p>
        <p>Vincent was a superb warrior, and he seemed to be enjoying the fight. 
          Fending off attacks from both paladins and laughing. Raren’s face was 
          a grim set of determination; he knew that this fight was a life and 
          death struggle. It was Vincent or they, and he was determined to be 
          the one who prevailed.</p>
        <p>Raren was an excellent swordsman; whatever knowledge of combat that 
          Vincent had passed on was doing him well. It was evident that he was 
          more accomplished than Rayke, oftentimes coming to his aid when Vincent 
          had him in a tight spot and giving him time to get his defences up and 
          renew the assault on the shadow knight.</p>
        <p>Back and forth across the clearing the three went, thrashing and heaving, 
          grunting with the strain of the battle. Sword a constant blur of motion, 
          Vincent’s huge sword crashing against the paladin’s shields with jarring 
          regularity. The shadow knight’s strength and stamina was like nothing 
          to two young paladins had seen. Even Raren marvelled at his former teacher. 
          During their training, Vincent had never revealed the full extent of 
          his prowess with the blade. Yet this was a battle that would not be 
          won quickly by either side.</p>
        <p>Thrust, parry, duck, riposte, lunge, shield up to block. All these 
          moves became monotonous as fatigue started to play a part in the battle. 
          Gone was the confident sneer on Vincent’s face. His was a mask of hatred 
          now. He had not counted on the sheer determination of the paladin brothers. 
          He had thought them an easy kill, lacking in experience and knowledge. 
          The paladin training that they both had received now served to frustrate 
          him more. But he had not made 500 winters and countless battles against 
          much more powerful foes, both human and inhuman, without having some 
          tricks of his own still to use, and the power of his dark god Innoruk.</p>
        <p>Again a spell came forth from Vincent’s mouth, his arm pointed at Raren. 
          A much more powerful spell this was. One aimed to damage the person 
          directly. Raren screamed in agony and dropped to the ground convulsing 
          and heaving in pain.</p>
        <p>“Shroud of Pain it is called, Raren. Hope you like it.” He blocked 
          an overhead chop from Rayke and lashed out with a heavy boot, connecting 
          solidly on the chest armour of Rayke, doing no real damage, but knocking 
          the young paladin off balance, as was its intention.</p>
        <p>Another spell came forth from Vincent and a magical darkness enveloped 
          Rayke’s sight and pain flooded his body. Blinded and in great pain Rayke 
          lashed out blindly with his sword, desperately hoping that he could 
          keep the shadow knight away from him until the spell effects subsided.</p>
        <p>Vincent moved in for the kill and was suddenly unable to move, his 
          feet rooted to the ground. Raren had regained his feet and called upon 
          his god to give him a burst of energy. Renewed with strength and vigour 
          he charged the older man. A wave of disease fell over Raren as he charged 
          but he gritted his teeth in determination and shrugged most of the effects 
          off, his sword crashed against Vincent’s blade, and again. The older 
          man held firm, even though he still could not move. His defences solid 
          still even under the furious paladin’s assault. </p>
        <p>Suddenly he grunted in pain as a frenzied slash got through his defences 
          and crashed into his leg armour, not piercing it, but denting it against 
          his leg to cause considerable pain. Then he could move again and he 
          dodged another thrust. Raren’s shield came forward suddenly and crashed 
          into his face, blood spurted from his mouth and nose and he staggered 
          backwards. He cried out as the sword slashed across his gauntleted hand, 
          cutting into the steel and he dropped his sword with a cry of pain.</p>
        <p>Raren was unprepared for the other gauntleted hand that swung around 
          and connected solidly and unopposed with his face, sending the young 
          paladin crashing to the ground in a stunned and bloodied heap.</p>
        <p>Vincent turned and another spell came forth and Rayke, who was just 
          regaining his senses, grunted and stiffened in pain as he felt some 
          of his strength and life force drain away.</p>
        <p>“Stupid foolish young paladins! You have no idea of what you are trying 
          to fight.” Vincent’s nose and mouth had stopped healing, but his hand 
          was still bloodied and throbbing slightly. He reached down to a sheath 
          at his leg and drew forth a dagger with a black blade.</p>
        <p>“Meet your maker, young one!” He lunged forward and thrust the dagger 
          through Rayke’s armoured chest in a quick, deft motion.</p>
        <p>A howl of pain was rent from Rayke as he staggered back, hand going 
          to the hole in his armour that was bleeding red blood vividly against 
          the silver metal. He tried to straighten, looked at his brother, trying 
          in vain to call to his god, then collapsed and was still.</p>
        <p>“No!” Raren screamed as he saw his brother fall heavily to the ground. 
          Looking around wildly he saw Vincent’s dropped sword near him. He lunged 
          and grasped the hilt. Instant pain and revulsion so great came suddenly 
          from him that he dropped the sword and staggered away from the tainted 
          blade, cradling his hand.</p>
        <p>Vincent laughed as he walked up and picked up his fallen sword. “This 
          sword knows its own Raren, it is an evil sword forged in magical furnaces 
          by godlike creatures many centuries ago for use by shadow knights, it 
          is called Soul Leech, the Dark Sword of Blood“</p>
        <p>“You killed my brother.” Raren said softly, tears streaming down his 
          bloodied face. “And you killed a paladin. If you have any honour still 
          left in that body of yours I now call upon it. Allow me to arm myself 
          again and then we finish it.” </p>
        <p>Vincent looked at his former pupil and considered. A quick nod was 
          all Raren needed and he scampered over and picked up his fallen sword 
          and shield. Raren was hurting. He was near exhaustion and the pain of 
          his wounds was wearing on him. He had no more magical resources to call 
          upon from his god, just the last reserves of stamina he had and his 
          skill with the blade.</p>
        <p>“Though my brother may have fallen to your foulness, you will find 
          me a much harder opponent. I cannot let you get away with this, both 
          as a brother and as a paladin. You know I will fight to my last breath, 
          and you know I have grown in skill since I was last with you. Have at 
          thee!” With a lunge Raren attacked his former teacher.</p>
        <p>Vincent was ready though and met Raren’s blade with a solid block. 
          Steel clashing loudly in the fading light. Raren was vicious and unrelenting 
          in his attack; his grief and anger giving him strength that forced the 
          older man steadily back. With a thud Vincent backed up as far as he 
          could go against the trunk of a tree. Raren’s furious attacks had backed 
          the shadow knight across the entire length of the clearing. </p>
        <p>A desperate duck saved the older man’s head as Raren’s blade bit deeply 
          into the trunk, but Raren blocked the reply thrust with his shield, 
          sacrificing the offence to protect himself and thereby giving time for 
          Vincent to pull himself free and away from the trees. </p>
        <p>Another spell started forth from Vincent but he stopped it suddenly. 
          “No. I will defeat you with the skill of my sword arm this time, not 
          with the aid of spells.” He charged at Raren.</p>
        <p>The older man’s greater swordsmanship began to tell on the battle and 
          it was not long after that Raren went down on one knee, bleeding from 
          a rent in the side of his armour. As the sword bit into flesh he felt 
          energy and life being sucked away, the sword was magical.</p>
        <p>“Get up, child!” Vincent yelled with hatred. He stood near Raren, sword 
          at the ready, breathing heavily. Raren lurched to his feet, ignoring 
          the pain flaring in his side, his former teacher’s taunting doing the 
          work for him and making the young paladin reckless in his attacks.</p>
        <p>It was not long after that again that Raren’s defences were broken 
          again and he staggered backwards, clutching at his shield arm, now useless 
          and bleeding near the shoulder. He would be unable to use the shield 
          now. Vincent laughed mercilessly as the wounded paladin struggled to 
          get rid of his shield and once again launched himself at the shadow 
          knight with a cry, bravely battling on.</p>
        <p>As it was, it turned out Vincent’s overconfidence in the idea he was 
          dealing with a seriously wounded and quickly fading paladin was his 
          nemeses. While Raren was in fact hurting and weak and light headed from 
          blood loss and the effects of the sword, he had saved one last trick 
          to use in the fight. Ironically, a manoeuvre that Vincent had taught 
          to him.</p>
        <p>Raren, stumbled and fell to one knee, head bowed and bloodied body 
          gasping for breaths. His sword pointing towards the ground, his whole 
          appearance that of one who had been beaten.</p>
        <p>“So the young paladin has reached the end. Sad, really. I had hoped 
          you to be a more challenging opponent, seeing that I taught you so much 
          of the ways of the sword.” Vincent’s voice was full of sarcasm and bravado; 
          he was not about to let the young man know that he had had the fight 
          of his life as well. He stepped closer to the bloodied paladin. “Do 
          pass on my regards to your brother.” The last word was sneered as he 
          raised the sword with both hands above his head and prepared to bring 
          it down on the bowed paladin’s neck.</p>
        <p>With a lightning quick lunge, the paladin that had looked beaten and 
          broken quickly turned and lunged upwards with the sword with all his 
          strength. Vincent saw the deception too late, his eyes going wide in 
          astonishment as Raren’s longsword punched through the chest armour of 
          Vincent.</p>
        <p>“That is something you taught me Vincent, remember?” Raren looked his 
          former teacher directly in the eye and wrenched the sword out. The older 
          man staggered back with a grunt, eyes open in disbelief, the sword falling 
          from nerveless fingers. A hand went to his chest and came back red with 
          blood, a darker stain on his armour quickly spreading. He coughed and 
          blood appeared on his lips.</p>
        <p>“Well done boy. Very well done”. He offered a lopsided smile at his 
          former pupil and dropped to the ground and was still.</p>
        <p>Raren bowed his head and a huge sigh came from his battered frame. 
          He was awash in a mix of emotions, relief, fear, anger and grief. He 
          raised his battered face and looked firstly at the body of his former 
          teacher, then at the still form of his brother.</p>
        <p>“Rayke”, he whispered as he painfully dragged himself over to the prone 
          form of the paladin he had finally met, only to loose once again. “My 
          brother.” He wrenched off his gauntlets, each movement sending sharp 
          jolts of pain through his battered and bloodied body, the wounds on 
          his side and upper arm screaming for attention. But he ignored the pain 
          as best he could for now and gently pushed away a lock of hair that 
          had fallen near the eye patch that his brother sported.</p>
        <p>A low moan came from Rayke, and he shuddered slightly. Raren’s sadness 
          suddenly changed to guarded hope, his brother was still alive, though 
          only just, and he had to act quickly. </p>
        <p>“Sorry, my brother, but this is going to hurt.” Raren, as gently and 
          as quickly as possible began to remove the battered breastplate, mindful 
          of every moan and groan of his mortally injured brother. Eventually 
          the breastplate came away and revealed his undershirt soaked through 
          with blood, and a gash in his chest, close to his heart.</p>
        <p>Raren placed his hand above the wound and closed his eyes. “Mithaniel 
          Marr, heal my brother. Grant me your favour and restore his health.” 
          Sudden warmth spread from his hand and the wound began to close and 
          heal, the bleeding stopped.</p>
        <p>In a moment Rayke had opened his eyes and was regarding his brother 
          properly for the first time in many years. “Vincent?” He asked.</p>
        <p>Raren turned to regard the fallen form of his former teacher. “He now 
          walks among the hell spawn creatures he worships”. Rayke’s smile was 
          full of warmth and gratitude.</p>
        <p>They helped each other up and Rayke steadied his brother, keeping him 
          upright and stable as his various wounds and lack of blood made the 
          world dim for a moment. Sudden warmth and strength coursed through his 
          body, his aches and pains quickly vanished as Rayke removed his hands 
          from his brother and let him stand on his own.</p>
        <p>Rayke bowed his head in humility. “Thankyou Mithaniel Marr for your 
          gift of healing.”</p>
        <p>“Guess we saved each other this day, brother.” Raren said with a smile.</p>
        <p>“That we did, my brother. That we did.” Replied Rayke.</p>
        <p>They went and gathered up their weapons, cleaning them and sheathing 
          them. Both Rayke’s and Raren’s shield’ were battered to near uselessness 
          so they left them where they lay. </p>
        <p>Though their wounds may have been healed, both were clearly exhausted. 
          “We must honour the fallen, friend and foe alike, with a proper burial.” 
          Raren said with a look at Vincent’s body. Rayke nodded and together 
          they quickly used the shields to make a shallow grave.</p>
        <p>“He may have been an evil man, but there was a certain honour to him” 
          Raren said as they moved through the trees to the spot Rayke had tethered 
          his horse.</p>
        <p>“He saved me from years of slavery and likely death. For that I will 
          always be grateful. But other than that, I have no regrets of what happened, 
          he would of killed me…us, if we had let him. His lived the life of a 
          warrior and died fighting, I think he would of liked to go out that 
          way. But enough of this, he is the past, and this is the current.” Raren 
          waited while Rayke untied his horse and together they mounted their 
          steeds.</p>
        <p>“This is the current yes” said Rayke, “and what do we do in the current?”</p>
        <p>“That,” said Raren, “is the fun part. We shall have fun finding that 
          out together. We have some catching up to do.”</p>
        <p>“Do you really think we are the brothers that Vincent spoke about? 
          I mean, really brothers?” Rayke asked as they made their way through 
          the trees and onto the road to Freeport once again.</p>
        <p>Raren was silent for a moment, lost in thought. “I have no doubt at 
          all that what Vincent said is true. We are brothers, Rayke. And we have 
          been reunited again.”</p>
        <p>Rayke nodded. “I feel the same way, I know it in my heart to be true 
          as well. Let it be known when we get to Freeport and the paladins that 
          Rayke and Raren Felsenspalter have been reunited again.” Rayke and Raren 
          urged their horses into a gallop, Freeport was only an hour or two away 
          and they were both anxious to spread the word that the name Felsenspalter 
          was for two paladins.</p>
        <br>
        <p>…Many are the adventures that the two brothers have been on. Many are 
          the foes they have vanquished. There are still journeys to be had, and 
          there are still foes to be vanquished. Together Raren and Rayke Felsenspalter 
          will tackle them, together as paladin brothers through blood and sword.</p>
