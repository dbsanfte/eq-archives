    <p><B>Biggest fear:</B> <br>
      <I>That one day I will log on and TWC will be no longer exist because everyone 
      has moved on...<br>
      </I><B>Funniest moment:</B> <br>
      <I>Watching Grelen get waxed by the NFP Paladin Guild leader when he hit 
      autoattack accidently was funny, but the funniest moment or moments were 
      back in the day when Melegant, Kapala, Wyvernwill, Penwig, Kanisah, Grelen 
      and myself used to get each other killed in strange and unusual ways... 
      I long for those days again...<br>
