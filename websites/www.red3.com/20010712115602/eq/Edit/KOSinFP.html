        <p><font size="4">How to get SF while KOS<br>
          By Grelen <br>
          (edited by Feonyx)</font></p>
        <p>Have a trusted friend cast Invisibility on you. Both of you run to 
          the Seafarer's Roost, south side of the docks in East Freeport. </p>
        <p>At night, a beggar like the one in Highhold will eventually appear 
          (he has 3 or 4 other place holders) at about 7AM. You need to give him 
          4 Drom's Champagne bottles pretty fast because he despawns at 9AM. The 
          Drom's are Lore, so you can only have one at a time. Unfortunately, 
          if you are KOS, you can NOT purchase the Drom's from the barkeeper so 
          either buy them from the female Barkeep or have your friend buy them 
          and give them to you. When the Begger receives the 4th Drom, he will 
          give you what looks like a note, but is actually a blanket with the 
          identification of &quot;Bunker #3&quot; on it. </p>
        <p>At this point, your caster friend needs to invis you again and you 
          leave. Head to West Freeport on go on a vermin killing spree killing 
          Beetles, Snakes and Rats. You will need Bog Juice (1 Snake Skin and 
          1 water bottle, placed in Brewery casket) and Edible Goo (1 Rat ear 
          and 1 Fire Beetle eye, placed in a baking oven) as well, for the next 
          part. <font color="#FF3300">BE SURE THAT THESE ARE PLACED LOWER IN YOUR 
          INVENTORY THAN YOUR NORMAL RATIONS OR IN THE BANK, OR ELSE YOU WILL 
          CONSUME THEM.</font></p>
        <p>Ok, from here, you need to run to the jail in West Freeport, which 
          is next to the Warrior's Guild and the Arena (back around where Guard 
          Hrakin spawns). Another Invisibility spell would be good here, to by-pass 
          the guards. </p>
        <p>Remember to avoid the Militia House! In the lower areas of the jail 
          is a prisoner. Go in and hail him several times, or ask about Zimel 
          (I don't remember which worked...). Eventually, he will ask for "Bog 
          'n' Goo". If hailed again, he will say "Bog 'n' Goo and blanket too". 
          You can give him all 3 together, but I don't think it matters. He will 
          give you a key marked "H.K #102" or something like that. Run to HighHold 
          Keep and give the key to the Banker lady in the basement. She will give 
          you the letter you will need to give to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw. If 
          you have the BSoF, your Testimony of Truth, The Hilt, and this letter, 
          you have the components for SF. Travel to Splitpaw. Hail Brother Hayle 
          (hehe) and, if you have enough faction with the Priest of Life (Qeynos), 
          he will give you the SF quest. FIRST, hand him ONLY!!! the letter from 
          the HK bank. He will hand it back and list for you the items you will 
          need as "Proof of nobility". Ask him about "Proof of Nobility". If he 
          gives you the list of items again, supposedly you have enough faction 
          for SF. Give him all 4 items. You will need to con at least Kindly with 
          Brother Hayle to get this. If you con Warmly with the Priests of Life, 
          that should be sufficient, as Brother Hayle is one faction level lower 
          then PoL's is... If all is well, receive the sweet-looking Soulfire 
          sword. </p>
        <p>I have everything except the BSoF, which I probably won't try for until 
          L42, like you were. Though I did get XP when our group got credit for 
          killing Live Lucan... mmmmm. Maybe I will try after getting to L40... 
          Anyway, I haven't been to Splitpaw yet, to see Brother Hayle, so I don't 
          know what my faction is either. I have done several quests for the Priests 
          of Life, both as a youngster and with Penwig after getting his Brother 
          Hayle letter. We'll see... </p>
        <p>Best of luck, my friend! Call on me, if you have need of my skills 
          and services (again, hehehe). Grelen</p>
