<p align="center">Here
is a snippet of what Kyle had to say about hunting the Goblin Netmasters...</p>
<p align="center">Heh as I found last night I had them spawn by the SE Island and swim
towards the north east one then curve west towards the 3spawn or ramp
island then back south again basically an upside down U. And I had one
spawn at 7 and at 9 but not at 11. The previous night I have a spawn at
7 and then at 11. When they say the netmasters are elusive it is an
understatement, I have a level 30 druid assisting me and over the course
of 60 hours have seen 11, one was KS, one suicided of the 9 I have
slain, only 1 had a net, too bad we need 4 of them for the pair of
bracers</p>
