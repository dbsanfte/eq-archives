    <i>The Minotaur Caves</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Meldrith will most definitely attack you and should be pretty easy to kill 
      off, but still quite annoying nevertheless.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="Skull1.jpg"><br>
  <i>The location in Meldrith's room and The Skull.</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> b) Dusty Ribcage - The Garden in Castle Mistmoore Castle. (Remember this 
    is Mistmoore and it can be very unforgiving... even for a 49th level Paladin). 
    Go through the &quot;Valley&quot; and take the Left opposite the Graveyard 
    and head down the tunnel. Head up the ramp on your left and head into MM. 
    Take the right within the Castle and head under the small bridge structure 
    and take another right and enter the door on your left. Take a right into 
    the garden and another right into the fountain area.</p>

  <p> d) Dusty fingerbone - Inside Phin's room in Kedge Keep. Invisible (the mobs 
    are nasty) and with Enduring Breath or a Fishbone Earing (you will drown otherwise) 
    swim off of the ledge in Phin's room and down through the black star on the 
    floor. Swim down and to the left and you should see a rock in a small alcove 
    or a branch jutting out of the wall. (Exact Location is neg 147, pos 145, 
    neg 251). The rock is to the right of branch and the fingerbone is on top 
    of the rock</p>

    (where you might also want to buy the pick and two dwarven ales from the bank 
    for Diggs Duggin).</p>

  <p> g) The Dusty Jawbone is found in an underwater Ice Cave in Everfrost. Head 
    to 1400, -4600 to the entrance of the Ice with an Enduring Breath on (You 
    could try and swim in... but it might be close if you aren't a great swimmer).

  <blockquote>
    <p>Jump into the water and swim South following the wall on your right. Follow 
      it West and then North up the other fork in the ice river until you find 
      the Cave in the North Wall (Loc 3000, -3900) and swim through and up to 
      dry land again. (I have heard rumour of a Necro down here so you might want 
      to invis undead to stop pets from jumping you.. but I didn't see him/her). 
      Take a right in the large room and keep taking rights heading towards the 
      location of the Jawbone (Loc 4500, -5200).</p>

    h) Dusty Leg - You receive from talking to Diggs Duggin in Gorge of King Xorbb

    is in order of time efficiency)</p>
