        <p>As twilight descended, the Dwarven Engineers continued with their efforts 
          to prepare suitable fortifications. When watch fires were lit, their 
          pace seemed to increase with each passing moment. Knowing an enemy attack 
          could come at any instant and with hardly a moment’s notice, the Dwarves 
          frantically worked to complete their assigned tasks.</p>
        <p> It wasn't long before they finished, at least as much as could be 
          done with the tools and materials available. Quite a few of the engineers 
          complained out loud as to the quality of their work. As is typical, 
          the Humans and Elves marveled at the thoroughness and strength of the 
          defenses, while the Dwarves grumbled about those same defenses being... 
          shoddy.</p>
        <p> The Elves, meanwhile, with their near-instinctual grasp of aerodynamics, 
          had assisted the Dwarves with constructing many bolts for the new ballistas.</p>
        <p> The Humans distributed the food supplies, ran water for those who 
          needed it, and carved the spikes for the ramparts. </p>
        <p>Looking down on all the bustle, Girad slowly shook his head. </p>
        <p>“It’s sad. All this time, we could have spent in peaceful trade and 
          cooperation. Instead of bickering about imaginary lines on a map or 
          who was hunting in whose forest. Only now, when we face annihilation, 
          or worse, do we work in peace and harmony. And look how well we complement 
          each other when we try. Each giving their all with what they do best. 
          And in battle, Ladies and Gentlemen, we are unmatched. Never have I 
          beheld a finer or more skilled force. Though tonight or tomorrow maybe 
          our last, there is nowhere else I'd rather be. Let us each to our posts 
          retire. And each to their own, prepare for the morrow. I must descend 
          to check out lookouts and perhaps lend them, for a brief while, a lightened 
          heart.”</p>
        <p> As the advisors and Commanders made their way, Girad sought out Lothor. 
          Always at the rear of any meeting, Lothor had once been accused of fearing 
          such gatherings. Eliciting no response, many continued to chuckle at 
          him... Until the King himself answered after one such meeting: “He who 
          is farthest to the rear of the tent is closest to the battle.” The chuckles 
          ceased after that.</p>
        <p> “We are in for a long night, Lothor. Get some rest. I will stand this 
          watch.”</p>
        <p> “I thank you, sire. I believe I shall. I must meditate for tomorrow’s 
          battle. Call on me, when you tire, for you need rest even more than 
          I.”</p>
        <p> “That I shall. Peace to your heart, old friend.”</p>
        <p> “Tiosler’s Hand calm your heart and sharpen your senses.” </p>
        <p>The King made his way through the resting Forces of Light, bidding 
          many an individual “Good Morrow” and a handshake. With regal grace, 
          he walked up to the bulwarks themselves and offered a quiet word to 
          the sentries. When he found Sathlas, the Elven Commander, he paused 
          in his meanderings. </p>
        <p>“What is the word, Commander?”</p>
        <p> “It’s quiet, King Girad. Normally, I'd say it’s too quiet, but with 
          the battle today and the stench of death and blood fresh in the air, 
          only the staunchest of nocturnal predators will venture anywhere near 
          this area. The scent of the dragons aught to keep most of them at bay. 
          Besides, there is little that Elven sight and Elven hearing cannot detect 
          at quite a distance.”</p>
        <p> “I doubt not the keen eyes and ears of my Elven brethren. I have to 
          wonder if we aren't the only ones counting on such senses.”</p>
        <p> “Sire, what do you mean?”</p>
        <p> “Something just feels... wrong.” </p>
        <p>The two stood in silence as if stretching out with every fiber of their 
          beings, to pierce the darkness of night. </p>
        <p>“Commander, ready yourself. Here they come.” </p>
        <p>The King and the Elven Commander both drew their swords, just as the 
          first of several goblins jump over the top of the ramparts. Sathlas 
          skewered him through it’s left ribs. He wouldn't have time to retrieve 
          it before the next one was upon him. He released his sword and fumbled 
          for his dagger. Girad’s sword nearly decapitated the second goblins, 
          even as it thought the Elf’s death was his to claim. As they recovered 
          their weapons, the Human and Elf had not time for thanks or praise as 
          several more goblins attacked. Time and coherent thought dissolved into 
          thrust, recover, parry, jab, slice, dodge, thrust. Just as suddenly 
          as it began, the goblins were finished. The goblins death-rattle eerily 
          harmonized with the cries of the other sentries spreading the warning. 
          A whisper of spidery language and the darkness vanished as light erupted 
          in the sky. Though Elven vision couldn't detect them, having the sky 
          become as bright as day illuminated countless small creatures creeping 
          across the battlefield. Startled by the flash of light, the advancing 
          goblins shrieked and rushed forward. </p>
        <p>"Chain-cast light, cousins!" shouted the mage who had appeared near 
          the King and Elven Commander. </p>
        <p>"Light the warning fires! We need more light!!" shouted the Elven Commander. 
        </p>
        <p>A painful admission for an Elf, but necessity and the greater good 
          smoothed the sting. </p>
        <p>Elves and Dwarves ran forward, some to light the warning fires and 
          others to loose arrow and bolt from longbow and crossbow. They were 
          followed closely by the Dwarven Infantry, who readied mace, ax, and 
          shield. </p>
        <p>The next goblin who made the parapet near the King and Commander was 
          greeted, not with sword or arrow, but spell and a handful of dust. Even 
          has it open it's mouth to utter forth, so where it's eyes shut in unnatural 
          sleep. </p>
        <p>"To the rear with this one, my friend," said Sathlantos the mage. "It 
          will provide us with the opportunity to discover what keeps them hidden 
          from my eyes." </p>
        <p>The servants loaded the unconscious goblin onto a stretch and bore 
          it away, under the armed scrutiny of Human guards. </p>
        <p>"Time yet for one more experiment, Sire. Stand well back from the edge." 
        </p>
        <p>With all three of them removed from the immediate vicinity of the battlements, 
          the mage readied himself. As the next goblin swung it's leg over the 
          edge and began to pull itself up and over, the Mage loosed another; 
          followed instantly by the next. The first spell send a bolt of blue-white 
          energy at the goblin's torso, even as the second raised a shield around 
          the 3 "experimenters". At the first, slightest contact with the goblin, 
          a blinding flash and explosion sent the 3 experimenters ducking for 
          cover; despite the presence of the shield spell. The stench of charred 
          goblin wafted through the air. Rising to their feet, King, Commander, 
          and Mage beheld the bits of flesh, bone, and blood which stuck to and/or 
          slowly oozed down the front of the shield. Beyond the gore, the scorched 
          planks of the battlements and a sizeable hole torn out of the wall, 
          exactly where the goblin had been perched. </p>
        <p>"That was a nasty trick, if that was intended," state the Mage. "One 
          way to find out. Tarn! Cast me a ballistic Flash!" </p>
        <p>The Human mage cast is globe of light into the air. Sathlantos counted 
          and then cast one more Dispel Magic bolt into the pressing mass of goblins. 
          The nearby defenders dropped to the floor of the battlements at the 
          sight of the bolt being loosed and a signal call warned many more. With 
          Wizards and their magic, one never knows what will happen; even they 
          themselves don't always know. </p>
        <p>The bolt of Dispel Magic hardly caressed the left shoulder of one of 
          the goblins, but that was sufficient. The resulting explosion became 
          a cascade of explosions, as surrounding goblins also reacted to the 
          null magic effects. </p>
        <p>Moments later, the arching ball of energy detonated in the brilliant 
          flash of light which gives it's name. Unlike the more conventional Flash, 
          the ballistic version of the spell also extends the duration of illumination. 
          Amid the strobe light affects of it's contemporaries, the sustained 
          light yielded a blast area that took several moments for the rushing 
          goblins to reach and cover. The grass was scorched black, yet didn't 
          burn. Of the goblins who had been there, nothing could be seen. Expanding 
          out from that point, concentrically, first only charred pieces could 
          be seen, though undistinguishable as to what they used to be or where 
          they used to go. Recognizable appendages and torsos were next, followed 
          by semi-whole bodies. Then came those goblins who were laying prone 
          and those feebly moving. Many of these were badly scorched as well. 
          Lastly came those who were not blackened, but were unmoving or slowly 
          rising to their feet. Unfortunately, for all by the hardiest of the 
          survivors, the battle rush of their comrades crushed them into gooy 
          pulp. </p>
        <p>As more mages came forward to hurdle bolts of Dispel Magic into the 
          masses, the resounding concussive explosions both lit the field and 
          deafened the ear. A signal was sent up and down the battlements and 
          soon the last explosion faded into the distance, like rolling thunder. 
          Goblins were no longer trying to reach the top of the battlements. As 
          archers fired ranging arrows, which burned brightly enough to see during 
          the day, it appeared the goblins were in retreat. And yet, at the end 
          of their flights, the ranging arrows revealed the fore-ranks of the 
          orcs, who had gathered to follow the goblin assault. </p>
        <p>"Sathlantos, how much longer can you and yours keep up such a magical 
          barrage?" asked King Girad. </p>
        <p>"Not long, Sire. Many are already weary for the effort. And we are 
          only part way through the night." </p>
        <p>"We could be in for a long night, indeed. Have the wizards rest. We 
          will light additional watchfires and use conventional methods on any 
          further attacks." </p>
        <p>"Sire, I recommend leaving those who are strong yet here, as they can 
          quickly turn the tide with but a few casts. We, in fact, work better 
          individually than as a fixed unit." </p>
        <p>"Mmm, good point. Even this old warhorse can learn a few things. Carry 
          on, Sathlantos. That will be fine." </p>
        <p>"Yes, Sire. And, thank you." </p>
        <p>As the grinning mage hurried off to assess his peers' condition, the 
          King turned to the Elven Commander with a puzzled look. Sathlas smiled 
          and leaned closer to the King. </p>
        <p>"Elves are so rigid in our ways and traditions that we rarely accept 
          changes, even good ones. The higher in the hierarchy, the more rigid 
          we tend to be. Sathlantos took a chance that, while being royalty as 
          well as our combined Leader, being Human you might at least hear him 
          out. By accepted his suggestion, you have made a strong and positive 
          impression on the mage. And, as you know, as long-lived as we are, our 
          memories are said to be even longer." </p>
        <p>"I see." said King Girad, nodding thoughtfully. "See to the men, Commander. 
          I'll pass the word back, so that we can schedule a relief rotation." 
        </p>
        <p>"I will, Sire."</p>
        <p> "That includes you, too, Commander. I want to see you in my tent no 
          later than an hour from now." </p>
        <p>"It will be so, Sire." </p>
        <p>King Girad had made it nearly two-thirds of the way back to his tent, 
          when he walked into a seeming wall of steel. Looking up, he realized 
          he was face to face with his old friend. Old friend or not, Lothor's 
          visage was foreboding. </p>
        <p>"I thought I told you to summon me at the first sign of trouble."</p>
        <p> "And I thought I told YOU to get some rest."</p>
        <p> "You can't lead this defense of Life and Freedom for our peoples if 
          you are dead."</p>
        <p> "Nor can you lead your command effectively if you fall on your face 
          out of exhaustion." </p>
        <p>Though Lothor stood head and shoulders above the King, Girad was a 
          no less formidable figure.</p>
        <p> "Fear not, Lothor. Though the goblins are running, the Orcs are lined 
          up. You'll have a chance to fight this night. But now we BOTH need rest. 
          Come."</p>
        <p> In fact, there were three more assaults that night. The first 2 were 
          comprised solely of orcs. The first time, the orcs came on as they had 
          during the previous day. The second, they attempted use of the "concealing" 
          oil. They also came under the cover of silencing spells, so the warning 
          came later then before. A few mages standing watch gave the Forces of 
          Light precious seconds to react, hurdling bolts of Dispel Magic into 
          the Orcish ranks. Even so, several groups of Orcs reached the top of 
          the battlements. Lothor led his Knights in sweeping the foul creatures 
          from the breaches. Scores of hundreds of Orcs were killed, before they 
          finally retreated. The third however, containing goblins, orcs, and 
          ogres came just as the first rays of dawn peeked over the horizon. As 
          they marched forward the way they had the day before, the hordes of 
          evil were quickly passed by two of the big Red Dragons. Moving at breath-taking 
          speeds, the great Wyrms closed the distance between them and their targets; 
          decimating hundreds of feet with each stroke of their mighty wings. 
        </p>
        <p>"ARCHERS!" was the cry that passed back and forth the ranks of the 
          Forces of Light. The creaking of hundreds of bows drawn taunt was virtually 
          drowned out by the sudden intake of air, as the Red Dragons neared the 
          positions of the Forces of Light. </p>
