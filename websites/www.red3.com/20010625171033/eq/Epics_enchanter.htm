	Jeb Lemused is in the form of a Sarnak Imitator in the Burning woods. He
	is not always around, and killing the nearby Sarnaks may help him appear.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to seek the
	truth of what is around you. When that is done, you will know what you seek.
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You need to have completed the quest which Stofo Olan has, for a copy of
	his research notes. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You give the &#147;Copy of Notes&#148; to Jeb Lumsed. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'I see that you have what I was waiting for. Stofo does
	do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey. Take
	this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of
	enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected
	the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle for me. If
	you need a sack, just let me know.' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You receive a coin called 'jeb's seal' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'I need a sack' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it.
	Then return it to me. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You receive an enchanter's bag. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'What serpent?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan Pedin, crafted
	the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry on the trade in a
	five-step process. Each student then became a master and chose one of their
	own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and I, myself, are current
	practitioners of the crafting. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Who are the four other masters?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'The masters are enchanters who have reached the plateau
	of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple, Nadia Starfeast,
	and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Who is modani?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him
	out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in his true form.
	The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to
	the elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues about his location
	there. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Modani will give you the Test of Illusions. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Who is mizzle?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened
	magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel,
	so you should not have to look far from his home to find him. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Mizzle will give you the Test of Enlightenment 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Who is Nadia?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful. She,
	too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I just recently received
	a letter from her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving
	every day, and that the outpost is well defended now. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Nadia will give you the Test of Charm 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	You: 'Who is Polzin?' 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	A sarnak imitator: 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will
	seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after the incident near
	Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he is well. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Polzin will give you the Test of Phantasm. 
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	Combine the 4 items in the sack provided to recieve the Staff of the Serpent.
