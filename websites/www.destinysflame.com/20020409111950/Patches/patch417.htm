      <P>&nbsp;<font color="003366"> ** Food Changes <a name=" Food Changes "></a>**<br>
        - Food items now have a 'duration'. This means that some food items will 
        not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain 
        your character longer than they did before. <br>
        <br>
        ** Bug Fixes<a name="Bug Fixes"></a> **<br>
        - We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat. This fellow 
        has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to. 
        We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to 
        work with this patch.<br>
        - Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character 
        was healed or damaged by spells. This could be seen, for example, when 
        a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly 
        go back down a bit right afterwards. There was no error in the assignment 
        of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed. 
        <br>
        - Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different 
        bracer graphic than you would. Now everyone (including the wearer) will 
        always see the same bracer texture. If you have two bracers that have 
        a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make 
        sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist 
        inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show 
        for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will 
        show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to 
        showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br>
        - Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be 
        facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead 
        to accidentally zoning back the way they had come. You should be facing 
        the right way when you make that zone transition now. <br>
        <br>
        ** Zone and Quest Changes<a name="Zone and Quest Changes"></a> **<br>
        - The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This 
        should make at least one quest more available. <br>
        - Grobb should now have a couple of ovens. Hopefully this will allow Troll 
        bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight. <br>
        - Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items. Previously, 
        if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant 
        would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once 
        to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy. Now he will have 
        4 in either case.<br>
        - We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains. 
        Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn 
        for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items 
        for those epic quests. Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce 
        the competition and resentment over this spawn. - We have reduced resistances 
        to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen 
        Shadow. This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs 
        in Velious.<br>
        <br>
        ** Improved and New Features<a name="Improved and New Features"></a> **<br>
        - When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all 
        of your corpses. <br>
        - You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, 
        etc...) from merchants. It works the same way as sell in that you can 
        hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item. 
        <br>
        - Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with 
        /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is). You can now use 
        /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window 
        separately. - Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them. 
        This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them 
        onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile. So if there is already 
        a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item 
        would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room 
        for it. - The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last 
        target when the chat bar is up. When the chat bar is open the tab key 
        will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply 
        names. When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between 
        yourself and your last target. <br>
        - /assist has an added parameter. /assist on and /assist off will determine 
        whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist. So if 
        you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage 
        your character's auto-attack. This change will be persistent, so it will 
        remain as you left it when you log out. /assist also now has a range of 
        200 feet.<br>
        - The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you 
        are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins. 
        This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong 
        item. PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain 
        that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br>
        - Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than 
        just 'hail'.<br>
        - Added /charinfo command. Currently this command only reports the zone 
        where the current character is bound. We may add further information as 
        things progress. <br>
        - You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is 
        hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported). 
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Item Changes<a name=" Item Changes"></a> ** <br>
        - We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of 
        the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally 
        disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two 
        one-handed weapons. What will happen now is rather simple. The very next 
        time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), 
        the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it. THE NEW 
        SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your 
        inventory. So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in 
        your inventory. And don't panic, the items didn't disappear. :) But also 
        MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS 
        (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be 
        able to fit into your main inventory). If you end up with a No-Drop container 
        on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have 
        a problem... Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged. Right 
        now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once 
        after it is created. We're working on fixing that bug. We decided to make 
        this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems 
        with the old scabbard. This new scabbard will have a special ability. 
        It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them. Simply 
        place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and 
        hit the combine button. The scabbard will convert the temporary power 
        of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword. Customer Service 
        WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones. That will be 
        done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined 
        the swords for the first time. <br>
        - Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, 
        it's a big two-handed axe...). If you have one in a bag now, be aware 
        that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out. 
        <br>
        - No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character 
        inventory upon disconnection with the server. If you are disconnected 
        from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as 
        summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you 
        log back to that character within 30 minutes. After thirty minutes those 
        No Rent items will be deleted. There may be some extreme cases beyond 
        our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be 
        on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe. 
        No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner. 
        <br>
        - Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch 
        of Quellios" as intended. If you have one of these items and it still 
        does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch 
        yours for a new one. <br>
        - Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br>
        - The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly. <br>
        - The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced. <br>
        - The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3. <br>
        - Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed. If you're wearing 
        these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce 
        it anyway. New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped 
        armors and on the questable armors. Because the Velious textures can be 
        a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be 
        loaded by default by the game. If you want to see the new textures you 
        will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE 
        (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE. <br>
        <br>
        ** Trade Skill Changes<a name="Trade Skill Changes"></a> ** <br>
        <br>
        - Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry 
        made for their god. For those that not only sing around the campfire, 
        but sing about the campfire!<br>
        - 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed. 
        Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container 
        that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear. But if 
        the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still 
        in it. Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br>
        - The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel 
        Chestplate has been increased a little.<br>
        <br>
        ** Spell Changes<a name="Spell Changes"></a> **<br>
        - Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only 
        require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making 
        cultural armor. Enchant Velium, Enchant Mithri,l Enchant Adamantite, Enchant 
        Steel, Enchant Brellium<br>
        - Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis 
        Lazuli to Malachite. They now use the same reagent as every other Magician 
        pet spell: Minor Summoning: Earth, Minor Summoning: Water, Minor Summoning: 
        Fire, Summoning: Air Elemental, Earth Elemental, Water Elemental, Fire 
        Elemental<br>
        - Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets 
        will now appear upon a successful use of the spell): Panic Animal (soandso 
        flees in a state of total panic!) Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away 
        in terror!) Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!) Acumen (soandso's 
        eyes tingle)<br>
        - Cannibalize IV now exists. This spell is now available in Velious.<br>
        - Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved. They now return 
        more mana to the caster than they did before. <br>
        ** Class Specific Changes <a name="Class Specific Changes "></a>**<br>
        - Monk weight allowance has been increased. Every 15 levels monks will 
        get an extra 1 stone weight allowance. The post 50 weight allowance has 
        also been increased by 2 stone. Level 15, Limit 15 Level 30, Limit 16 
        Level 45, Limit 17 Level 51, Limit 18 Level 55, Limit 20 Level 60, Limit 
        24 <br>
        - Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than 
        before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.
