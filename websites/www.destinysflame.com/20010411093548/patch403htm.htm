        -** New and Changed Features **<br>
        - Guild Message of the Day.<br>
        Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd to set up a 
        Guild Message of the Day (GMotD). From then on any time a member of that 
        guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender 
        added at the front, so you will know who sent the message. Any guild member 
        will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the 
        message will be displayed again. The GMotD will be erased if the server 
        comes down, however. You will have to reset the GMotD when the server 
        comes back up.<br>
        - /assist changed and improved. It should be much more reliable now. It 
        also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted. The assisted 
        person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<br>
        - Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that 
        were too far above or below you. <br>
        <br>
        ** Skill Change **<br>
        - Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, 
        your next successful forage will always be drink or food. We have also 
        decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the 
        chance that you will forage water. <br>
        <br>
        ** Spell Changes **<br>
        - Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<br>
        - Translocate now has the proper spell gem. <br>
        <br>
        ** Bug Fix **<br>
        - Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users. This fix will most 
        likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having 
        problems.<br>
        <br>
        ** Item Changes **<br>
        - Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you 
        to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures. We have decided 
        to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish 
        to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show 
        no graphics. <br>
        - Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been 
        added.<br>
        - Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed. It no longer has the 
        same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion. <br>
        - Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors. Tinting was 
        never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better 
        without it. <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous Items **<br>
        - Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing 
        the availability of one of the quest items. <br>
        - Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds. <br>
        - Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit. <br>
        <br>
        ** 'Combine' container changes ** <br>
        We've made a change to 'combine' containers. In order to prevent people 
        from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button 
        will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe. This will 
        be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. But this removes the 
        only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their reduced weight 
        and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, 
        with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made 
        a mistake. We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers 
        somewhat. Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will 
        now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit. Along with this 
        we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you didn't know, 
        most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%. We are 
        raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight reduction of 
        all containers with the information shown on a right click. </font></DIV>
