<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Day 4</font> </strong><small>Posted Sunday, March 23, 2003 by <a href="mailto:Aminna1@hotmail.com">Aminna</a></small><br>The Flame and Council picked up where they left off on Saturday and cleared the Drake Isle. Two members of the "Most underappreciated class in EQ" (copyrighted by Nymlar) had their day and got their epic drops. The jury is still out on whether the Mage epic is indeed the hardest of all epics to complete...but those who've survived all 4 days of this run will agree that is ranks up there in the top 3.<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/NymlarCrown03_22_03.jpg><br>Gratz to Nymlar on his crown!<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/YabuCrown03_22_03.jpg><br>Gratz to Yabu on his crown!</p>

It is safe to say Bzzt Island files have been moved into our respective " moste hated break-ins in game" folders.<br><br>It was a long fight and as the pile of DT'd tanks mounted a wee Paladan stepped forward to tank the final moments with the boss bee.<br>Ramone may have gotten the kill shot but Arakas was the last tank standing toe to toe with Bzzt Zzzt. Gratz Arakas!<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/ArakasBazztZzzt031803.jpg></p>
