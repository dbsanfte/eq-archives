Now, historically the Flame has never fared well trying to break into Fear and the only way to confirm the Shissar's whereabouts is to break into the bad boy...so the call went out to Flamers far and wide.<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/ShissarCrew1202.jpg><br><br>Three groups of brave souls showed up and not only did we blow our break-in-time record out of the water we took out the Wraith of Shissar.<br><br>Congrats to Comus on getting the final drop for the much envied snake stick!<br><br>Special thanks to Nealaya and Beamian for lending a hand.</p>
