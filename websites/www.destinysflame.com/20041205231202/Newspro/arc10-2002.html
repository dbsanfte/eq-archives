You miserable creature!" <br><br>"Oh, indeed," answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, "there may you read what kind of a man I am." <br><br>The giant read, "Seven at one stroke," <br><br>~The Little Tailor by the Brothers Grimm<br><br>What does this have to do with the Flame you ask? Well read on!<br><br>After learning that our intended target of CoM was camped for an hour or two we decided to take on some overdue epic mobs for various members of the Flame.

Gratz Babtin!<br><br>Word came down that our mobs in CoM were open so off we headed to the Emerald Jungle. We cleared the lower level reavers and headed up the invisible bridge where we cleared reaver number 2 who spawned 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... and so on until at last we had killed 33 Reavers!<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/black%20reaver.jpg><br>We will be issuing belts that read "33 in one stroke" next week.<br><br>Gratz to Blacktorn, Gant and Giluvian on their Jade Reavers, Babtin on his new shield, Karrok on his MOSS and Athriimyr on his nice 2HS!<br><br>Our final target of the night was Lord Rak Ashiir we sent Babtin's little pet in to do our dirty work while we sat back to enjoy a cold one after our 33 reavers.<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/Bendaorf%20Dead%20Rak.jpg><br>Gratz Bendaorf on the last drop of his epic!<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/CoM%20Fighters.jpg><br>The Class of '33<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/Bendaorf%20Epic.jpg><br>Bendaorf and his Epic! w00t!<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/GiluvianSwiftwind110302.jpg><br>Giluvian and Swiftwind! w00t!<br> <br></p>
