        Registration for the San Diego Fan Faire closes on Wednesday, March 28th, 
        and we are running out of spaces. Once all the spaces are taken, we will 
        not be accepting any further registrations (or walk-ins). So if you plan 
        to attend sign up before someone else gets your spot. Head over to www.everquest.com 
        to register. <br>
        <br>
        *** Patch Day ***<br>
        *Spell Changes and Additions*<br>
        - A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids 
        and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These 
        spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.<br>
        - Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing 
        of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.<br>
        - Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain 
        types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available 
        in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful. <br>
        <br>
        *Item Changes*<br>
        - Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a 
        fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and 
        water effects from these items. They have been replaced with modified 
        versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves). 
        <br>
        - The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the 
        waist.<br>
        - The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate. <br>
        - Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield 
        to right click and worn to activate. <br>
        <br>
        *Bug Fixes*<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at 
        the wrong location.<br>
        - Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 
        6 to 16. <br>
        - Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging. 
        <br>
        - Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals. <br>
        - Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters 
        even when he is away from his home. <br>
        <br>
        *Enhancements*<br>
        - Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd 
        in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now 
        has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to 
        the accidental deletion of a guild. <br>
        - Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player 
        can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This will 
        only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle 
        effects. This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper 
        rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able 
        to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons...<br>
        - Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will 
        allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 
        'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), 
        NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the 
        client. This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, 
        and can help those with slower connections with better performance and 
        connectivity. <br>
        - Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will 
        also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any 
        of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will 
        be added in the next patch or two. <br>
        - Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window. This 
        means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the 
        Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches 
        the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.<br>
        - The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when 
        you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.<br>
        - View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will 
        now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the 
        same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing 
        on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it. <br>
        - Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's 
        group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is 
        using the proper ingredients. Failure of the craftsman to use the proper 
        ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.<br>
        - In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed 
        from a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over 
        to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade.<br>
        - We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells 
        no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will allow 
        those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates 
        even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        *Quest*<br>
        Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk 
        to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you. </font></P>
