Thanks to Guardianmind for leading a flawless breakin. Thanks to Synail the Mage for coming out and cothing our bums all over the joint and gratz on the Mage epic drop. Gratz go out to our clerics (Afish, Krondar, Anngelika, Tuldain & Myrryn) who almost all walked out with shiny new arms (who needs a BP when you can have arms??). Gratz to our rogues (Toxie and Tapit) who walked out with new clothes and our shammie Jorree (it's good to be the only shammie heh heh).<br><br><IMG SRC=http://www.destinysflame.com/Pictures/AvatarOfAbhorrancePoH04_28_02.jpg></p>
