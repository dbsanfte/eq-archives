<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">New Recruiting</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, May 21, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>The Council of the Flame has placed a temporary freeze on current recruiting procedures until they can be fully evaluated.  During this time new members must be approved by three officers of the guild and can only receive their membership during a guild event.  If you know someone interested in the guild, please make sure that they are given the opportunity to interact via grouping, raids, or events with several officers so that they can be given consideration for admittance into the guild.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">New Members</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, May 21, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>Last week there was a major influx of new members (about 90% of them were alts). I apologize for not posting you guys yet but it will be soon. I am working with Nelenu on getting a database up for our guild and which will make that step much easier.  If you haven't already done so post some info about yourself in the Member Updates section of the forums.  If you don't know the password just ask a member in the game.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">EQ Warning</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, May 16, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>Everquest has posted a general warning in regards to the patch scheduled for 5/30.  Please be warned that there is the potential for your corpse to disappear when the patch is run.  GM's can assist you in recovering your corpse but the best bet is not to leave your corpses all over Norrath...</p>
