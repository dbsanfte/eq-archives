<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Kudos to Qwaszz!</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, November 5, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@sbcglobal.net">Beradin</a></small><br>A post was placed in our forums about one of our paladins and I thought it deserved a spot here on our website....<br><br>I told Ydnar Frostbane about this and he said to post it to the website so here it is...<br><br>I wanna thank Qwaszz for helping a lowly newbie out in EK the other day. (lvl15 Bard hehe fully twinked tho, but that is another song) <br><br>I was after a bard ring that had dropped and got bushwhacked by a Graveyard Wraith! I had just done a /who zone and proceeded to send tells to peeps for a revive or rezz. I was not after the exp back but was bound in Freeport still and would have surely died trying to get back to my corpse. Qwaszz was the only one who would help. I did not even have a good loc of where I died just an idea of where. He hunted around till he found it then revived me. He offered to find a cleric for an exp rezz even!! He then healed me and fought off an aggro to keep me alive! I want to say thanks to Qwaszz and Destiny's Flame for having a true Paladin in your guild. <br><br><br>Cresce Ndo<br>Bard of the 16th movement<br>Torvonnilous<br><br></p>

Many attended this late, late nite event (Deltox, Tarelil, Aminna, Comus, Gandan, Beradin, Gloruk, Phedra, Dylanne, Beamian, Tegan) and although we had our deaths (Aminna, Comus, Gandan, Tarelil x2) Nemene and Kitt were there to pass out the friendly rezzes.
