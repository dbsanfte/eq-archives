<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Kaesora Raid a Success!</font> </strong><small>Posted Sunday, September 30, 2001 by <a href="mailto:">Aeawen</a></small><br>The raid went off without so much as a hiccup.  I could have wished for more phat loot during our temporary jaunt to the library, but oh well.  The following people got their xalzog fangs: Rumardian, Bamkin, Krondar, Sedaen, Blacktorn, Idya, and Comus.  Of these people three had their prods and we went to get their keys after the raid.  Congrats Idya, Comus, and Kiyallmane. ( I owe Sophos and Kevaren a fang, almost got everyone)<br><br>Other loot that was to be had during the raid were the following:<br>two tombcarvers (5 17 +3 dex and agi)to Blacktorn and SophosOne Xalzog blade (2hs 23 40 +3str and agi) Rumardian<br>two dusty knapsacks (25percent weight reducing)Sedaen and Rumardian<br><br>I guilded Sophos before the raid.  Also if I am not mistaken that those of us who were low enough in level came away with a great deal of exp in this exp modified dungeon.  DF ruled this zone on Friday and everyone seemed to have a great time.  It was a pleasure to lead this raid.  Thanks for the help from others to keep this ranger on his toes ;)  Now lets get those prods taken care of so we can get some weekly raids to hs planned.<br><br>In Service,<br>Aeawen</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Dragon Necropolis</font> </strong><small>Posted Sunday, September 2, 2001 by <a href="mailto:Kalski@mediaone.net">Ydnar</a></small><br>Thanks Comus.  I just want to tell everyone who came that I cannot be more impressed by how well the impromptu raid went!  With only two groups we were owning the rats that we came across.  The teamwork displayed was awe inspiring.  All this was done with only 3 melee as well and only two peeps from outside the guild.  Thanks to Jenen and Queamyan for coming along.  We did get quite a few more quest gems.  We also handled the raid wipeout with ease and all corpses were recovered and rezzed within an hour.  Good job Briela and Lanan for the cr. </p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Congrats Ydnar!</font> </strong><small>Posted Sunday, September 2, 2001 by <a href="mailto:">Comus</a></small><br>Congrats to Ydnar on getting his third flawless diamond last night in Dragon Necropolis, and having all the pieces necessary to get the Thurgadin Breastplate.  It's just too bad that by the end of the night, all the dwarves were missing from dwarftown, thanks to a failed 10th ring quest.  Hope to see you sporting the new armor soon.  No one deserves it more.</p>
