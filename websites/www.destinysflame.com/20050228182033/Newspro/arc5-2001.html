<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">New Recruiting Policy</font> </strong><small>Posted Saturday, June 30, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>The Council of the Flame has met and discussed issues pertaining to our current recruiting policy.  The following policy has now been set forth by the Council:<br><br>The new minimum level for the guild will be set at 17.  This is to ensure at least a minimum understanding of your character and some dedication to its development.  <br>All new members will go through a minimum of 30 days probationary period.  Their rank in the guild will be Questor of Destiny.  They will have access to all the normal guild forums and events.<br>Ranking in the guild will now be level based as far as titles go.<br>Members who are 50+ will have the master rank of their group.  Members in the 35-49 range will have the name rank of their group. Members under 35 will have the lower rank of their group.<br>These ranks are:<br>For the Knights of Destiny-<br>     Knight Commander (50+)<br>     Knight of Destiny(35-49)<br>     Squire of Destiny(under 35)<br>For the Scouts of Destiny-<br>     Master Scout (50+)<br>     Scout of Destiny (35-49)<br>     Nomad of Destiny (under 35)<br>For the Priests of Destiny-<br>     High Priest (50+)<br>     Priest of Destiny (35-49)<br>     Accolyte of Destiny (under 35)<br>For the Mystics of Destiny-<br>     Arch Mage (50+)<br>     Mystic of Destiny (35-49)<br>     Apprentice of Destiny (under 35)<br><br>Full members are allowed to bring alts into the guild.  The minimum level for an alt is 20.  The number of alts you may have in the guild is based on your rank.  Members under 35 may have one alt.  Members 35-49 may have two alts, and members 50+ may have unlimited alts.<br>Alts will still retain the rank of either Soldier or Scholar of Destiny depending on their affiliations.<br>In order for someone to become a member of the guild it requires the approval of either one officer or three full members in good standing.<br>The Council still maintains the right to announce a freeze to recruitment.<br>Candidates who wish to join the guild will need to attend an event in order to join the guild unless an officer is available.</p>

Congrats to Aeawen and Auronan for getting some great loot!  For those of you who missed it, Ydnar has promised Kiya and I several more raids as it turns out that dragons don't like us still in Velious.  The raid went well the turnout was fantastic and though we had occasional deaths we were able to quickly get revenge for them.   Also, many of us made the journey and got our CS and WL teeth!  The night was enjoyed by all and we hope to have many more like it.  Well Done Ydnar!</p>

If you'd like to donate to the auction to help raise money for guild events such as reagents for raids, coffins, and so forth, please send me a tell in the game or post in the forums.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Photo gallery</font> </strong><small>Posted Saturday, June 2, 2001 by <a href="mailto:comus_@hotmail.com">Comus</a></small><br>I've been wanting to do some work on the photo album, but find that I'm desperately short on member pics.  Rather than trying to remember to take screenshots every time I meet a guildmate, I'm asking people to help by emailing me screenshots of themselves.  Most of you probably already have a few, and if you don't, it's not hard to take them.  Just remember to use the F10 key to get a clean shot.  And if you have any other screenshots you think might be good for our gallery, send those too (especially shots of the guild in action).  Thanks.</p>
