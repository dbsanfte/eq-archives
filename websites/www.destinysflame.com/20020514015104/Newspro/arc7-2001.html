<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Warning about Lower Guk</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, August 21, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>I'm not sure if it's because a few of our guildmates took the crown from the froglok king, or if rumors made it to Innothule of Qwaszz cooking frog legs, but I don't think the denizons of Lower Guk like our guild much.  It seems that in the past few days that zone has claimed the lives of more guildmates then Aminna and myself combined.  Apparently some of us may be hanging out with barbarians too much and their err distinguished smell has rubbed off onto the rest of us.  It seems that the minotaurs down in Lower Guk just happen to not like that smell and quickly let their fellows know we are there.Attempts to go anonymous and hide our guild tags have not been effective in deterring the threat so I'm guessing that Staligar told them where our website is.  So if you plan on adventuring down into the depths of the frogs, be warned they seem to be expecting us.  </p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Griffon Convention Disrupted in East Wastes</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, August 21, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>I was minding my own business in East Wastes doing the chores that the Coldain are expecting me to do before they'll let me have another prayer shawl, and as I was trying to get an egg off an uncooperative griffon, I realized I had unfortunately kited him into the middle of at least three others.  Needless to say the elder griffon was a bit perturbed at me having interrupted their private meeting and I was quickly dispatched.  Fortunately Ydnar brought his merry band of fellows and was able to resurrect my poor corpse before it became part of the noon buffet.  Needless to say, I'll be checking the griffon posts in the near future to make sure I don't disrupt any more griffon planned meetings.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Updates to the Raiding Policy</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, August 2, 2001 by <a href="mailto:beradin@swbell.net">Beradin</a></small><br>To eliminate potential problems on guild raids we have established a guild policy concerning all guild related raids. The survival of our members during a raid requires us to be organized and prepared for unforeseen encounters and situations. <br><br>I. There will be one individual assigned to be the leader of the raid. His or her authority during the raid is the final say as to what each individual does during the raid.<br><br>A) On guild raids a guildmember will always be the lead for a group, and will be responsible for looting that groups kills (This helps facilitate gathering of pp at the end and the proper distrobution of items). Normally, an officer will be in charge of each individual group during a raid to ensure that all policies are followed.<br><br>II. Raids are planned events which includes the time of the event and not just the location. A starting point will be set and all members who are involved in the raid need to be at that point at the proper time. Transportation to a raid will be provided before the raid. Once the time of the raid has arrived, the event is officially active and all members are expected to be in their places. It is understood that exceptions may occur, but these must be approved by the leader of the raid. <br><br>III. There will be a planned method of distribution of the rewards of the raid. Most raids will have specific goals in mind, and these goals will be the priority in distributing the loot.<br><br>A) Until everyone has won an item, only one item per person. <br><br>B) 25% of the pp looted from the mobs goes to the guild bank account to help finance future events. Please bear in mind that the guild bank is not accessible 24/7 and if funds are needed, it must be put into the planning for a raid. <br><br>D) Whatever criteria is being used to allow people to roll on a given item, all players fitting that criteria will be allowed to roll with no exceptions based on level, guild membership, etc.<br><br>E) Reservations for items are neither frowned upon or encouraged. They are the realm of the organizer. However, if items are to be reserved they MUST be announced on the board and in the gathering locale BEFORE the raid gets underway. <br><br>F) At the end of the raid all gems will be rolled on by those participants who did not win an item. SoV quest gems go to the guild bank to be distributed as needed to individuals completing their quests. Quest gems will be released from the bank to guild members when three of them have been obtained.<br><br>G) Specific raid looting rules such as NBG, no NBG, or flavours thereof, are exlusively the realm of the raid organizer provided they do not conflict with any of the above. These raid looting rules must be posted with the raid info on the board (note: these can be very simple or very complex, its entirely up to the organizer). <br><br>H) If an Epic item is a possible loot item on the raid, those interested should make that known to the organizer beforehand via the message boards. Epic items will go to those on the raid closest to completion of their quest. If there is no clear leader in that context then they will be rolled upon by all those doing the quest. If finally there is no one present doing the Epic, the item can be opened to a normal loot roll or given to someone in the guild in need of the item.<br><br>I) The guild bank will be available should items be needed for Epic specific raids. An example of this might be Peridots needed for Rune V when doing Venril Sathir. <br><br>J) Should a member feel that the policies are not being followed, they may contact an officer who will bring the subject to the Council. Members who abuse the raiding rules for personal benefit will find their membership revoked.<br><br>IV. Any member sponsoring a raid must post the details of the raid on the Guild Forums. If the raid is an open raid, the details must be posted in the open sections applicable(LFG 35+, LFG 34 and under). If it is a closed raid, then please post the details in the Raids Forum. <br><br></p>
