Re: ragefire</span><hr size=1> First of all I appreciate you not naming anyone in this.  The problem arised with me and Jibekn's alt  Jibalk.  I have no problem discussing this problem as I have with Jibekn for over an hour and with several others.<br>
<br>
I have no reason to lie about the facts as I gain nothing in it for myself.  I would not lie or do anything wrong to help a guildmate, friend or even a real life friend.  I wouldn't do it for myself and not about to start.<br>
<br>
I was killing wyverns about 50 eq feet from Ragefire's spawn point.  I was there to give Paisley company since she had been there for 20 hours waiting for him to spawn.  As she told me, she was the only one in the zone when she logged on and was camping it.  Well, Ragefire spawn so close to me while I was looting a corpse I was shocked I wasn't aggroed.  Imediately I told the guild to come fast.  I did /w and only 2 non guildmembers were in zone.  Jibalk and another person that I forget the name right now.  Within minutes we had 2-3 fuill groups at Ragefire spawn since everyone has just been there killing Talendor.  No one had to leave groups because it was less than 30 minutes after Talendor's death.  Since I find spelleffects annoying during raids I had it off for Talendor.  We had our groups ready and discussing the tatic.  Jibalk was the only 1 of 2 non BC people in zone.  He knew he had one chance to get RF and that was pull with us all standing there.  He ran up and stunned him.  But I didn't see the spell effect.  Jibalk started running off.  A few seconds later RF started running after him.  I was standing right next to Zordak with several guildmates when this happened.  He knew we were ready to engage.  He saw us all and decided to pull him away hoping to sneak off with him.  I saw this and was not going to let it happen.  His argument is that he had the force in the zone and was ready to engage.  He did not have the force and I have no reason to lie about it.  During the fight of the human form he said he had the force.  I did /w and /w GUILD and only 4 non BC members.  One of the 4 was not part of his group as he was camping at BW zones pulling mobs.  At the end of the Dragon fight he started yelling in shout.  At this time I did /w  again.  This time there was 7 non BC members in the zone.  We had the force and were ready to engage.  He wanted to kite him to wait for his friends to arrive.<br>
<br>
If you want to takes his side please look at the facts before you do.  He said several things to me.  One being that he lost Ragefire to BC before and wasn't going to let it happen again.  He doesn't honor our camp since it has been his for the last month.  He feels even though there was a server patch and no one was on during it that it is still his camp.  He saw Paisley there knowing she was camping RF.  He said nothing assuming that either Paisley would give up and he take over,  we wouldn't have the force on line or that he would be faster.  <br>
<br>
If you are taking the time to read this post then please do me a favor.  Look at a map of Skyfire Mountains.  Look where Ragefire spawns and where the druid ring is that he says his force was at.  If you we to pull RF to that ring and I assume around the edge of zone to avoid adds   would you kite him all the way up around behind VP to get there quickly?  No, it was his intention to hide this mob from us asap since they were not ready.  And I ask you this.  If he was ready before us then why pull all the way to the druid ring and not just kill him at his spawn point where it is safe from adds.  He did this because we were there in force and in his words &quot; was not going to lose RF to BC again&quot;.  He said he lost Ragefire spawns because he was on a raid or at work.  But they were never his spawns.  If you aren't there then it isn't your camp.  Somewhere he thinks RF is his camp until he gets it whether there is a server patch and he logs on after  another cleric camping it.  We had the force there first and were ready to engage first.  He decided to kite him away, the long way to buy time and hide the mob.  <br>
<br>
If you believe every word he says, if he was ready, then why pull RF at all.  Makes no sense to me, if they were prepared before us why wouldn't they kill him right there.  According to Paisley she was there first.  We were faster to get to RF camp and prepare.  He didn't like this and tried his best to twink his bot with epic.  Sorry if this seems harsh words but it is accurate and if you take the time to look at all the facts I think you will see the big picture.<br>
<br>
Btw,  I am going to talk to a GM with Jibekn.  I can handle my own problems.  I appreciate being given the chance to clear this up on my own.  And if officers have a problem they will take it to me.  I did tell everyone in guild chat and raid channel what was going on.  I was not the only officer in attendance and I was backed up.<br>
<br>
But fine if anyone thinks I acted wrong they have their own opinion.  Jibekn said to me about the play nice policy.  LOL , then why would he pull a mob with our force standing right there away knowing we were quicker to the punch and were ready to fight no kite 5 minutes across a very large zone the LONG way around.<br>
<br>
I will be copying this exact message in the officers forum so they don't miss this topic as I feel I did nothing wrong and have no reason to not discuss any problems.<br>
<br>
Also,  he said Jibalk is camping Ragefire.  If you log on and he isn't on or in SF it is not his camp.  I think he feels that if he logs on and sits in SF it becomes his camp again instantly regardless of anyone else camping it.  I feel for his camp for a month, but if you leave a camp due to server patch or just logging off then you lose it.  But this isn't even about that.  Today Blood Cult was faster to organize a RF spawn and that is the fact plain in simple.<br>
<br>
I am going to place a poll in the officers forum.  There are 10 officers and 1 guildleader.  I will not vote and want to see a clear opinion among the other officers.  I feel I did the correct thing but if the other officers don't agree then something will have to be done.  Bottom line is the GM will make the final decision but I prefer to have the backing in my guild before I continue to contest this issue.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time to read this.  I have no hard feelings to anyone in this and the last thing I want is a bad name amongst others in guild or out of guild.  I think I have been fair in my almost 2 years of Everquest and hope this shows I have no intention of being unfair.  My most valuable item in Everquest to me is my pride, honor and how others portray me.  It was an honor to become an officer as I see that my friends look to me as a person who will help the guild move forward.  It means alot to me to be friends with everyone.  But people have different views and RF is one of the biggest /petition starters that I know of.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I am running on but my reputation means alot to me and for anyone questions my actions as less than honorable, then I become very concerned.<br>
