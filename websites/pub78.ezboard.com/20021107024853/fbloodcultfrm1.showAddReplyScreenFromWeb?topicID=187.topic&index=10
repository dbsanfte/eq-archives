A neighbor suggested that she cut the tail of one horse and that worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in a bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other horse's tail and our blonde friend was stuck again. The neighbor suggested she notch the ear of one horse. That worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed wire fence. Once again our friend couldn't tell them apart. The neighbor suggested she measure the horses for height. When she did, she was very pleased to find that the white horse was 2 inches taller than the black one.<br>

A blonde and a brunette were watching the 10 o'clock <br>
news together. The current news was about a man up on a ledge and threatening to jump. The situation cut to a commercial.<br>
Brunette: &quot;I'll bet you $20 he's going to jump.&quot;<br>
Blonde: &quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
(then back to the newscast.)<br>
He jumps.<br>
Blonde: &quot;Okay, here's my $20.&quot;<br>
Brunette: &quot;No, that was too easy, I can't take your money.&quot;<br>
Blonde: &quot;I insist. I lost!&quot;<br>
Brunette: &quot;I have a confession to make. I saw the same thing on the 6 o'clock news and knew he jumped. So it wasn't really a fair bet.&quot;<br>
Blonde: &quot;I saw the exact same newscast, but I didn't think he would be stupid enough to jump twice!&quot;<br>

A guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. &quot;What's up?&quot; he says. &quot;I'm having a heart attack,&quot; cries the woman. He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he's dialing, his 4-year-old son comes up and says, &quot;Daddy! Daddy! Uncle Ted's hiding in your wardrobe and he's got no clothes on!&quot; The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the wardrobe floor. &quot;You jerk,&quot; yells the husband, &quot;my wife's having a heart attack and you're running around with no clothes on scaring the kids!&quot;<br>

A man is in a hotel lobby. He wants to ask the clerk a question. As he turns to go to the front desk, he accidentally bumps into a woman beside him and as he does, his elbow goes into her breast. They are both quite startled. The man turns to her and says, &quot;Ma'am, if your heart is as soft as your breast, I know you'll forgive me.&quot; She replies, &quot;if your penis is as hard as your elbow, I'm in room 1221.&quot;<br>

A lady goes for her first golf lesson. The pro says, &quot;You've got to hold the club like you hold your husband's organ.&quot; She takes the club and hits the ball. He says, &quot;Beautiful. Perfect shot. Right down the fairway. Now, take the club out of your mouth, put it in your hands, and we'll go for distance.<br>

Three mice are sitting at a bar in a pretty rough neighborhood late at night, trying to impress each other about how tough they are. The first mouse slams a shot of scotch, and pounds the shot glass to the bar, turns to the second mouse and says: &quot;When I see a mousetrap, I get on it, lie on my back, and set it off with my foot. When the bar comes down, I catch it in my teeth, and then bench press it 100 times. The second mouse orders up two shots of tequilla. He grabs one in each paw, slams the shots, and pounds the glasses to the bar. He turns to the other mice and replies: &quot;Yeah, well when I see rat poison, I collect as much as I can and take it home. In the morning, I grind it up into a powder and put it in my coffee so I get a good buzz going for the rest of the day.&quot; The first mouse and the second mouse then turn to the third mouse. The third mouse lets out a long sigh and says to the first two, &quot;I don't have time for this bullshit, I gotta go home and fuck the cat.&quot;<br>

Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Raymond, decide to go on a picnic. So Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. By the time they do arrive, everyone's exhausted. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and says, 'Alright, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.' 'I didn't bring the bottle opener,' Steve says. 'I thought you packed it.' Naturally, Raymond doesn't have it, so the turtles are stuck ten miles away from home without soda. <br>
<br>
Joe &amp; Steve beg Raymond to turn back home and retrieve it, but Raymond flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. After about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Raymond to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. <br>
<br>
So, Raymond sets off down the road, slow and steadily. Twenty days pass, but no Raymond. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Raymond, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Raymond in sight, Steve starts getting restless. 'I NEED FOOD!' he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. 'NO!' Joe retorts. 'We promised.' Five more days pass. Joe realizes that Raymond probably skipped out to the diner down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. But then, right at that instant, Raymond pops out from behind a rock, and says, 'Just for that, I'm not fucking going.'<br>

There was a guy in a bar one night that got really drunk, I mean REALLY REALLY drunk. When the bar closed he got up to go home. As he tumbled out the door he saw a nun walking on the sidewalk. So he stumbled over to the nun and punched her in the face. Well the nun was really surprised but before she could do or say anything he punched her again. This time she fell down and he stumbled over to her and kicked her in the butt, then he picked her up and threw her against a wall. By this time the nun was pretty weak and couldn't move very much so then he stumbled over to her, put his face right next to hers and said &quot;Not very tough tonight, are you Batman&quot;.<br>

Two good friends are out driving on Route 66 and one guy has to take a leak. Being in the middle of nowhere they pull overby some shrubbery and the guy goes to relieve himself. Suddenly, he screams &quot;Aaagh! a rattler bit my cock!&quot; &quot;Relax!&quot; says his friend, &quot;I'll go find a pay phone and call a doctor.&quot; So his friend drives off and finds a pay phone, call a doctor and asks what he should do. &quot;Well,&quot; said the doc,&quot; you must cut crosses in the wound and suck out the poison.&quot; &quot;Is that the only way Doc?&quot; asked the man. &quot;Yes, you must do that or he'll die.&quot; He finally gets back to friend and his friend asked &quot;So, what did the doctor say?&quot; &quot;You're gonna die, buddy. You're gonna die.&quot;<br>

This time, she didn't even hesitate.
