Young gnomes are typically homebodies, and spend most of their time in their quiet and small (no pun intended) community. Indeed, I still keep in touch with the gnomes I grew up with as an apprentice wizard in Ak'Anon.<br><br>When I got a little older, though, I started feeling the itch to explore Norrath. My first adventures consisted of venturing out into the Faydark woods, eventually reaching the marble walls of Felwithe, home of the High Elves and the tree city of Kelethin, home of the Wood Elves. Spend any time amongst the elves, and they will exhort you about the virtues of Tunare, their goddess and the Mother of All. But while they pay lip service to her, I soon discovered that Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, dwells quietly in many of their hearts. Perhaps I was naïve, but even as I helped the elves battle to repel the orcs of Emperor Crush, I found that many of my allies were without honor, nobility or courage. It was a disheartening lesson to learn about the world, to say the least.<br><br>But that wasn't entirely true, not of all the elves. In the shadows of Kelethin, I met those who were an exception, who stood out against their fellows. Elves like Leopa, Elyhim and Shazarae possessed a generosity of spirit, a greatness of heart and a vision that matched up with my own ideals. I learned as much from Shevik and Elyhim battling the orcs on their home ground as I had up to that time. I remember one night, squatting in the shadow of Crush's castle, Shevik confided his desire to one day gather a company of like-minded individuals to explore Norrath and do great deeds. It was a good vision, but we were young and few in number then.<br><br>Soon thereafter, Leopa and I set out with friends to see the wider world of Norrath. We lived in Rivervale for a time, then moved to Qeynos. It was there, after more adventures, that we received Shevik's call. He was going to form his company at last. He had gathered unto him heroes from throughout Faydwer, and Leopa and I were lucky enough to have been among those called.<br><br>Since then, the Walkers have prospered, spreading out to explore Faydwer, Antonica, Odus, Kunark and Velious. Friends new and old have joined our ranks, and even those of less than reputable descent have cast aside their darker origins to join this company of heroes. We have grown both in power and reputation, and continue to do so. We have become a fellowship where each voice and opinion is of equal weight, and are one of the few companies with an elected leader.<br><br>And as always for the Walkers, the journey remains more important than the destination. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A> at: 8/22/01 5:12:32 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm7.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub78.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="walkersofvazaellefrm4">General<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm10">Screenshots<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm13">Applications for Membership<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm19">Polling Station<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm23">Computer and Technical Issues<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm7">Charter<option value="walkersofvazaellefrm8">Guides</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00F500>- </font><a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/bwalkersofvazaelle>The Walkers of Vazaelle</a><font color=#00F500> - </font><a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm7>Charter</a> <font color=#00F500> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/walkersofvazaelle">The Walkers of Vazaelle</a><font color=#00F500> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
