I am one of the most respectful players on the server and have very little enimies. But today, was one of the most hurtful and disgraceful thing that has happened in my eq career. Yes, one of your clerics was there camping him for around 20 hours which I do not mind. What made me angry was how I have been in that zone for a month (many clerics can tell you this) and finally see him spawn. (the previous spawns happened when I was either at a raid or at work) I told my guild to get to skyfire and they went... when a killable source was there I pulled him with my cleric towards the druid circle. I was thinking to myself about how all this paid off for me but all of a sudden I see one of your guildmembers, who I'd rather not name tag it off of me and eventually got enough agro to pull it to the crew... ragefire died painfully infront of me as I could do nothing about it. Ill admit, I said some words in shout that shouldnt have been said but many would do the same if it happened to them... Im not trying to start problems, (many members are good buddies of mine) im mainly asking for a apology and to let you know that I (jibalt) am camping ragefire....  <br>

<br>
Sadly I wasn't there today as i'm stuck here in the office <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   although I know Paisley was as I logged on briefly this morning after finaly completing the patch - I saw you there too at the same time.<br>
<br>
What you describe here is a blatant KS because you already had agro and it was taken from you, BC are very clear about our Ragefire policy both internally and on open forums.  Nobody in BC would want to achieve the cleric epic at the cost of the guilds reputation so this suprises me.<br>
<br>
I am guessing there is another side to the story, and i'll be endeavouring to find out what that is.  Feel free to talk to me about it later tonight. I'm a member not an officer, but expressely interested in the Ragefire camp for many months as i've still not accomplished it (was too infrequent at first but now have 'bot' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  I've spend almost 11 online days there now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Blood Cult will respect the first force capable of killing Ragefire in the zone, in the player defined 'camp' this would meen having the force there before he popped.  Alternatively we'll acknowledge any force that gets there before us even if it is still buffing (a courtesy we'll always give and expect in return).<br>
<br>
I do recall Legends of Harmonium being against Blood Cult's attempt to form a list for Ragefire, therefor we cannot acknowledge that you have him 'camped' by yourself.  Especially more so as your process of camping is intermittant.<br>
<br>
However if, as you describe, you had agro with your cleric this is obviously something we'd only engage if you asked us too (ie. you had no force in the zone, where going to die otherwise and did /y) or if you /telled for help.<br>
<br>
Your description of events is against the Verant play nice policy, and not something i'd like to see my guild being guilty of.<br>
<br>
If this version of events is entirely true, i'll be asking for the receiving cleric to destroy the item with GM present to respawn the dragon for your force - with a full appology.<br>
<br>
However I would also say that if this is just sour grapes i'll be congratulating Paisley and reffering you back to the BC attempt to form a list on www.xevserver.com where LoH members/officers involved in the thread stated that they would not support it.<br>

The problem arised with me and Jibekn's alt  Jibalk.  I have no problem discussing this problem as I have with Jibekn for over an hour and with several others.<br>
<br>
I have no reason to lie about the facts as I gain nothing in it for myself.  I would not lie or do anything wrong to help a guildmate, friend or even a real life friend.  I wouldn't do it for myself and not about to start.<br>
<br>
I was killing wyverns about 50 eq feet from Ragefire's spawn point.  I was there to give Paisley company since she had been there for 20 hours waiting for him to spawn.  As she told me, she was the only one in the zone when she logged on and was camping it.  Well, Ragefire spawn so close to me while I was looting a corpse I was shocked I wasn't aggroed.  Imediately I told the guild to come fast.  I did /w and only 2 non guildmembers were in zone.  Jibalk and another person that I forget the name right now.  Within minutes we had 2-3 fuill groups at Ragefire spawn since everyone has just been there killing Talendor.  No one had to leave groups because it was less than 30 minutes after Talendor's death.  Since I find spelleffects annoying during raids I had it off for Talendor.  We had our groups ready and discussing the tatic.  Jibalk was the only 1 of 2 non BC people in zone.  He knew he had one chance to get RF and that was pull with us all standing there.  He ran up and stunned him.  But I didn't see the spell effect.  Jibalk started running off.  A few seconds later RF started running after him.  I was standing right next to Zordak with several guildmates when this happened.  He knew we were ready to engage.  He saw us all and decided to pull him away hoping to sneak off with him.  I saw this and was not going to let it happen.  His argument is that he had the force in the zone and was ready to engage.  He did not have the force and I have no reason to lie about it.  During the fight of the human form he said he had the force.  I did /w and /w GUILD and only 4 non BC members.  One of the 4 was not part of his group as he was camping at BW zones pulling mobs.  At the end of the Dragon fight he started yelling in shout.  At this time I did /w  again.  This time there was 7 non BC members in the zone.  We had the force and were ready to engage.  He wanted to kite him to wait for his friends to arrive.<br>
<br>
If you want to takes his side please look at the facts before you do.  He said several things to me.  One being that he lost Ragefire to BC before and wasn't going to let it happen again.  He doesn't honor our camp since it has been his for the last month.  He feels even though there was a server patch and no one was on during it that it is still his camp.  He saw Paisley there knowing she was camping RF.  He said nothing assuming that either Paisley would give up and he take over,  we wouldn't have the force on line or that he would be faster.  <br>
<br>
If you are taking the time to read this post then please do me a favor.  Look at a map of Skyfire Mountains.  Look where Ragefire spawns and where the druid ring is that he says his force was at.  If you we to pull RF to that ring and I assume around the edge of zone to avoid adds   would you kite him all the way up around behind VP to get there quickly?  No, it was his intention to hide this mob from us asap since they were not ready.  And I ask you this.  If he was ready before us then why pull all the way to the druid ring and not just kill him at his spawn point where it is safe from adds.  He did this because we were there in force and in his words &quot; was not going to lose RF to BC again&quot;.  He said he lost Ragefire spawns because he was on a raid or at work.  But they were never his spawns.  If you aren't there then it isn't your camp.  Somewhere he thinks RF is his camp until he gets it whether there is a server patch and he logs on after  another cleric camping it.  We had the force there first and were ready to engage first.  He decided to kite him away, the long way to buy time and hide the mob.  <br>
<br>
If you believe every word he says, if he was ready, then why pull RF at all.  Makes no sense to me, if they were prepared before us why wouldn't they kill him right there.  According to Paisley she was there first.  We were faster to get to RF camp and prepare.  He didn't like this and tried his best to twink his bot with epic.  Sorry if this seems harsh words but it is accurate and if you take the time to look at all the facts I think you will see the big picture.<br>
<br>
Btw,  I am going to talk to a GM with Jibekn.  I can handle my own problems.  I appreciate being given the chance to clear this up on my own.  And if officers have a problem they will take it to me.  I did tell everyone in guild chat and raid channel what was going on.  I was not the only officer in attendance and I was backed up.<br>
<br>
But fine if anyone thinks I acted wrong they have their own opinion.  Jibekn said to me about the play nice policy.  LOL , then why would he pull a mob with our force standing right there away knowing we were quicker to the punch and were ready to fight no kite 5 minutes across a very large zone the LONG way around.<br>
<br>
I will be copying this exact message in the officers forum so they don't miss this topic as I feel I did nothing wrong and have no reason to not discuss any problems.<br>
<br>
Also,  he said Jibalk is camping Ragefire.  If you log on and he isn't on or in SF it is not his camp.  I think he feels that if he logs on and sits in SF it becomes his camp again instantly regardless of anyone else camping it.  I feel for his camp for a month, but if you leave a camp due to server patch or just logging off then you lose it.  But this isn't even about that.  Today Blood Cult was faster to organize a RF spawn and that is the fact plain in simple.<br>
<br>
I am going to place a poll in the officers forum.  There are 10 officers and 1 guildleader.  I will not vote and want to see a clear opinion among the other officers.  I feel I did the correct thing but if the other officers don't agree then something will have to be done.  Bottom line is the GM will make the final decision but I prefer to have the backing in my guild before I continue to contest this issue.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time to read this.  I have no hard feelings to anyone in this and the last thing I want is a bad name amongst others in guild or out of guild.  I think I have been fair in my almost 2 years of Everquest and hope this shows I have no intention of being unfair.  My most valuable item in Everquest to me is my pride, honor and how others portray me.  It was an honor to become an officer as I see that my friends look to me as a person who will help the guild move forward.  It means alot to me to be friends with everyone.  But people have different views and RF is one of the biggest /petition starters that I know of.<br>
<br>

     Like i said in my first reply, i did not come here to create problems, basically why I did not mention your name. I also did not come here to make people pick sides. But this post, imo, should have been dealt with you, myself and the GM. But you gave me no choice to fight back. <br>
<br>
    &quot;Well, Ragefire spawn so close to me while I was looting a corpse I was shocked I wasn't aggroed.  I did /w and only 2 non guildmembers were in zone. Jibalk and another person that I forget the name right now. Within minutes we had 2-3 fuill groups at Ragefire spawn&quot;<br>
<br>
     You are saying you were killing wyverns, saw ragefire spawn and did a / and only saw 2 non bc there. (the time you did / only the cleric and yourself were there that were in bc) before them  minutes your crew was not there according to your quote. so lets just say it took them around 4 minutes which seems how long it took for the 3 groups to arrive. <br>
<br>
&quot;We had our groups ready and discussing the tatic.&quot;<br>
<br>
lets say that atleast took a 2 minutes which I know was longer because as I was pulling ragefire more bc started to show up.<br>
<br>
mainly this all adds up to 6 minutes MINIMAL yet It was still myself in zone when we both saw him spawn at the same time? Moving on...<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are taking the time to read this post then please do me a favor. Look at a map of Skyfire Mountains. Look where Ragefire spawns and where the druid ring is that he says his force was at. If you we to pull RF to that ring and I assume around the edge of zone to avoid adds would you kite him all the way up around behind VP to get there quickly? No, it was his intention to hide this mob from us asap since they were not ready. And I ask you this. If he was ready before us then why pull all the way to the druid ring and not just kill him at his spawn point where it is safe from adds. He did this because we were there in force and in his words &quot; was not going to lose RF to BC again&quot;. He said he lost Ragefire spawns because he was on a raid or at work. But they were never his spawns. If you aren't there then it isn't your camp. Somewhere he thinks RF is his camp until he gets it whether there is a server patch and he logs on after another cleric camping it. We had the force there first and were ready to engage first. He decided to kite him away, the long way to buy time and hide the mob.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   As I was pulling him, did i not give you a specific tell saying that I am pulling it to my crew? infact I did. So Basically you are &quot;assuming&quot; that i was kighting him. IF not, then why did you cast snare on him immidiatly when you saw him? You NEVER bothered to ask me what i was doing with him nor did you even know where i was taking him. So no, you can not tell me that it was a fact that i was kighting him. (which i wasnt) Like i said, My friends were at the druid portal, why did I chose to pull him there and on the zone wall? one, I was on the zone wall because there will be no adds that come along with it (im guessing this is why you thought i was being sneaky) and two, since i did have such a low amount of people I did not want no mistakes hapening. Meaning them running in the middle of a zone filled with danger that could create a death as they running to ragefire, when actually its safer for me to pull behind druid portal without any deaths. (less roamers= safer spot especially with 7 members) sure your members were close to ragefire spawn, (keep in mind they were not even in the zone when he spawned as for my crew also) but that doesnt mean you HAVE to kill him next to the wall. I personally think that spot is the worst to kill him because of the dispellers roaming all around there. Its just like pulling any other mob to a group/raid rather then killing it at its spawn point. IF you read my first post correctly, you will see that I did not say that the spawn belonged to me I was basically saying i had bad luck and finally I got to see him spawn for the first time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He doesn't honor our camp since it has been his for the last month He feels even though there was a server patch and no one was on during it that it is still his camp. He saw Paisley there knowing she was camping RF.<br>
<br>
 WHEN did i specifically tell you that the spawn belonged to me in the first place? You are making me look like a fool. I told you that I have been there for a month and was there even after server patches. Why did i say this? because you told me that i was just a greedy alt. I told you that to basically tell you that I am not greedy at all, and if i had gotten the piece I would deserve it. Please, if you are going to use my quotes use the how they were used.<br>
<br>
 He said nothing assuming that either Paisley would give up and he take over, we wouldn't have the force on line or that he would be faster&quot;<br>
<br>
This works out both ways... Paisley said nothing to me. <br>
I said nothing because i knew saying something about the camp would just start a argument, as i think paisley felt the same with me.<br>

Sure, by the time you would have kitted RF to the druid ring your team would have been rdy for the kill (it takes more than 5 minutes to bring a mob to the druid ring from North East even if you take the short cut by the lava lake, which means being invis) but when you pulled you didn't have the forces in zone to kill.<br>
<br>
BC's policy is clear : if you had been rdy for the kill before BC we would have let you engage first.<br>

    I pulled it with my cleric, jibekn was loading up on my second comp as my guildmembers were there. And behind druid rings is infact a safe spot, The first time i fought tal with a low amount of people we pulled it behind the druid portal to the zone wall. This is why the idea of me to pull ragefire there was safe.  <p><center>

I'd just like to add that that I know of no other guild that has help with as many ragefire camps as BC. I'm sure they had thier reasons and not just attempting to KS you. /shrug. Gratz Paisely on your epic.<br>

<br>
It's the understanding that the first one to draw aggro has their right to kill that mob, correct?  Looks to me like Jibalt pulled and was moving to kite the mob until his friends showed up to help him.  NOTHING wrong with this, it's a normal thing if you can pull it, kite it and wait for your friends to arrive to kill it.  Perfectly within the rules.<br>
<br>
Having someone come up and take that kite from you, however, isn't in the rules and is a blatent kill steal.  I may not have the facts straight, but from what I've read this is what it sounds like to me.  Incredibly greedy and dishonorable.<br>
<br>
Jib if we're alongside you in camp and this same thing happens, please /yell to us for help.<br>

Do u know someone can kite this mob for several hours ? so someone on another time zone than us just kite him 4 hours to have his guild log on and kill ? i mean of course some mob can be engaged and killed but i think when a guild is rdy for an attemps they have the right to try it. Btw on this mob we can all give our opinion and never find something good for every one. So gl for ppl who really want to continu this kind of discussion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

@Cleramid - Im pretty sure the manaburn wiz + jibekn + warrior could have taken Ragefire (with some of the gear harm have)no probs.<br>
<br>
@Pentorian - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FIRST FORCE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there to kill him has the right to the mob, as warrmouk said, u could kite him for as long as u wanted (which is not the courtesy rule) so whoever had the first force ready to engage has the rights to the kill.<br>
