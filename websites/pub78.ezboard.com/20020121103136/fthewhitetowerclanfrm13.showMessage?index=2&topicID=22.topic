I recognized it, having travelled on it many years past. <br>
    <br>
   It was late afternoon and, judging by the surroundings, I was still some distance from the city.  Though it was still bright, many of the colorful birds had already sought their nests.  Here and there swarms of night insects began to stir, lifting themselves under the leaves of bushesby the road.  The shadows of the trees had grown long, and, judging by the shadows, it was nearing time to stop and make camp, as I was in no hurry to make my destination.  <br>
<br>
  I wondered if it was still practical to continue my journey, the sun would soon be down, and the night was not without it's dangers, particularly to a man on foot.  It is at night that the many Trollocs that seem to have found their way to this part of the world make their presence known, not to mention the wolves, and Thieves.<br>
<br>
  I came to the decision that I would withdraw from the road, wrap myself in my cloak, and spend the night in the shelter of some rocks, or perhaps crawl into the tangle of some thorn bushes, where one might sleep in relative security.  Now that I was considering discontinuing my journey, I suddenly became acutely aware that I was both hungry and thirsty.  I reached into my leather pack and fished out a skin of water, and a piece of dried meat, it would have to do for now.<br>
<br>
 I had scarcely stepped from the road when, coming down the road, each step carefully measured and solid, I saw a wide, hunched figure, bending under a gigantic bundle of sticks, strapped to his back by two cords which he held twisted in his fists in front of his body.  His load was probably to fuel the fires of his home.  The weight the man was carrying was quite staggering, and would have staggered most large men, this man was very strong. <br>
<br>
 The man approached more closely.  His eyes were almost covered with a white, shaggy, mess of hair, with twigs and leaves entangled in it.  The whiskers had been scraped from his face, probably by the blade of the broad double-headed wood ax bound on top of the bundle.  He wore a short tattered sleeveless robe, which had a leather back and shoulder area, on his feet he wore heavy leather boots, worn down and looked ready to fall apart.<br>
<br>
 I stepped into the road before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello,&quot; I said lifting my hand in greeting.<br>
<br>
The shaggy creature, broad, powerful, monstrous in appearance, stood before me, his feet planted firmly on the road.  His head lifted, it's wide narrow eyes, pale like water, regarded me through the brush of hair that almost concealed them.<br>
<br>
In spite of his slow reaction to my presence, his deliberate and patient movements, I gathered that he was surprised.  he had apparantly not expected to meet anyone on this road.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello,&quot; he said, his voice thick, almost less that human.  I sensed that he was considering how quickly he could get to the ax bound across the bundle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean you no harm,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked the man, who must now have noticed the sword over my shoulder, and probably considered me an thief.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not an outlaw,&quot; I said.  He obviously didn't believe me.  &quot;I am hungry,&quot; I said &quot;I have very little food on me, and have barely eaten all day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I too am hungry,&quot; he said, &quot;and have had nothing to eat in many hours.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is your home near?&quot; I asked.  I knew it would be from the time of day at which I had encountered him.  The sun usually dictates the schedules of most country dwellers.<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean you no harm, I have a little money and can pay you for the food.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An outlaw takes what he wishes,&quot; said the man.  He regarded me, and I thought I saw the trace of a smile cracked through the stubbled leather of his broad face.  &quot;I have no daughter, I have no silver, and no goods.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I wish you prosperity,&quot; I laughed, &quot;and will be on my way.&quot;  I passed him and continued down the road.  I had moved but a few steps when his voice arrested me.  It was hard to understand the words, for his voice was rough, and it sounded as though he did not use it often.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have peas and turnips, garlic and onions in my home&quot; said the man, his bundle like a giant hump on his back.<br>
<br>
&quot;The creator himself could not ask for more.&quot;  I said to the man.<br>
<br>
&quot;then friend,&quot; said the man, issuing me an invitation to dine with him, &quot;share my table.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am honored&quot; I said, and I was.<br>
<br>

He would have a guest tonight.  He would speak little himself, not being use to conversation with others, and being to proud to form sentences which he knew would most likely be stumbling and ungrammatical, but would sit by the fire until dawn, refusing to let me sleep, wanting me to talk to him, to tell him stories, recount adventures, to give him news of faraway places.  What I said, I knew, would be less important than the fact that something was said, that he had not been alone again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Ruon.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruon of what city?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruon......&quot; he said<br>
<br>
&quot;Of what city?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of no city,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Surely,&quot; I said, &quot;you are of Tar Valon being so near it.&quot;<br>
<br>
   The squat, misformed giant of a man seemed almost to recoil as if struck, and to tremble.  I sensed that this simple, unaffected primate of a man was suddenly afraid.  Ruon, I felt, would have faced a Trolloc armed only with his ax, but yet, here, he seemed frightened.  The great fists holding the cords of the bundle of wood turned white; the sticks rattled in the bundle.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I am Mandinga Bedoa,&quot;  I said.  &quot;Mandinga of Tar Valon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ruon uttered an inarticulate cry, and began to stumble backwards.  His hands fumbled on the cords and the great bundle of wood loosened and clattered to the road.  Turning to run his foot slipped on one of the sticks and he fell.  He fell almost on top of the ax which lay on the road.  Impulsively, as though it woere a life-giving plank in the maelstrom of his fear, he seized the ax.<br>
<br>
 With the ax in his hands, suddenely he seemed to remember he was not schooled in fighting, there in the dusk, a few feet from me, like a beast clutching the broad-headed ax, breathing deeply, sucking in the air, mastering his fear.  His eyes glared at me throught the grizzled, matted locks of his hair, I could not understand his fear, but I was proud to see him master it, for fear is the great common enemy of all living things, and his victory I felt somehow was also mine.<br>
<br>
  Ruon straightened as much as his giant bow of a backbone would allow him.  He was no longer afraid.<br>
<br>
  He spoke slowly.  His voice was thick, but it was fully under his control.  &quot;Say you are not Mandinga Bedoa of Tar Valon,&quot;  He said.<br>
<br>
  &quot;But I am,&quot; I replied.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I ask your favor,&quot; Said Ruon, his voice thick with emotion.  He was pleading.  &quot;say you are not Mandinga Bedoa of Tar Valon.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I am Mandinga Bedoa of Tar Valon,&quot;  I repeated firmly.<br>
<br>
  Ruon lifted his ax.<br>
<br>
  It seemed light in his massive grip.  I felt it could have felled a small tree with a single blow.  Step by step, he approached me, the ax held over his shoulder with both hands.<br>
<br>
  At last he stopped before me.  I thought there were tears in his eyes.  I made no move to defend myself.  Somehow I knew Ruon would not strike.  He struggled with himself, his simple wide face twisted in agony, his eyes tortured.<br>
<br>
  &quot;May the Creator forgive me!&quot; He cried.<br>
<br>
   He threw down the ax, which rang on some of the stones of the road to Tar Valon.  Ruon sank down, and sat cross-legged in the road, his gigantic frame shaken with sobs, his massive head buried in his hands, his thick, guttural voice moaning with distress.  <br>
<br>
  At such a time a man may not be spoken to, for the way some warriors looked at it, pity humiliates both he who pities, and he who is pitied.  According to the Warriors way, one may love, but one may not pity.<br>
<br>
  So I moved on.  I had forgotten my hunger, I no longer considered the dangers of the road.  <br>
<br>
  I would make it to Tar Valon by Dawn. <p><img src="http://whitetower.wotclans.com/sigpics/mandinga.jpg">

It was a nightmarish journey, and a foolish one, trying to rush on through the night to find Tar Valon, bruising, falling, scraping myself in the darkness, yet driven by such a torment of doubt and apprehension that I could allow myself no rest until I stood again on the lofty bridges of Tar Valon. <br>
<br>
   Was I not Mandinga Bedoa of Tar Valon?  Was there not such a city?  Each sign I saw said there was one.  Yet why did the road look untraveled?  Why had Ruon the stick carrier acted as he had?  I stopped and looked at the stars above me, finally the clouds had cleared and they and the moon could be seen.  The sky above me was alive with the brilliant points of light, some flickering, some white, some yellow, but all breathtaking, if not for my determination to move on, I could have found a safe spot to lie and look at the stars till morning.<br>
<br>
  I prepared to set forth on my journey again, grateful now that the moon might guide my path on this perilous road.  I asked mysef, in a sane moment, if I should not seek shelter, and I knew that I should, but I could not, because questions burned within me that I could not dare to answer.  Only the evidence of my eyes and ears could allay my fears, my bewilderment.  I sought a truth I did not know, but I knew I must discover, and it lay at the end of this road.<br>
<br>
  I caught a strange, unpleasant scent, much like that of an unclean animal, but stronger.  In that instant every sense was alert.  I froze, and almost animal response.  I was silent, not moving, seeking the shelter of stillness and immobility.  My head turned imperceptibly as I scanned the rocks and bushes about the road.  I thought I heard a light sniffling, a grunt, a small doglike whine, then nothing.<br>
<br>
  It to had frozen, probably sensing my presence.  Most likely it was a trolloc, hopefully one on it's own, I guessed it had not been hunting me, or I would not likely to have smelled it.  It would have approached me from upwind, if it had any sense of a hunter that is.  I stood still for a good 2 to 3 minutes, then I saw, tall, a man beast, lumber across the road, it's face with a doglike snout.<br>
<br>
  I breathed a sigh of relief, it was alone, so not much of a danger, it's attack, if it should detect my presence, would be little more than a nuisance, probably a clumsy noisy charge.  It staggered into the darkness, not seeing me on the road, and continued on to whereever it was going.  Strange to see a Trolloc so close to city.<br>
<br>
  Black, scudding clouds again obscured the moon, and the wind began to rise.  I could see the shadows of tall trees bending against the darkness of the night, their leaves lifting and rustling on the long branches.  I smelled rain in the air.  In the far distance there was a sudden flash of lightning, and the sound of remote thunder reached me some seconds later.<br>
<br>
  As I hurried on, I became more apprehensive.  By now it seemed to me that I should be able to see the lights of the tall cylinder of the White Tower.  The wind gathered force, seeming to tear at the trees.<br>
<br>
  In a flash of light I spied a wooden sign and eagerly rushed to it.  In the mounting of the wind and darkness I traced the numbering on the wood.  It was true.  I should now be able to see the lights of Tar Valon, Yet I could see nothing.  The city must be in darkness.<br>
<br>
  Why were the lanterns not hung on the bridges, why were the lamps of a hundred colors and flames no lit in the buildings of the city,.  Why was it in darkness, why?<br>
<br>
  I stood by the sign, trying to understand.  I was confused, uncertain.  Now that I had not seen the lights of Tar Valon, as I would have expected, it struck me more forcibly that I had not even seen the lights of country cooking fires glowing in the terain surrounding the city, or the torches of guards patrolling the roads around the city.<br>
<br>
  A monstrous chain of lightning exploded in the night about me, deafening me with the shock and roar of it's thunder, splitting the darkness in violent fragments, breaking it to pieces like a clay bowl struck with a hammer of fire, and with the lightning, the storm descended, fierce cold torrents of icy rain whipped by the wind.<br>
