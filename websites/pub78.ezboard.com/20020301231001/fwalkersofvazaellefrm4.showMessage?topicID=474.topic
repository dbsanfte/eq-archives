Simplify, simplify.”<br>Thoreau <br><br>&quot;My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there.&quot;<br>Charles Franklin Kettering<br><br>“The anthropic principle is where science is confronted with a mystical implication in that our creation purely from anomaly is difficult to defend.”<br>Joseph Firmage<br><br>“I believe that every one of us is made of light, and every one of us matter. We are made of God. We are children of Cosmos, each a light in time. I – the truth of observation – am – the love of experience.

That wasn't bullshit. It's on European Socialism. I mean, really, what's the point? I'm not European, I don't plan on being European, so who gives a crap if they're socialist? They could be fascist anarchists, that still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car. Not that I condone fascism, or any ism for that matter. Isms in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an ism, he should believe in himself.<br>I quote John Lennon: &quot;I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me.&quot; A good point there.
