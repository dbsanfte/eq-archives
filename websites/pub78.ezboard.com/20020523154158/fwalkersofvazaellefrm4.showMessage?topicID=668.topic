(sun.)<br><br>First of all, I want to thank everyone that attended for being patient while we put this together. It was a spur of the moment raid, and many of us had very little to no raiding experience, and it speaks volumes that we were able to get as far as we did. Shulzan and I just started sending out tells and before we knew it, we had two groups to bring in there! The response was much more than we expected! Thank you all for trusting us with your time and effort, I hope you all feel as rewarded as I do! <br><br>Specifically, I want to thank the whole Fate's Clan crew that joined in, because we couldn't have done this without you! Cynati, Zass, Mortainus, and Fronk - thank you for joining us, and a special thank you to Annaleas for bringing them along. I hope we can all do this again soon. An extra special thanks goes out to Borgard for being our main puller/rezzer/ all around nice guy! <br><br>Walkers that came: What can I say? I already knew you folks rock! Thanks and a big warm welcome to Jullious, our newest member! Also thanks to Lillishana, and Kerina! (I don't remeber buying a ticket for THAT train!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also thanks to Neulail and his 1337 AOE skillz! <br><br>Extra extra extra extra extra extra (etc., etc. ad infinitum) thanks to Idane for coming in at the end and rezzing EVERYONE when we finally bit the dust! Simply amazing girl! I can't thank you enough. I will make it up to you one day, some how! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Of course, thanks to Shulzan, who helped put this whole thing together and probably was dealing with a lot more stress than he let on. You continue to amaze me brotha! I'm glad you're a part of this guild. You are absolutely true Walker material! <br><br>If I forgot to thank anyone, I'm very sorry. There was a lot going on and I may have missed someone. <br><br>I hope everyone got some XP, some loot, and above all, HAD FUN! That, truly, was what this was about. I also hope, like me, everyone found it a learning experience. I definitely got some serious lessons in monitoring several chat channels and managing aggro and such. <br><br>Very soon my friends... very soon WE TAKE CASTLE MISTMOORE DOWN!    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>and, oh yeah, DING!

There is nothing like being run to the zone, twice, by those misty inkies.  When I hear &quot;RUN&quot; and the raid leader (Tryunn) answers &quot;you heard her!&quot; well hey, who am I to argue, right?  Just glad I had GATE loaded because I KNOW there was no way I was going to be able to find my way out without getting lost.<br><br>Egad some of those trains were insidious.  I did not even know CHARM was a weapon they had to throw at us.  I wish I could remember the kind soul's name who was charmed and pounding on me, (I think it might have been Myrmidel) and me caught without a strip enchantment loaded!  I tried to talk him into letting me sit down and med it so I could free him, that it was for his own good after all! (LOL)  But NO.  And without Fronk there to heal my sorry arse I knew both I and our group were done for.<br><br>Which reminds me, Fronk, thanks for saving my bacon with your heals so many times.  I am so bummed you were the first to fall on that last nasty train.  How you went so fast I do not understand.  Maybe they got you while you were sitting. There were enough of them that if they all jumped you at once I can see it happening.  One minute you were there, the next you were gone.  And without you our whole group could not stand.<br><br>I also want to say thanks to Lillshana for swinging that steel and keeping most of those nasties off of us.  And Neulail, I quickly figured out that it was in my best interest to step in there next to you and stun them buggers when you drew agro.  You and your AOE nuke, well, does the phrase super sweet mean anything to you?<br><br>And a big thanks to Borgard for figuring out how to keep everyone happy.  You are a true pally.  And a heck of a puller.<br><br>And a big thanks to Shulzan for getting the ball rolling and giving me a heads up and to Tryunn for organizing it all.<br><br>Finally, I just want to say thanks for the chance to experience some serious pucker factor dragging corpses past all those killer misty folk.  I got a serious case of the panic attacks when I realized Borgard had SOW and I didn't and I didn't know they way yet.  (He says as Borgard rounds the corner WAY up ahead and fades from sight)  But I learned, fast.  And thank goodness inviso didn't fail!<br><br>And Gratz on ding 29 Tryunn! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble<br>O.G.
