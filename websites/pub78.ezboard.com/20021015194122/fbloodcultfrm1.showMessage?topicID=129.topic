PREFACE<br>
Please find following The List entry for Bootti.  After what I consider to be a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> serious</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> verbal slanderous sustained assault I have no hesitation in submitting him to the damnation of no-rez hell.<br>
<br>
Here's a log file i've read through and still can't believe happened. It's an argument involving some inflamatory remarks where both parties cross the line.  I feel that Bootti went too far in inciting inflamations from a jovial beginning. I also feel that this person is potentially unstable, making several psychological assessments of myself throughout the conversation yet exhonorating himself of all mortal frailties.<br>
<br>
My appologies for the size of this log, but I felt in this instance it was wise to copy the log in un-abridged having edited out only that which was not directly involved.<br>

When I have a mission, it consumes me; I will not be satisfied until the job is done. I have a strong sense of duty, and a strong sense of direction. Changes in the tide don't phase me - I always know which way the wind blows, and I know how to compensate for it. I get on poorly with people like myself. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

In reallife terms: I am British, of which Wales is a part.

If you had said you where Korean I would have replied, &quot;You have my sympathies&quot;.<br>
<br>
Xenophobia is not racism.<br>
<br>
Stop trying to demote the argument to racism, in doing so you are commiting racism buy using your race to pick fault in another.  The defence of racism walks the tightrope of racism itself - the boy who cried wolf killed the flock when the wolf came.<br>

It doesn't change the fact that I would post the log of such an incident to any guild who's member slanders me in such a serious way.<br>
<br>
I've had a little time to think about this now and here is my decision:<br>
<br>
I will not tolerate this abuse from Bootti or any other player online.<br>
<br>
All this trash of him &quot;having no opinions&quot; &quot;making no judgements&quot; &quot;holding no grudges&quot; yet following that with opinions, judgements and &quot;you started it&quot; is simply evidence of mental instability which frankly I don't care about.<br>
<br>
However Calling me racist is either a) True (which is a criminal offense) or b) Slanderous (which is a criminal offense).<br>
<br>
The fact that he has called me racist on a public forum in his message above opens this to a legal issue.  I am upset by this sustained assault of his and will not have him blackening my name in a public forum or online in Everquest.<br>
<br>
So either he retracts this now, sincerely and publicly, or I send the log to Verant &amp; Ezboard in the first instance and to a higher authority if satisfaction is not achieved.<br>
