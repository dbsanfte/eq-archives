<br>
Hi everyone.  I need to communicate a few things to you all, in hopes of having a second opportunity to be a member of Blood Cult.  I've had lots of time to think about this, and regardless of what requirements are placed on me, this is the guild I'd like to belong to, in order to continue playing the game.<br>
First, I want to Congratulate all of you on taking down Venril Sathir today.  I had a great time going along, first to SG and WW to try to get things there, then the mad dash to Karnor's Castle to deal with VS.  It was tougher than I thought, but you all did it, and it went really well except for some strategy and necessary communications that were in /guild rather than /ooc or /shout, and I was a little confused and frustrated for a bit.  Still, I was glad to be there, as I've been glad to be involved in all Blood Cult activities since I first met Blood Cult members several months ago.<br>
Second, since I'd been a member of BC, and was removed by Nogi, there's still some things to be said about that.  I said things that were wrong, I expressed myself badly, and I criticized where I shouldn't have.  I was wrong.  I let my frustrations get the best of me.  I made accusations and disparaging comments about Meyna, Garnak, and Tsunare which were unfair, and untrue.  I apologized privately to each of them, but I once again apologize, so that everyone can see it.  I was just wrong.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I have no resentment against anyone for anything that happened, and would like to be forgiven for having said things against them.  I felt like I was taken advantage of, but it's really my own lack of knowledge that put me in that position, not anyone else.  Please let that be in the past and not affect us any more.  I sincerely do not hold anything against anyone except myself, concerning the tranquil staff and events connected to it.<br>
Third, you know I joined Last Exodus after leaving BC.  Chakkan has a very nice guild, he's a very good leader, and a top-notch monk, and I thought I'd have a great opportunity to learn a lot from him and the other members of LE.  However, about 2 weeks after joining them, I was involved in a problem with one member.  I was asked my opinion about how this one member should level faster, and I gave it.  I suggested leaving their friends at home and going to the toughest places possible with the highest level people available.  I meant no offense toward any of their friends, it was just my opinion of how they'd level fastest.  A couple days later, this member of LE and friends blew up at me, deciding I didn't like them, had something against them.  Not true, but it was blown up into a fight that I neither expected nor wanted.  Chakkan and other officers got involved, because that group of friends disbanded from the guild, and I apologized for giving an opinion that was asked for, I apologized for someone else's perception of my opinion, to do my part to make things better in the guild.<br>
The following week, I went out of my way to group with those members in Sebilis, to show that we could all get along, to show that I had nothing against them, and to have some fun killing froggies.  After about 3 hours, the one member had cast a spell that caused out mob to aggro on them for a short time, and I mentioned &quot;I didn't know that spell could taunt like that&quot;.  A few minutes later, they blew up at me again.  Accused me of saying things to the other group member about them.  Not at all true. Adelin, Iskariot, and Arathi may not remember that group, but they'd surely remember if I made any comments to them about anyone.  I didn't.  So I asked the LE member what was the problem, why they were doing that, I tried explaining that I'd said NOTHING, that I thought we were having a really good time, the group was doing extremely well.  I mean, wouldn't you want to know why someone started accusing you like that?<br>
Well, from that point on, everytime I tried to talk to them, these people would scream &quot;leave me alone, you're trying to start a fight again&quot; over and over and over.  All I wanted was to know what the hell their problem was.... A couple hours later, I started getting very abusive, harassing tells from someone I didn't know, telling me they were going to ruin the game for me, because I was bothering the LE members, they were going to come after me in every zone I went to anytime I was online.  Turns out this person was the &quot;spouse&quot; of one of the LE members, but only online, character-marriage things.  I put them on /ignore and went on with what I was doing.  The next day, just the 3 other members of LE who had this ongoing soap-opera drama with me were on, so I started asking in /guild what the problem was and why they'd started that thing the previous day.  They still haven't answered that.  But they spent a lot of time accusing me of starting something that I had never done.  It went on awhile, I simply refused to quit trying to find out what was the problem, why they were doing what they were doing.  So, the next day, I explained what was happening to a couple of the guild officers.  Late that evening, Chakkan had me removed from the guild.<br>
That's all there is to that.  I didn't go out of my way to create a problem.  I answered someone's question honestly, and they used that to build a soap opera, conveniently failing to tell everyone else that they asked my opinion.  Then, when that ended to soon, too easily, they took the next opportunity to build on the drama, create new theatrics.  Oh, I'm not blameless.  I should've shut up, headed for the exit at jboots speed, gone to camp Hasten... but I didn't.  I demanded answers, I screamed for justice, I ranted and raved at the unfairness.  I should've never been there.  I regret the whole thing happening, but I honestly didn't start any problem, didn't cause any problem.  I was just sucked into a problem someone else decided to have.  I talked to the LE officers afterwards, I know they've got to consider the guild as a whole, and have no resentment towards them.  <br>
I should've been in BC the whole time, and for that, I am very sorry.<br>
But, I want back in.  I've made that clear to so many of you.  I still hang out with several of you at every opportunity, I plan my play so that I can be around BC whenever possible, I try to get in on the raids and epic mob hunts with you.  I've done it as much as I can, because you're the guild that I want to belong to.<br>
I'm not making excuses for being who I am, even when I do or say things that I shouldn't.  It happens.  I'm so imperfect, it's not even funny.  But I'm doing everything I can to contribute to BC, to each of you.  There's not a single member of BC that I wouldn't group with, go try to camp an epic mob with, spend my online time helping get a level for new spells or new skills or anything.  I think if you ask around, there's plenty of members who have seen me doing just that.<br>
I'd like bygones to be bygones, let the problems of the past be water under the bridge.  But you can hold me accountable in any way you see fit, just give me another chance at BC membership.<br>
I hope to see you all again soon.<br>
Thanks.<br>
Jaynay <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#300000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/udadex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dadex</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master slayer</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/7/02 6:00:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fbloodcultfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Apologies, regrets, but no excuses.</span><hr size=1> Thanks for clearing the air Jaynay, takes courage to do it publicly,  but sometimes its the simplest way of working things out. <br>

<br>
I was sorry to see you go and said as much at the time, but your return does concern me.<br>
<br>
The reason I am so concerned is because since your departure from Blood Cult you haven't, from the evidence I have seen, changed.<br>
<br>
There is no reason to believe from the evidence before us that your not as combustable as an aerosol can in the raging fires of SolB as you where before.<br>
<br>
Rather than seeing an example of a change in your persona, instead your plea above shows a frightening example of the very thing you where guild removed for and I rather fear you are just applying for BC'ism on a rebound.  I hope that isn't the case.<br>
<br>
I try to be as direct as my convoluted ways allow me to be Jaynay, so i'll tell you strait now how I feel as I did when I consoled you on your departure, I very much feel that there is no need to rock the boat, I don't see any reason why BC should welcome you back.<br>
<br>
Nogi however believes in you.  His strength and faith in you alone is the reason you are being given this chance.  I sincerely hope he isn't doing this because he feels guilty about removing you, I hope his reasons are as just as his words of support have been.  His faith in you alone is the reason why I stand by his decision to let you back in.<br>
<br>
I have always maintained that I hold nothing against you Jaynay and even quite like you, and just as I said I was unhappy about the events that led to your departure and regreted your guildremoval.  I'll stand by my words when I said i'll continue to group with you and rez you if need be.<br>
<br>
I will not however, stand by and look on if you upset anyone else, guilded or otherwise, whilst wearing a Blood Cult tag after your name.<br>

What's mine is mine, and I make sure everyone knows it. Nobody invades my space without permission - I'd destroy everything I own before letting someone take it from me.
