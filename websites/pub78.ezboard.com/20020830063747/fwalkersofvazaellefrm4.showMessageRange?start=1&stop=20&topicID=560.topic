It wasn't an easy decision to make but it is one that I know I'll feel better about in the days to come. I'm not leaving out of any RL crisis or distraction. Rather, it's that I feel that the increasing demands of time and effort are just no longer compatible with the newly graduated Sina who still has much work and life ahead of him and feeling less time to do it in!<br><br>I have so many great memories of being with you guys.  But what comes to mind the most when I think of Walkers is our respect for each other and the willingness to communicate -- that atmosphere was always there and everyone's voice mattered regardless of level or class. The only thing that mattered was the person. While I don't think everyone took advantage of this opportunity for dialogue, they should know that they mattered whether they knew it or not! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  When faced with problems, the way we handled these obstacles really defined who we are and that's something to take pride in. Perhaps the best testament to this is the fact that other guilds have come and gone and many just cannot manage to keep the whole happy – but the Walkers are still going strong.<br><br>I have to really thank Alphonse for getting me into EQ in the first place. And I want Alph to know that even though I know he doesn'tget to play as much as he wanted, his presence (and absence) is very much felt. He's that good a person! And as for you all:<br><br>Elyhim - I always considered you the spirit of Walkers, a true friend and one of the most honourable people I've met<br><br>Caniel - I don't think you could have picked a class better for you as I think it really suits you. You're a helper and a healer at heart!<br><br>Ulrich - You bastard! You rocked and you were the glue. I'll have a pint one day with you and the rest of the Canadian Mafia<br><br>Rudee - The man. That is all that needs to be said. Even with a difficult work schedule you made time for us and the guild and that means a lot. <br><br>Tryunn - bling, bling, mofaka! *walker gang signs*  Wish we had a chance to group but I leave knowing you're awesome ench!<br><br>Azil - if Ely's the spirit you were the heart. You are absolutely great! Always positive and there for others. I always picture you as smiling *does a backflip for Azil*<br><br>Shiloch - how can anyone not be impressed with someone who tried to start an all-caster guild? Glad you found a home in Walkers. You're a great friend and ______ __ is lucky to have you as a Game Guide!<br><br>Larn - I wish we grouped more but your voice was definitely known in guildchat and was always welcome.<br><br>Thallas - the quieter bard that didn't say much but whenever he did it was always meant a lot. Thanks for helping the guild keep its perspective and for being a great bard and better person.<br><br>Arius - Glad we got chances to group. Everybody missed you when work called and you were overseas. Having you around was always terrific!<br><br>Kalenie - I'm glad that you too decided to come back to Walkers long ago. You always conducted yourself upstandingly and were outspoken about what you believed in and are respected by all.<br><br>Fieni - I always thought of Fieni as the Fieni Family since it was fun to guess who was playing her at the Fieni homestead! Regardless, Fieni was always fun to be around! You're a nut and it shows and j'admire vous!<br><br>Kaelwolf - I remember meeting ya the first night I came back to Walkers and was immediately impressed with your ghetto mezz skills in BW. After that, I continued to be impressed by your person. <br><br>Bammbi - Even your nice ass didn't detract from you being a skilled player who always came off as intelligent and fun...you slut!<br><br>Acanis - You were very fair-minded and always a positive force. This guild is all the better for having you in it.<br><br>Swoops - I don't think I can say enough good things about you. You embody the Walker spirit very much and we all know it and thank you for it.<br><br>Wemdar/Hungary - Thanks for being my wiz pet that afternoon in the Grey! We had a really good talk and am glad for it.<br><br>Luleras-Cashius - from the lone ranger to madman monk – a great guy and complete player!  You flat out rock.<br><br>Yecna - I was glad you joined Walkers and even prior to this everyone only ever had good things to say about you and I'm proud to have known you<br><br>Hauen - being on the Walker late night shift, it was fun to talk to you and your sense of humour and comments always made me laugh. A pal of a pally (!)oof, forgive that pun<br><br>Kaosmos - I know you left us but I think I speak for Walkers when I say that it was a departure only via guildtag and not in spirit.<br><br>Kimaru - to be honest, I wasn't sure if Walkers was for you but everyday you logged on, you proved me wrong with your attitude and sense of fun and Walkers is lucky to have you<br><br>Faddo - the little tank that could! Small in stature but with a big heart. That'll be Faddo to me.<br><br>Goann - always had nothing but the highest respect for you. I know you've found a home in Walkers and wish you all the best. I'm glad your voice is among the Walkers.<br><br>Zahasha - thanks for making me feel part of the SCoL family! I will always remember you for that<br><br>Krristan, Lilli, Teeka, Produs, Pulsar, Amicus,  Honorkin, Lorie and my other Walker friends – Sadly, I leave the game knowing you all a lot less than I'd have liked.   <br><br>Katarin - …what to say? There wasn't anyone who I felt more comfy with talking to when I'd log on. Thank you for everything – if I could send you a hug and kiss in a box, I would.<br><br>Whizbang and Leopa - You two are just beautiful people and I love you both for it!!! I can go on and on about you two but suffice it to say, I couldn't picture EQ without you guys. <br><br>If I say anything more, the weeping may interrupt my babbling, so I won't! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I probably won't hang around the message boards since I think the hurt of not being able to log onto guildlife will be too tough for me. <br><br>I'm also not selling Abinsuran.  Though I briefly considered it, I realized that he was very much me and I wouldn't feel comfortable with anyone else trying to be me since I do such a slack job of it myself!<br><br>I'll pass my account info on to Alph and he'll have my droppables if anyone needs'em. I'll also pass along the applicant info table.<br><br>I leave knowing I've been with the best people I could have journeyed with and I hope that we all have a chance to meet again one day.

What could I possibly say that hasn't already been expressed?  I enjoyed our early morning conversations, your wit, your often outspoken posting, and your subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) influence in the guild's direction and attitude. In short, being around you was a hoot! <br>I hope you don't deguild or delete or anything silly like that.  As Azil said, perhaps you'll want to pop on to decompress, vent, or simply spend a bit of time with old friends to take a break from the hectic adventures that you'll be facing in RL.  At the very least pop onto the boards once in a while and keep us posted about the life of Sina.<br>I suspect that you will be a success in anything you choose to pursue, especially if you pursue it with the same zeal that you displayed with Abin.<br>Good luck!<br><br>P.S.  What about fragging?  You do still want to frag or be fragged once in a while, right?  hehe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/udunnodoncare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunnodoncare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#00F500>(3/14/02 12:32:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=560.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Farewell, friends</span><hr size=1> Well shit. <p>Bammbi, the Ranger with the nice ass.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ushilochveneficus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shiloch Veneficus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#00F500>(3/14/02 1:55:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub78.ezboard.com/fwalkersofvazaellefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=560.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Farewell, friends</span><hr size=1> Sorry to see you go, Sina, but I completely understand your position.
