Please beware, it is very very long.<br>
<br>
Much of the info and tactics were gathered from many of you so I do hope this helps others on the way to being Main tank on raids.<br>

========================================<br>
<br>
Last night I was asked, “what does a main tank do anyway”? It told the person that I couldn’t explain it in tells so I will try here. I want to share what I’m doing so that everyone understands and so that we can work better as a team.<br>
<br>
In one sentence the job of the main tank is to keep the mezzers and the puller alive. Now this may sound dramatic but that is what it is. You will note that I say mezzer and not enchanter because although enchanters are normally the mezzer they are not the only ones who can mez.<br>
<br>
It starts days before the raid. The main tank must know what the intended target is and how to fight it. But just as important the main tank must know what mobs lay between the raid and the target. This is to assist the main tank in picking the correct target at the correct time. You must know which have magic resistance and how much, which are healers and which are casters so that you can pick targets in the order that best protects the mezzers from attack and increases the raid’s chances of success. The order that a multiple mob pull is attacked can very often be the difference between success and wipe out.<br>
<br>
You also have to know the layout and topography of the zone to be hunted, probable pull strategies and most likely camp points. You must decide in advance, if possible, where you will stand, which way you fill face, should you shrink, should you levitate and will you assist pull with arrows or not.<br>
<br>
If the raid leader does not designate a back up main, the main assist will select a partner to work with. This person is normally of a class that can grab agro and survive while solo tanking a un-mezzable mob. Normally SK’s are the best choice followed by Pallies but others can do a good job here. Their job is to solo tank any non-mezzable adds. The backup must also be as prepared for the raid as the main assist. If the main assist dies the backup must be prepared to take over.<br>
<br>
Now it is time for the first pull. <br>
<br>
The puller goes out and disappears from sight. Minutes later there is an “inc” messages. The targeted mob at that time is called a hard agro’d mob. This means that the puller has likely agro’d the mob by doing damage. When this mob comes in, it will continue to attack the puller until agro is removed or the main assist is higher on the agro list. Soft agro mobs are mobs that have been agro’d by the puller through her/his actions but not by damage. Soft agro mobs will likely switch agro to the next closest player as they are pulled in unless another player takes some action to acquire agro (i.e.: healing the puller) or by faction. The first player that the mob encounters while chasing the puller must be the main tank. Training the main tank is GUUD.<br>
<br>
So now the puller is in sight. The first thing the main tank must do is to acquire the agro of the hard agro’d mob from the puller. The main tank can sometimes tell which is hard agro by the mobs forward motion. If the puller moves off of normal pathing, a hard agro mob will normally follow, soft agro’d mobs normally don’t. Using assist in most cases to pick up hard agro normally fails. The assist command cannot be trusted in this situation. When you see the main tank shooting arrows at a mob as the puller approaches it is because the main tank has probably identified the hard agro. Do not assume that the mob that the main assist shoots arrows at will be the first target. This is not science but mostly guesswork. The puller should normally run to the main tank and stand or feign death, if possible, just beside or behind the main tank. This is so the soft agro’d mobs will become agro’d on the main tank. Training the main tank is GUUD.<br>
<br>
Next step is to assess which mob should be selected as the first to die. This mob is very often not the first that the main tank targeted. With the exception of boss mob fights the order is normally:<br>
<br>
Completely magic resistant healers<br>
Completely magic resistant casters<br>
All other completely magic resistant mobs<br>
High magic resistant healers<br>
High magic resistant casters<br>
All other high magic resistant mobs<br>
Melee class mobs starting from lowest hit points to highest (clear the trash)<br>
Low magic resistant casters last (some of you like the free mana pool)<br>
<br>
You will notice dispelling mobs are not listed; these normally fall into one of the resistant categories but if they can be mezzed they should be left for the end of battle.<br>
<br>
All that just happened to pick the first target but it is very rare to have all of these types of mobs in the same place at the same time. Hate is one of the few exceptions which one of the reasons why I dislike raiding Hate so much. Give me Fear any day.<br>
<br>
After the first mob is down, it is time to pick the second. It gets even more involved here. While the raid is fighting the first mob the main tank must be watching for feedback from the raid leader, clerics and mezzers. The main tank is also looking for mobs that have been rooted, more on that later. To the extent possible, the main tank must ignore everyone else. Sending tells or lots of guild chat just makes sorting through the battle spam for information about the next target even harder to find.<br>
<br>
What the main tank is attempting to do during battle is to get a feel for which mezzer is mezzing which mobs, always looking for low on mana calls from the mezzers and cleric while trying to determine which mobs are giving the mezzers difficulty. <br>
<br>
Once the first mob is dead, the main tank must take all of what was learned during the battle and add it to their mob knowledge and pick the next target.<br>
<br>
Now more on rooted mobs. The main tanks should normally avoid any mob that can be mezzed and is rooted. The reason is that a rooted mob will always attacks the player physically closest to it regardless of how much agro another player has built up. This can be anyone from the gnome rogue trying to get in a backstab to the cleric sitting in the middle of the raid trying to med for one last heal. The main tanks will normally leave known rooted and mezzed mobs to the end in the hope that the root will have expired.<br>
<br>
Now it is time to break the mez. The main tank will pick the next target and hail it communicate which will be next to die. Members of the raid can use assist to pick up the target and taunt but must not attack. The skills used to gain agro are taunt, disarm and beg. The number of cycles of these three “taunts” is determined by knowledge of the mob, the number of mez castings and debuffs cast. All that tempered with how much mana mezzers and clerics are declaring, how many players are currently dead and how many mobs are left to kill. Once agro is acquired, the main tank will attack first then declare assist. The rest of the raid must then re-assist to ensure that correct targeting. It is critical that no member of the raid breaks a mez until the main assist calls for ASSIST. The main tank may have switched based on feed back from the mezzers or raid leader. Attacking before the ASSIST message gets more mezzers killed than any other reason on a raid. Now all may attack, never before.<br>
<br>
What is next? Well just rinse and repeat until all mobs are pulp on the ground.<br>
<br>
Now here are some things that make the job tougher and sometimes down right impossible. <br>
<br>
The user interface of EQ is not perfect, no kidding right. The main tank must use the cursor to target. If a gnome were to sit at the feet of an ogre completely out of sight and the ogre uses the cursor to target a mob, the ogre will get the gnome as a target every time. Often even being just slightly in front and to the side of the main tank prevents cursor targeting. If you cannot see the back of the main tank you are very likely to make cursor targeting difficult and sometimes not possible at all.<br>
<br>
Moving forward as the puller approaches the raid all but guarantees that the only method of targeting available to the main tank is F8. And I can tell you that F8 does not consider the life of the puller or mezzers as relevant. Hard agro cannot be cleared and the best target is often missed. Once the raid is on a target, switching it often results in disaster.<br>
<br>
Lots of guild chat and emotes during battle limits the amount of time that the main tank has to read messages from the puller, mezzers and raid leader. Any dual wielding hasted tank has so much personal spam that they only have seconds to read any messages. Any required information must be short and to the point.<br>
<br>
Sending tells normally will distract the attention of the main tank. With very few exceptions, the main tank should ignore all input from anyone except the puller, mezzers clerics and raid leader. During battle if you are not one of these 4, you can help a great deal by saving chat for between battles or keeping it in-group.<br>
<br>
When fighting in tight quarters, identify the direction that the puller will be pulling from and put your back to the opposite wall.<br>
<br>
The more room that the puller and main tank have to work with the more successful they will be doing their job. If a point is identified as the limit the member of the raid should move to, please stick to it. Hate and WW are good examples of that.<br>
<br>
When a mob dies, even if it is the last of the pull, move back into position as if the next pull is seconds away.<br>
<br>
The job of main tank can be exciting, challenging, with lots of responsibility and action. But the job can go from fun to a nightmare in seconds. I take ever death that a mezzer experiences and many cleric and puller deaths as a personal failure on my part. Joking about it especially after someone dies just adds to the frustration. All I’m asking is that people do the little things that make the job easier. <br>
<br>
Now lets go kill stuff!<br>
<br>
<br>
Tinuvil: Har, usstan found something bwael funny as well<br>

<br>
With some enchanters, you DO need to say `mez that`.  With some tanks, you DO need to say `assist please !`.  With some clerics, you DO need to say `heal please !`<br>
