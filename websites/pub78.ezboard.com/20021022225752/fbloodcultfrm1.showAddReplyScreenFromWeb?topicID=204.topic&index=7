     Like i said in my first reply, i did not come here to create problems, basically why I did not mention your name. I also did not come here to make people pick sides. But this post, imo, should have been dealt with you, myself and the GM. But you gave me no choice to fight back. <br>
<br>
    &quot;Well, Ragefire spawn so close to me while I was looting a corpse I was shocked I wasn't aggroed.  I did /w and only 2 non guildmembers were in zone. Jibalk and another person that I forget the name right now. Within minutes we had 2-3 fuill groups at Ragefire spawn&quot;<br>
<br>
     You are saying you were killing wyverns, saw ragefire spawn and did a / and only saw 2 non bc there. (the time you did / only the cleric and yourself were there that were in bc) before them  minutes your crew was not there according to your quote. so lets just say it took them around 4 minutes which seems how long it took for the 3 groups to arrive. <br>
<br>
&quot;We had our groups ready and discussing the tatic.&quot;<br>
<br>
lets say that atleast took a 2 minutes which I know was longer because as I was pulling ragefire more bc started to show up.<br>
<br>
mainly this all adds up to 6 minutes MINIMAL yet It was still myself in zone when we both saw him spawn at the same time? Moving on...<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are taking the time to read this post then please do me a favor. Look at a map of Skyfire Mountains. Look where Ragefire spawns and where the druid ring is that he says his force was at. If you we to pull RF to that ring and I assume around the edge of zone to avoid adds would you kite him all the way up around behind VP to get there quickly? No, it was his intention to hide this mob from us asap since they were not ready. And I ask you this. If he was ready before us then why pull all the way to the druid ring and not just kill him at his spawn point where it is safe from adds. He did this because we were there in force and in his words &quot; was not going to lose RF to BC again&quot;. He said he lost Ragefire spawns because he was on a raid or at work. But they were never his spawns. If you aren't there then it isn't your camp. Somewhere he thinks RF is his camp until he gets it whether there is a server patch and he logs on after another cleric camping it. We had the force there first and were ready to engage first. He decided to kite him away, the long way to buy time and hide the mob.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
   As I was pulling him, did i not give you a specific tell saying that I am pulling it to my crew? infact I did. So Basically you are &quot;assuming&quot; that i was kighting him. IF not, then why did you cast snare on him immidiatly when you saw him? You NEVER bothered to ask me what i was doing with him nor did you even know where i was taking him. So no, you can not tell me that it was a fact that i was kighting him. (which i wasnt) Like i said, My friends were at the druid portal, why did I chose to pull him there and on the zone wall? one, I was on the zone wall because there will be no adds that come along with it (im guessing this is why you thought i was being sneaky) and two, since i did have such a low amount of people I did not want no mistakes hapening. Meaning them running in the middle of a zone filled with danger that could create a death as they running to ragefire, when actually its safer for me to pull behind druid portal without any deaths. (less roamers= safer spot especially with 7 members) sure your members were close to ragefire spawn, (keep in mind they were not even in the zone when he spawned as for my crew also) but that doesnt mean you HAVE to kill him next to the wall. I personally think that spot is the worst to kill him because of the dispellers roaming all around there. Its just like pulling any other mob to a group/raid rather then killing it at its spawn point. IF you read my first post correctly, you will see that I did not say that the spawn belonged to me I was basically saying i had bad luck and finally I got to see him spawn for the first time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He doesn't honor our camp since it has been his for the last month He feels even though there was a server patch and no one was on during it that it is still his camp. He saw Paisley there knowing she was camping RF.<br>
<br>
 WHEN did i specifically tell you that the spawn belonged to me in the first place? You are making me look like a fool. I told you that I have been there for a month and was there even after server patches. Why did i say this? because you told me that i was just a greedy alt. I told you that to basically tell you that I am not greedy at all, and if i had gotten the piece I would deserve it. Please, if you are going to use my quotes use the how they were used.<br>
<br>
 He said nothing assuming that either Paisley would give up and he take over, we wouldn't have the force on line or that he would be faster&quot;<br>
<br>
This works out both ways... Paisley said nothing to me. <br>
I said nothing because i knew saying something about the camp would just start a argument, as i think paisley felt the same with me.<br>

Yes some of you friends were there, but not all of them. I can truely say you didn't have the force to take him as i saw 2 of your guildmates arrive about 10 seconds after me.<br>
Sure, by the time you would have kitted RF to the druid ring your team would have been rdy for the kill (it takes more than 5 minutes to bring a mob to the druid ring from North East even if you take the short cut by the lava lake, which means being invis) but when you pulled you didn't have the forces in zone to kill.<br>
<br>
BC's policy is clear : if you had been rdy for the kill before BC we would have let you engage first.<br>
