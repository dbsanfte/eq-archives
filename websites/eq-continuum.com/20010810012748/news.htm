          be less 'evil' and more user-friendly. I am still toying with some of
          the things that it does.. not sure I am too happy about the
          split-screen for the message board, just remember you can right-click
          and open in new window on the link. I will experiment more... Right
          now I am looking for feedback on the look, the presentation - I am
          aware of the usability issues, and am working on some alternatives.
          Anyway, let me have it for good or bad in the message forum please =)</font></li>

          link back up. Sorry for the interruption of service ... remind me and
          Adammair to MAKE CONSISTENT BACKUPS before attempting any changes...

        <li><font color="#FFFFFF">I fired off a message to someone at Verant regarding the EverQuest
          Status Server protocol. When I get something back, I'll let everyone
          know.&nbsp; Due to the holidays, I don't expect anything soon.
          Hopefully though, when I hear back from them, I will be able to use
          the information to build a server status script. The script used by <font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times"><a href="http://www.eqvault.com">EQ
          Vault</a></font> is proprietary, and I'm guessing that all others are
          as well. I found a public domain one, but it is written in Perl and
          requires a scheduler to run. We don't own this web server, and don't
          have access to the cron, so we can't schedule anything. Besides, I
          think that I might be able to write an in-line script in VBScript or
          JScript that will be dynamic and refresh with the page. I would think
          that would be better for Verant anyway since it will only querry the
          server when someone hits the page, and not every few seconds as most
          other status scripts would. My only other option is to use <a href="http://www.duke.nu/eqserverscan.html">EQ
          ServerScan</a> , pull the information from the logs into a database,
          and script the page to pull from this database. To do that, though, I
          would have to employ the use of my server, and we all know about the
          problems that occur when my IP address changes.</font></li>
