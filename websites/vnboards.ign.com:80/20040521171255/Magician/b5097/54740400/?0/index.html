				When I started EQ before there was any expansions Magicians, Necromancers, Wizards &amp; Druids could all solo.  <br>  <br> Magicians were better at soloing indoors, though many would debate this b/c other class's had heals, root, and best of all feign death. Magicians pets made up the difference. At level 50 a magician could do all of the basic rooms in Lguk. While the harder rooms they could not. Necromancers could if they were careful, so maybe they were the best soloers/shrugs what do I know... I know that a magician pet used to kill Frogs left and right and was my best friend.  <br>  <br> Necromancers such an evil class, blindness/darkness (snare), lifetaps (heals), dots, root, pets, feign death, if a necromancer was great he was basically never dead. If they were dead it was b/c they were trying something insane like soloing a dragon.  <br>  <br> Wizards could root dd, root dd, all day long. I am not quite sure when they got snares but I know they can kite all day long now, Wizards in HoH 4 mobs at a time. <br>  <br> Druids possibly the king/queen of the outdoors if it was snareable (and didn't summon) a druid could kill it. A lot of things indoors they were able to kill as well, root  dot root dot etc. Very powerful. <br>  <br> These 4 class's seamed to be all more or less balanced. Each had there strengths and weaknesses but overall they were all useful, could all solo *almost* equally (quad kiting beats anything but a magician could kill half as fast, and a necro even faster) regardless everyone seamed happy.  <br>  <br> The next update was of course kunark levels 50-60 our pets basically saw no *huge* upgrades many would say they were nerfed to be more in balance so warriors/melee types felt more in place. Magicians still had the reputation of being powerhouses and the new group spells (DS) helped some. Soloing however was a thing of the past. Except in a certain few areas with extreme caution.   <br>  <br> The other class's were basically in line as they had been previously, some becoming even stronger (druids, wizards) while others like the necromancers suffered greatly. Getting repeated spells that were not strong enough, a totally new change on there pets, feign death being nerfed so they couldn't have there pets up more then 2? mins while FD etc. They in large parts stopped depending on there pets and became the wizards of DoT's. They also became very dependent on outdoor zones fully utilizing there darkness/fear kites.  <br>  <br> They next update was of course velious more useless magician spells, but the new gear helped. Magicians could no longer solo things that gave experience but we could kill greens! the other class's still remained about the same as they did in kunark. <br>  <br> Luclin was after, 60th level still being max level but now AA points were introduced as well as focus items. Magicians could once again solo! Not all over but in certain places like Akheva, and if you were really careful or really good at chain casting pets The Grey. A Magician could now solo at least some places thus we were happy! We were still not the powerhouses we used to be in t he old world but the more we killed the stronger we became (go go AA points!) Wizards, druids, etc could quad kite and gain 3-4 times the experience we could in the same amount of time but we could still manage to do better then some (warriors, monks etc) <br>  <br> Then it happened, PoP came out mobs magicians used to hunt quickly became green our new nuke spells are a &quot;You will not evade me&quot; nightmare. 2k+ damage bolt spell with no way to avoid it really. Most used there AA points in spell subtly or whatever its called while others just nuked less or prayed there warriors had better taunts/dps/aggro.  <br>  <br> The days of soloing anything that gave actual experience are over. Our pets got HP upgrades (minimal)! the damage upgrades they received came in the form of summoned weapons you have to arm the pet with. The hp's they needed also came in a spell (summon belt) adds another 500hps to the pet + stats, etc., but is a 64th? level spell. The previous belt isn't worth getting. The second one isn't really worth getting either. The truth of the matter is Pets are now used as DoT's in groups. They are 100% worthless at trying to solo in areas that actually give decent experience. <br>  <br> Heck Ive seen Magicians (65th) try to solo Rats in PoD something we see Druids, wizards, necro's &amp; even Rangers do at level 52+ and loose! Magician pets are eaten so fast we don't know what way is up. To make it worse Sony in all its wisdom has made us totally 100% dependent on these pets. We do not have a Root, snare, etc. Our only choice is to try to chain cast a pet. Sony helped us by adding an AA skill enabling us to bring in a fully buffed and dressed pet into action but the AA cast time is not instant. Its not fun Running around Pod with a mob as fast as your Jboots (or aa skill) using levitational tricks so you can gain a few feet every here and there so you can possibly click this AA skill and pray it lasts long enough so that you can win the fight which generally ends up in people training the zone. <br>  <br> I am not sure who is now in charge of magicians. I know that I have 300+ days played on my magician and I consider myself fairly well dressed. I have 100+ AA points and 4500+ mana. I thought for along time I was doing something wrong so I talked to a magician who is on the HIGH end of the scale. 6000+ mana full elemental gear, right clicks, Ancient spells, 450+ AA points 400+ days played we talked for many hours she too has tried many places to solo and has found it to be totally useless.  <br>  <br> With PoP we lost the ability to solo. Creatures do far too much damage and our pets cannot keep up. We have NO spells except nukes to aid our pets or ourselves. Our Heal spell heals for less then a HoH mob does in two rounds of damage. Yet magicians constantly see wizards, necromancers, druids, and now even rangers killing these mobs constantly. To hit us again Bards too solo in HoH. (as well as other places as they all do) I know a few wizards who make 6 aa points a day EASY solo. The Light blue mobs in the jail in PoJ I can solo if I get one at a time I spent 9 hours down there and gained 1 yellow of aa I thought I was doing good. (ha!) <br>  <br> I am not quite sure what the future of EQ holds. But I know they constantly ask us questions on surveys, all of which are &quot;click here&quot; Just once I would like to get ahold of someone who KNOWS something and make there ears ring with stuff they should have never let happen. Let alone things they should fix &amp; change. <br>  <br> Everquest continuously forces people to group. If you want to kill anything worth while join a Uber guild. B/c your going to need 50+ active full time players to get to the top. With the realize of 60th+ levels and more directly PoP there is no place for old magicians like myself who like to sit back and kill mobs alone all night.  <br>  <br> What I find even more disturbing is that after 4 years EQ doesn't understand that the fun of EQ isn't how hard can we program EQ monsters. The Fun of EQ is killing monsters period. Being with your friends, &amp; the sense of getting ahead while doing so (loot). Right click potions that full heal and Mana potions too, Have Magicians be able to summon 900 pets and solo all of Wtov, who cares? He is having fun and the monsters will regenerate in 30mins or less. Yet I can see the problem with the named in Ntov etc. Guess what? the answer isn't to make it so the magician (or necro or wizard or warrior or whomever cannot kill whatever they want) its to make it so that the Named and ALL creatures respawn at a MUCH faster rate. (like 45mins) Then we can Kill all we want all the time and always be happy! Vs writing a stupid E-mail bitching how poorly sighted Everquest's visionary team is.  <br>  <br> Guess what, I am a strong believer if 900 people kill 1 mob (named) that the mob should drop 900 parts of loot too. But I'm just a depressed everquest junky what do I know.  <br>  <br>
