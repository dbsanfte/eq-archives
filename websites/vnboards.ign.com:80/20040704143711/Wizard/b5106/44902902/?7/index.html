				 I've played EQ since the beginning and am still playing  and have 2 accounts and have played nearly every character to at least 40.Needless to say i really like EQ it has done especially in its beggining what almost no other game has.MMOLRPG is now in full swing and EQ I believe still shines brightly,EQ2 is on the horrizon and I am gonna jump to it cause the beginning of games are simply the best of times and really cant be explained.Imagine this you are a level 13 warrior or ranger and your wearing a full set of banded and are duel weilding mino axes or dwarven axes.You were the man!LMAO,that now is such low grade newbie gear i woud rather be naked then to take it with a new alt.Anyway,I would just like to say Wizards have been royaly shafted.You may disagree but youd be wrong.At least in EQ they have been shafted,if you played one in just about any other game I think youd see why I say this.Check out the explanation in any dictionary for a wizard and see if that has any similarities to what Verrant or Alan,Abashi and the other creators have created.At best we are ok,great soloers for quading(if you have to right gear)great at DPS and speed of spells,quite frankly one of the best if not the best traveler in the game.If im missing any other strength let me know.Now describe a EQ wizard.IMHO we are the crazy thirst for power dd seekers.That to me describes someone who is lacking wit knowledge and intelligence all of wich a wizard is known for.I've played alot of rpgs not all of them and all mainly before eq so dont tell me about all these new games like daoc or ac if anything they would most likely coppy and try to improve apon what eq has done.Im also not trying to rant but realize that yeah it kinda is but just dont call this class a wizard cause its not,this class lacks different spell types and spell skills.One dimensional and if you like that thats good but its still not a wizard,neither is what the describe when you create one,it states being something of a master of defencive magic.Thats a big fat lie unless stun and root are the defence but thats hardly any mastery of defence.You got your skins and most of them in base pre kunark and beyond where nothing special they just now got spell sheild wich is ok and manaskin,dont talk about epics cause not everyone has one.Besides that if im not mistaken its one of the hardest to get.I like how NWN and or D&amp;D describe a wizard in battles,a warrior can defeat a foe quickly in a fight,a wizard can defeat many foes quickly in a fight.You start out weak and become rather powerful in the end.Lets take D&amp;D cause im sure EQ did when they created the game and developed the characters ect..For simplicity lets just look at the casters.Magic User(Wizard)some may say magician but in the end you become a wizard so in that this class is clearly the wizard.Illusionist(EQ's enchenter).From the Magic User class they created 3 classes wich wouldnt be all bad except one thing they gave tons of magic user spells to the illusionist class leaving little for the 3 they created (necro magician and wizard).Necromancer is a great class if you ever played one youd agree this is nice,some improvements could be made but you are defined as using spells dealing with death pretty good spell line,very nice pet,manna regen and life regen spells also nice touch not much shabby about them they should have level drain spells for you in the end if not earlier though and some other cool things.Enchanters,clearly get the good end of the grouping stick,spells dealing with ones thoughts and mins attacks are clearly what should be and is your main attacks but you get much more,haste,slow,stun to name a few and i only name stun cause its the best caster one bar none.Magicians,you are almost as shafted as wizards only real difference is your ablility to summon a champ of a elelmental pet.Only when aoe come into play are you really mildly behind wizard.You already read what i wrote on the wizard class so i wont rewrite it,thing is we got he scraps of the Magic User class and whats so ridiculous is there is pelnety of great spells that coulda been implemented to wizards, magicians a few more neat ones for enchanters and necros and kept the game balanced.I didnt believe it in the beginning but i do now,the makers of the game/classes hated magic users(wizards).They are bias to their own product and not giving a complete package to paying customers when its clear they must just hate us or be holding some kinda grudge.I say put all that aside and create some new spells with thought and creativity.Its funny but i wrote a whole slew of new ideas on spells quite a while back ahd some good stuff like dot lines of spellls crowd controll some impressive new dammaging ones too.One I called Catastrophy is now Manna Burn and i commend it, its great but not to be used for everything it makes us have some wow power but really the other spells were just as good if not better.Im sure I wasnt the only one with a idea of unresistable DD using ones manna my goal in that was to have something better than dragon and giant raid type spells my though was on someone having capabilites of 5000 dammage they even exceeded this with aa ablilties making it be even better and capable of really blowing the socks off something.I hope EQ2 makes the wizard right or calls it the kamakazie caster if it stays,really i do like the eq wizard but again it lacks where it should be strong,groups or solo we should be wanted if not desired and if not so group desired we should be better solo equiped.Wizard huh? our most intelligent thing we do as the smartest class is determine  how long before launching the warhead.E gads we are absolute Einsteins.Without special gear we should be both group friendly and soloable,we arent you need sow or j boots or a sum of cash for all the peridots your gonna waste.Things we should have but dont,a dot spell or line of dot spells could replace the alkabor line np.Balance you may say and who needs dots you say.We do quite simply and here is why it gives a alternative to dd for one and a chance to med while the dammage is being done it can also improve our DPS per fight wich is in effect smart.Some spells should have a unresistable  part to them other part should be element dammage,take ice commet(this should be moved to level 65 as it was intended to be the ball of wax for wizards anyway but too late).It is cold yes but for gods sake its a commet.The commet should be unresistable and add in cold dammage if it were not resisted same for ice spear and any other classes spells wich have a object of unresistable preportions.Unless your telling me you can resist a comet id like to see you try, our planet couldnt unless it were so tiny it burned in the almosephere.I realize its a fantasy game but only thing i see as fantasy is these guys ideas sometimes.I mean we got barbarian rogues,why not ogre rogues, small agile nimble that decribes a barbarian perfect.Trolls should be one of the best foes instead of playable races.They took magic weapons to hit regen was so good you werent supposed to be able to kill them unless by spell,fire ,acid or something like that but they get really none of these bonuses except regen.They should of opted for half orc but oh well trolls are cool but should be the enemy.Dammage sheilds should be up there with the best i dont see why they gave us what they did however the fire resist is nice but again seems to me most mobs fight with magic based spells not sure why but that seems to be the preference.Crowd controll,now before you go thats chanter stuff hog wash it was always wizard line thats just one that was also given to chanters besides how many special powers should one class have above the rest?1 I say and then they should balance the rest of the powers with the rest of the classes in that field,meaning chanters can be the best cc but dont have to be the only our best is dd,they got dd so whos taking whos ,were just getting shafted is all,we dont have any cc besides root wich isnt designed for cc its a alternative.We dont have to use mind controll for crowd controll anyway we can use a element or alteration type spell.Here is some suggestions for a cc wizard spell or spells.Freeze-encases a target in a ice pillar for a ext period of time.Gaze-you gaze at a target petrifying them for a extended period of time.Imprisonment-you sent a target to another dimension for a period of time unless dispelled.TIME STOP-(this is my favorite and most appropriate anyway)while we cant actually do it correctly by stopping time around us we can go the alternate way and stop time for the targeted mob thus freezing it in time for a duration allowing for dammage to be done even while under the spells effects,could get this at 50 and say the time delay gets better per level and at level 60 youd get a improved version being the AoE Time Stop.A area effect root would be nice too.Concusion, cool idea but i think it could be inserted in the yonder series.Those are useless and dangerous anyway but as a concusion type spell they could serve a purpose and be approriate.Take the range of of the line down dramatically so youd most likely stay in the same room and put concusion added to it when you cast.So when a mob comes to crack your butt but you dissapear how is it supposed to track you down anyway he should go to the next player or back to the tank(s) because he just wiffed and has no clue where you are ,kinda like a caster evade.There are 3 yonder type spells and ech should inprove concusion type effects 1st 100pts 2nd 300 3rd 500,thats my opinion but i think its right since we dont have a pet this could allow a wizard to be much more free and not worry about casting so much wich is how a wizard should act anyway.Every caster class should get a form of the clarity spell at 50 and a upgrade at 60 or so ,or learn to med standing making sitting double med time this would cut downtime and make all casters more battle ready.HOw about combination spells?Meaning  think of a nuclear reaction.Take a gaseous dot,add a fire dd dot or whatever BOOM!.Double your output from mixing elements.Liting the gas ablaze making the dot do double dammage and the explosion should do 2 times the dammage as the original as well,kinda neat if it were made.Say the dot was 650 and the dd was 650 both would turn to 1300 for a possible 2600.Manna efficiant and smart.Not much more time so ill end.Lets recap I dont hate the wizards i just dont think they got their fair share of different spells and are not really wizards but crazy mind bent on destructive power casters. <br>  <br> Spells suggested: <br> Freeze-single target crowd controll <br> Gaze-same <br> Imprisonment- same <br> Time Stop-Single target stops time for the mob and allows dammage while under the influence of the spell till its duration. <br> (my favorite)  <br>  <br> Resilient Sphere-unbreakable magic spere not allowing the  surrounded to do or recieve dammge till its dispelled or wears off.(just thought of that one too) <br>  <br> DoT line of spells-ranging from 50dot level10 to 1000 level 60 1500 level 65. <br>  <br> Change Yonder spell line-add concusion to the line of 3 spells reducing 100 for the 1st 300 for 2nd and 500 for the last and reduce the range of mini teleport so to stay within a room <br>  <br> Give all casters the ablility to cast clarity at level 50 and a upgrade at 60 <br>  <br> Dammage Sheilds-should be up with other classes and group buffable <br>  <br> Unresistable Elements in spells-Ice Commet for instance make 1 part cold the other part commet(unresistable dammage) <br>  <br>  <br> wish I had more time I dont think anyone reads these anymore anyway.Lets hope eq2 is as fun as eq and good hunting wizards of norrath. <br>

				Sorry for the runon paragraph.I didnt intend to even rant,I was actually just thinking of some new spells that could give us a bigger and useful aresenal. <br> When I kept thinking of how we are as a class and what we do I changed the name of the topic and just posted lol,it was a bit much but I think it was right.I dont picture a wizard as a quad kiter but more of a quad destroyer.Druids were meant to kite thats their nature.All the movies and whatever included a wizard I never seen a champoin 100 yard dasher,they were usually old frail men but extremely smart and wise.They used their intelligence to win fights not running around in circles hoping their internet connection doesnt give out on them. <br>  What I was asking for was 1 a dot line of spells replacing the alkabor line ranging from 50 (level 10) to 1500 (level 65).The dammage over time spell series for us could give us lots of options and really increase some dammage per second ratios. <br>  Put concussion in the yonder line and lowwer its distance so you stay in the same room. <br>  Make certain spells have unresistable elements like Ice Commet.The commet should be unresistable and the cold dammage should be resistable ext. <br>  Give a crowd controll spell type wich doesnt deal with mind spells like enchanters.I thought Time Stop would be a great idea,whereas you target something cast on it and its would be susspended in time till the duration of the spell wore off and open for attack while susspended(level 50).A area effect one at (level 60). <br>  I said something about dammage sheilds should be a bit better but that doesnt matter,although I did think of another good idea.When we cast a spell and gets resisted we gain agro on a monster.We didnt do any dammage to it but its still pissed at us for the threat of what we could have done.Why is that not so with mele? I think the mele should gain agro with misses as well as with the hits for the threat it imposed on the monster.This could make it easier for the meles to hold agro for casters such as us and all other casting healing types. <br>  Again,sorry for the original long rant but just wanted to post some new ideas,good hunting.
