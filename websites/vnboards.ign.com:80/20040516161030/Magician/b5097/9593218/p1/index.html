				This is a petition.  A petition that verant actually fix and improve the mage class, as they havent been fixed or improved since beta (I played a mage in beta 3). <br>  <br> Many of you on the tribunal server, prexus, lanys tvyl, rallos zek, and test might have talked to me, as for the last 2 weeks I have been spending quite a bit of EQ time going around to these servers (chosen randomly, except for tribunal which I play on) to discuss the problems with fellow mages and see if all mages were agreed on them.  Thus far I have a list of over 40 mages who have heard in depth all of which I will outline in this message, and all 40 mages were in complete agreement with the problems at hand.  Only 2 mages out of the 45+ that I talked to had any dispute about any of the problems - not all of them - but merely one or two.  I would also like to take this chance to appologize to all of the mages I have bothered in-game about this, as most people dont log on to have some stranger start talking to them about thier class for 10 minutes while they should be helping thier group kill monsters. <br>  <br> I will first outline the problems as both I and the mages I've talked to see them, and will then post proposed solutions below by problem #. <br>  <br> Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks... <br> This is one of the biggest problems with mages, both in combat (soloing especially), and in travelling (which is half of the game).  The problem is quite simple - a mage gets aggrod on by a monster: 1) he has a pet to defend himself, in which the pet can eventually taunt the monster off of the mage so the mage can either help his pet kill the monster or he can get a head start running to zone -OR- 2) he has no pet to defend himself, in which case he also has no way to get the monster off of him, and so he dies.  This is a huge problem, mages are the ONLY class that have no means to evade a monster that is aggrod on them while they are perhaps just running through a zone, or fighting a monster that just WILL NOT taunt onto his/her pet.  Necros have snare (darkness), root at 34, shadow step, and feign death - by all means a good necro should never die.  Enchanters have root, stuns, mezmerize, memory wipes, charms...the list goes on...enchanters are the best at getting an aggrod monster off of them, whether it be when travelling through a zone or in a fight gone bad.  Wizards have snare and root, starting at lvl 4 - this is thier bread and butter, they also have stuns, so wizards are by all means quite capable of travelling anywhere without risk and ensuring that they can get away from a monster if they end up in a fight gone bad.  Dictating whether or not you should stay and fight/die or run and live is half of the game, so it is a big deal.  However for mages, we do not have that choice, we stay and die, end of story. <br>  <br> Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper! <br> This problem has arisen from the fact that mage summon spells havent changed since beta, and all the equipment in norrath certainly HAS.  In beta, when a tank was on a corpse run, he might ask me for 2 swords of runes so that he might fight off anything that aggros him along the way.  Back then, this weapon was quite adequate, it still isnt as good as fine steel, and although it is the mages best summoned weapon, it is still good enough to give to a person in need (heck, a rusty sword is better then nothing, right?).  Mage weapons are useless, we only summon them for necro pets and recently our own pets (mages pets used to be unable to wield weapons), and still, they are only summoned to make our pets look &quot;neater&quot;...they dont actually help them much, if at all (I have seen absolutely no difference, so I will continue to believe, until I see some actual implemented code, that weapons do not do a single thing but make the pet look different).  Mages can summon food, drink, bandages at 4, a useless pouch at 8, infravision stone at 16 (until then, erudites and humans, you are blind), water breathing stone at 24, more food and drink at 24, ultravision stone at 29, finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39, and a modulating rod at 44.  Not exactly masters of conjuration if you ask me: we are the only caster class that is unable to enhance vision until 16, the items we summon give us effects that should be available at half the lvl in which we recieve them (who needs levitate at 39? at 20 it would be useful, at 39 its just something more we can summon for newbies who dont even thank us).  Also, I just outlined everything a mage can summon...that isnt much you say, and no, its not...the infravision and ultravision stones are useful only to erudite or human mages, the water breathing stone is mostly unused, the levitation ring at the level which we recieve it is not even useful anymore, bandages are good, food and drink is good to have, those pouches are useless - too small and you cant even put most items into them, and the modulating rod...well, better thought of then it actually is. <br>  <br> Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again? <br> This has been a problem since beta, however it wasnt as much of a problem back then, as the rest of the classes hadnt been so highly enhanced and improved yet, and the monsters hadnt been tuned up and buffed.  Back in beta, a mage was actually a foe to reckon with.  Our pets were almost on par with necro pets, our DD spells were sufficient, our AE spells were nice to have (although unusable now), and at least half of the items we summoned were actually useful.  Sadly, this game is all about hack and slash, thats all there is to this game, and although verant has implemented this hack and slash ideollogy (sp?) in a manner which it is much more entertaining then the normal diablo clone, it is still hack and slash.  If your class doesnt have sufficient means to dispatch monsters with, then your class is useless...I could care less if you can cast clarity, sow, all the buffs in the game, heals, etc....if you cannot kill monsters solo your class is group dependant and thus you can no longer just log on and play the game, you must log on and try to find a group before your time runs out and you have to log off.  A mage has 1 way to kill monsters.  Direct damage spells and his/her pet.  That is all we have.  Now, our DD spells are supposedly second only to wizard...this is untrue during most of the game (lvl 1 to 60).  We also have a few AE spells.  However, AE spells only get us killed, and so they are useless (and mana inefficient to begin with). <br> So, the first issue with this problem is mage pets.  Mage pets, every single one of them, can be easily taken out by a necro pet of same level.  Throw into this equation the mage pet being buffed by the mage burnout, fire shielded by the mage fire shield, and given the best weapon the mage has: the necro pet will still win.  I have tried this duel every lvl of the game, as I have previously played a lvl 50 mage along with a lvl 50 necro all the way to 50.  I have also tried pretty much every pet at every level (I had to do some of the duels for lvl 24 through 44 pets when I was in fact 50 and could actually research the pets we could not buy).  Mages should summon the most fearsome pets on norrath, we are afterall CONJURATION MASTERS, are we not?  Mage pets should be bar-none able to out-tank, out-damage, and out-taunt any other pet of the same level in the game.  Our pets should have more HP, more armor class (our pets get hit for max damage by mobs of same level as them), more attack rating, more strength/dexterity so that they hit harder, land more of thier hits, and can actually take some damage.  Mage's pet's spells (root, gust of air, burst of fire, slash of ice) are also more of a burden then a good thing, as they resist 99% of the time, they require the pet to sacrifice a round of combat (where they could be missing the target in melee instead), and they cause the pet to stand still and allow the monster chasing us to get ahead of them (most solo fights invole the mage running from the monster, and the pet trying to keep up hitting it from behind trying to taunt it).  I do think that pet's spells were a good idea, however they were not implemented correctly.  If verant wishes to keep this good idea of thiers, they should at least FIX it.  Make pet's spells unresistable to monsters up to 8 levels above the pet (ie: halfway to our next spell lvl, white monsters cannot resist our pet's spells).  Also, do not make our pets sacrifice a round of combat to cast the spell, implement it as a proc (with a very high proc rate) instead to allow them to continue hitting (otherwise, for example, our earth pet sits there and casts root 6 times in a row and every time it resists, which accomplished absolutely nothing except make the monster hate the mage more since the pet isnt taunting or doing damage).  Pet's spells in fact do not do much, the root obviously does some good (allowing the mage to flee), and the gust of air obviously does some good (it stuns the monster, ie: allowing the mage to flee), but they resist so much that I would much rather not have them at all the way it is right now. <br> The next issue with this problem is mage DD and AE - our only other asset besides our weak little pets.  Mage DD spells are NOT second only to wizard.  Mage DD spells are only a few points higher then necro DD spells, they are sometimes even less then enchanter DD spells, and even druids have a higher DD then mages for half of the game (ie: 1 through 50).  Mage DD and AE spells SHOULD be second only to wizard, EVERY level of the game, WITHOUT question whatsoever.  That doesnt mean that we should do 1 MORE point of damage then the necro, enchanter, and druid spells of any specific level, it means we should do 20, 50, 80 points LESS then the wizard spell of that specific level.  Mage DDs at level 29 for example, 176 damage, versus necro DD at 24, 160 damage.  We should be doing about 200 DD at level 29, more in line with the wizard's DD of 250 at that level.  We still arent as mana efficient - by far, and we still dont do as much damage, and we still cant cast our DDs as fast - this keeps wizards out in the front by far in direct damage (especially with wizard spells being less resistable). <br> Also, our AE spells should be pumped up a bit.  The way I see it, although wizard SHOULD be the master of dealing damage in anyway spellwise, mages are tuned for AE spells.  We throw rains of fire down over our pets wreaking havoc on the monsters he is taunting away from us - that is what a mage should be like - that is what verant says a mage is - that is very very far from the truth. <br> Our malise line of spells, it should have the same resistance check as tashan, it is the same kind of spell, and the shamans have been petitioning this for almost a year now. <br>  <br> ###################################### <br> Proposed solutions <br> ###################################### <br> Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks... <br> Mages are masters of conjuration and masters of the elements.  Our post lvl 50 class names are even &quot;Elementalist&quot; and &quot;Conjurer&quot; so if verant even disputes this, they have proven how mentally ill they are.  Snare and root come straight from the earth element.  We should have both of these spells.  We should have single target root, single target snare, AE root, and AE snare.  Mages should have these spells starting at either lvl 4 or 8 and they should correspond to about the same level that any other class gets the spells.  This would give us a way to evade monsters, a way to be more helpful to our group, and it would actually finally give mages what they were meant to have - mastery of the element: earth. <br>  <br> Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper! <br> I already know that verant has admitted to this problem, so I wont go into too much detail as I have faith in thier abilities, and hope they have already come up with some solutions.  Basically it is simple, every weapon a mage summons is useless at the level he/she is able to summon it.  Back when there were level 40s wielding well-balanced and fine steel weapons, and that was normal and &quot;good&quot; equipment for thier level, mage weapons were not all that bad.  However, now, they are rusty short swords.  The items a mage summons are also useless and very limited.  We should be able to summon items that give us any desired effect in the game.  I would even go so far as to say we should be able to summon sow rocks (1 charge stones alike that of the water breathing stone that click to give us sow equivalent to [(our level) - (level we recieved sow rock)].  For example if we recieved the sow rock spell at 20, at lvl 20 we would summon a lvl 1 sow rock spell (equivalent to lvl 9 shaman sow).  We are also the only class that has no means to regenerate mana faster.  We are the ONLY caster class that just has to sit and meditate every point of our mana the hard way.  This should not be so, especially since our DDs are mana inefficient, and our summons cost a huge amount.  We should be able to summon a &quot;breeze fan&quot; at level 20 (4 levels after enchanter breeze), and a &quot;clarity rod&quot; at level 34 (5 levels after enchanter clarity).  These items would be one charge items, alike all other mage summoned items, that will give the appropriate and corresponding level of a &quot;breeze&quot; and &quot;clarity&quot; type spell.  This will hopefully negate the hard fact that mages have the longest downtime of any caster.  Now, I realize you are all perhaps thinking I am crazy to think that mages should recieve sow.  However, think about this, what do mages have that one of the 3 other caster classes dont?  We can summon food and drink...thats about it.  We should be able to conjure items that give us any desired effect we want, why not give our class something unique? Actually give us what was promised?  Its definitely not something mages dont deserve, afterall, it falls completely in line with what our profession is, so why not actually fix our class? <br>  <br> Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again? <br> Mage pets should be the best pets in norrath.  That is our calling, to be able to summon beings of great power to do our bidding.  We are not enchanters that merely animate inanimate objects, we are not necromancers that reanimte dead corpses or control the essence of bones, we summon actual beings from the planes of the elements.  They have names, they have personalities, they are our friends and companions.  Mage pets should have much higher AC, mage pets should NOT get hit for the same amount of damage as the mage him/herself gets hit for.  Mage pets should have more HP, as a mage, your heal pet spell is one spell that MUST be memorized AT ALL TIMES, otherwise your pet dies and there goes another summon stone (and usually a bit of exp too, since you die next).  Pet healing spell should be for emergencies, it shouldnt be a neccessity.  Right now I am playing a level 30 mage, and to even try and solo low blues/high greens I have to heal my pet at least twice or it WILL die.  The process of a fight with mage solo right now usually goes like this: burnout on pet, fire shield on pet, malise or nuke moster to pull, send pet on it, run around in circles until pet can taunt monster, sit and med for 10 sec, heal pet, nuke, heal pet, sit and med for 10 sec, nuke, heal pet, nuke, by now mana is all gone, so I either die or I am victorious with at the most 20% mana left and a pet that has at the very most 40% of his life.  Then I sit and meditate and go grocery shopping or run some errands, because it takes that long to meditate back to full, and without full mana you cannot solo monsters that give anything near good experience, especially since mage has such a high experience penalty.  In groups where our pets arent the tanks, we dont have this problem too often, but we are still not very useful in a group.  Personally I would rather have a necro, enchanter, wiz, druid, shaman, or just another good tank in my group then another mage.  We are weak, and we are mostly useless. <br>  <br>  <br> And this was one heck of a long post...so my parting words will be that if you are a fellow mage, help our petition out, because I know you know the burdensome task we have at just being able to play.

				as i am the 2nd non-anon poster and 4th poster i feel kinda pissed off.  i am willing to bet that both of those anons are NOT mages, did NOT read the entire post, and have NO idea what it is like to play a mage.  they probably play a useful group class or a feasible solo class.  as i am not yet i high level character (16) i can only attest to 2 points: <br>  <br> 1) summons are useless <br>  <br>   a. our summon spells for items are not needed whatsoever - even for our pets <br>  <br>   b. our pets suck in comparison to necros - this one really hits home because that is really what makes me a mage and the fact that a reanimated corpse could be stronger than an elemental being is ludicus (sp?) <br>  <br> 2) no way to kill things <br>  <br>   a. the only time i ever get a decent group is when i am playing with friends, the other times i am playing with uber twinks who would rather have a wizard or necro <br>  <br>   b. soloing is way to hard for the class that is supposed to have a built in tank to protect us <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> id just like to add also that the lack of root snare makes no sense either. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> i see from your signiature that you have played 4 mages, so i am definetly valuing your opinion and those of others cannot truly be valued.

				Mage pets can be beat by necro pets?  You could not be more wrong.  I play on Rallos.  Any of my pets can spank any necro pet, and the fire pet can beat any other class's pet so bad it's absolutely embarassing to them.  The fire pet's damage shield is more damage than their pet's max hit.  And if you're saying this, I have to question all of you other supposed research about where we stand. <br>  <br> You asked for everything but the kitchen sink.  Clarity, SoW, root, snare.  Might as well go ahead and add Ice Comet, Flying Kick, and Complete Heal.  If they give us all of that stuff, what point would there be in anyone being anything but a mage?

				While I agree that we should have SOME kind of way to either evac ourselves (other than gate) or slow a mob down (other than our pet) like all other casters do, I basically agree with what you said, Vdir.  I fought a yellow necro once (I also play on Rallos), and it was laughable.  He attacked, and of course both our pets went into play fighting each other (as they always do).  He began piling on DOTs, I stood there and cast Cancel Magic over and over.  Then my pet finished his off, and the last I saw of him was his scrawny gnomish tail heading for the hills ...  =) <br>  <br> Too bad I didn't have my earth pet out; he'd not have escaped.  ^.~

				Sow stones? Rod of clarity? LOL!  Thats good.  In EQ, the measure of a good character is not how well they solo (even though I find soloing with my mage to be pretty easy)  If you want a &quot;balanced&quot; world where everyone is the same and has the same abilities, try UO.   <br> In any case, although I've only been a magician for 16 levels, I love it.  Sure at the levels where me pet is weak I need a partner or group, but at the levels when pet is new I totally dominate!  Evens out if ya ask me.   <br> You do have a good point about the weapons though.  As far as I can tell, other than providing newbie necromancers with a small advantage, they are pointless.  Only weapon I would find useful is Summon Arrows at 20.. but thats because I partner with a Ranger a lot.  And the easy access to bandages reduces downtime and saves mana for everyone in my group.  But thats about the extent of it.  For the most part I don't even waste money on new weapon spells.  Staff of Warding?  O please I'll keep my steins thanks.   <br>  <br> ~Worty~ <br> aka Moichido the Mage <br>  <br>

				I will agree with your travel post and battle post we are pretty much screwed there. I saw a difference at lvl 30 when I could start casting in toe to toe combat with less interupts but hey by then you do most of your travel via a druid or a wizzy, and those mobs dont even aggro anymore. For awhile lvl 8-30 my main transportation was invis and let me tell you, verant did their best to make this spell as unreliable as possible. Can you say WTF is invis good for? <br>  <br> Masters of Conjuration? Coldstone, bandaids, Cornacopia, Everfont, Ring of Flight, and shard of the core are the only spells I make use of.   <br> &lt;hows that for sick, I can fit that all on one line&gt;  I aggree with there be anymore, I mean I was greatfull for the shard spell, but trully, can we get summon a stone that will give us shadow step, a root that will root or snare, maybe a globe that can cast flash that will do a blindness spell.  <br>  <br> As for that Call of the Hero or whatever the name of that spell that summons group member. That spell is way to high. IMHO we should be getting that spell around lvl 34, but who am I to question the all mighty Verant. <br>  <br> I have no clue how someone can say our pets suck? As well if you want a group go get one. I host dungeon crawls, and lower dungeon raids all the time. When I want to group in a zone for exp, I start one. You just have to know how to orgainize groups. Most all classes will come to you out of neccessity for exp.

				One more thing on the pets when I was lvl 36 I was grouped with a lvl 40 necro. We were passing time in FOB waiting for a full group for Kaesora. A lvl 24 monk came up to us and wanted to see how he could fare against our unbuffed pets. He was able to kill the necro pet in the first battle and had maybe a bubble left in health. He was a mean little twink. Then he went against my water elemental. I had to call it off before he died and the pet had over half of his health left.  ANY QUESTIONS?

				Look..I have been playin' a mage off and on for a year (lvl 50 now..should be 60..but college got in the way)..and mages have gotten screwed...yes our pets can beat a necro pet..but I'm sorry..we are raped by their dots (you talk about cancel magic..bud..higher up necros have some of the nasiest shit you can imagine (disease, poison, etc))...shamans rape us with dots..druids rape us (yes I use rape cause that is what it is)..every caster class makes us its bitch..our pet should be buffed up...we should get at least snare or root (every other damn class gets it) or mez. or fear or something like that..i don't mind the lack of sow or transport..I buy ports and use jboots...hell I don't mind the dd all that much..all I really want is a snare or something..and a pet that will last a bit longer (AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD VERANT FIX THE PATHING!!!!!!!!!)

				Yes, EVERY CLASS, other than magicains have some form of snare/root/mez.  Melee class either can cast it or proc it like a normal spell with their weapons. Caster classes, well just name one that cant cast one of these spells. This is not a big request, just a little equality. Magicians are the only class that once caught by the aggro of an angry mob in the open during traveling, WILL be raped.   <br> Dont tell me. This is part of Verants vision. Magicain will not travel freely through norath without the assistance of another player class. This way we will have to group at least.  GIVE ME A BREAK.

				It's obvious that mage pets are better than necro pets for the last several months.  I didn't think people still believe that necro pets are better than mage pets.  But hey, I was talking to a necro the other day who was telling me the mage epic pet is comparable to the necro 59 spectre pet.   <br>  <br> Though traveling has never been a problem for me.  Gate/invis have always worked fine for me.  Most things don't see through invis when running and if you're worried summon the pet, it's only 200 mana before 51.  If you can't gate from one mob when starting at full health w/o a pet then you should really get your channeling skill maxed.  With a 200+ channeling skill I can always get gate off from one mob unless they are a monk or rogue mob and I can still usually get it off from two mobs before they kill me.  Sure, it may be a pain in the ass to go back to your bind point but it's much better than dying. <br>  <br> The truth is: <br> 1) Mage pets are very strong, clearly the best pets in the game.  We have the best pet designed buffs. <br>  <br> 2) Mages are the masters at conjuration.  We can summon the most things and the best things out off all the classes.  Hell, even half our DDs are conjuration based. <br>  <br> 3) Mages have the 2nd best DDs in the game.  Our DDs are better than every other classes DDs except for wizards whether it be from mana/dmg, recast time, casting time, etc. <br>  <br> 4) Mages can solo very well. <br>  <br> 5) Mages don't need a root/snare spell.  For soloing reasons the earth pet is good enough for root and for traveling keep a pet out or travel invis.  Once I throw on malisement my earth pet lands a root around half the time maybe more.  With it being casted every 6 - 8 seconds it's pretty good.  Not to mention you shouldn't be chaining all your nukes anyway.  Wizards and clerics are the only casters in the game without pets, you don't see them complaining.  Even shadowknights get pets. <br>  <br> Yes I agree some of our spells are given out at a ridiculous level.  Valiant Companion should be a bit lower.  Maybe 46 - 50, not 59.   <br>  <br> The only things that mages should recieve in my opinon are:  <br> 1) Upgrade to the pet heal spell.    <br> 2) Improved invis  <br> 3) A charm summoning spell, not for power reasons just it makes sense. <br>  <br> Overall though, the magician is not a weak class.  No class is, they're all pretty balanced.  Are we underpowered?  No.  Are we underestimated?  Yes

				i have to respond to that if you are caught without pet deal.  ever ran through a zone as a melee class?  guess what?  you get caugt at higher levels or even lower levels by an even or yellow mob = dead. <br>  <br> no spells to save you, no gate, etc. <br>  <br> in reference to that first post again:  the useless pouch at level 8 offers weight reduction.  not a big deal?? well, with 55 str i think it is a big deal.  granted with my barb rogue, not so much.   <br>  <br> I am loving my magician (still new to it though).  pets kick ass and can solo a warrior of equal level.  <br>  <br> i agree with some of these other posts that this guy just wants the uber class.

				I dissagree with the person who plays the melee class and thinks that getting caught by a mob is bad... You have WEAPONS? whats a petless mage going to do? beat the mob to death with a book? or cup for that matter? all a mage can do is lay down and try not to bruise his/her attacker. I Have something to say about this dueling Necro pets altho we may not be beaten all the time (most mages dont want to admit this) We are beaten! and even if we arent' Necros just fear and then root are pet off into the boonies and leave us defenseless so the Necro pet can interrupt our casting thats when you once again take up the fetal position and wait for the bright light. Master of What? the only summon spells i have used the last 10 levels are Summon food &amp; water, summon arrows, and my pet's summon spells. Granted i haven't lead the most adventurous 10 levels but it is scarey traveling as a Mage, and I dont want to hear about taking a TP or TL, that's commonly 50pp on Xegony!! three trips a day and your outside FreePort with your Stien of Mogguk collecting coins. &lt;takes a deep breath&gt; About the Clarity thing... Druids? have their own kind of Clarity can't remember what its called right now tho, Shaman, canabalize I &amp; II, Necros, have that spell that changes Hps into mana and they can replace the hps with life tap and those kind of spells, then theres wizards who now have two kinds of mana regeneration that mana strand thing and that stupid mage pet fake-out familiar that acts as a buff and mana regen. THAT! really eerks me the fact that they conjure something Lol i'm being a little to protective of my class.. I'll just move on. Enchanters... have clarity. Cleric's! are the only ones that don't have a way to get back mana (and of course I choose to inflick myself with playing one of those too). Mages have the second best DD in the game 3 fastest casting rate of those DD's and you're only better but 18hps.... &lt;faints&gt; but sinces you cast slower you actually can't take advantage of those eightteen whole hitpoints. Snare or root would also be good, it's just way to expensive and time consumming to be resummoning your pet Everytime you zone and even with your pet, a mage pets taunt is bordering on pathetic... and without a pet, mages are like a naked high elf standing Nek forest. This one mage put into words what i have been thinking for a long time and just haven't had the ambition to say anything and I too have been playing since April 1999. As of now i'm just playing my mage out of habit, i know that sounds weird but playing that long you make friends and ...blah blah <br>  I Hope Verant reads this and actually does something it would just make my day Lol

				It's obvious you mages have very little clue about other classes.  You seem to think like you have it so bad, and all other classes are like gods.   <br>  <br> Since you mentioned Mage vs Necro duels, let's look at the Enchanter in duels versus any other class.   <br>  <br> You cast the Tishania spell, &lt;so and so&gt; looks around nervously.   <br> &quot;You cast the &lt;insert name&gt; spell!  Your spell is resisted!&quot;   <br> &quot;You cast the &lt;insert name&gt; spell!  Your spell is resisted!&quot;   <br> &quot;You cast the &lt;insert name&gt; spell!  Your spell is resisted!&quot; <br> You have been slain by &lt;your opponent&gt;! <br>  <br> Against anyone with even MODERATE magical resistance buffs, Enchanters can hit with absolutely NO spells.  Even when you lower their magical resistance, it's still just too high to matter.  The only way to win a duel/PvP as an enchanter is to charm something-- that works in about 5% or less of the zones.   <br>  <br> Enchanters can fear your pets, of course, that is undeniable.  Then again, if you're dueling a necro, why not just use an earth pet and send it in to attack their skele.  The first attack the pet will do will be root.  Then it gets feared...sounds like you'd be on even terms at that point.  Either way, at least you'd have a chance to actually HURT the Necro. <br>  <br> I'm not saying that mages have no problems, but as far as PvP goes, don't bitch.  Other classes have it much worse in PvP.  True, an Enchanter is something of a support class, but it still remains that we get resisted 100% of the time by anyone with good MR gear EVEN WITH Tishan spells! <br>  <br> I see what you are saying about Mages having no way of escape if they get jumped, whereas Enchanters can Mez, Wizards can Yonder and Gate, Necros can fear.  Then again, if you are in a dangerous area where you can be jumped, why wouldn't you just have your pet out for insurance?  Is the 5 silver cost for Malachite really that high?  If what you are jumped by is much higher level, then everyone except maybe the wizard is equally screwed (spells will be resisted).  In fact, against a high red, if your pet is out, a mage has a good chance of getting away, much better than the chances of an Enchanter somehow managing to flee.  As long as your pet can take 2-3 hits and hold the mob off for maybe 20 seconds, you should easily be able to Gate or run for the zone. <br>  <br>

				I've seen a lot of magicians give up easily because they don't know how to use their class well.  I've seen level 16 magicians die to blues when I was hunting yellow and red con Cragspiders at that level, and they poison even.  I can fight a hill giant at level 46 with a Fire elemental pet, yes, a Fire elemental, not an Earth elemental.  I'm not saying you're wrong in your statements, you're right on with a few of those.  You are making Magicians sound like a completely useless class that always has to group in order to fight.  I have soloed my Magician from level 1 to level 46, no grouping.  I've found I live longer and level faster soloing.

				This is a copy of the reply I sent Alan about one of his recent replys to the boards.... <br>  <br> Alan, <br>   I am trying to let all my thoughts and ideas stay put till AFTER all the balancing is done.  However, one of the comments you keep making really bothers me. <br>  <br> &quot;In the situation you described, though, the pet is essentially as valuable as a rogue would be (the warrior would be the reason that a rogue would be able to deal out as much damage as he would). Add to that the ability of the mage himself, and you might indeed have a single character that is able to deal the damage of two warriors. Of course all of this is situational, which makes it very hard to evaluate.&quot; <br>  <br> So by reading this what you are saying is that its okay for the pet to take a share of experience since its &quot;as valuable&quot; as a PC.  So if this mind set is true, then WHY have a mage summon a pet at all when another PC is better (no pathing issues, follows directions, thinks for itself, etc)???  So since its not viable for the mage to summon a pet because PCs are better that makes a mage nothing more then a weak wizard that dies very quickly.  The only fixes I can see for your balance team to do is 1) Fix pet pathing COMPLETELY and make them worth the xp they steal from the party and soloing or 2) make it so when a mage does not have any pets summoned he gets a &quot;boost&quot; in his spell damage so he is useful without a pet (maybe have his damage output equal about 75% of a wizards output) or 3) disable the pets xp stealing all together since they are after all an &quot;extension&quot; of the mages abilities.  I mean, does a warriors weapons and armor steal XP?  Does a Bards songs steal XP?  No, their &quot;Class Defining&quot; abilities do not steal xp BUT a mages &quot;Class Defining&quot; ability to summon a elemental steals XP.  How is this balanced or fair?  Sorry for my rant, I just can't stand aside when I see a problem that is not being addressed. <br>  <br> Zaymot Silver <br> 47th Mage of Fennin Ro

				i am a 14 level mage, yet is seems to me mages are not the casters of choice.  i get tells for groups, but not as much as my shaman and low level wizard(8). i like my mage and will play him until my money or fun runs out, but i am starting to get the impression that people are looking for the cool necro or some other caster to group with.  hope fully now that pets do not take xp it will change.

				With this new Mod rod nerf I'm wondering if Verant will address high end mobs magic resistance. In some cases lowering the HP's of high end mob will not be sufficient if Mages cannot use their spells against these mobs. If I cast 3 or 4 magic and 3 or 4 conjurgation DD against a mob and they are all completely resisted I'm nearly useless as the &quot;Second highest DD dealer&quot;... <br>  <br>

				First off to the lvl 16 mage. Your pet is NOT there to take and do all the damage.  Buff the pet, DS yourself and then start nuking.  Keep enough mana aside to cast for a second pet.  Start casting for a new pet when your old one is at 30%, when your cast bar is at 10%, hit the old &quot;pet get lost&quot; hotkey and voila, instant fresh pet to take over where the old one left off.  Just make sure you have enough distance between yourself and the mob so it has to run a bit before hitting you.  <br>  <br> To the rest that are pissing and moaning about the mage class, learn how to play the class WITHOUT trying to be something it is not. <br>  <br> Mages are mages are mages, not wizards, not shaman, not necros.  Mages have their down sides as well as up sides, you either love to play them or will wind up posting whiney stuff about them here.    <br>  <br> I don't mean to sound harsh but I personally am tired of the posts that demand mages be the best of this game.  We aren't.  There are some things that tick me off regarding what Verant has done, but all in all, I love playing this class and will not stop playing it unless Verant opts to make us all rangers or palidans.  <img src="/images/faces/wink.gif" border=0 alt="wink.gif" height=16 hspace=0 width=18 vspace=0>
