        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">1.</font><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </font>
        <font color="#FFFF00">First and foremost, Dragons of Northstar is a 
        raiding guild.&nbsp; We raid daily at approximately 6pm CST.&nbsp; If 
        you are on at that time you are expected to be at the raid regardless of 
        whether there is loot there you want or a flag you need.&nbsp; We need 
        all that can attend every raid so that we can work as a unit when it 
        comes time for the big mobs and the higher planes.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">2.&nbsp; XP, AAXP, and LDON adventures are 
        extracurricular activities to be done during your spare time NOT during 
        raid time.&nbsp; The focus of this guild is to RAID and get to the 
        elemental planes and you need to be at the raid when you're online.&nbsp; 
        NOTE: There will always be exceptions and Real Life always comes first.&nbsp; 
        Plan ahead and don't plan xp time during our set raid time of 6pm CST.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">3.&nbsp; Rule pending.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">4.&nbsp; Members WILL NOT go /anon when online 
        during our regular scheduled raid time of 6pm CST whether you are at the 
        raid or not.&nbsp; This helps officers track DKP and attendance.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">5.&nbsp; Members will be courteous to one another 
        whenever possible and if differences do occur those involved need to 
        keep it to tells and out of Guild Chat.&nbsp; If there is a problem with 
        another member that you cannot resolve yourself speak to an officer and 
        we will try to help if possible.&nbsp; When grouping with others outside 
        our guild try and represent us well.&nbsp; Everything our members do 
        reflects upon our guild as a whole, for good or worse.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">6.&nbsp; Loot is awarded via our DKP system.&nbsp; 
        The DKP is basically an attendance and participation tool.&nbsp; 
        Currently 1 DKP is awarded per Named killed (subject to adjustment as 
        needed).&nbsp; An item that drops is linked by an officer with a request 
        for tells and the item's DKP value is attached to the message (Send tell 
        to Erikose for Rat Ear (1)).&nbsp; The number in parentheses is the DKP 
        value of the item.&nbsp; The officers then vote on the winner based in 
        part on DKP, past loot wins, and need.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT ATTEND RAIDS 
        YOU WILL NOT GET DKP AND WILL NOT GET LOOT!</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">7.&nbsp; To facilitate the tracking of DKP members 
        WILL NOT leave raid without letting an officer know and without checking 
        that their DKP in the Guild Management Tool has been updated.&nbsp; At 
        the end of a raid members will stay in RAID till they verify that their 
        DKP has been updated.&nbsp; This is the only time to dispute DKP.&nbsp; 
        IF YOU FAIL TO VERIFY OR LEAVE RAID BEFORE DKP IS UPDATED IT IS YOUR 
        FAULT AND WILL NOT BE CHANGED AT A LATER DATE.</font><p align="left">
        <font color="#FFFF00">8.&nbsp; If you cannot abide by these rules for 
        whatever reason then Dragons of Northstar is not the guild for you.</font></td>
