out the water from her clothes, &quot;how many times does that make? Four? Four
times I've fallen of that blasted boat.&quot; Katani muttered to herself some
more then found a spot on the ground where she could sit in the warmth of the
sun. Her companion, a Wood Elf Rogue, finally glanced her way and tried to
stifle his laughter. He had purposely jumped overboard to try to save his friend
when she fell into the Ocean of Tears, but by the time he had gotten to her the boat had sailed on without them.. too far for them to swim to.<br>
<br>
Shadmel looked over his maps for a third time and narrowed his eyes. &quot;There
is no island in this location.&quot; Katani looked up at him confused, then
looked around at her surroundings. &quot;er, Shad? What do you call this place
then, cause it sure looks like an island to me.&quot; She peered at him closely
wondering if her friend had been knocked on the head during their swim from the
boat to the shore. Shadmel sighed heavily, &quot;I'll go look around some more, see if I can find anything.&quot; The rogue suddenly was gone, having hidden
himself and preparing to sneak away &quot;Just you wait one second!&quot; Katani
exclaimed as she scrambled to gather her belongings, "Don't you dare leave me
alone here.&quot; Katani camouflaged herself and together she and Shadmel began
exploring the island.<br>
<br>
After several hours of searching the coastline, they finally made their way
inland. Their supplies were being depleted and they needed to find shelter, food
and water soon. Dusk soon came upon them as they finally found a small cave.
They would have to wait till morning before venturing out again. As the settled
in for the night a sudden burst of light appeared. They found a small tunnel
that Shadmel had to duck for in order to make his way, but Katani could easily
walk through so she took the lead.. eager to see what lay ahead. As she found
herself nearing a large cavern she suddenly stopped and swallowed hard... afraid
to even cast the spell to camouflage herself. Shadmel finally caught up with her
and at the sight before him immediately hid himself. Then, seeing how Katani was
exposed he stopped hiding and stood in front of his halfling friend. Too stunned
to move, the druid and rogue could only stare up into the eyes of a huge silver
dragon who had observed their every movement.<br>
<br>
&quot;All is well little ones. I wish you no harm.&quot; The Silver Dragon
spoke, her voice gentle and kind. &quot;I am only resting from a long journey.
Come, sit with me a while and tell me of your world.&quot;<br>
<br>
The soothing voice of the great dragon did much to sooth their fears, so Shadmel
and Katani approached the Silver Dragon and told her the stories of Norrath. The
legends, the gods, the quests and what could be found in the various parts of
the world. The telling of their tales lasted several days, during which the
Silver Dragon provided food and drink to sustain them. The great dragon seemed
to take great interest in learning everything the two was sharing with her....
then finally, after three days, the Silver Dragon told them why she wanted to
know.<br>
<br>
&quot;I come from another world, a world that has been destroyed. Only myself
and a companion of mine live. At least, all that we know of. The Black Dragon,
Nightwing, and myself, seek others of our kind. I had hoped to find some here,
but this land is too vast and full of mysteries that I fear I can not search all
before I must rejoin my companion who searches elsewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We can help you!&quot; Katani cried, overcome by the sadness in the Silver
Dragon's voice. &quot;Yes, we will do all we can to help you!&quot; Shadmel
vowed with such conviction that the Silver Dragon looked at him closely. The
rogue could see the scrutiny in her eyes. &quot;Yes, I believe you would.&quot;
The Silver Dragon knew Shadmel was a rogue, but she saw within his heart truth,
goodness and honor.<br>
<br>
The Silver Dragon spoke a few words and suddenly Katani was holding an ancient
tome. &quot;This that you hold, bears the history of my world up to it's last
moments.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And this... &quot; she began as she started another spell &quot;is a gift
so that you can search even further.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shadmel and Katani looked at each other, but did not understand what the gift
was. &quot;You will know in time what I have given you, as you read the
histories of my world&quot; The great Silver Dragon then cast another spell as
she bid the two farewell.. &quot;I will see you two again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Shadmel and Katani found themselves on a boat heading for Greater
Faydark... and to what they will call the Silver Dragon Clan.<br>
<br>
A Few Weeks Later.....<br>
<br>
Katani caressed the ancient leather bound tome respectfully then opened it's
pages to read yet again of the Great Dragons. The words, she memorized every
day, though she knew the entire tome by heart.<br>
<br>
This day, she turned to the pages which told of the Silver Dragon's return to
her world and found destruction..... an image of a crystal on one page caught
her eye as it had many times before. She spoke the words which released it's
magic and she watched again the scenes inside the crystal.<br>
<br>
<i>Two figures stood side by side... without speaking yet deep within each
other's thoughts. &quot;Gone...everything...gone&quot; The female didn't notice
a tear as it fell unchecked...emotion burned within her yet her face was a mask,
devoid of the pain and heartache that still violently swirled inside her.
&quot;We are all that are left you and I... and we shall be the last of our
kind&quot; His mind did not betray any resentment towards her or himself for
being unable to propagate. His Life mate had passed on and he could have no
other to replace her. He had learned many lifetimes ago that nothing can be
changed, you can only go forward. The female stirred beside him as she caught
his last thoughts &quot;Only go forward??? and What do we have to go forward
to???&quot; He felt the intense bitterness in her thoughts but remained a tower
of strength.. she needed him now more than ever and he would do all he could to
complete her teachings. &quot;Teachings? and Why should we continue with the
Teachings? There is NOTHING for us now..&quot; She cast her eyes across the
desolate planet....nothing lived in this wasteland, yet she could still see with
her inner eye... the homeland of her family... &quot;It is time... we must
go&quot; He gently urged her on....knowing that soon even they could not escape
the same fate as the rest. Each felt within them a tiny flicker of cold and heat
that sprouted out as it grew stronger. From the female, an aura of silver
surrounded her then branched outward filling the area with a brightness that was
blinding. Her companion became encompassed by a wide thickening cloud of
darkness. As light and dark merged, a spectacular sight appeared as they became
one and created a world of intense gray. Almost immediately the light and dark
began receding and growing smaller and smaller till none of the light and
darkness remained. In their stead was a silver dragon and a large black dragon.
The silver female dragon sighed, a bitter sound that showed her frustration
&quot;There is nothing for us now, What are we to do??&quot; &quot;You will
learn, as I said before you must continue your teachings, .and we shall add new
ones for you to be able to exist among others&quot; &quot;Surely there are more
like us?&quot; She asked hopefully, yet she knew what his answer would be.
&quot;There may be similarities but none... in any dimension of the universe,
are like us&quot; His mention of dimensions reminded her of the last of her
Teachings, she had just begun to travel to other worlds with her Th'ras'AK when
they were sent word that their world was being destroyed. They had arrived too
late to save any of her kindred. She looked back at their world, now destroyed,
a last look before they would leave their home forever. They lingered... wanting
to prolong this moment for as long as they could... they would never be back...
and there was nothing to come back to. &quot;We can open doorways into other
worlds...can travel through dimensions... but can not erase what happened
here... &quot; She felt as though her body would crumble from the sadness within
her. &quot;Time has been... and shall always be our greatest enemy&quot; He
replied harshly... and she looked up with surprise...but he continued....
&quot;The past is gone...our future shall never be... you know that you and I
can not hope to continue our race. It is best that we move on... we can not
change what has been...&quot; &quot;No! I will carry this within me till the
dying breath leaves my body!&quot; She declared as she promised herself that
somehow she would continue the legacy of her race. &quot;Our race is dead! There
is nothing that even you and I together can do to change what has
happened.&quot; He knew her power was strong... and his own was even stronger...
and when combined they created an unequaled force of power...but this was beyond
their powers... they could do nothing to change the past. &quot;Time...as you
said... Time is our greatest enemy... But someday &quot; &quot;Someday you will
have moved on. You may keep the legacy of our race...but that is all you shall
ever have&quot; &quot;Then in my heart and soul I vow that the legacy of our
race... the history of our past shall remain within me... and for as long as
that may be I shall embrace history for with it I shall someday find a way to
control time... and someday I shall restore our future.&quot; Together, the
male, Nightwind of the Black Clan from the Land of Shadows, and the female,
Firesky of the Silver Clan from the Land of Moonlight, traveled through space
and through many dimensions, searching for others like themselves. During their
journeys they found many races who were destined to share the same fate as the home world
of the Ancient Ones. Nightwind and Firesky vowed to save as many lives as
possible, and swore they would return someday with the help they needed to
protect them.<br>
</i><br>
Katani closed the book as Shadmel approached. &quot;You reading that
again?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; she muttered defensively. &quot;Only watching this
time.&quot; Shadmel spoke the words that he now understood.. the words which
were the gift of the Silver Dragon that he had been able to decipher from the
ancient tome.. Shadmel became Dillin and sat down beside Katani, put an arm
around her shoulders and squeezed. &quot;Their tale is sad.. I know..&quot; but
the Silver Dragon is out there. She asked of us a great and noble task which we
shall endeavor to complete. If there be any of her kind alive, we shall find
them. More and more join us.. more eyes and ears to learn of any dragons.&quot;
Dillin hugged Katani and retrieved the book from her to hide it in it's special
place. He, too, caressed it's cover gently, in reverence to the great mysteries
and life of the Great Dragons.</font></b><font color="#C9BAD9"><br>
