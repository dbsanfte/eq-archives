I.&nbsp; Guild Name and Game Systems of Operation
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The name of the guild that this charter establishes will be
  Silver Dragon Clan (SDC). Silver Dragon Clan will operate chapters on the
  following Online Role-Play Game systems / Servers:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; EverQuest (EQ)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Saryrn Server - Primary Server<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Other servers may be added at a
    later date.<br>
    <br>
    B.&nbsp; Star Wars Galaxies (SWG)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Primary Server to be determined upon
    game release.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Other servers may be added at a
    later date.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>II.&nbsp; In Game Vs. Mundane Considerations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>EverQuest and Star Wars Galaxies are online games that allow for the
  creation of fictional In-Game characters that are operated by a mundane player
  via a computer connection to the game system.<br>
  <br>
  It is important to note, EverQuest and Star Wars Galaxies are not real life
  and are just games. As such Silver Dragon Clan is a guild comprised of In-Game
  characters, not the mundane player operating the characters, and is not
  intended to be a forum for mundane and / or personal issues.<br>
  <br>
  While Silver Dragon Clan will take advantage of mundane resources and systems
  that allow a player to operate multiple characters, each character will be
  considered to be part of a family of characters controlled by the same player
  unless other wise noted.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>III.&nbsp; Guild Goal / Mission</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The overall goal of Silver Dragon Clan guild is to promote fun, adventure,
  excitement and enjoyment for all members of the guild.&nbsp; To this end, the
  mission of Silver Dragon Clan will be to sponsor events, forums and other
  creative outlets for involvement by all members of the guild.&nbsp; Members of
  Silver Dragon Clan will be united by this common goal and mission while
  following the policies and rules set forth in this charter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Membership Qualifications and Application Process</p>

  steps of the application process:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.&nbsp; Complete and submit a membership application, found in the

    <br>
    2.&nbsp; Create and submit a character listing on Guild Magic web site for
    inclusion in the Silver Dragon Clan member roster. Creation of Guild Magic,

    intent to join the guild and that the character is seeking a sponsor.
    Include in the post the character name, class, race, level, past guild
    membership and any other information that should be known about the
    character. Creation of a free message board account is required if not
    previously created for another character.<br>
    <br>
    4.&nbsp; Begin the sponsorship period and complete any quests given in
    preparation for sponsorship, while awaiting a response to message board
    posting from a sponsor.<br>
    <br>
    5.&nbsp; Work in conjunction with a sponsor to complete sponsorship process.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>C.&nbsp; Star Wars Galaxies Membership Qualifications<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be determined as game release date
  approaches.</p>
  <p>D.&nbsp; Star Wars Galaxies Application Process<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be determined as game release date
  approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>V.&nbsp; Sponsorship Process</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan members are united by the quest given by the Silver
  Dragon to seek others of her kind. The goal while undertaking this quest is to
  promote fun, adventure, excitement&nbsp; and enjoyment among the members of
  Silver Dragon Clan.<br>
  <br>
  As part of this quest and goal, members strive to work together to obtain the
  skills necessary to explore all areas of the game worlds where Silver Dragon
  Clan has a presence. In the process of working together, members of Silver
  Dragon Clan form a community of friends and kinship.<br>
  <br>
  Silver Dragon Clan has established the sponsorship process to allow
  prospective and active members of Silver Dragon Clan to get to know each
  other. This period is also designed to allow active members to evaluate
  whether prospective members display qualities that will enhance the ranks of Silver
  Dragon Clan.<br>
  <br>
  To begin the sponsorship process, prospective members must create a message
  forum posting as described in step three of the application process. This will
  serve as an introduction by the prospective member to the active membership of
  Silver Dragon Clan. The prospective member will next have to await a response
  to the message board posting by an active member that will agree to serve as a
  sponsor.<br>
  <br>
  The posting will remain active on the message board for two weeks pending a
  response from a sponsor. If a response is not received during that time
  period, the posting will be removed from the message board. This should not be
  viewed as a rejection of the prospective member, but rather as an indication
  that the prospective member may need to spend some time befriending and
  getting to know the active members of Silver Dragon Clan. It is advisable that
  the prospective member knows a few active members very well and feels
  comfortable that one of those active members will be a sponsor prior to
  beginning the application process.<br>
  <br>
  The message board post will be copied into the &quot;Members’ Area&quot; of
  the message forum for active members to discuss sponsor assignments. When the
  active members have had an opportunity to discuss sponsoring the prospective member (See Sponsor Requirements below), a sponsor will be selected and will
  post a response to the prospective member’s original posting.<br>
  <br>
  During this time period the prospective member should take the opportunity to
  begin interacting with the active membership of Silver Dragon Clan. Also at
  this time the prospective member may also be given a quest to complete that
  will bring them in contact with other members of Silver Dragon Clan. This
  quest will not be so hard as to be unattainable at the prospective member's present
  level, but will require some assistance from active members of Silver Dragon
  Clan. This quest will be published on the message board and active members
  will be encouraged to assist.<br>
  <br>
  Once an active member responds as a sponsor, the prospective member will be
  able to continue to fulfill the remaining requirements of the sponsorship
  process. At this time the prospective member will be given limited access to
  the Members' Area folders so that they may communicate with other members of
  the guild.<br>
  <br>
  To allow the active members to further evaluate the prospective member’s
  acceptance as an active member, the prospective member, with the assistance of
  their sponsor, will participate in hunting groups, raids and guild events as
  listed below. These requirements must be met after a sponsor has been
  selected, previous interactions with active members prior to selection of a
  sponsor will not be considered retroactively.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Participate in one large guild raid or event. The prospective member’s sponsor must accompany them at the raid or event for it to be
    counted towards the requirements. The sponsor must also post to the
    appropriate message topic in the Members' Area folders for the prospective member to receive credit for the raid attendance.<br>
    <br>
    B.&nbsp; Participate in at least two smaller guild hunt events or general
    hunting group. Regardless of the group type, the prospective member must
    have hunted with at least three different&nbsp; active members for this
    requirement to be met. Each of the three active members must post to the
    appropriate message topic in the Members' Area folders for the prospective member to receive credit for participating in the hunting groups /
    events.<br>
    <br>
    C.&nbsp; Have a brief interview regarding membership and involvement in
    Silver Dragon Clan with one of the guild officers or guild leaders.&nbsp;
    The time and location of this interview may be arranged via the guild
    message board or in game tells so as to be convenient for both the
    prospective member and the guild officer / leader.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The requirements listed above are intended to provide a guideline of the
  minimum participation required, while more participation is not required, it
  is strongly encouraged. The main objective to be considered is the opportunity
  for the prospective member to interact with the highest possible number of
  active members of Silver Dragon Clan.<br>
  <br>
  The sponsor and all other active members will provide feedback regarding
  interactions with the prospective member by posting to the appropriate message
  topic in the Members’ Area folders. The active members should also reflect
  their impressions of their interaction with the prospective member and their
  opinion of whether or not the prospective member should be promoted to active membership
  in Silver Dragon Clan. If further feedback and evaluation is required, the
  sponsor will be informed of the necessary, additional requirements.<br>
  <br>
  It should also be noted that the prospective member, the sponsoring member and
  all active members contributing to meeting the requirements of the application
  process may not be from the same family of characters controlled by the same
  player in any way.<br>
  <br>
  Once all the requirements of the sponsorship process are completed, the
  prospective member will be promoted to active membership in Silver Dragon
  Clan. Arrangements will also be made at this time for the member to be guild
  invited and receive the In-game guild tag.<br>
  <br>
  After the character has been promoted to active membership they will serve a
  thirty-day probationary period. During this probationary period if the guild
  leadership determines it necessary, the character may be removed from Silver
  Dragon Clan without warning and further will not be required to honor any
  policies in this charter pertaining to an appeal or mediation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VI&nbsp; Sponsor Requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To be considered as a possible sponsor, members of Silver Dragon Clan must
  meet the qualifications listed below:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Be an active member in good standing and not on probation.<br>
    <br>
    B.&nbsp; Not be currently sponsoring another prospective member with any
    character member.<br>
    <br>
    C.&nbsp; Must be able to commit the time to serve as a sponsor and mentor to
    the prospective member.<br>
    <br>
    D.&nbsp; Aid the prospective member in fulfilling the requirements to attain
    active membership as outlined in the Sponsorship Process section of this
    charter.<br>
    <br>
    E.&nbsp; Act as a mentor to the prospective member by providing answers to
    questions, helping them to become familiar with Silver Dragon Clan and
    making the transition to active membership.<br>
    <br>
    F.&nbsp; Act as a liaison between the prospective member and other active
    members to coordinate completion of quest, hunt, raid and event
    requirements, as the prospective member will have limited access to the
    Members’ Area folders of the message board.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
VII. EverQuest Membership Requirements
<blockquote>
  <p>To maintain an active membership status, each character member must meet
  and maintain the requirements listed below.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Each member will follow all rules and policies set forth in this
    charter and all other guild forums and systems.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Members will follow all conditions as set forth in the Verant
      / EverQuest Terms of Service Agreement (EULA displayed while loading game
      program) and all other Terms of Service agreements of other systems used
      in conjunction with membership in Silver Dragon Clan (IE: Guild Magic, SDC
      Web Portal, Etc.).<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp; Members will follow and adhere to the provisions set forth in the
      Verant / EverQuest &quot;Rules of Conduct&quot;, &quot;Play Nice Policies
      - Activity within EverQuest&quot; and &quot;Message Board Conduct&quot;
      policies, located on the main EverQuest web site (To view these policies
      in more detail - visit the web site by clicking&nbsp; <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>).&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      As there are certain sections of these policies that can be misinterpreted
      or can lead to problems / disputes between game characters, please note
      the following excerpted sections, the guild's interpretation notes and
      policy adjustments.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; Kill Stealing</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        1) Excerpt - &quot;Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for
        any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group
        that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific
        permission.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        2) Interpretation Note - Some players have varying definitions of what
        is a NPC - A NPC is any in-game character that is controlled by the game
        system and not another player. in-game monsters, commonly referred to as
        MOBs are also considered NPCs. While the policy can be interpreted as:
        &quot;You
        should not deal the killing hit to the NPC / MOB without the group's specific
        permission&quot;, it should be noted that the character that damages the NPC
        / MOB the most receives the experience gain for killing the NPC / MOB. This can
        cause complications between characters.<br>
        <br>
        3) Policy Adjustment - Silver Dragon Clan members shall not engage, cast
        on or melee any NPC / MOB that another character is preparing to fight or is
        actively fighting unless they are a part of the same group or have
        received specific permission to do so from the other character.
        Permission can include the person using the /yell command, using the in
        game channels (ooc, shout, etc.) to announce a train to the zone that
        they need assistance in killing. If you are not absolutely certain that
        the character is in need of assistance do not in any way engage the NPC
        / MOB.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>b) Ninja looting</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        1) Excerpt - &quot;Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment
        from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who
        killed the creature if they are in attendance.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        2) Interpretation Note - Items in the game can be used for many purposes
        and as such have varying value to each character. What may be appear as
        an item to be sold to a vendor by you may be a required component of a
        quest or tradeskill of another character. Also the person that killed
        the NPC / MOB whose corpse is there in front of you may still be engaged by
        the remainder of the swarm that they are fighting.<br>
        <br>
        3) Policy Adjustment - Silver Dragon Clan members shall not loot the
        corpse of any NPC / MOB that they or a member of their group did not kill
        unless given specific permission to do so from the character that killed
        the NPC / MOB.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>c) Contested Spawns / &quot;Camping&quot;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1) Excerpt - &quot;There are cases where two or more groups wish to
          kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups
          are required to compromise.<br>
          </p>
          <p>If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players
          prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will
          mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to
          debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption
          and may result in disciplinary action.</p>
          <p>It is therefore <b>strongly </b>suggested that the groups make
          every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to
          involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit
          you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.</p>
          <p>Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one
          or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are
          capable of completing that goal.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          2) Interpretation Note - Many misunderstandings occur in EverQuest
          over this &quot;Play Nice&quot; policy and opinions vary greatly as to
          whether or not Verant allows &quot;camping&quot; of specific NPC / MOB
          spawns. Based on this policy and the 'kill stealing&quot; policy
          mentioned above there arises the opportunity for many different
          interpretations. Based on the two policies it will be the guild's
          interpretation that Verant does not recognize or allow a character
          exclusive rights to claim a specific spawn but rather that characters
          compromise and share spawns. However many players do recognize the
          concept of &quot;camping&quot;, therefore some communication will be
          involved regarding the contested spawn so that a compromise may be
          reached. Please see the policy adjustment below for Silver Dragon
          Clan's exact policy.<br>
          <br>
          3) Policy Adjustment - If a character / group is hunting /
          &quot;camping&quot; a spawn site and is at that location prior to your
          arrival, then per the 'kill stealing&quot; policy do not interfere
          with the character / group's hunting ground / &quot;camp&quot;. The
          Silver Dragon Clan member should open a dialogue with the character /
          group as to what type of compromise may be reached. If the Silver
          Dragon Clan member is the character at the spawn site first then
          maintain your hunting ground / &quot;camp&quot;, but be open to
          compromise. Because spawn site recycle times and size of the spawn
          site can vary greatly there is no set policy that can be defined here
          that will address this issue. The general Silver Dragon Clan policy
          will be to work with others to reach an equitable solution. If an
          equitable solution can not be reached then assistance should be sought
          from an EQCSR. Any solution mandated by the EQCSR will be followed by
          all Silver Dragon Clan members, regardless of their opinion of the
          mandated compromise. This policy is not intended to direct Silver
          Dragon Clan members to seek assistance from EQCSR staff in every
          incident that a solution can not be reached, common sense and courtesy
          should be a guiding factor in disputes of this type. It should also be
          noted that excessive requests for mediation by EQCSR staff can
          directly affect the reputation of the guild and the Silver Dragon Clan
          member and is addressed by other policies in this charter.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d) Foul language and abusive behavior</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1) Excerpt - &quot;Foul language is not permitted, in any language.</p>
          <p>Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context,
          including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language
          that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to
          hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter
          (/filter) is not a license to be profane.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          2) Interpretation Note - This policy does not lead to any
          misinterpretations, it is being highlighted here for extra emphasis
          and to note that Silver Dragon Clan will extend this to include
          actions and behavior. The guiding factor here is that if it is
          something most people would not say or do in front of their parents,
          grandparents or religious leader then it is best left unsaid or
          undone.<br>
          <br>
          3) Policy Adjustment - Foul language, behavior or actions are not
          permitted, in any language or form.</p>
          <p>Excessive use of foul language, behavior or actions of an
          inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs,
          and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment
          and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence
          of the filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane. This is to
          include transmission on in-game channels (ooc, auction, shout, guild,
          chat channel, tells, etc.), out of game resources (message board
          posts, web site, etc.) including any systems used
      in conjunction with membership in Silver Dragon Clan (IE: Guild Magic, SDC
      Web Portal, etc.) this will also include non-guild related resources where
          the character represents their self as a member of Silver Dragon Clan
          (IE: Casters Ream, EQ Traders, etc.).</p>
        </blockquote>

<p>VIII.&nbsp; Membership Hierarchy, Ranks and Titles</p>
<blockquote>

    Silver Dragon Clan is structured on a rank hierarchy, and will recognize two
    ranks for each member. The first rank system will be based on the In-game
    rank structure of each game system and the second rank system will be based
    on membership in Silver Dragon Clan. Additionally certain ranks and guild
    positions will carry an associated title that will be bestowed upon members
    by the Dragon’s Council of Silver Dragon Clan.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    A. EverQuest In game Ranks<br>

    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Member - The In-game rank of Member is the standard rank allowed for
    guild members by the EverQuest game interface. This rank allows characters
    to display the guild tag following their name above the In-game avatar to
    identify them as a member of the guild. Also it allows them access to the
    guild chat channel. The majority of Silver Dragon Clan members will be given
    this In-game rank.<br>

    given by the game interface, members of these ranks will follow the Silver
    Dragon Clan policies in this charter in conjunction with exercising the

<p>IX.&nbsp; General Guidelines and Rules</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following are the original guidelines and rules of Silver Dragon Clan.
  While they may be addressed in other sections of this charter, they are
  included here to maintain the original concepts and beliefs by which the guild
  was founded. The individual items in this section will be superceded by all
  other sections of this charter should a conflict in policy need to be
  resolved.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    1) Role-playing is strongly encouraged.<br>
    <br>
    2) Guild members should aid each other as often as reasonably possible. This
    includes helping each other with corpse runs, acquiring items, porting,
    resuscitating, and grouping together.<br>
    <br>
    3) No Begging from other players or members for aid, whether it be items,
    money, ports, resurrections or help in leveling. Begging is highly frowned
    upon, especially begging from those who generously give of their time to
    help others anyway.<br>
    <br>
    4) No kill stealing. You may loot only your own (or your party’s) kills.
    Members should attack only those mobs that are not currently in conflict
    with another character. This does not apply if the other character is a
    member of your party or if the person is requesting assistance.<br>
    <br>
    5) Members will control their pulls at all times. If you or your party must
    run from a fight pulling a mob train, you should attempt to warn others of
    pending train through use of the appropriate chat channel such as /shout.
    You should also take a route which will not endanger others along your path
    of escape.<br>
    <br>
    6) No looting during battles. Make sure all of your party members are safe
    before you take loot. Also you should follow any party or raid looting
    agreements and procedures.<br>
    <br>
    7) No inappropriate language over chat channels (i.e.: Auction, Shout, OOC,
    Guild, Etc.) , in deference to other players and Verant policies.<br>
    <br>
    8) If guild members want to be anonymous in EverQuest, they are required to
    use the /role command, not the /anonymous command, so that they will show up
    on guild who lists.<br>
    <br>
    9) Alts (alternate characters) are allowed in the guild at any level.
    Players are also welcome to join Dragon Companion Guilds on other Servers.<br>
    <br>
    10) Auctioning items to guild members is allowed, it is preferred that a
    discount be given to guild mates whenever possible, but is not required.<br>
    <br>
    11) No PvP characters in the guild at this time. (At a later date we may
    allow PvP characters for Guild Wars or specific guild events)<br>
    <br>
    12) All Guild Members are to encourage fun, excitement and adventure for
    everyone!<br>
    <br>
    13) Guild Members will follow all Verant policies, including the established
    Play Nice Policy.<br>
    <br>
    14) Guild Members will adhere to the following Guild Golden Rules:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A) At all times let your actions honor the Silver Dragon.<br>
    <br>
    B) Guild Members shall not undertake any action that would be detrimental or
    harassing to another player in the lands of Norrath.<br>
    <br>
    C) Guild Members shall take no action that will reduce the honor or
    reputation of their own or the guild’s name.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>X.&nbsp; Guild Families</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  While Silver Dragon Clan will take advantage of mundane resources and systems
  that allow a player to operate multiple characters, each character will be
  considered to be part of a family of characters controlled by the same player
  unless other wise noted.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; A family will be comprised of a minimum of one character and a maximum number
  of characters to be arranged between the player and the guild leaders (the
  guild leaders reserve the ability to limit the total number of characters a
  player can consider to be part of one family).&nbsp; If a player chooses to
  have a family of two or more characters, the player will designate one
  character as the main character to be considered the leader of the family, all
  other members of that family will be considered alternate characters.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
    B.&nbsp; The actions of each member of a family will affect and impact the status of
  all of the members of that family of characters, unless otherwise noted.
  Therefore each family member will not be required to maintain guild
  requirements separately but rather as an overall family effort. By the same
  token if the actions of a family member warrant disciplinary action such as
  probationary status, all members of that family will be affected and be considered
  to be on probation.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XI.&nbsp; Guild Households</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan recognizes that in the process of working together, members of Silver
  Dragon Clan form a community of friends and kinship. As a means of allowing
  members to further their associations in similar pursuits, Silver Dragon Clan
  will accommodate members by allowing members to band together in guild
  approved households.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Members wishing to form a household must meet the following
    requirements.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; A household may be formed by a minimum of three members.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; The three members that meet the minimum requirement must be
        from different guild families.&nbsp;<br>
        b)&nbsp; The three members that meet&nbsp; the minimum requirement must
        be played regularly - mule characters not allowed.<br>
        c)&nbsp; All members must be active members in good standing.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2.&nbsp; The members forming the household will select one of the
      members as the leader of the house.<br>
      <br>
      The method by which the members make this selection is completely at their
      discretion.<br>
      <br>
      The member that is selected as the leader of the house will be appointed
      to the title of Dragon Liege and will be required to fulfill the duties
      and responsibilities that are defined in this charter under the Titles
      section. The members of the household will be expected to assist their
      Dragon Liege with all events including but not limited to, attending
      raids, events, hunts and buffing stations hosted by the household.</p>
      <p>3.&nbsp; The members will request approval from the Dragon Elders for
      recognition as a household.</p>
      <p>4.&nbsp; The household will be approved and recognized at the
      discretion of the Dragon's Council.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>B.&nbsp; Approved guild households will be given special listings on
    Silver Dragon Clan resources as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; A message board folder, accessible by all guild members.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp; A subsection on the Silver Dragon Clan Guild Magic roster.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp; A section on the Silver Dragon Clan Web Site.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>C.&nbsp; Guild households must maintain the following requirements to
    remain active.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Maintain a minimum of three members.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; The three members that meet the minimum requirement must be
        from different guild families.&nbsp;<br>
        b)&nbsp; The three members that meet&nbsp; the minimum requirement must
        be played regularly - mule characters not allowed.<br>
        c)&nbsp; All members must be active members in good standing.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2.&nbsp; The selected Dragon Liege must maintain the requirements of
      their guild title. The household members will also be expected to continue
      assisting their Dragon Liege.</p>
      <p>3.&nbsp; The household must be represented by a minimum of three
      members at least once every 3 months (calendar quarter) at guild household
      competition events hosted by the Dragon Elders.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>D.&nbsp; Members that are Dragon Masters, Dragon QuarterMasters or
    members of the Dragon's Council will be allowed to choose a household to
    associate themselves with, however it should be understood that no special
    preference shall be reflected by the association. The membership in a
    specific household and bearing a guild title will be considered separate of
    each other. The Dragon Elders reserve the ability to require titled guild
    member remove themselves from a household if a conflict of interest or issue
    of impropriety should arise.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>E.&nbsp; The Dragon Elders reserve the option to define additional
    requirements of guild households.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XII.&nbsp; Guild Events</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The overall goal of Silver Dragon Clan guild is to promote fun, adventure,
  excitement and enjoyment for all members of the guild.&nbsp; To this end, the
  mission of Silver Dragon Clan will be to sponsor events, forums and other
  creative outlets for involvement by all members of the guild.&nbsp; Members of
  Silver Dragon Clan will be united by this common goal and mission.</p>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan will hosts events of the type listed below. This list is
  intended to provide a guideline for the guild, not a limitation. Silver Dragon
  Clan will plan to host events of these types as noted in each section, however
  these are intended as a guideline.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Raids - Guild raids will be recognized as being a large
    gathering of guild members united in a common goal to seek adventure in the
    lands of Norrath. This type of event will in most cases require more than
    one group of adventures to accomplish. Some examples of this type of event
    are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Seeking to kill the main MOB of a zone for game experience or
      specific quest item.<br>
      2.&nbsp; Seeking to clear a zone of all MOBs by starting at the entrance
      and fighting deeper into the zone, for the purpose of receiving game
      experience or exploration.<br>
      3.&nbsp; Seeking to obtain class specific equipment / armor / epic quest
      items for a specific member(s) or guild vault.<br>
      4.&nbsp; Seeking to kill MOBs in a specific zone to obtain tradeskill
      related drop items (&quot;Farming&quot;)<br>
      5.&nbsp; Seeking to hunt in a high level zone, such as the Planes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Silver Dragon Clan will plan to host events of this type every other
    week.</p>
    <p>B.&nbsp; Events - Guild events will be recognized as being a gathering of
    guild members united in a common goal to seek fun and adventure in the lands
    of Norrath. This type of event will in most cases not require melee. Some
    examples of this type of event are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Scavenger Hunts<br>
      2.&nbsp; Beach Parties<br>
      3.&nbsp; Tradeskill competitions<br>
      4.&nbsp; Find the hidden guild member.<br>
      5. Guild household competitions.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Silver Dragon Clan will plan to host events of this type once per month.</p>
    <p>C.&nbsp; Hunts - Guild hunts will be recognized as being a gathering of
    guild members united in common goal&nbsp; to seek adventure in the lands of
    Norrath. This type of event will in most cases require one group of
    adventures to accomplish. Events of this type may be similar to raids but on
    a much smaller scale. Some examples of this type of event are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Hunting together as a group for the purpose of gaining game
      experience.<br>
      2.&nbsp; Hunting together as a group for the purpose of exploring a zone.<br>
      3.&nbsp; Hunting together as a group to obtain class specific equipment /
      armor items for a specific member(s) or guild vault.<br>
      4.&nbsp; Hunting together as a group to kill MOBs in a specific zone area
      to obtain tradeskill related drop items (&quot;Farming&quot;).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Silver Dragon Clan will plan to host events of this type two to three
    times per week.</p>
    <p>D.&nbsp; Buffing Stations - Guild buffing stations will be recognized as
    a gathering of guild&nbsp; members united in a common goal to provide
    assistance to guild members and non-guild members as they hunt. This type of
    event will in most cases require one group of adventures to accomplish and
    will not provide game experience. Events of this type will be primarily to
    spread the name of Silver Dragon Clan and to facilitate recruitment or
    prospective member sponsorship process. Some examples of this type of event
    will are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Offering free healing and buffing at the entrance or common
      gather point of a zone.<br>
      2.&nbsp; Offering train derailments at the entrance or common gathering
      point of a zone.<br>
      3.&nbsp; Offer free porting services.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Silver Dragon Clan will plan to host events of this type once every two
    weeks.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; Guild Loot Policy</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan will recognize the following policies as they apply to
  looting corpses. These policies are not intended to supercede any other
  agreements that guild members may agree to as part of being in a group. Guild
  members should follow these policies if no other agreement is in effect.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; When hunting in a group, regardless of whether the group is all
    guild members or a mix of guild and non-guild members.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Members will not loot any corpse that was not killed by
      themselves or another member of their hunting party.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp; Members will not loot any corpse while any member of their
      hunting party is fighting.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp; Members will share loot equally and fairly so that all members of
      their hunting party have the opportunity to profit.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Some examples of looting styles can include:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; Appointing a primary looter that will loot all money and at
        a break will divide the money equally between party members using the
        /split command. Looter will turn of autosplitting.<br>
        b)&nbsp; Loot items by rotating the loot order alphabetically by party
        members' names.&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>4.&nbsp; Members will use the /random 100 command (character receiving
      highest number) to determine who will receive items sought by more than
      one member of their hunting party.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The overall consideration in looting is that all hunting party members
    receive the opportunity to profit from the available loot dropped by MOBs
    killed.</p>
    <p>B.&nbsp; When hunting at a guild hosted raid / hunt the following loot
    system is the preferred method:</p>
    <p>Silver Dragon Clan will follow a &quot;Need before Greed&quot;
    philosophy. This means that equipment / armor / quest items will be
    distributed to the event members based on specific order of precedence and
    benefit. The precedence and benefit order and distribution method is as
    follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Loot gathering method:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; Each raid / hunt group will have a designated looter. Looter
        will turn off autosplitting<br>
        b)&nbsp; All loot from corpses killed will be looted only by the
        designated group looter.<br>
        c)&nbsp; Items that will be distributed during the loot distribution
        phase will be reported to the raid / hunt host as they are looted.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2.&nbsp; Loot distribution method:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a)&nbsp; All money looted will be distributed to the members of the
        specific hunting group members using the /split command.<br>
        b)&nbsp; All loot items will be given to the raid / hunt host for
        distribution.<br>
        c)&nbsp; All consumed spell components (gems, etc.) will be distributed
        to the raid attendees in the following manner:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1)&nbsp; Raid attendees that were present that used their own
          supplies for spells, receive 25% to replenish their supplies.<br>
          2)&nbsp; Dragon QuarterMasters receive 25% for guild vaults.<br>
          3)&nbsp; Group looting the components receive 50%.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>d)&nbsp; All loot will be distributed by the raid / hunt host to all
        raid / hunt attendees using the highest roll of a /random 100 to
        determine the recipient.<br>
        e)&nbsp; All loot will be distributed in the following order of
        precedence, based on item stats (All attendees will receive items before
        moving to the next level of precedence):</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1)&nbsp; Raid / hunt attendees of that class / race / etc. that
          were in attendance and hunting at the raid / hunt that needs the item.<br>
          2)&nbsp; Raid / hunt attendees that have an alternate character that
          supported the raid / hunt in some way that needs the item.<br>
          3)&nbsp; Raid / hunt attendees that have an alternate character that
          did not attend / support the raid in any way that needs the item.<br>
          4)&nbsp; Dragon QuarterMaster seeking the item for the guild vaults.<br>
          5)&nbsp; Raid / hunt attendees that can not use the item but plan to
          sell the item.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>3.&nbsp; Planning notes - The raid / hunt host will coordinate the
      possible loot from the raid / hunt and all requests for loot in advance of
      the raid / hunt as part of their preparation of the raid / hunt and post
      the information as part of the raid / hunt announcement. This will allow a
      clear understanding by all raid / hunt attendees and reduce confusion
      during the raid / hunt itself.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; Power Leveling&nbsp; / Low Skills Policies</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan recognizes that players do engage in power leveling of
  characters.&nbsp; While Silver Dragon Clan will not prohibit this practice,
  guild members will be expected to follow this policy.</p>
  <p>Power leveling through questing will leave the character lacking in many
  needed skills such as melee or casting abilities. If a member engages in power
  leveling they will make sure that their skills are brought up to a sufficient
  level as to not be detrimental to other members of their hunting party.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  If a member's skills are not sufficient for their current overall level due to
  power leveling or lack of practicing that skill then they will not participate
  in any guild events requiring them to fight, until such time as their skills
  are sufficient. (ex: If the character is a level 30 druid but their melee and
  / or casting abilities are those of a level 10 character due to power
  leveling, then they will not participate in any guild event that will require
  them to melee.)</p>
  <p>Also it is understood that some skills are not kept even with other melee
  and casting skills. Such as keeping one handed slashing maxed while not
  raising two handed blunt. Members will not use any weapon that they are
  lacking the skills to use, during guild raids / hunts unless all other members
  of the group are warned in advance and agree to allow them to do so. They will
  also be prepared to switch back to their most proficient weapon at any time so
  as not to endanger the other members of their hunting party. (ex: The member
  is a level 30 druid with a one hand slashing skill of a 10th level character
  and two handed blunt skill of 28th level, then they will use two handed blunt
  while fighting unless all members of their party agree that it is ok for them
  to try to raise one handed slashing skill).</p>
  <p>The main consideration is that members with inadequate skills do not
  endanger other members of their hunting group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XV.&nbsp; Honor System</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As is the case of the of the internet and online role-playing games it is
  very easy to remain anonymous or to hide certain information regarding
  themselves. Silver Dragon Clan acknowledges this ability and will foster an
  atmosphere of privacy of personal facts between all members. However, part of
  administering the guild requires that certain information be disclosed per the
  policies set forth in this charter. Silver Dragon Clan will expect all members
  to honestly represent themselves to the guild and its' members.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Due to the nature of the game systems and internet facilities used in
  administering the guild there is no easy way to double check the honesty of
  all the information that people may convey regarding themselves or their
  characters. Silver Dragon Clan will accept the information provided by members
  based on the honor system. Information provided and conveyed by members will
  be considered to be accurate and honestly provided.</p>
  <p>Further as is the case in any game there are times when there are incompatibilities
  between different players and characters that lead to situations where
  conflicts between characters arise. Silver Dragon Clan is understanding and
  open to providing characters another chance if the circumstance of the
  situation allow. There are however some situations where this is not possible,
  leading to the association ending and a parting of the paths occurs. This
  sometimes is an amicable separation and sometimes is not so amicable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is understood that some players take advantage of the ability to hide
  their identity by creating a new character to escape or hide a bad reputation
  they may have gained with a previous character.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan understands that all of the above mentioned situations
  occur and prefer to trust players are honestly representing themselves,
  however Silver Dragon Clan reserve the right and ability to remove any member
  that it discovers to have misrepresented themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XVI.&nbsp; Disciplinary Actions</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All members of Silver Dragon Clan will be expected to follow the rules and
  policies set forth in this charter. Also members are expected to follow the
  rules and agreements associated with the game systems and outside resources.
  Should a member not do so, the need for disciplinary action may arise. This
  section will govern the manner in which Silver Dragon Clan will conduct
  disciplinary actions.</p>
  <p>If a situation arises where disciplinary action must be considered, the
  members of the Dragon's Council will&nbsp; review the information of all
  parties to make a decision if disciplinary action need be taken. The preferred
  method will be for the council to meet in an in-game chat channel to review
  the information from all parties. All council members directly involved in the
  situation under review will be removed from participation in the decision
  making process. Further the Dragon Elders will limit their participation to
  coordinating the discussion and moderating the chat channel. Upon reviewing
  all available information the council will make a decision on the matter and
  if necessary will decide on the appropriate action to be taken as punishment.</p>
  <p>The Dragon Elders will serve as the appeals council in the matter. The
  Dragon Elders will have the authority to overturn or adjust the decision of
  the Dragon's Council at their discretion.</p>
  <p>Disciplinary actions may include but are not limited to the following and
  will affect all characters in the member's family of characters.:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Demotion in guild rank.</p>
    <p>B.&nbsp; Removal of guild title.</p>
    <p>C.&nbsp; Probation status</p>
    <p>D. Guild removal</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XVII.&nbsp; Leaving the Guild</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan recognizes that there may arise the situation where
  members will leave the guild. Members may choose to do so either voluntarily
  or involuntarily.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A.&nbsp; Voluntary removal from Silver Dragon Clan</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Silver Dragon Clan understands that members may choose to leave the
      guild for various reasons. If a member decides to remove themselves from
      the guild, they will need to inform the Dragon Elders prior to using the
      /guildremove command.</p>
      <p>The Dragon Elders would like to be aware of why members choose to leave
      to determine if there is an area of dissatisfaction that may need to be
      addressed. This also allows the member to maintain an amicable
      relationship with the guild as there may be other members of their family
      of characters that they would like to keep in Silver Dragon Clan.</p>
      <p>From past experience, the Dragon Elders have found that members
      choosing to leave Silver Dragon Clan for another guild, often find that
      they wish to return. By discussing the matter with the Dragon Elders
      arrangements can be made for a leave of absence if necessary so that guild
      ranks may be maintained.</p>
      <p>Dependent on the circumstance surrounding the members decision to leave
      Silver Dragon Clan, the Dragon Elders reserve the right to require the
      member to remove all characters of their family from Silver Dragon Clan.</p>
      <p>If a member chooses not to notify the Dragon Elders that they are
      removing a character then they may proceed in using the /guildremove
      command, however they will be expected to do so for all members of their
      family of characters. If they do not remove all characters, then any
      remaining characters in Silver Dragon Clan are subject to guild removal
      with out warning or notice.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise informed by the Dragon Elders, any members leaving
      Silver Dragon Clan will lose any and all guild titles, ranks and status.
      If the character then chooses to rejoin Silver Dragon Clan, they will be
      required to complete the application process and sponsorship period.
      Further the Dragon Elders reserve the right require additional tasks of
      the previous member as a condition of their application process.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>B.&nbsp; Involuntary removal from Silver Dragon Clan</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As a result of disciplinary action a member may be required to
      /guildremove their family of characters for a specified period of time or permanently.</p>
      <p>If it is determined that a member must do so, then the member is
      expected to carry out the /guildremove command for each member of their
      family of characters under the supervision of a member of the Dragon's
      Council. If the member refuses to honor this requirement and members of
      the Dragon's Council are required to issue the /guildremove command then
      that member will forfeit the ability to rejoin Silver Dragon Clan with any
      character in the future.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>XVIII.&nbsp; Amendments to this Charter</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silver Dragon Clan is in a constant state of growth and change. As such the
  need will arise for certain policies of the guild to be changed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The charter will always be accessible on the guild web site for viewing and
  review. Once the changes are made notification will be posted to guild members
  on the guild message board. The changes will go into effect upon posting,
  however a grace period of seven days will be allowed to give members an
  opportunity to become familiar the new requirements.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
