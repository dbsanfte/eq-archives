1: The Sundering of Earth.<br>
<br>
In a time not far from our own, the world we call Earth was running out of fossil fuels, and the land was scarred from nuclear radiation from <br>
<br>
 both power facilities and wars alike. Almost all energy came from the sun, or the heat from within the Earth. Eventually the skies became <br>
<br>
polluted, and the world was on the brink of disaster.<br>
<br>
Eventually an international council was formed to solve the problem, and decided that the warring nations would set their differences aside <br>
<br>
and cooperate to build a number of space vessels to be sent out in search of hospitable planets. In the end, several hundred space vessels <br>
<br>
were sent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2: Exodus. <br>
<br>
Several star systems were found, however one ship found a system with 6 planets with perfect living conditions for humans. However, though <br>
<br>
only a few years had passed for the ships, hundreds and hundreds of years had passed on Earth. When message had finally arrived on Earth, the <br>
<br>
entire population had been in preparation to leave. There were many humans who wished to stay on Earth, weather than flying into the <br>
<br>
mysteries of space...<br>
<br>
The Second Fleet arrived several hundred relative years later. The thinking of the new humans was highly militaristic, and the leaders of men <br>
<br>
were determined to unite all the worlds under one rule. The origianal fleet's human occupied planets, otherwise known as Dwellings, were <br>
<br>
quick to abide by the orders of the newly formed Alliance. Anyone who didnt was &quot;persuaded by force&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3: The Outcasts<br>
<br>
3 Ships from the origional fleet found a system with a single planet. The world itself was uninhabitable like a gas giant, but it had 3 moons <br>
<br>
that had similar atmospheres to earth. The ships landed on each of the moons, but the moons radiated a mysterious field that disallowed any <br>
<br>
electrical currrents to run. So the pioneers were stranded and cut off from the rest of the humans.<br>
<br>
These moons were like nothing anyone had ever seen before. They were brimming with magic,something that no one ever thought was real. The <br>
<br>
first moon was a forested one. It was filled with a magically forged metal ore. The ore  was entwined with everything. It was the building <br>
<br>
block of the moon. It was arguably the strongest metal any human had ever laid eyes on. After hundreds of years, they became entwined within <br>
<br>
the magical flows of the moon, and were able to use the metals to make weapons of unimaginable power. But knowing that upseting nature might <br>
<br>
ruin the magic that the moon gave to them, they had a deep deep respect for nature, and lived in relatively primative lifestyle.<br>
<br>
the Second moon, was made of billions of small islands in one global ocean. The sky was always a golden pinkish hue, and the oceans were <br>
<br>
pristine teals and blues and whites. The ocean was brimming with magical creatures and energies. The people eventually harnessed these <br>
<br>
energies and were gifted with the power to control the elements of fire, wind, and magic of the purest sense.<br>
<br>
The third moon was not as beautiful as the other ones. It was filled with cliffs and mountains, and was very rocky. This moon had creatures <br>
<br>
and more creatures. Soon the people became druids and lycanthropes. They could change forms into any creature they wanted, but strived to <br>
<br>
prefect their control over the transformations. The stronger their human forms were, the strength of their animal form would grow <br>
<br>
exponeitially.<br>
<br>
All three of these moons lived lifes dedicated to fighting, everyone constantly trained and fought for sport, it was their form of <br>
<br>
recreation. When the moons all were going to float within a few miles of each other, the leaders of the Outcasts knew that the event was one <br>
<br>
that had to be taken advantage of. They used their energies to construct a shrine at the north pole of each moon, and used their powers to <br>
<br>
create a tractor beam that kept the moons in a triangle close to eachother, that doubled as a portal to travel between the planets. Since <br>
<br>
there was no plausible reason for war, the 3 moons peacefully coexisted for more hundreds of years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The 3 moons, now called San-Tsuki have heard rumors from traveling traders of a horrible army of the alliance are combing the area for any <br>
<br>
human life. They are inevitably going to reacch San-Tsuki and will try to force the inhabitants into a life of oppression and slavery.<br>
<br>
The Story<br>
Charecters I still need names for them (i tell you the hair types so you can get an idea of their image)<br>
(W) and (X) are brothers. W is considered popular in the community and is the best swordsman in San-Tsuki. He is a pimp and hs all the luck with the ladies, and X is jealous about it. He wields 2 of the best-crafted swords in the universe, they are thought to be indestructable. The swords are house to <br>
<br>
magic gems that give W estraordinary powers when he is at an emotional peak. If W is away from his swords, then he can summon them into his <br>
<br>
grip at will. He has red crew-cut hair.<br>
<br>
 X is more of a loner, he is hopeless with girls and has a bad fear of heights. When X was little, he was exploring a cave and fell into a <br>
<br>
pool of molten Ore. He absorbed the pure essence of the Ore and, instead of lugging a weapon around, he can materialzie blades from his palms <br>
<br>
to do his bidding, be it ninja stars for attacking at a distance, or a sword-like weapons for close quarters. These mmagic blaldes cannot <br>
<br>
remain in existance for more than a few moments, nor can they remain if they become damaged or cracked by an enemy. He has long raggidy <br>
<br>
white-blue hair.<br>
<br>
(Y) is a sorceress from the ocean world. She is sweet and innocent, and has a crush on nearly every cute boy she sees, but dont be fooled, if <br>
<br>
you piss her of she can be a real bitch. She is adept at using fire and light to attack her foes. She finds close quarter combat impure, <br>
<br>
sticking to ranged attacks. She has long blue hair possibly in a ponytail or braided.<br>
<br>
Z is a lycanthrope from the rock world. He is the comic-relief, always making wise-cracks and getting in the last word. He can transform into <br>
<br>
a werewolf when fighting, but when forced into emotional apex he transforms into a half-wolf half-phoenix creature. he can control animal <br>
<br>
behaviour. He has long long long brown hair, it goes down to his waist and on the front of his shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
The story first has to do with protecting San-Tsuki from the Invading Alliance. There will be a war on san-tsuki but in the end the alliance <br>
<br>
will retreat and return with full forces. Before they do, these 4 people set out on a quest to find a sacred charm that lies in the hands of <br>
<br>
the alliance. The charm will protect San-Tsuki forever.<br>
<br>
Later when they find both the Captain of the Alliance and the charm in his possession, they will learn that earth has been taken over by an <br>
<br>
evil force, and the alliance was simply trying to amas an army to dispel the darkness from their homeland. However the creatures and <br>
<br>
remaining humans there have been twisted into demons.<br>
<br>
Thats all i have so far<br>
<br>
once i get my scanner, i can post a picture of everyone<br>
plz help with names... i could only think of san-tsuki (japanese translated &quot;3 moons&quot;)<br>
<br>

Questions:<br>
1. if the planet is low on fossil fuels than what do the ships run on? I would have to assume that they're solar powered in order for that too. But...<br>
2. If the ships are solar powered what happens when the sun or a star is obstructed? <br>
3. Now, when you say, that a long time has passed on Earth but not for the &quot;explorers&quot;, How is that? I'm going to assume that it must be some kind of stasis during the travel.Unless they have some form of hyper speed. Also... <br>
4.if the Earth is in desperate need of new planets, than just how much time would they have for the &quot;explorers&quot; to find the planets. <br>
<br>
I'm only asking these questions because I believe they're important to adding some depth and eventually some one always wonders about those kinda things... <br>
<br>
best of luck<br>

<br>
well the counntries had to cooperate and combine what they had left for their one last shot at a new salvation... afterwards whenever they found a sun they would collect power for a while before moving on. i never really thought about it<br>
<br>
the ships collect enough sunlight while they are near a sun and store it.<br>
<br>
The ships are moving extremely fast... enough for space travel. einsteins theory of relativity states that if you are moving fast then time is distorted... so inside the ships time moves slower than outside the ship... im not too certain on how it works<br>
<br>
after the ships leave earth, earth then prepares for a response.. they have no idea how long it will take... they use satalite dishes that collect sunlight then relay the energy to energy plants. it is not very effective and only provides enough energy for co2-&gt; o2 converters and other survival brickabrack... the people are now under militaristic rule and have been moved into camps just waiting for the saviors to come...<br>
however the exodus of earth is only a short part of the story..<br>
<br>
<br>
other updates:<br>
ive thought about it and i figure that the lycanthropes should live on the forest moon and the blade warriors should live on the rocky moon... that would make more logical sense<br>
<br>
now about the demons...<br>
in the beginning of time when the universe was being forged, there was a war between good and evil... a demon's axe was chipped, and the chipped piece floated through space for bazillions of years... its like the size of like... a large house.. and crashes into earth after the ships came back and left again... inside the stone is pur eevil and it comsumes the planet turning the remaining humans into demons and all the leftover creatures into giant monsters and the entire world is dark an black and lava and ash <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofaeolus>FireOfAeolus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/11/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1012.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: questions</span><hr size=1> Ok i finally looked up some names tell me if they sounds good<br>
