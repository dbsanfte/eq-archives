I like his face, espeically his chin and neck.  His long arms and large hands are pretty interesting too, very unique in some way.  His horns with adornment and spiky shoulder thingys are a really nice touch too.  <br><br>What's kind of amusing is if you put your hand over your monitor so it covers everything bellow his waist, it looks like a different sized character (a smaller one).  Then if you reverse that it looks like his legs, feet, and forearm are part of a larger man.  It's almost like two differently sized characters where meshed together.  Cool!<br><br>I would agree with the left leg problem.  It's not so much where it connects to the body but how it's angled and the perspective involved with that.  Actually it does involve his hips too.  You have him almost stepping back or with the left leg/foot slightly back from his right leg and foot.  the problem is that this is not represented in his hips.  His hips should be tilted downward in the direction of his left leg.  In which case, his right leg with have to come forward a bit so that it's centered under his neck divot (so that it appears he's supporting his weight).  An alternative is to change the perspective near his feet so that his left foot is down further and almost in line with the plane his right foot rests on.  This would be a quicker fix if you feel the desire to go back in and change it later.  It does kind of look like his left leg is to short compared to his right even if it’s supposed to be slightly recessed.<br><br>This is more of a personal qualm I have with some artist’s styles but please give male characters their dignity! ^_~  It looks as if he's been neutered completely; no nothin down there, poor guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Just one of those things.  I actually saw a pretty interesting analysis of 90's style comic art on TV one day a while ago; it was just a little news tid-bit that Space (Canada's Sci-Fi channel) aired.  It was suggested that due to the liberalization of sexuality in the West for the past few decades, sexuality is becoming more and more blurry and ambiguous.  To counter this effect, comic artists began to exaggerate certain anatomical proportions like women's breasts (Perhaps culminating in Joe Madureira's more recent work) and men’s musculature which almost became grotesque at times.  Hence, sexual ambiguity has been dashed by anatomical exaggeration in extreme's in some cases.  Of course the male crotch disappeared (Lee and McFarlane) so as to eliminate any homoerotic possibilities.  It was surely an interesting examination of 1990 North American mainstream comic illustrations, although I have elaborated of course since it was just a clip ^^.<br><br>Of course, predictably enough, the pendulum seems to have swung into equilibrium in North America with more comic artists returning to a more natural, less tight, style.  It's almost bloby but quite natural.  It's a refreshing development to say the least.  <p><p><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Brian Bork</FONT><center><p><FONT face=Verdana size=1><u>Quote</u></FONT><br><FONT face=Verdana size=1>"Certo, un diavol dell'inferno <br>Qui il ha fatti capitar."</FONT><br><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Le Nozze di Figaro</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=browndog>BrownDog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/18/02 9:30:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Brimstone bio pic</span><hr size=1> Another note about his pose is his hands.
