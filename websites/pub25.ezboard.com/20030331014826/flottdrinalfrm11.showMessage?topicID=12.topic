<br>
Today's journal shall be brief as I actually ate lunch during my lunch hour rather than sit and my desk and work through it, hence I really only have a few minutes.  <br>
<br>
Once again, my explorations were severely limited last night by a very iffy packet loss rate.  I was afraid to fight anything that could really give me benefit me in gaining my 30th season.  I tried an Undead Cyclops with a druid friend and after wasting a good 40 or so arrows on it, I went LD just as the druid was preparing to nuke it to death.<br>
<br>
Of course, it took me a few minutes to get back on, the druid had killed the Clops and looted, so I had nothing to show for it but low health and a significant loss of many for the arrows.  It was at this point I became exasperated at my DSL and decided to camp for the evening.  <br>
<br>
Nightly totals - 3 blue bubbs , now only 103 Orange Bubbles from lvl 50, and 514 blue bubbles from level 50.<br>
<br>
Strategy Note - Reds used to be easy to kill in a good twosome, but that is no longer the case.  I guess this is a showing that I am now getting to the more tactical stages of the game.  This is both good, and bad.<br>
<br>
Interesting Note - A guy I met when I came back to the game a couple of months ago is now abotu to leave the game.  When I came back he was a couple of levels under me (12 vs 9).  In the last couple of months he has gotten all the way to lvl 44, but is totally bored with fighting fighting fighting.  I told him to go questing for a few days, or develop a secondary character to play on down days, but evidently he is a typical power-leveller than burns out in games in no time.  Guess this just proves the point that the game is what you make it.  If you relax and enjoy it, and enjoy the quests, and the time spent socializing, you will most likely enjoy the game more than merely logging in the level each night.  <br>

I had just a modem and could never hook up better than 26000 (NOTE: If you move, get a new number as they will just reroute the line to your new residence through the junction box next to your old residence.  If you move 4 times like I did, conection speed just get worse every move).  However, at 26800, I never had a PL problem and dropped much less than most. <p><a href=http://terstai.trafficblast.com/drinal target=_top><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/chey_sig.jpg border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utpar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TPar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council of Lords</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/01 12:57:59 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daily Journal - DSL Strikes Back</span><hr size=1> DSL seems to depend on a variety of things.  These include, but aren't limited to:  The DSL provider, the type of DSL connection you have, the phase of the moon, the time of day, the condition of the tide, the outside weather, sunspots, the existence of UFO's, and a host of other bizarre circumstances.  While DSL seems to be quite fast, and normally pretty reliable for me, there are days when I have severe packet loss, followed by a link death every 3 or 4 hours.  It could be blamed on the internet in general I suppose, but I think that most &quot;internet&quot; problems are ISP's wishing to blame their own incompetency on someone else.  The nameless, anonymous internet is always a good target.<br>

<br>
DSL is an awe-inspiring technology, just as cable modems are.  The only real difference is that if and when cable modems become too popular the bandwidth will be shared by all the people on your main cable line back to the cable office.  This is not a very good thing for the future, as some cable companies are now even sending movies downstream over cable lines to users on demand.  This chews up bandwidth badly.  Fortunately for cable modem users this has not become very popular yet.<br>
<br>
DSL - which is run over standard copper wire that has been in place for decades for phone use, is similar (sometimes better, sometimes worse) to cable modems in speed.  However, the bandwidth is yours and yours alone (as much as it can be that is, given the way the internet works).  I am running 4 PC's in my house and can easily be playing 4 online games at once, or better yet, watching live sports (that I can't get locally) on one computer screen while playing online games easily on all the others.<br>
<br>
The issue that is causing me problems is the youth of the technology.  So many people are getting it in Atlanta now, Bellsouth is having to constantly upgrade equipment in their Central Office and such to keep up with demand, well ok, they can't even keep up!  This means, maybe one or two days a month someone or something went wrong during an upgrade and we have DSL issues for a while.  Which means I can usually browse the internet, but packet loss is bad enough that it is simiar in speed to 56k modem, and the packet loss is so bad you can forget playing any current online RPG's.  <br>
<br>
On a technical note, I don't really have DSL.  I have fiber lines to my house, so I run what many called I-FitL or FFTP.  Which uses the same type of packaging as DSL, it just has greater limits on distance.  Unfortunately, most people do not have this capability as they are working off ancient phone lines.<br>
<br>
Any way you slice it, I have had 6 months of unreal speed and only one or two bad days every other month or so.  It has definitely been a blessing for my online gaming.  I remember my dial-up experiencing just as many, if not more outages, and the speed was awful and inconsistent.  So yes, DSL is awesome, and it will only get better as the infrastructure catches up to it.<br>

DSL is an ever fickle technology as it is, indeed, somewhat new yet running over existing copper telephone wiring.  I remember seeing a report that somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-90% of the world's telephone lines were a century old.......can you say problematic?<br>
<br>
oh yeah.<br>

It is actually pretty amazing how well the copper lines are holding up.  I myself work for a big bad, everyone hates us, regional bell company, so I know all about the issues of keeping everything running well on copper.<br>
<br>
Honestly, the more I see of the the phone company and the equipment the more amazed I am that in the last 5 years I have never failed to have a dial tone at my house with the exception of extremely severe weather conditions.  Compare that with Cable which goes out when it rains too hard, or satelleite which goes out all the time.  These technologies are running on relatively new mediums compared to traditional copper of the phone industry, and yet they don't work worth a crap.  I guess somebody way back when did something right.  Or maybe, jst maybe, government protected psuedo-monopolies might actually work better ... shhh ... I think someone might label me as a communist for thinking like that.  And to think I actually consider myself an anti-big-government libertarian.  Yikes.<br>
