I mean I even have what casual clothes both men and women wear of all races, and sketches below each and every discription, and what combat clothes both men and women wear, and you get the idea. But the best thing is, men and women are seen as EQUAL'S! No need for fighting for women's rights! Weeell......there may be some hesitance in allowing the women into combat at first, but when they show there skill hell yes they'll be excepted! =D I just love how the whole setup is going, I mean I haven't even TOUCHED the storyline yet, I've thought about the plot a bit though....And yes, it's a Monarchy, but the Monarchy is an evil and mischevious one at that - and inside the castle's courtyard are where all main events are held, and market's for food and supplies....There'll be bands of theives and assassin's, and some sort of Ninja's and Samurai's.

It would be a 1st person game for starters, because that's the way we see things.  I don't see things through a camera over my head.  Secondly, any guns you get to use in the game will require you to actually go through a training course to use them.  There's no way you'd be able to use an M4A1 and keep your finger on the trigger...  you have to use the burst fire.  Then it would work like an RPG.  You have missions to accomplish, people to meet and talk to who will give you various different responses based on the type of person you are.  Ultimately, you should be a good guy, but you could be the no nonsense 'Shoot first, ask questions later' type of person, and people may not open up to you as well.  These are just some crazy thinkings though...  Maybe I'll write a story for it later. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That which does not kill us, makes us stranger.<br><img src="http://www.methart.com/signature.jpg "></img><a href="http://www.methart.com"><img src="http://www.methart.com/button/methart-fire.jpg " border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prismrefraction>PrismRefraction</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/26/02 3:56:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=296.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: if you could develop a game......</span><hr size=1> Fallout is basically that.<br><br>I have a great story for my game, around FF6 level(no where near FF7, I'll try it on another story).<br><br>It takes place in post-nuclear war era(600 years past).

They seem to be highly popular though...The only one i really want to play at the moment is final fantasy 10. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/bprojectk" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.liquid2k.com/projectk/projectklink.jpg" border="0"></a> HASSAN Chop!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prismrefraction>PrismRefraction</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/27/02 4:01:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=296.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: if you could develop a game......</span><hr size=1> RPG charactors never actually consider the anarchy and terror that happens after the destruction of an empire... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usupadude5000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>supadude5000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/27/02 4:52:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=296.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: if you could develop a game......</span><hr size=1> could my questions plz be answered????!!!!!!!!!?????

Tribes 2 one's easy to figure out tho...<br><br>For modelling programs I'd like to say I use Maya but i dont have a legal copy so 3D Studio Max 4 is what i use (yay go school and go giving me free copy yay promising student whooo go meee lol) and theres alot of small modeling programs that people usually use in mods for half life like Milkshape etc... <br><br>Programming.... Oy Vay lol to many different languages but mostly C or C++ is what works best in my point of view, (maybe someone with more knowledge in programming can suggest something else if theres better)<br><br>i think thats about it for getting started and pretty well done the game than u gota go through all the business shiz if u wana release it. <p><-> "I know hip hop *turns had back and smiles*" <-></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prismrefraction>PrismRefraction</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/27/02 9:09:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=296.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: if you could develop a game......</span><hr size=1> Direct X is pretty good when coupled with C++.<br><br>JAMagic is pretty decent, 300 bucks, learn a new language, it's a program that is made for 3d game making. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=296.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=296.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=296.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=296.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.emailToFriend?topicID=296.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.threadControl?topicID=296.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=296.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=296.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32>VG Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
