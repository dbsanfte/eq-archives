You have to have a good sense of humor. And must try to keep each comic reletively short.<br>
<br>

Well you must obviously be able to CG. I'd prefer it if you had an example i can go off of. The type of coloring I want is Cel style.<br>

Well, I hope to get some replies. Any questions...just ask.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A boy with a mysterious talent.  A talent that no one else has.<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A talent that is mutating.  And with every breath he takes, it becomes stronger...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are a million galaxies in each…therefore there are a million life forms in 1.<br>

The Enhancement<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I lay in the comfortable bed, sleeping, my dreams became scarier and scarier. I wake up with small drops of sweat on my face and with a tear coming down my cheek.  It's only 2 weeks before I get out of this hospital, I thought to myself.  <br>
&quot;I wonder if any one is going to visit today...?&quot;  I said as the cute nurse had walked in the room.  She had blue eyes, nice curly brown hair, and she was slim.<br>
&quot;When am I gettin' out?&quot; I asked just to make sure of the date.  <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, you are recovering very fast from the accident.  I think you'll be out in about 2 weeks.&quot; So I guess  I was right.  <br>
“Hey can you get me anything to write with?&quot;  I'm a pretty talented artist so I try to draw as much as I can.  It's going to be my career.  I’ve been in 4 accidents before.  I was in a bus accident...that was what I kept on dreaming of.  <br>
&quot;I'll bring you some food, a paper and pencil.  I'll be back soon&quot;.  <br>
&quot;Can you bring me something sweet?&quot;.  <br>
&quot;Yes, I’ll bring you Orange juice.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Thanks&quot;.  As she left the room I started to get a really bad headache.  I heard something really high pitched, and I felt like something was pounding on my head like a hammer.  I had a vision...but it wasn't that clear.  I always draw my visions, that's how I inspired &quot;myself&quot; to draw. <br>
When the nurse came back I started to draw what I saw.  “Wow, you have some talent.” Said the nurse.  <br>
“Yea I know.  I’m going to be an artist soon.”  <br>
“Yes, I can tell by the way you draw.  Very nice.”  While I was drawing, the nurse and I heard a scream down the hall.  I got up out of the bed and went to see what it was.  It sounded like an old lady.  One of the patients was going mad.  He had started to strangle the old lady.<br>
Security came by and beat him down to the floor.  They had left a small scar on his back.  My picture was the picture of a young man on the floor with burble coming out of his mouth, and a small mark running down his back as if he had gotten scratched by something sharp.  I thought that it was just a coincidence that the guy strangling the old lady looked like my person.  “Heh, look at my drawing.  Kinda looks like that guy right?”  <br>
“Yea…Kinda.” The nurse and I were both looking at each other with a strange look….<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A few hours later my mother came to visit me.  She had dark brown eyes, dirty blonde hair, and was kind of chubby…my father is dead so I don’t think he’d be coming around here…I had only gotten to see him twice before he died in a ship wreck.  He looked like a tough man; he was practically the opposite of me.  For a strange reason he always left home whenever I would try to do things with him.  He had a small birthmark on his neck with the number two on his neck… Just like me.<br>
“Hi, mom.”  <br>
“Hello, son…how do you feel?”… <br>
“I…I have a bad headache.”  I really needed something to calm the pain down.  I was still feeling thumps on my head, like when I had the vision.  <br>
“Mom, can you ask the nurse to get me something to make the pain go away?”… <br>
“Ok son.” As my mom left the room to get the nurse I laid on my bed with a sick feeling in my stomach.  Darkness fell on top of me and I couldn’t see anything for a few seconds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I passed out.  When my mom came back, she started to shake me back and forward with her hands on my shoulder.  <br>
“Son, Wake up!!”…I could hear her screams but I couldn’t open my eyes.  I felt something sharp go into my shoulder.  Slowly I had opened my eyes, and saw 2 faces over me.  They were really blurry at first, but soon I regained my correct vision.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The Training<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My mother and the nurse were watching close for any signs of sickness.  “Nurse, is he ok?”… <br>
“He’ll be fine…you don’t have to worry about it.  I gave him his shot, he should be fine for quite a while.”  I was listening to the conversation, while trying to get up on the bed, and sit upright.  It all sounded like gibberish to me for some reason… I couldn’t get why…?  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt really drowsy.  Once my mom and the nurse stopped speaking I took my food that I hadn’t eaten in some time and started to drink some orange juice.  I took the small batch of peas that were on the plate and started to chew on them.  They were really bad.  I didn’t want to eat it, but I was so hungry that I just ate everything on the plate.  I began to feel better, and a little bit stronger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I felt like I was changing…  I told my mom how I felt, and she said that it was just a stage I was going through.  Heh, I thought that I went through “that” change already. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “All you need is a little bit of sleep.”  She said, while giving me a gleeful grin.  Two weeks later the doctor said that I can now get out and do a little bit of exercise, but not too much because I had an almost healed knee and a swollen ankle.  At around 6:00 P.M. I left the hospital and finally headed for home.  When I got back into the dump, I went strait to my room and laid on the bed…feeling the comfort of being back.  The place was practically different to me, since I had been gone for so long and all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had sat down on my chair and leaned on to of my small, but efficient, desk to draw anything that came on my mind.  For a while I thought about that day at the hospital.  How did I do it?  It’s like… I saw what was going to happen.  I got up from the rough wooden chair and went to my house to get something to drink.  When I got there my mother was there.  She was making something in a big pot of water.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mom….” I had said in a low voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes? …What is it son?” She said in a kind of rough voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “One day at the hospital… A man started to choke an old lady.” I explained to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, I’m not bringin’ you there anymore.”  She said as if I had just told a joke.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I had a vision a few minutes before it happened… It was blurry so I’m not too sure what it was.  I think that it was a man struggling to get up, after being beat down into the floor, and an old lady trying to breath.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, that’s a coincidence.” She looked at me for a second and then back at the pot to stir whatever was inside it.  “You know… your father had a little ability.  That’s why he took him away.”  She said in a strange voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Him…?  Who is… him?” I asked while heading to the refrigerator.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “God, my son.”  She went to a cabinet reaching for something.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grabbed a packaged drink and began to walk back to my room.  “Ability?” I muttered under my breath.<br>
<br>
<br>
