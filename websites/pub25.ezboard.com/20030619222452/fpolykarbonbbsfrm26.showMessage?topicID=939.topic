The first issue is already set up but this introduction comes later for one of my main characters, Sebastian, a vampire.  It's not comic book script yet but this is supposed to be a sample of my writing, not script.<br>
<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
&quot;I was motivated only for my people, although they had in truth, done very little for me.  Those long and weary nights spent in study drove me further into madness even as I searched for the answers.  My sleep during the day was fitful and fleeting at best as I dreamed of equations and astounding possibilities.  Are philosophers right when they say that truth can be found in insanity?  I was driven to preserve my dying kind at any cost and in a smaller sense, myself.  I was pushed to find true immortality because our time was running out.<br>
<br>
There were the traditional methods for preservation, I suppose, but it was full of danger and there was always room for grievous error.  Children could be turned by the Purity but the era was different.  Children no longer revered or respected their Mothers and Mothers lost all hope of ever teaching their Children.  Both sides either stopped caring or never did in the first place.  These Children would gladly take Purity and soil it.  They would strike out on their own to seek answers and wreak havoc on our fragile structure. They would create Rogues, fashion humans into Slaves and inflict their seeming invulnerability upon the world.  These Children would have to be destroyed by the very hand that created them and this was probably the most painful blow of all.  To destroy our own kind was only a setback in our quest and it also drained our strength.  Most of us were too old to fight such battles.<br>
<br>
I, however, had two battles to face.  For one, I, myself was a Son.  I had been carefully selected by my Mother for Purity and once the gift was given, I was sequestered away from the world.  I was carefully schooled and taught everything I needed to know about my people.  My discipline was also harsh when I misbehaved.  My young life was nearly expired on several occasions to teach me that I was NOT immortal and of course, the all important lesson of humility.  I think I turned out rather well, considering the failure of many of my breatheren but the very methods that made me who I am, also worked against me.  Because my Mother had kept me so secret, when I finally made my appearance at his side in our society, I was looked upon with fear and resentment.  My Mother was deemed insane but he remained firm in his belief of proper Birth nevertheless.  I was his model Son and I did my best to prove myself. <br>
<br>
From the moment I was gifted with Purity, Mother taught me that in order to walk among humanity, I must immerse myself completely into life once more.  I must think of my life now as night and day.  During the day I appear an ordinary citizen of the world while at night, I must strive to be an extraordinary member of my kind.  I would continue on from where I left off.  I had been putting myself through a college of philosophy but with my extended time and newfound abilities, I studied three times the amount I had before and delved also into the metaphysical.  I was able to find a leisurely but more indepth pace at which to pursue my goals.<br>
<br>
It was apparent from the time of my birth that we aged.  The cellular decay process was slower than with human beings but with my young eyes, I could see the progression.  When we are young, we are virtually invulnerable.  Our exterior flesh is the texture of fine marble and almost impossible to penetrate.  As we grow older however, the texture becomes more like delicate ceramic.  Strong mental skills become the key to survival because our bodies can be broken and with that, Death follows.&quot;<br>
