INT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT (11:25pm)<br>
<br>
DYLAN and SASHA are sitting around in front of a computer, clicking and laughing occasionally.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Hey, The first season of Trigun DVD's<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I already have it, what about Ranma 1/2?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Have it, Aliens Boxed set?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Have it, Soul Reaver?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Have it, DAMN isn't there ANYTHING on ebay we don't already have?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
How about the Necronomicon, don't think we have that.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I think your right, bid<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Ok, now we play the waiting game<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Feel like playing PS2 instead?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Hell yeah.<br>
<br>
INT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT (4:15am)<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha come back in chatting about the game they just played and sit down at the computer.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I still say that your controller is sticky.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Dylan, it's not sticky, you just forgot that it was down, left, right, left, right, up, down, X, triangle, X, circle. Admit it.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
It was all you and your damn sticky controller! I demand a rematch!<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Never mind that, we were the highest bidder on the Necronomicon!<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
w00t. When will we get it?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
4-6 days.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Excellent, what do you want to do until then?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
PS2?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
You know it!<br>
<br>
<br>
EXT. STREET. DAY<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are walking down a street talking.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Did it come yet?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I hope so, it should have.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What do you want to do with it when we get it?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I was thinking of just leaving it on my coffee table, you know, as a conversation piece.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
We COULD do that, or we could try out some of the spells in it.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Do you know what they do?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Not really, but I think I heard something about a fog spell.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Whatever, first we have to see if we actually got it<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Then lets get down to the post office.<br>
<br>
EXT.  POST OFFICE DOORS.  DAY<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are standing in front of the doors.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Cross your fingers<br>
<br>
They enter the post office<br>
<br>
INT.  POST OFFICE.  DAY<br>
<br>
Sasha opens the post office box and lists through the mail, the last thing he takes out is a package slip.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Sweet! It came!<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Lets go pick it up at the desk.<br>
<br>
EXT.  POST OFFICE DOORS.  DAY<br>
<br>
Sasha and Dylan are holding the book.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Crack that thing open! I want to see what's in it.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Maybe we should go to your house and look at it there.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Because if people see us reading it they might be like &quot;They're witches! Burn them!&quot; and it wouldn't be good.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Good point.<br>
<br>
EXT.  STREET.  DAY.<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are walking down the street, back the way they came. There are a large amount of crows in the trees and over the wind is a barely audible voice.<br>
<br>
WIND<br>
watch out watch out watch out<br>
<br>
Wind<br>
danger danger danger<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Do you hear something?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What kind of something?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Some sort of voice<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
No<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Oh, Ok.<br>
<br>
INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are reading the book.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Hey, want to try out one of these spells?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Ok, which one<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I dunno, you pick one.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Well my Ancient Arabic is a bit rusty, but I think this one summons fog.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Ooo, Wow, Fog, I can barely contain my excitement.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Well it's the only one I can read, if you gave me longer I could probably read more, but as it stands right now this is the only one we can try and cast.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Fine, tonight we'll go to the graveyard and try to make some fog, but YOU keep reading, I want to know how to make something more substantial.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Deal, until then lets play some FFX.<br>
<br>
EXT.  IN FRONT OF DYLANS HOUSE.  NIGHT/DUSK<br>
<br>
Dylan, ASHER and Sasha do up their jackets and start walking.<br>

<br>
Sasha<br>
Cool<br>
<br>
EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT/DUSK<br>

Walking down the street they start hearing more voices in the wind.<br>
<br>

Sasha<br>

<br>
Dylan<br>
No<br>
<br>
Wind<br>
you don't know what your doing<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Are you sure you didn't hear that?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I didn't hear anything, your just scared and imagining things, stop freaking out.<br>
<br>
Asher <br>
*cough*@#%$*cough*<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I'm not freaking out, and you (pointing at Asher) Shut up. (back to Dylan) I was just asking you if you heard anything.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
And I didn't, so stop bothering me and make sure you know that fog spell.<br>
<br>
EXT.  GRAVEYARD.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Dylan, Asher and Sasha find a place to stand and Sasha starts reading from the book.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
You ready?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I think so.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Well then hurry up and do it already.<br>
<br>
Asher<br>
Yeah, it's cold out here.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Ok, *clears throat* Delarnous hekiatak hrgrathauk herstartaun kelatouk.<br>
<br>
They pause and wait, looking around expectedly.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Well?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
It should start soon.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I think you failed, lets go home, you can start reading that more, trying to figure out what you did wrong, and how to do other stuff.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Deal, do you want to wait around a bit longer to see if anything happens.<br>
<br>
A high pitched scream fills the air.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
No, I'm fine with leaving now<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Yeah, me too.<br>
<br>
Asher starts running away<br>
<br>
Asher<br>
WAY ahead of you!<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha take off running.<br>
<br>
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY.  NOON (Next Day)<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are sitting at a table.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
That was messed up last night.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Are you still on that? it was probably like a cat or something.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Whatever<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Did you figure out anymore about what that book was saying?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
A bit, I don't think we did anything wrong with that spell though.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Well we obviously did, because I didn't see any fog.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Yeah, I guess, I'll keep reading, say, feel like doing something tonight?<br>

Dylan<br>
Ok.<br>

Asher starts to take Sour Cream and various spices out of the fridge. From another part of the house a door slams.<br>
<br>

Hello? Dylan, you and Sasha back already?<br>
<br>
No response, just the sound of someone with a bad leg shuffling forward.<br>
<br>
Asher<br>
Hello? Who's there?<br>
<br>
More shuffling, coming closer. Asher walks towards the door, which goes to the hallway which leads to the door. <br>

He looks out and sees a man dragging a broken leg, shuffling towards him.<br>

While we're waiting for him feel like smoking some of that fine herb?<br>
<br>

INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY.  DAY  (Next Day)<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are sitting at a table.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I just don’t know what could have happened.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I think I might have an idea<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What is it?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I was reading more of the Necronomicon last night<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
And?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I think the spell we cast was to summon the undead.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
And they might have been what killed your brother.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
So basically what your saying is we’re screwed.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Not necessarily, sure they may have only one goal, that being killing the ones who raised it, aka. Us.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Screwed.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
But if they can’t do it in 48 hours, they return to the dead.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
So at 4:20am tonight we’re safe?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
As far as I can tell yes.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Well tonight, we’ll be ready.<br>
<br>
INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.<br>
<br>
Sasha is holding an axe, Dylan is holding a chainsaw. They are sitting on a couch with chairs in front of the doors. Suddenly there is a crash from outside.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I guess this is it.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Want to go kill whatever’s out there?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
You bet.<br>
<br>
They pull the chair away from the door and head out.<br>
<br>
EXT.  IN FRONT OF DYLANS HOUSE.  NIGHT.<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha start looking around, everything is completely quiet. They start searching around in bushes.<br>
<br>
Wind<br>
watch out watch out watch out<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
You have to have heard it this time.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I think I might have<br>
<br>
Wind<br>
They’re coming.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Ok, I definitely heard that<br>
<br>
They start seeing large groups of zombies walking up the road towards them.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
There’s to many to take all at once, get back in the house, we might be able to survive in close quarters.<br>
<br>
They run back into the house<br>
<br>
INT.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha run into the kitchen, looking around frantically. <br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
We should go to the cold room, we may be able to hold them off there.<br>
<br>
They run into the basement.<br>
<br>
INT.  BASEMENT.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
They run into the Cold Room.<br>
<br>
INT.  COLD ROOM.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
They run into the Cold Room, and hide behind the fridge. Suddenly the air vents fall open.<br>
<br>
Wind<br>
They’re here.<br>
<br>
The sound of moaning and shuffling feet comes from, above them.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Before you even ask, Yes, I heard it!<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Wait, think about it for a second.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
This is how your brother died, I don’t know about you, but if I’m going to die, I want to go down fighting, at least make those zombies work for their meal.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
You’re right.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Is there any way out of here? Those zombies have the whole upper floor.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
The storm doors! You open them while I hold off any zombies with this<br>
(He pats his chainsaw)<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Ok, lets go.<br>
<br>
They leave the Cold Room.<br>
<br>
INT.  BASEMENT.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Sasha goes to open the storm doors while Dylan stands behind him, looking out at the rest of the basement, revving up his chainsaw.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Stay back cursed undead!<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
I think I’ve got it.<br>
<br>
EXT.  DYLANS BACK YARD.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Sasha climbs out of the storm doors with Dylan soon after him. Zombie arms reach out after them while Dylan and Sasha close the doors and put a few large rocks on top of them.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
We stand a better chance for survival if we split up.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Ok, you take the park, I’ll go for the woods.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Right, If I lose them, I’ll try and find you.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Me too.<br>
<br>
Dylan runs up towards the trees, Sasha runs around the house to the right.<br>
<br>
EXT. PARK.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Sasha is running through the park, he hears moaning and the sound of shuffling feet from behind him. He starts to run up the hill when he notices the top of the hill is full of Zombies. He glances down the hill and sees even more Zombies. He looks around frantically then notices a pipe, large enough for someone to fit through about halfway up the hill. He puts on a large burst of speed and dives in, then climbs down it.<br>
<br>
EXT.  WOODS.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Dylan is running through the woods, he can see zombie shapes, flitting through the trees and the sound of moaning over the trees. Wherever he looks there are Zombies<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
These woods are infested!<br>
<br>
He turns back from where he came and starts running.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Maybe Sasha’s had better luck.<br>
<br>
EXT.  STREAM.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Sasha comes out from one pipe, soaking wet.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Well at least I’m alive, and can finally get out of this water.<br>
<br>
He looks up and sees that there is a cage over the part of the stream he is in, and the top is covered with zombies, reaching down at him<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Damnit.<br>
<br>
He then climbs in the other pipe.<br>
<br>
EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
 Dylan is running down the street when he hears splashing coming from the side of the road. He revvs up his chainsaw and walks over to the source of the sound to see what it is.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Prepare to die, Zombitch.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a Sasha’s hand comes up and grabs his ankle, Sasha then swings himself up.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Man, am I ever glad to see you<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Don’t ever do that, unless you want your hand chopped off.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Sorry, where should we go now?<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
I say we make our last stand in the graveyard, we’ll take them down where it all started.<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Deal.<br>
<br>
They run off up the road towards the graveyard.<br>
<br>
EXT.  GRAVEYARD.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
Dylan and Sasha are standing back to back on the spot where they summoned the Zombies. Dylan’s Chainsaw is running, Sasha’s holding his axe. All around them they can see and hear huge hordes of Zombies, moving towards them.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
This is it<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
Last Stand<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
COME ON! WE’RE READY FOR YOU ZOMBIES!<br>
<br>
Suddenly there is no sign of the zombies, Sasha’s watch beeps.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What happened?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
We made it<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
What?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
We made it 48 hours.<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
They’re gone?<br>
<br>
Sasha<br>
They’re Gone<br>
<br>
Dylan<br>
Wow. We made it.<br>
<br>
INT.  DYLANS BEDROOM.  NIGHT<br>
<br>
MIKE comes over and picks up the Necronomicon, sitting on Dylans bed.<br>
<br>
Mike<br>
Hey, what’s this?<br>
<br>

 MY CRITICISM:<br>
 First off,have you ever even seen the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.<br>
Didn't think so.Well it isn't written in egyptian,and even if it was ,which it wasn't,it wouldn't be published that way.<br>
The Necronomicon was actually written in Arabic,and the author was the ledgendary &quot;Mad Arab&quot;.<br>
 Second,the only copy you could buy was rewritten by R.A.Salvatore and some other famous authors.Also,the spells are all spells of protection from something or summoning demi-celestial biengs,not undead.<br>
 Lastly,the script needs a lot of work.Its mostly running and Talking winds and cheezy references to modern culture.<br>
 MY ADVICE:<br>
 Write it as a story first,then try to convert it into a script.Have more stage direction,and less mindless babble.<br>
Thanks<br>

Anyways, I don't know to much about the Necronomicon, but Egyptions did have books of spells in their tombs to protect them, but you were right how thye were protective spells.<br>
But, thats Hollywood. It would be better to keep a distance from reality when it comes to cases like that, or it wouldn't be fun. ie: There is no such thing as zombies (Do not tell to &quot;largo&quot;) <p>I'd rather be judged by 12

don't know if you've taken a screenwriting course or anything (you said something about doing this project for school, i think) but this is nowhere near what a real script should be. if you're doing the project i guess that's okay but normally you should have much more detailed descriptions of the characters, locations and the characters actions, anything that really helps solidify the mood of the scene. <br>
only thing that i really noticed plotwise was that in the first scene at the cemetary you have three characters listed but only two of them talk and only two are listed as leaving the cemetary. i'm assuming this is just an oversight, but you may still want to make the third character (Asher) a little more noticable. <br>
oh, and when Asher is going to make the dip i don't think he needs to say &quot;i guess i'll go make the dip now.&quot; having him glance at his watch and then get up and move into the kitchen would be more than sufficient to tell the audience what he's doing (since it was already mentioned before.) <br>
on the plus side, i think this is a pretty funny script. kind of a Bill and Ted meets Night of the Living Dead. the dialogue could be tightened up a bit too, but it's pretty good. and for the purposes of the script i don't think it really matters what language the Necrominicon was written in. <br>

<br>
The dialogue does kind of go off a bit in one or two areas but nothing too serious. I take it you'll be directing it and the script won't even be graded at all? If it will be, then I think you've got some pretty sound advice. <p><BR>Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day.<BR>Teach him to fish and he'll sit in a boat and drink beer all day.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prismrefraction>PrismRefraction</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/23/02 6:30:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zombie Script</span><hr size=1> Most scripts have a little description of the background somewhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uthebraneatingzombie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Bran Eating Zombie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/24/02 10:17:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.9inchnails.com/photos/studio/img/54.jpg length=95 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zombie Script</span><hr size=1> Ok, Let me first start off by thanking the people who read this and commented.<br>
<br>
First off, Kadeity. No, I have never seen it. I will be changing the script to have it as an Arabic text, thanks for noting that. BTW, do you know if it was writen an a modern form of Arabic or not? I will however be keeping it as summoning undead. Because even though that might not have been what it WAS used for, it is commonly knowen as having undead raising spells, and every reference I have seen has had it listed in this way. While it may not be correct, it is commonly thought to be correct and it works with the story. Thank you for that information though. Also I know I could not find a real copy of it on eBay, Agent Cryrid was right in thinking it was a joke. The reason there is not a lot of stage direction is that from what I've been taught in the various film classes/seminars I have attended, they suggest not putting in a lot of stage direction to allow the director to make his/her own desicions. Also I am directing it, so I already know what the locations look like, so I didn't describe them. <br>
<br>
Agent Cryrid, Yes, it was ment as a joke, and thanks for the defence.<br>
<br>
emmapeel1601, Yeah, I normally would, but as you correctly guessed I am doing the project, so while I normally would write out charecter and location description, It's all in my head. Also I'm just being marked on the video, so I didin't bother to write that stuff down, sorry for any confusion. With the cemetary you're right again, that was an oversight, thanks for pointing that out, I'll fix that up, same with the dip line. Thanks for the compliments, a Night of the Living Dead/Bill and Ted/Evil Dead type movie was what I was going for.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Ascended Bob, Thanks, that's what I'm going for. I'm going to be tightning up the diolauge to save a bit of time, so is there any specific things you can think of that I could cut out?<br>
<br>
 <br>
PrismRefraction, yeah, if you've read this far I already answered your question, thanks for reading my script.<br>
<br>
I'll make the corrections and re-post it, and when the movie's done I'll try and upload it so you can all watch it. <p><p>ilfed sikofit was found broken, hacked and left indifferent next to a possum who, while initially playing dead, obviously was struck by a vehicle of great power.<br>
