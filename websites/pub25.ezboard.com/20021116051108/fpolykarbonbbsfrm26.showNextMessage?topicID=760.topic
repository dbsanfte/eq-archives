Need opinions</span><hr size=1> ok, I thought this up the other night. It's kinda long and i'm not sure exactly what i'm gonna do with it yet. I need opitions.  I'm either just going to write it as a novel, or i might try scripting it into a manga. Sorry this is so long, i kinda went into detail on the important parts that stuck out in my mind when i was typing it up. No dialogue is present so some of this might be a bit confusing. Just let me know. I'll try to explain to the best of my abilities. I've been developing this world of mine for about.. 10 years, but this is the first time i've ever really tried to explain it to anyone. but first the plot.<br>
<br>
ok, starts out with 2 species battling over land and stuff. one's human, other's constol (i'll have to explain EXACTLY what they are later, but basically they are shape shifters, changing from one animal to another, and have an ALMOST human appearance in one form) anyway, constols sack the human city of Karoth, the king (Marcus), the captain(Darren) and some of the royal guard barely excape in time... are attacked on their way out by a group of them, and manage to capture several constols, including our main character (London). He's 6 (because of the way they grow, i send another email explaining constols in detail, he looks 10) and his father(Aries) is among the captured. Marcus declares himslef general over the small little army of his men, and eventually kills Aries. Marcus has 10 yr old princess (Jessica) who has never been outside palace until now, and she is walking by the makeshift prison that they have the constols in when she spots London, he gets her to come closer and scares her half to death... the captured constols end up escaping and then the plot jumps ahead...<br>
<br>
a young 10 year old constol (looks 14-16 at least, this is London from earlier) is with a group of vagabond constols (about 10-15 of them total) they are traveling at night on a topless cart. He smells and then sees the camp of the king and his men from before (doesn't really know exactly who, but it smells familiar) he decides to attack them and get the food and supplies they need. when they attack, half the soldiers are killed, and the main men (Marcus, Jessica, Darren, and a few officers) are gathered in the center, while London's men get what they need... he recognizes Marcus, and Jessica recognizes him (she's now 14, but acts older) she smacks him causing him to bleed, he holds his men back from hurting her and acknowledges that he remembers her too... then they leave... Jessica follows them back to their cart and overhears conversation between London and Caleb... (leading to possible mutiny) London gets on his horse and rides ahead to a clearing (with a specific name, The Clearing of Thorun, why it has a specific name is explained later in the plot). Jessica tells Marcus, Marcus goes after him, and Jessica insists on following him. Marcus makes London an offer to fight with them (he's a mercenary now btw, told the constol army to basically go to h*** about a year after the incident with Marcus and Jessica and stuff) they end up jousting (different kind of jousting, it's like battling on horses, not the traditional way, hard to explain, i'll draw a pic soon and show u) and Marcus wins. London makes a blood pack with him... then Caleb comes up with the rest and challenges his authority (not a good thing). London kills him brutally (basically they sword fight and main character flips the other's sword to where he has both swords and then slices him in half) makes the other constols choose to either go home, or follow him (gives them till morning)<br>
3 of them join... one is his best friend from his youth (Michael) that has stayed with him no matter what... <br>
<br>
this is a kinda boring part...  basically they get attacked a few times, important plot structuring converations take place (London and Jessica find out that they love each other... etc...) up until one night when Jessica has a bad dream that Caleb comes back to life and kills London. Jessica sticks to him like glue the next day and they get attacked again (only about 8 men with crossbows and some constol fireworks that cause serious damage if hit with them). London saves Jessica's life, captures one of them(after chopping his hand off), kills the rest single handedly. finds out where the rest of them are hiding, and they attack, but there's someone else there, he looks just like Caleb, but it's his son(Tarrin), back for revenge. one catch, he's a demon... London kill him like his father to see if the dream is true. Tarrin puts him self back together and has London on the run, but not before London reveals part of his own little secret that scares the hell out of everyone... he's not exactly normal. London shoots an energy blast at the demon (thru a chant) then runs... Jessica follows London and ends up getting drug along for the ride.... London as he runs realizes that Caleb was a demon too, but the reason he didn't come back is because they were in The Clearing of Thorun. the clearing is enchanted. London runs to that clearing to get away from Tarrin. London eventually tricks Tarrin (by playing dead after saving Jesica's life from an energy blast) into coming into the clearing and London kills him. after all of this (and possibly during the trip to the clearing) London tells Jessica that he's really a demon, turned mortal. he wanted to know what it was like... and they've (the demon world) been after him for a few hundred years (explaination: he's not completely mortal, he can be killed, but old age doesn't affect him). the only way to get his immortality back is to destroy the demon king but if you kill the demon king then u have to control of the underworld, not a fun job (think hades' job on Disney's hercules, except not &quot;censored&quot; like disney does). Marcus and his men meet back up with London and Jessica. they all go back to camp and London starts packing. Jessica refuses to let him leave without her. London finally agrees to take her. and a new adventure begins... <br>
another kinda boring part(not borring... but it's jsut more plot evolving and random battles)... until one time London leaves Jessica at a tavern with just enough $ to get back to Marcus... <br>
<br>
This plot doesn't really end here, but this is the first big chunk. If you like it, i'll put the next block up. until then, i guess i better explain this little world i have going.<br>
<br>
ok... this world (ASIEA) was barren, but exactly like earth at it's beginning as far as climate and such. i use to be a star trek fan so some of this comes from that... but in the distant year of 2023 (or somewhere around there) a genetic scentist and his assistant got stranded on this planet and decided to populate it with several races... human, quieroton(i got that from spanish, don't ask), tremers, and constol. In some version of this world i also added dragons... but they are not dominant in this story (for now) humans, well i HOPE u know what those are, quierotons, kinda like aztecs, but with even weirder traditions and stuff, i'm not going into gorry detail, bevcause they don't even show themselves in this story either, tremers, i've done VERY little development on this race, primitive if i recall from my notes that are lost somewhere, <br>
anyway, they don't show up either. <br>
<br>
CONSTOLS: as i told u already, they're shape-shifters. Can change from an almost human form (more human that a manga morph, they have cat like eyes, stand on the balls of their feet, and display some animal like actions) to almost any animal, depending on where they live (ex. forest: bears, tigers, lions, some birds, lizards, etc...) only one small civilization can change into marine animals, and only a limited amount of them at that. Every constol has a main animal they prefer to change into, fitting with their personality and home environment. <br>
also, they age faster than humans. like i kind of explained earlier... a 6 yr old, is more like a human 10 yr old, and a 10 yr old is at least like a 14yr old human (possibly 16). This is because their life spans are so short, an elder is about mid 30s, and that's stretching it. This is because (lol everything leads to something else!) they fight alot. among themselves, against humans, etc... gangs, armys, mercenaries, etc.. most of that is constol related on this planet. <br>
<br>
hmm... i think i've told u almost everything, i don't need to go into the dragon thing... unless i end up putting that in, and that will be another time<br>
<br>

Need opinions</span><hr size=1> The biggest thing I can see right now is the sheer amount of information you posted. I know you wanted to explain your plot in detail, but if you want more opinions on it, you should condense it down. <br>
<br>
Now, concerning the plot itself. The characters seem rather 2-dimensional. Nothing really seems to be their motivation. Try to give them obscure qualities that would not be aparent on the surface. For instance, concerning your main character London, give him some strange fear. IT doesn't necessarily be blown through the roof, but to involve it would add a more lifelike nature to them. They way I am picturing London is as a macho,silent type person with no emotions. It does not seem to me that someone could stay that way all the time, it isn't natural. <br>
<br>
Theres nothing much left to comment on, so far, the plot is interesting, but a bit long.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulordpeanut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordPeanut</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/15/02 9:03:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hm.</span><hr size=1> I kinda like it.  As far as the naturality of the character, it would actually make more sense to exaggerate the non-normality of London, since he *isn't* natural.  I think this could turn out cool...should you choose to make a manga of it, I'd jump on that bandwagon.<br>
