But PC's are much cheaper and people dont want to spend 3,000 on a computer without a monitor when they can get a good one for 1,200 with a monitor/printer/speakers/everything.<br>
<br>
I think Microsoft has a &quot;monopoly&quot; since no one else tries to give people what Microsoft offers. Linux has no chance in hell at being a regular home OS, its the most un-user friendly thing in the world, and since AOL is the most popular ISP I think that shows enough that user friendly is what sells. As far as home use goes, Linux is for programers and the people who think they are programmers, not for grandma and grandpa who just want to go on eBay and print/send photos of family.<br>
<br>
I dont see why people think they are trying to &quot;take over the game market&quot; now. Its common sense to know that no company will ever do that. Sony is selling SO much more than any other console yet they dont even come close to having a monopoly, they really have to stay on their toes since its such a competitive market and every product is around the same quality. But with Windows thats not the case, Linux isnt made for the average person, Macs are to expensive for the average person, Windows is just right for about everybody (and theres no reason to discuss why IE is used more instead of that cry baby company made Netscape who doesnt know why IE is more popular than their incompatible piece of trash). <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/banners/button1.gif" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif width=13 height=13" BORDER=0> at: 6/8/02 9:46:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=evangelion>evangelion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/8/02 10:13:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/codywyers/images/gift/wslgelion.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What a bunch of twits you are.</span><hr size=1> *glares at IamHiro*<br>

your not obligated to respond...<br>
if you dont anwer a question, it doesnt make you wrong...<br>
blah...<br>
off topic...<br>
<br>
<br>
you guys are really over-reacting....<br>
its a gameing system...<br>
it plays games...<br>
<br>
who cares what it looks like.....it plays games...its not some sort of accessory with which you impress girls....<br>
<br>
who cares what it is capable of..<br>
its the game designers that make a game look good, not the system....<br>
GC RS2 has the best graphics in a game ive ever seen...its comparable to the movies even<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Xbox controller...<br>
you get used to it...<br>
all you people are used to N64 and PS controllers, its no wonder that you people would not accept a bigger more spaced out controller, but lay off....<br>
<br>
people hate Msoft because they are a successful company....<br>
i dont really think they are a monopoly...<br>
there are alternatives to almost everythink MS offers....<br>
people choose MS because the price is right, and the stuff is good....<br>
this makes them a monopoly?<br>
no, this makes them the best...<br>
a monopoly is when you completely control the market, and you are the only one<br>
who can sell and/or produce the goods...<br>
<br>
people from apple and such are just pissed because they arent as successful....<br>
so they pull all this MS is a monopoly to give them some of the cash....<br>
<br>
basically, they are trying to force the public to viewing their items in a brighter light<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in other words...if you dont like it...dont buy it <p><center>

I really wanted Halo.  I was waiting for Halo for years, literally.  I was waiting for Halo before Bill knew what it was.  I don't have an XBOX yet, so I can't play Halo.  That's it.<br>
<br>
Does that mean I hate the XBOX? No, absolutely not.  It seems like an awsome system.  I don't know too much about too many other games it has but I would really like a shot at some of the Star Wars ports they have going on.<br>
<br>
I haven't bought it as of yet because I am a hardcore Nintendo fan from way back, and the XBOX was $300.  I can't afford to go and get every system out there all at once.  Now that they dropped the price, and some time has went by since my GC purchase,  I'll be thinking hard about getting one. <p><br>

<br>
GC, XBox, and PS2 all have great (and very bad) games for them.  I have enjoyed playing games on all three systems.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why most of you hate Microsoft.  Because they're successful?  That doesn't make much sense... And then a lot of you are rallying behind Sony, of all companies.  If you dislike MS due to their bullying tactics and strongarming the competition but still like Sony, you're a hypocrite.  Sony is just as bad.<br>
<br>
I repeat, don't be a fanboy and feel obligated to bash GC or XBox just because you own a PS2.  You really CAN like all three systems and their games, I promise you.  No one will look down upon you for not choosing sides in a battle that really shouldn't matter to you or your life in the slightest bit. <p>No one has ever accused me of having an opinion.  Don't be the first.<BR>

<br>
I think you should get your facts straight before bashing Apple... I've never seen or heard anything where anybody from Apple called Microsoft a monopoly... In fact, Apple and MS have had an agreement over the last five years to cooperate and share technology and programs for each other's formats. <p>No one has ever accused me of having an opinion.

<br>
I don't have problem with x-box or other consoles as such apart from the fact that they always try to monopolise the market by purchasing good titles and holding them back and/or making them exclusive to their system only. Like Halo, for example: when I first saw the screenshots of it on the bungie site I swore that I was gonna buy it. Well, now I can't exactly do it cuz surely enough there is no halo for PC. A clear example of an attempt to monopolise the market, and as we know from our economics lessons monopolies are BAAAAAD. <br>
<br>
The one thing that does concern me though is the fact that x-box is basically a revamped unupgadeable PC. (anyone has any idea about the restriction mechanism they use to prevent discs from playing on other systems by any chance?) That's basically selling the very same product but with restrictions supreficially imposed on it and using games as a bait to make people buy it. Does that sound fair to you? Well not to me...<br>
<br>
A question for Pat: were you involved in any titles that have by now been released? if yes, which ones?(Obviously you weren't allowed to tell us about the unreleased ones so there's no point asking.) Just wondering. Not that it's gonna make me run buy an x-box (mostly cuz i don't have enough money - If i did I'd prolly own all three consoles by now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but to see what your work resulted in really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukillersparrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Killer Sparrow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://raider56k.homestead.com/files/angif/fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/10/02 5:22:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://raider56k.homestead.com/files/angif/scorch.gif WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What a bunch of twits you are.</span><hr size=1> Smilie Master<br>

Oh and Halo is coming to PC as a somewhat 1.5 version its believed that they are putting more levels etc. on it.<br>
<br>
My friend Tyson Green works for bungie, he and most of his co-workers don't exactly like Bill Gates (one reason may be cuz most of them like mac computers), but they love the fact that they now have a huge support from such a huge company. In fact Halo might not have been as awesome looking if it weren't for MS's little funds boost. <p><br>

when i was referring to apple<br>
i was meaning all other major computer companys...<br>
just because they have an agreement doesnt mean they like each other...<br>
jobs hats gates for stealing the windows technology..nevermind he stole it from xerox...<br>
oh well....<br>
i wasnt bashing apple...dont get so defensive<br>
<br>

it's a damn nice machine, too. <br>
but really, you CAN buy more than one console you know.  it's not a political party or something.<br>

With MS making the XBox and Apple playing up the &quot;digital hub&quot; theme with the iPod and various other potential launches, I wonder how much they'll even be competing head-to-head in five years. <p>No one has ever accused me of having an opinion.  Don't be the first.<BR>

The only problem Ihave with X-box is the controller. I don't think it's too big (not for me atleast), but i do think it's a little uncomfortable. The GC, on the other hand has an extremely comfortable controller, but the button setup takes some getting used to and isn't so great for fighting games (which are what I play the most). <p><center>You're all <a href="http://engramstudio.com/batmans.html">insane</a>.
