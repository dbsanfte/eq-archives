I have been there three times, myself. My first trip there, I stayed a suburbish area of Meguro at a friends apartment. With a  couple subway rides, I was right in downtown Tokyo. There was so much to see and do, I literally had my feet bleed I was walking around so much (travel tip #1: Wear comfortable shoes!). If you get a chance, use the Yamanote Line (green colored) subway. This travels in a circular pattern around Tokyo and has lots of interesting places to stop. Like:<br>
Harajukyu- where all the kids hang out<br>
Shibuya- big shopping district<br>
Shinjuku- lots of shops.... well, everyplace has lots of shops<br>
Akihabara- called &quot;Electric Town&quot; for a very good reason. I could spend all day here! Arcades, game stores, book stores all over. Their book stores and computer game stores are cool! They are laid out like this:<br>
                         (Book store/Games store)  <br>
     Floor one- magazines newspapers/game systems.<br>
     Floor two- Art books, collected volumes, etc/Playstation games.<br>
     Floor three- manga.... tons of manga/Nintendo games<br>
     Floor four- adult stuff/Genesis games<br>
     Floor five- I don't think I've been in a book store there that had more than f floors/PC games.<br>
     Floor six- ...../Adult stuff<br>
  In Akihabara, when you leave the station and walk... to your right (forget which direction [north, south,etc]) and follow the main road on down, you will eventually hit Ueno Park. Ueno is a nice place to people watch. I think there is a little zoo there as well as some temples- one of which I shuck into late at night with some locals that were wanting to sneak into to get their fortunes! Awesome story there that I can tell at a later time). Keep heading in the same direction and you will get to a huge Japanese museum. Neat stuff in there if you want to see official ancient Japanese armor, katanas, artworks, etc.<br>
Ueno- In case you're too tired to walk here from Akihabara (a couple miles, I think), you can just ride the Yamanote Line here. Read above for stuff to see.<br>
Takadanobaba- I think this is where Go Nagai's studio is. He invited me to visit (I met him at his wife at an Anime Expo back in 93) if I ever made it to Japan. <br>
<br>
Other things to see (that I saw):<br>
<br>
Kamakura- This is where the big Buddah statue is.<br>
Yokohama Bay Bridge- You've seen this in lots of anime, now you get to see it for real. <br>
Musashi Koen (I think that's the name... I'm at work and can't reference my travel info)- Nice quiet peaceful little park. Lots of neat things to see as you walk around the park. If you stop at the ouside restaurant to eat, be careful! The cats around there will hop up on your lap and try to eat your food!<br>
Asakusa- Big market area. You've seen this in anime and TV/movies as well.<br>
<br>
Heck... hoped that helped! My second trip there was just a recap of most of the places I saw. I did make it to Kyoto for a few days. Lots of beautiful temples there.<br>
On my third trip, I was married there. On our honeymoon, we went down to Hiroshima area on one of those tour bus deals. DO NOT DO THE TOUR BUSES!!!!! When you stop at certain areas, you only have a limited time (try 30 minutes) to explore things. I lost track of how many times I held up the bus because I was too busy looking at things.<br>
Hope that helps out. If you want more detailed info on stuff, let me know. I'm writing this at work and am relying on my fading memory to remember things. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've been to japan 3 times as well, once to study abroad, once for a summer (bumming) and once to visit.  I'm afraid i can't help you out too much about the anime studio tour bit (although i could give some pointers around akihabara, if you'd like) but if there's something in specific you'd like to know, as komikino said, we'd be happy to help you out.  what exactly are you looking to do?  Where will you be going/staying?  How much is your budget?  that kind of information will help us give you more useful advice.<br>
<br>
Just off the top of my head, I know it's rather cliched, but buy a good guide book.  I use the Lonely Planet Japan, and I highly recommend it.  There is are Tokyo/Kyoto specific versions, but I wouldn't buy those, most of the info they contain (and tons more) is included in the big Japan one.<br>
<br>
Get a good map (of the subways/JRs especially), preferably one with english/kanji on it.  (unless you're fluent in japanese hee hee).  There are good bilingual maps available at the information counter in Narita and Kansai.  <br>
<br>
Always keep at least 10000 (1man) yen with you.  I've never felt comfortable walking around Japan without at least that much in my pocket.  Believe me, you can and will spend that (and more!) in a pinch!  Credit cards are not widely accepted outside of big department stores/electronics places.  <br>
<br>
If you have an ATM card, flip it over and look for the &quot;cirrus&quot; logo (should be like two blue circles intersecting (like mastercard) and say &quot;cirrus&quot; on it).  If you have a citibank card/ other atm card with &quot;cirrus&quot; on it, you're all good, you can withdraw money at citibank with it.  Be aware that citibank is probably the only bank that you can count on to accept your foreign atm/credit card (provided it has the cirrus logo!!!).  If you have time, i would open a citibank checking account now, for when you go.  Then, in a pinch, no worries (provided you're in a big city, where there's citibanks' a plenty).  Travelers checks can be hassel IMO.  Bringing it all with you in yen's not a bad idea either (since you're only going for a week).<br>
<br>
There's plenty more to say (cheap places to eat, interesting things to see, etc etc.) but my brain is fried (just got done with three hard ass tests).  Ask if you have any more questions!<br>
<br>
also, if you need some language help, head over to the japanese language help forum on polykarbon.  <br>
<br>
hope that helps! <p><center><B> <I>Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu.  <BR>Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.  </I> </B></center>

Oh yeah! I forgot about food!<br>
Again, depending on your situation, the quest for food might be different than what I experienced on my first trip (on my second trip, I stayed with my wifes family).<br>
When I was staying at my friends apartment (I was all by myself since he went to America for a business trip) I did this:<br>
For breakfast I would eat a couple (small) cartons of yogurt and chug some OJ (cost... maybe $4-$5) that I purchased the before from a convinience store (7-11) the night before.<br>
For lunch, I would hit a Happy Burger or any one of our &quot;American&quot; fast food places that has been twisted into a wierd concauction of Japanese foods to satisfy their tastes. Be prepared to spend a bit more than you would here in the States, though.<br>
For dinner.... oh! This was my highlight of the day..... There is a little tempura udon shop right next to the station in Meguro-honshu where I was staying. After my day of running rampant, I would stop in there and eat some of the best damn tempura udon I have ever tasted... for only $3 a bowl (that's hella cheap.... good tempura here goes for $6-$9 a bowl). I surprised the owner there a few times by ordering <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> two</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> bowls sometimes.<br>
Then, on my way home, I would stop at the conveinience store and load up on yogurt and juice for the next day.<br>
Oh yeah, if you eat light (like eating what the Japanese eat) and spend a lot of time walking from place to place (like they do), you might loose weight! I lost 7 pounds from my first trip! <p>Komikino/Richman<br>

The thing is I want to do and see alot of stuff there, but with just a week to do it in I need to prioritize. The anime studio isn't an absolute thing but it would be great if I could. I really just want to go and see the place, ever since I started drawing anime I've had a fascination with it. Akihabara sounds like a really cool place, never heard of it until now. I really would like to see all the shrines'n'stuff as well, oh and the big buddha statue too. Goddammit, a weeks not long enough! But I am going to Japan, which many won't be able to do ever, so I should be grateful for whatever I get.<br>
<br>
I have no idea specifically where I want to go in Japan, that's why i'm asking you guys to give me an idea of what it's like over there, I'm gonna have to do some research myself though, see what I can dig up.<br>
<br>
I understand Pat has been to Japan too, does he post on here any more?<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again Komikino and maimaipanda, you've both been a big help. I'll be sure to ask again if I need to know anything else.<br>

I can help you with some cool stuff if you're in the tottori area...or if you're going to the kansai area...<br>
all the historical stuff in osaka and nara and kyoto is really really great...you might think Ugh...history...but it's less like history when you could fit your house inside a giant buddah (Pretty much THE giant buddah)...<br>
not only that but the buddah is indoors in the most impressive and large structure you'll ever see...Well sure there's skyscrapers in new york...but they aren't a couple thousand years old and entirely made of wood...<br>
Oh...and we can't forget a building with the top storey made of GOLD yes...well gold leaf...it's still damn cool...<br>
<br>
Oh...and money...get about $200 worth in yen...you likely won't need more...only a few places have credit cards and nowhere has debit...and you usually get ripped off on the exchange if you don't do it at your bank....<br>
<br>
EAT....and do it often...you might say OOoo...anime...but go to a ramen shop instead...catch some anime movies on the satilite later...really eat as much different stuff as possible...even better if you have a family to cook for you...MMmm...all you can eat rice and tea....<br>
<br>
Watch TV...I know that sounds lame but the game shows and commercials are unreal...I don't even mean anime...and if you can go during a sumo tourney...those are sweet...they get some coverage on ESPN...but they cut all the cool stuff...really...it's awesome...<br>
<br>
if you have any interest in cars...go to a dealership or car show or a race track...trust me...very very impressive...<br>
<br>
Stay away from Natto<br>
stay far away from love hotels...<br>
If you can...find a family there...they'll give you cheap good food...a cheap place to stay...and a good tour of the area since they know it better than you...and of course neccesites like peach water and pocky...<br>
Oh...and try makudonarudo it's funny just to do it once... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=speede>Spee de</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/22/02 6:47:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11329.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ganbatte</span><hr size=1> makudonarudo? <p>The milkybars are on me!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umaimaipanda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>maimaipanda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/22/02 11:02:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11329.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~mamiller2/images/Tonkatsu2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ganbatte</span><hr size=1> makudonarudo = &quot;mcdonalds&quot; in japanese.

I would bring at least $1000 in yen (around 12,0000 yen (that's 12 man en bills, not 2!)) for a week.  Especially since he mentioned he wants to do the whole anime-tour bit.  I'd definitely agree with Jefm however, that a visit to any number of historical sites is much more entertaining than spending all your time watching anime.   And the food!! *mimes a dying-in-ecstasy-motion* there's a reason why their's a big piece of tonkatsu under my name to the left there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Yeah, stay away from that stuff!<br>
I survived on my two week voyages there with $400. I used cash for quick purchases (souviners, food) and used a credit card for more expensive purchases (books, toys). Be prepareed though, if you use your credit card. They will ask you if you want to make payments on the purchase or if you want to just have it appear as the full charge. I didn't know what they were asking when I made my first credit card purchase so I was all confused. Imagine the poor clerk trying to explain that in bad english with me using bad japanese... it was a Monty Python skit gone bad.<br>
Also, make sure you know how to answer the McDonalds employee when they ask you &quot;Is this for here or to go?&quot;. I knew how to answer all the &quot;fast food&quot; questions besides that one. Ah.... another Monty Python skit...<br>
They should print those questions and responses in a book... mine certainly didn't have them! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Komikino/Richman<br>

I suppose his situation would be different...me personally though...I'm a cheap bastard...I barely spend any money...most stuff is pretty cheap anyway...I mean for about $5 you can get an animage(magazine) that would hurt if you dropped it on you...you could also get manga cheap at any book store or grocery store...I loved the grocery store...MMmmm...Ramune<br>

Like all the cliches, Tokyo really is just an amazing breathtaking city; a mishmash of traditional and ultramodern, serene and nonstop energy, always moving, never sleeping, etc etc.  <br>
The other city you should probably defintely see is Kyoto, the &quot;cultural heart&quot; of japan (hee hee, I sound like a guide book).  Kyoto is located very close to other interesting places including Nara (giant buddha, world's most dangerous deer) and Osaka (or as I like to refer to it, the big concrete place where 10 million people just happen to live).<br>
An itinerary you may want to consider is the following:<br>
<br>
Arrive: Tokyo Narita<br>
Tokyo: 3.5 days<br>
<br>
Shinkansen (bullet train) to Kyoto (around 15000 yen one way, 3.5 hours)<br>
<br>
Kyoto: stay 3.5 days, take day trips to Nara (and maybe Osaka)<br>
Leave: Kansai International<br>
<br>
By arriving in one airport and leaving via another you can save on unneccesary travel expense back to Tokyo, and greatly expand the number of sights you can take in.  Also, Kansai International is quite a stunning airport, built on an artificial (and sadly, sinking!) island, with fantastic architecture.<br>
------<br>
Some things to consider:<br>
Tokyo: <br>
Just like a guide book, allow me to describe Tokyo as a 'collection of neighborhoods each with their own character and unique sites and flavor'.  I apologize if i repeat anything Komikino or Jefm or anyone else said above.<br>
<br>
Stay somewhere cheap or else you'll run out of money instantly!  But at the same time, somewhere not too far away from all the &quot;action&quot;.  I know there is a good youth hostel in Iidabashi which I mention just because when I studied abroad I stayed in Iidabashi.  I dont' know how expensive the hostel is, but I got the feeling that it was rather reasonable.  <br>
Iidabashi is located in a very nice position, which is to say, it is directly in the middle of the Yamanote line (green) (on the sen-chuo line (yellow) which bisects the Yamanote).  It is three stops away from Akihabara (around 5 minutes) and 5 stops away from Shinjuku (around 13 minutes).  Each of these can be reached directly from the train station, which is located very close to the hostel, as I recall.  There are also 4 subway lines (tozai (blue) maronuchi (red), ginza (purple?) and one other one (green?)) which serve Iidabashi and will wisk you away to more disparate locations such as Ginza and Roppongi with a minimum of fuss (though i still like the JR's better).<br>
Essentially, as Komikino said, almost all of the major sites in Tokyo are served by the circular Yamanote line (green).  Once you get to any site on this line, it's a pretty efficient and short jump to anywhere else (it takes about 1 hour to completely go around once).  So assuming you get on the Yamanote, here's some of the interesting places you can go!<br>
<br>
Shinjuku- Definitely go here! it's like &quot;blade runner&quot; in real life.  So much neon, so many high rises, it's unreal.  There are fantastic department stores, throngs of people, .... words aren't sufficient to describe it.  Anyway, some things to look for:<br>
<br>
1- Takashimaya Department store (you can't miss it)- a massive 12 story (or so) complex which includes some of the most outrageously expensive goods (second only to ginza) in Japan; go down to the food court on the bottom floors to sample some delectable delicacies, also great place for gifts!  Half of takashimaya is occupied by one of my favorite stores Tokyu Hands (big green sign, you'll know it when you see it).  No more needs to be said- GO HERE!!  Bring money, buy all sorts of cool and neat things.  Everything from stationary to backpacks to lumber.  <br>
<br>
2- Comme Ca (big store, you can't miss, right outside of Shinjuku &quot;My City&quot;).  I personally like this store for fashionable clothes/goods, but it's not for eveyrone.  won't hurt to take a quick peek though!<br>
<br>
3- walk around amongst all the stores like Marui (O|O|) etc. in downtown shinjuku.  At night, it's outstanding.  Be prepared to spend lots of money<br>
<br>
4- Kabukicho.  Ah, good ol' kabukicho.  The 'red light' district.  Its very very intersting to walk around down here and just be amazed at the sidewalk signs advertising the ahem, &quot;products&quot; available.  Be aware though, that  single caucasian male (which i'm assuming you are) walking through here is very likely to accosted by cries of &quot;Onisan, massaji ikaga desho ka!?&quot; (&quot;How about a massage?&quot;).  If that's not your boat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and you're fortunate enough to meet a young lady, there's tons of love hotels in this area which are just fascinating to um, look at <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
on an aside, if you look really really hard in kabukicho, you can find a machine that vends used girls panties.  It's expensive (around 5000 en/pair)  but makes a hilarious gag souvenier.  It was still there as of this past august.  <br>
<br>
*a final note: there's two &quot;sides&quot; to shinjuku, east and west.  One has boring government builidngs and skyscrapers (except the tokyo tocho towers- breathtaking!!!  with free observation decks which allow you to see just how vast and expansive tokyo/yokohama really is)  and the other is 'where da' party at'.  make sure you go to the right one!<br>
<br>
Harajuku - down from shinjuku on the yamanote line, Harajuku is a beautiful neighborhood with some really upscale stores, one of the most fascinating streets in all of japan and a fantastic shrine.<br>
<br>
I forget the name (takashi dori?) but it's directly in front of the main exit to the train station.  You can't mistake it, look for the seething throngs of japanese kids, dressed up in outrageous fashions (secondly only to shibuya).  Walking down this street you will see just an awestriking cross-section of japanese fashion victim youth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    and some of the most interesting stores in the tokyo.  Be aware though, that if you are dressed even remotely &quot;thuggish&quot; (i.e. hooded sweatshirt or baggy pants) (or sometimes just being a foreigner is enough) you will be accosted by countless black men who are hired to &quot;catch&quot; potential customers for their (mostly hip hop/urban clothing) stores.  Just keep repeating &quot;no thank you&quot; and keep walking forward, and eventually they'll let go. some are quite aggressive, though so be prepared!<br>
<br>
Once you're done exploring this street, you can hang a right to the next major intersection, and go back up the way you came on the street parallel to the one you just walked down.  If you are so inclined, before you head back, there is a great toy store (Kiddyland!!!!) located a little bit further up the way you were going (on this next parallel street)  on the right.  It is a great place to go! lots of kick ass toys.<br>
<br>
Anyway, once you head back, you'll come to slightly  more serene area close to the train station.  cross the pedestrian bridge and you'll come to the entrance to Meiji Jingu (shrine).  this is one of the largest shrines in all of japan, and highly recommended that you go see it.  Admission is free, and the land is very serene and calming.  The shrine istelf is very nice as well.<br>
advice for visiting a shrine:<br>
1) DON'T STEP on the raised metal piece marking the doorway. it's bad luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
2) go up to the hanging rope with the bell.  There is a box with slots cut into it in front.  Take a coin (5 yen coins (with the holes, yellow) are the luckiest) and throw it in.  Wish for something/communicate with the heavens/whatever, clap your hands twice, ring the bell, clap your hands twice again.  <br>
3) buy interesting omamori (good luck charms), oshokuji (fortunes, though useless unless you read obscure kanji <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) etc.  <br>
<br>
Shibuya:<br>
South of Harajuku is Shinbuya, the &quot;youth capital&quot; of japan.  Outrageous fashions, tons of love hotels, the infamous Kogyaru (deeply tanned/bleached/big boot wearing girls of infamy) and the great store Loft!   What more can you ask for?  oh yes, a TGIF.  (LOL I had a friend who INSISTED we go to TGIF every friday when i was studying abroad.  *sigh* i didn't have the heart to tell him that my heart does not wax nostalgic for all the fake-historical kitsch plastered all over the walls).  Loft  (&quot;Ro fu to&quot;) is a great store which is like Tokyu Hands, only better.  Very very cool.  If you need directions, just ask.  The kogyaru are something you need to see.  Try and seek out some really outrageous ones!!   Also, if you see someone selling &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; be assured that a) they are the real deal and b) you can legally buy them (at least as of this last summer).  I'm not recommending you do drugs or anything, i just though i'd answer this question that virtually every gajin seems to have.  <br>
On a related note- do NOT (repeat: DO NOT!) do drugs of any other sort in Japan (weed, amphetimines, etc etc.)  you defintely do not want to be caught by the japanese police for that sort of sh*t.  unpleasant does not begin to describe what may happen to you.  <br>
Also, there is a fantastically huge (8 floors!) 100 yen store in Shibuya (100 yen is about 1 dollar).  I forget exactly where, but you can find it without stressing too hard.  It has all sorts of great cheap things that would make great souveniers!<br>
<br>
Ikebukuro:<br>
About 4 stops north of shinjuku on the yamanote line, Ikebukuro is pretty nondescript save a) sunshine city and b) Toyota Amelux showroom.  Oh yeah, it also has two of the worlds largest deparment stores, though i doubt you'll be interested in them.<br>
<br>
Ikebukuro is also pretty rowdy, especially in some areas.  Those same black guys from Harajuku are back in force, and if anything are more aggressive.  Fortunately you only have to weather about 3 or 4 of them on your way to Sunshine city.  <br>
Sunshine is kind of like a huge &quot;city in a building&quot; and while I personally don't find it all that fascinating, there is a) A huge Tokyu Hands  and more importantly b) A TAREPANDA STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
*clear throat* ahem... ah, sorry about that.  Yes, well, if you're so incline, the tarepanda store is down stairs (huge escalator, second only to Osaka Umeda Sky building in my experience) through the maze of &quot;alpha shops&quot; then straight back, past the mini-comme ca.  You'll notice the big San-X characters including afroken, kogepan and of course TAREPANDA.  Feel free to buy me the huge 1.5 meter tarepanda doll sitting out front as an omiyage (souvenier gift).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
anyway, tarepanda aside (is that possible?) there's also lots of interesting &quot;sidewalk&quot; vendors hanging out with all sorts of interesting cheap gifts.<br>
<br>
back topside, the Toyota amlux building (largest indoor car showroom) is chock full of cool-ass cars you wish you could only afford.  definetely cool if you're into cars.  <br>
<br>
Swiiiingiiing back around to the other side of the yamanote line (don't worry, i'm almost done)<br>
<br>
you have: <br>
Ueno: known as shitamachi (old city) Ueno is kind of a laid back place remeniscent of Tokyo before it got all uber urban.  I personally think that the only really interesting thing here is the Zoo, and that only for the pandas. Of course, as you may have notice, i'm biased towards pandas.  Other than that Ueno shouldn't rate too highly on your list of stuff to do.<br>
<br>
Tokyo (station): this is a pretty urban part of tokyo, i never really explored it much, but there's a lot going on.  <br>
<br>
Akihabara: Ah yes, what you really want to talk about, huh?  Well, it's akihabara.  go there, drool, watch your wallet spontaneously combust.  What the hell, if it's your thing, spend the whole day there.  bring your passport and you can usually get your tax back!! (&quot;passport ga areba, zeikin wo kaishite moraimasenka?&quot;)  There is so much to see in Akiba, go wild!  my only advice- seek out the little hidden stores as well as the big ones (like LOX, which sucks IMO.  Bic camera in Shinjuku/Ikebukoro, etc. is much better).  Don't just stick to the things on the major avenues!  DON'T SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY AT ONCE!  You will undoubtedly see some inifintely cooler sh*t later on.  also, most places will take credit cards (moderate sized and up).  You can bargain a little bit (around 1000~2000 yen depending on price) so take your time to comparison shop.  don't try and go buck wild though! this isn't Hong Kong!  <br>
<br>
<br>
anything I left out? Oh yes:<br>
<br>
ginza:  You can go here if you feel so inclined (you need to take a subway, i think, i don't think it's on the yamanote line- amazingly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   the subway ginza line will uh, take you to ginza).  just be prepared to feel utterly and completely poor and unfashionable.  I doubt there's much for you here, but its nice to walk around and see just why everyone thinks japan is so expensive.  If you have a girlfriend- AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Actually though, there are some upscale places which are relatively inexpensive for lunch! (beware: relatively inexpensive by ginza standards means ~5000 yen/person for lunch)<br>
<br>
Roppongi: The 'foreigners' section of tokyo, whether you go or not is up to you.  amazingly it is filled with foreigners and the girls that love them.  if you're looking for a relatively meaningless hookup with a girl who'll drive you to bankrupcy (ah, but the ride along the way is so much fun!) this is the place to be provided that a) you have money or b) you're cut like a US marine.  Anyway, a good time to be had, especially at night, though personally I've only been there twice (most foreigners tend to sour on the place quickly).  Lots of nightclubs etc.<br>
<br>
----------------  maimai takes a breath---------------<br>
whew!! okay, i seem to have written a novel, so we'll leave it at that for now! if you have questions on kyoto/kansai, we'll get to that later!<br>
<br>
in closing:<br>
cheap places to eat:<br>
<br>
Yoshinoya - gyudon ('beef on rice') very good.  standard order &quot;nami chu&quot;.  orange sign with black writing.  King of cheap.<br>
Ootoya - cheap but delicious japanese resteraunt. all sorts of food, of course i recommend &quot;tonkatsu teishoku omori&quot; (tonkatsu set with XL rice).  there is one on kagarazuka dori in iidabashi if you end up staying there. blue sign with white kanji<br>
Maku - Mickey D's.  okay, but only try it once, just so you can say you at at japanese mcdonalds.  much better is....<br>
MossBurger: Just good japanese fast food.  highly recommended.  red sign, white writing.<br>
FastKitchen/Lotteria,etc: more generic fastfood in the vein of mossburger/maku.  pretty good.  Fast kitchen has some great mini pizzas for cheap!<br>
kaitensushi places: countless places where the sushi comes around on a conveyer belt and you take what you want to eat.  yummy (usually) and cheap.<br>
<br>
anyway, my hands are cramping up now, so i'm gonna go <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    if you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask!  Hope this helps!<br>

&lt;will you be eating here or....?&gt;<br>
<br>
you: &quot;koko de&quot; &lt;here&gt;   or.... &quot;mochi kairi&quot;/&quot;take out&quot; &lt;to go&gt; (they will understand &quot;take out&quot;)<br>

*sigh* no, but i have a girlfriend who seems to think that I am, which pretty much explains why I burn through so much money whenever I'm there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
lol, anyway I guess that was a pretty high estimate.  I was just thinking that it sounds like this is the only time he may be going to Japan (at least for a while) and I thought that it best if he really lived it up and made the most of it.  $1000 isn't a whole lot of money when traveling (especially in Tokyo) and there's few things sadder than going to the other side of the planet and not having enough money to do all the things you want to do.  But if you're going with your dad then you can get rid of the housing/food costs right off which would greatly reduce your costs.<br>
<br>
Also, I tend to buy a lot of stuff whenever i go to Japan, so I was just kind of assuming that the rest of the world is afflicted with the same malady as I, wherein you can't pass by a cool shiny hi tech gadget with a remote control and LCD screen without pulling out your wallet and unconsciously handing it to the clerk. <br>
<br>
so yeah, maybe 1000 is high (certainly if you're going there for an extended period of time!). But if this is more of a once-in-a-liftetime deal for you, my advice is go for it!  Hey, that's what credit cards are for, right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Maim.... if I had only known that phrase! Lol! I was ordering my food just like I learned in school thinking I was the coolest thing since I knew what to do. Then she asked that question... It was like the world stopped and all eyes were on me.<br>
Me: &quot;Sumimasen... moo ichido onagai shimasu (Excuse me, one more time please/repeat what you said)<br>
Her: okyakusama kochira ni meshiagarimashoka?&quot;<br>
Me: Wakarimasen (I don't understand)<br>
Her: (She looks around for help... there's noone to help her... everyone else is busy. She then points outside, then points to a table).<br>
Me: (little light bulb goes on in my head). OH! Kokko desu! (Here!)<br>
Sigh... I was humbled.<br>
Man, talking about Japan like this brings back soooo many good memories! <p>Komikino/Richman<br>
