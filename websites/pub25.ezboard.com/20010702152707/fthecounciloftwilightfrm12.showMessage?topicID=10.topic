<br>
I noticed two key quest components that both Opus and Urlek need are in Permafrost. Urlek needs a snowball off of an Ice Goblin Wizard for Totemic Pants and Opus needs Icy Greeves off of an Elite Guard for Lambent pants. As best I can tell both mobs are in the 25 to 30 range and both spawn near the King's room or Alchemy room. Have you been in Permafrost? If I get a few of the guildmembers to help, would we have a good chance of success or should we wait until we get to higher levels? I would not want to accidently lead us into VOX's lair or anything suicidal. Oh and please ignore Urlek's crude comments. After all he is a barbarian. He has been bludgeoned by Cros and Holie on several occassions and then there is Galahdriel. She often makes fun of his low wisdom. Urlek's opinion of Druids is not so good at the moment. He has vowed to take revenge on some tree called Grizzelknot. Just ignore him. I am sure with so many Druid's, rangers and their friends in the guild, Urlek will some day see the error of his ways.<br>

It's a good thing that big barbarian cannot fit in the door.  He would probably track who knows what all over your lovely home.  And for the record, I do NOT make fun of Urlek's wisdom.  He just does not appreciate the subtle nuances of elven humor.<br>
<br>
If the guild does venture into Permafrost are there other creatures that would be safe for the Sunday group to hunt?  I heard that the Goblin Alchemist drops the much coveted Mammoth Hide Cloak (+4 wisdom) that many of the guild could use and more commonly the Mammoth Hide leggings (+4 sta?) that Oakwyn and I could use.  I also heard rumors of other wisdom-enhancing items found here (runed circlet?). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uirides.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irides</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Priestess</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/00 4:22:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perma Pants raid</span><hr size=1> Someone was selling mammoth hide leggings for 50 plat around Kelethin the other night.<br>

Anyway, my bard friend Fahlana had the worst experience in Permafrost, which is where she lost the 23rd season (after being very comfortably in it) and was up until the wee hours of the morning waiting for some higher level members of her guild to come in and get her corpse for her.  There is one area of Permafrost in which being invisible does not seem to matter, and if you are not careful, you can have a couple dozen goblins chasing you... and if you can make it back to the outer areas of Permafrost, you might just have ALL the goblins following suit.  It was not a pretty sight, but of course that zone is not totally impossible since many people choose to adventure there.  Just takes a veeeery steady hand... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uoakeheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oake Heart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/24/00 3:13:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perma Pants raid</span><hr size=1> &lt;returns from a long and difficult journey across Norrath&gt;<br>
Oh...hello friends. <br>
<br>
Permafrost, the lair of the Lady Vox, ahh...many memories.  Many long and lonely nights have I sit in the alchemist room trying to get the Mammoth Cloak for a shaman friend. &lt;sigh&gt;  I did however end up with 9 or 10 pairs of mammoth legs of which I gave most of them away, but I may have 2 or 3 pair still left in the bank.  If I do, they are yours Gala and Oakwyn(here out known to me as lil Oak).  The cloak is very rarely worn by the alchemist if you could not tell.  <br>
<br>
I think your group would be hard pressed to fight very deeply into permafrost at your age.  Perhaps in a few seasons.  Although I think that Oake and Beloved were around 23 and 24 when they took the Alchemist for the first few times.  We got lucky and walked away with 2 cloaks within a few hours.  We were indeed in danger, so with a large knowledgable group...I suppose that you could get the components you need Opus.  &lt;ponders&gt;  yes...I think you could...I might suggest letting me guide you in just to be safe and I will help you setup a camp at the alchemist and then perhaps you can pull to there???  Just an idea...<br>

Well, I shall follow as usual.  It's not that I'm fearful of venturing into this area, but I've lost my 22nd season too many times last week and I don't really want to relive the nightmare that my poor dear friend Fahlana went through.

It seems like that's a level where we all get new spells.  Thus we'll be better prepared.  So I say 24 or 25.  Because if we're just barely into 24, we sure as heck wouldn't want to lose it.

<br>
I hope you don't mind my coming into the forums of your wonderful guild.  If you would want my help on any raid to help you attain quest components, you could count me in most assuredly.  Depending of course on my availability, but I would happily issue my abilities in whatever way possible.  I definitely need a little more dungeon experience, as my last trip into Najena could've gone better, but I believe it taught me many things about my abilities.<br>
<br>
Maybe I shouldn't speak for him, but I'd gladly also offer my half-brother's assistance.  His name is Kinvarian.  He's a ranger who is slightly more seasoned than I at the moment, and I believe a few of you have met him.  I wish I could offer both of our services, but we made a pact never to adventure together, as one seeing the other in great pain would be devastating to either of us.  He has often offered to break the pact to protect me, but I wouldn't be able to have that on my conscious either, so it's best this way.<br>
<br>
And I would generally agree with Ms. Nutty, new spells are never a bad thing to take into a new adventure.  I know there are a few in particular I am looking forward to at my next rank of spells at my 24th season.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I will be giving notice to my current guild and jumping board to the Council, if I am worthy of the honor.  It's been a tough decision, but I think I've made more friends in this guild than I have in my current one, and I find I can't adventure with people from Strange Brew that often as they are more avid in their hunting than I am.  I may stay in Strange Brew until Saturday to say my good-byes and thanks.  They are also having a drinking and brawling event on Saturday, which would be a great opportunity to say good-bye to them all in an organized setting.  If memory serves me correct it will be in The Arena off Lake Rathetear at 7pm EST.  I'm sure any of you would be welcome to join if you like, could possibly be a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I suppose I have rambled on long enough, and Oake is kind, as always, to offer his assistance.  He is a wise wolf, and is always welcome to ask me for a shot of tranquility. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I shall see you all in the realm of Norrath shortly, and wish you all well.<br>

You would most definitely be welcome.<br>
<br>
I know what you mean about not being able to see your half-brother in pain.  I frequently adventure with my husband Feldros and he is always causing me angst with his dare devil tactics.  Last night he dueled a cleric named Healzz, and although it was all in good fun, I just couldn't watch.  I just kept my spell book in front of me and concentrated on meditating.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I look forward to adventuring with you once again.  I am sure you will be a wonderful asset to our guild, because of your skills as an enchanter and also because you are always fun to hang around with (your half brother is also, of course).<br>
