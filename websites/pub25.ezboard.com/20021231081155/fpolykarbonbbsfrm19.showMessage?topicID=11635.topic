My girlfriend Jennifer...was a few seconds away from trying to overdose on pills before thank the powers, I showed up on her doorstep with a paper for school that I had forgotten to give her only a few minutes before. Let me give you the whole story. Jens mom works at an elementary school cafeteria. Well, this morning when I picked Jen up to take her to school on the way to my exams, her mom was telling me "I only got an hour of sleep last night and I have to go and bake cookies all day today (at this point I am already thinkign aww poor baby got to put prebaked cookies in the stove) well, I soon forgot about that and we were bothat our repsective schools. Later today, I went over to Jens house like normal. We sat on the front porch and waited for her mom to get home...despite being really clumsy Jen was havign a great day. Well, here comes good ole mom, she was ina biotchy mood (like always) and not 1 second through the door she starts cussing Jen out about how this that and the other have been done and how she shouldn't have to come home to a mess after a hard day at work. Well, she gets everything cleaned and here comes more trouble. Jen wants to go to my house so she asks her mom and she says "I thought you were cooking dinner tonight" Jen relpies yes she's cooking but that is why she had planned something quick so she could cook for the and then would be able to go with me. Well this is when her mom informs her that no she is coocking meatballs tonight. (Jens parents told her she could plane the dinners for this week) So they start back and forth about why they weren't supposed to be eating what on that night. Then her mom says well, we changed the schedule because I wasn't here last night, you shouldn't have planned that when you knew I was going to be gone (she hadn't told Jen she wouldn't be there until an hour before leaving) then when Jen said that her mom should have told her she wasn't going to be there and she would have planned around it her mom has the nerve to tell her that she doesn't have to tell Jen where she's going. Even when it was important, if she didn't feel the need to tell her then I don't think Jen should have gotten in trouble. Well, her mom gets pissed and says wait until your father hears this. We go over to my house for maybe two hours and I make her her dinner, then we come back and I go home. That was when I realized that I needed to print out a paper for her for school and I had forgot to. I drive back over there and she comes out...she sort of stands there blankly, then looks up at me and bursts into tears. Both of her parents felt the ned to take their bad moods and crumby jobs out on Jennifer and despite doing ll of the housework twice today she has been grounded for a week. I am just so pissed off with this they treat her like a bloody slave and there isn't a pissin thing i can do about it for another year at least.And on top of that just when I had got her to stop being suicidal they start being worse to her...it is like they want her dead. She has been scratching her arms up real bad and if I hadn't forgot that paper she may have poisoned herself and died tonight in that hell hole. How can anyoen treat their child like that.[/font] <p>&quot;The believer may be happy, but the doubter is truly wise.&quot;<br>

This is really terrible to hear, even though I've never known Jeniffer personally.  She's a real nice person (from what I know) and it's sad to hear that her kindness is being taking advantage of.  I hope she keeps her head up.<br>
<br>
First, I don't know the situation, so I'm not gonna judge.  But I hope that her parents are just dealing with rough times, and aren't actually like that IRL (like what happened to mine, I went through a similar situation at 16, though not to this extent).  From what littile knowledge I have, my advice to Jen would be to talk with her parents somehow in an orderly manner (as in not argue, but talk the problems out).  My advice to you is to try not to get in the middle, as the worst thing a parent hates most is his daughter's boyfriend in a bad situation (no matter who it is).  <br>
<br>
Thoughts and prayers go out.  I hope ya'll make it through unscaythed.<br>

If her parents won't change then she just needs to learn better coping skills and tough it out.<br>

<br>
It gets so hard to remember how good life can be when nothing is in view but heartache and pain. I am sorry.<br>
<br>
There are a few options that I could think of, but they're kind of extreme. <br>
<br>
1. Tell Jennifer to come live with you for a few weeks. This sounds odd, but given the circumstances, and her suicidal tendencies, removing her from that place seems to be the best option. It would probably be just until her parents could get their act together. <br>
are doing to their own daughter. <br>
<br>
2. Contact Children Protective Services. If Jennifer is in danger, the authorities should probably know. <br>
<br>
3. Get both your parents and her parents together, and try to talk things out. In the least, more people should know the danger faced by Jennifer. <br>
<br>
4. Be her rock, her tether to sanity. Make her understand that she is valued, she is special, and that her parents are just punks. Go out and buy her something nice. That sounds so stupid, but it's worth a try. <br>
<br>
In the end, its up to you, my friend. I'm sorry, I know that you never asked for this responsibility, but you have it. <br>
<br>
Watch her, Noah, because I lost a friend like this myself, and I've never forgiven myself. <br>
<br>
Be strong, have faith, and everything will be fine. <br>

<br>
horrible<br>
just horrible<br>
<br>
but she sufferd from depression (( she was 12 ))<br>
<br>
showing sunshine and happines to a person who suffers from depression isnt gonna work very much<br>
<br>
so find out if shes in depression (( a headshrinker or docter works here ))<br>
<br>
at extreme cases depression can make you think you have nothing to live for <br>
<br>
so my advice would be to find out if shes suffering from that<br>
<br>
and find out more about the situation with her parents<br>
<br>
as its been said earlier they migth have problems <br>
(( money or somehting else ))<br>
<br>
if she is suffering from depression hope it can be cured with pillz and medics<br>
<br>
as in extreme cases were nothing works they use elecroshock terapy <br>
wich can make you forget things and wreck your memory <br>
(( thats the last way out when nothing else works ))<br>
<br>
also be a good friend and help her as best as you can<br>
<br>

Keep an eye on her whenever this kinda thing happens so that she doesn't hurt herself.  Maybe you could buy her a cell phone if she doesn't have one of her own and tell her to call you whenever she feels that way.     <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.emeraldwinter.com/comic"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://emeraldwinter.com/comic/ewcomic.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Way back when (a year and a bit ago) i was more depressed than ever (if you dont know me than you wouldnt know im &quot;perma-depressed&quot; and paranoid of everything and no i didnt say that for pity i say it because i just know myself finally) I was being teased so much at school, hadnt had a girlfriend in a year, parents were being assholes and yelling at me and each other every day, and i fealt worthless like i was never going to do anything good to please anyone. I was about two days away from slitting my wrists i had it scheduled, had my standard stereotypical letter written explaining why i did it, etc, but salvation came when my friend and i got talking about things on the bus that had nothing to do with anything really just standard conversasion about our days and I figured out that if i killed myself i'd just be a quitter. From than till now ive done everything i see and want to do myself, i started b-boying(breakdancing) awhile ago hurt myself so i cant do that anymore, started playing guitar, started a band to share my experiences to the world in song, started Hung Gar (style of kung fu), and plenty more pointless things that i just wanted to do. I told my parents what i was planning to do gave them the letter and let them read it and made them realize what they were doing since than we have resolved our differences but new paranoia's have grown, but my friends(I think they realize), gf, parents, and everyone finally understand me and realize i say stupid paranoid things by accident sometimes and seem like a @#%$ but im really just scared. So at least everyone's helping me and I'm understood.<br>
