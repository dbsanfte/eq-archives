Here is a short something I brewed up.<br>
<br>
Strembrok stepped outside the pub, his face slightly flushed from having drunk and vociferated with the mostly surly, mostly unkempt bar crowd he’d ever encountered. He swooned a little to the right, then left, finally finding his footing, continued unceremoniously along a path, his direction somewhat distorted. The liquor confused him, always, one moment conversing complacently about his wife and children, the next raging about the scruples of government. It seemed an odd juxtaposition, however, inviting as the initial conversation was it never delved deep into the human conscience, superfluous, cordial, ordinary, though never hackneyed. The second-self was always irritated, anxious, struggling, as if trying to free itself from some prison. Intoxicated all his hidden, deeper feelings, seemed to bubble to the top, bringing about the heterogeneous from the homogeneous. He looked at the bottle of Mattock’s Ale he held in his hand, how smooth and generous the calm liquid looked. ‘Deceptive, bastard’ he thought, pouring the contents on the ground and watching the ale fizz up and defile itself. ‘How it froths, once disturbed, how angry and vile it becomes,’ he thought casting the bottle off to the side of the road in half-thought. It shattered, but he seemed to take no notice of it, continuing to stare at the receding bubbles on the coarse filthy ground. ‘Brew me up a revolution,’ he said quietly, at first. ‘From within the whole, hidden, are the lives who will bring the country upon its knees, when left to their own devices ferment under the black towering caldron that is the state, brewed and kept prison in the translucent bottle, but beware, beware! The froth, the storm of revolution lies hidden!’ He concluded, his voice growing to a shout. Two men stumbled out of the pub, but were obviously too drunk to take any notice of anything. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Strembrok, continued, his face now colored rouge form the fire of the drink and the passion of his mind. What were these thoughts, which permeated in his head, they seemed to stagnate there, some times dormant, some times agitated, catalyzed by the occasional drink they surfaced on the defiant yellow liquid. ‘Bloody fools’ he thought, looking up to the sky as if talking to someone who was listening. ‘Damned bloody fools, 9 times out of 10 the hard iron kettle will withstand the blows and re-brew what can be collected after the spill,’ he paused, a man in a closely drawn over-coat passed quickly by him. ‘It’s injustice, but how justice seems to counter with more injustice, only now approved. To sacrifice is to kill, there is no way around it, why can’t they see that.’ Strange was his premonition, but stranger still the manner in which he had come upon it, not in quiet rational, but heated passion. He thought about it ‘Yes…yes that’s it, heated passion. That’s all there is. Eventually the pathetic foam dies away, it has to, it is nature.’ He clenched both his fits, triumphantly, as if having come to a truth that had been eluding him thus far. He looked up again, and beheld the tawny sunset in the distance, the after glow of the sun, to him it was like the calm warm face of a child, after a day of ecstasy in Eden. Now on the eve of revolution, how could it still look this way? It hadn’t even flickered, hadn’t waned, the intensity never really changed, it was all a matter of position and perception. On the other side of the world they would see it begin to rise as he was seeing it set. But eventually as it rose for him it would set for someone else. No one saw the sun rise all the time, but, then again, no one ever saw it set all the time either. Though human nature contorted the usual timeliness of the sun, giving it odd hours, so the risings and fallings were not even in their time or distribution. ‘Ha!’ he laughed, somewhat sardonically, seeming to realize at that point the grater condition and devices of man. ‘Ha, no revolution if there were not men, but we are and so there is, perhaps it is our nature to defy the realm in which we live and play discord to the humorous ordering of things.’ He stopped short, looked hesitantly around him, to see if there was anyone passing on the road, he was almost feverish at this point. It was late and he had not found his way home yet. ‘But…yes, but! If nature can produce the ale through much of its own device, and so too can produce us, then isn’t the revolution somewhat brought upon by nature herself? Think, us, that we are the masters of our space, that we are indisputable in our realm and superior to all things; yet, at the very simplest we are the mere tools of nature, mere tools. To be used and cast aside in a matter of a hundred years, often less. We think we make the game, yet it is we who has been played all along.’ He continued unsure now of his direction, much less his destination.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He felt something, a hand, warm, but so much fire was in him to such a degree, that it felt almost cold as it touched his troubled cheek. Unsure, slightly unsteady he turned to find himself face to face with the confidant of his life. Her hair was a plain blond, but beautiful all the same. There was nothing exceptional about her figure, yet to him it was the world and his happiness. He calmed, the fire in his cheeks, dissipating, and the space replaced by a comforting force emanating from the hand that touched it. ‘There now, my sweet,’ the voice said in a subdued lyrical manner. ‘You’ve been drinking again,’ the therapeutic voice continued. His head fell submissively to her breast and she rested both hands comfortingly on his head. She steadied him, providing a crutch and straightening his course. ‘Don’t worry, were almost home.’ ‘Home’ the word resonated in his mind, as if it had been the tuning note of the fork. To home! That was his destination, now that some one had provided direction to him. <br>
When his good-natured wife had finally directed him to his bed, she carefully removed his shoes and took out the contents of his pocket. His wallet fell open and she saw the composed picture of the man on the bed in his clean terse military uniform she read the caption: Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Chief of Military Bioethics, Joseph Strembrok<br>

I had to look up vociferated in the dictionary...nice vocabulary...but it's above most people...especially a loud drunk...<br>
you get points for making me pull out the dictionary but it makes the story hard to read...actually the whole thing has a rather extended verbiage...most people are to lazy to write so sophisticated for a long time so I'd guess you dipped into the thesaurus a bit...<br>
which isn't bad...it actually made the story more fun to read...it gives it a very interesting style that really stands out from most of what gets posted here...and even what ends up in stores...<br>
The story itself is really amusing...and the obscure adjectives help it...mostly because a lot of them are funny to say out loud...(the next time your mom yells at you tell her not to vociferate...the chaos following that is good for a few laughs)<br>
<br>
the only complaint is that it's not easy to read for people reading at a lower level...<br>
which is great...stupid illiterate bums...<br>
<br>
if you want a book that takes a while getting used to the writing style<br>
The screwtape letters by C.S. Lewis<br>
is incredible...after a few chapters it's easy but the first little bit is hard because he has such a strange style <p><pre>

<br>
yeah, i admit it is a bit verbose, and some words i could have put into their simpler form. But I was trying, to do something with the work. I wanted this government offical to be drunk, but i wanted also to alert the reader, that this was not just any ordinary drunkard. I used those certian words to capture the particular flavor I was looking for. I could have use, yell or cry out, instead of vociferated, but there was something in vociferated that captivated me.(also it makes people remember this piece or at least captures them in a way. Everyone who had read this piece has commented on that word. So not only does it provide a visual stimulus, but also a cognative one.) In a sense though, I was trying to make it seem like Strembrok, although drunk, was educated. I wanted the reader to assume a sort of educated position, when looking at this fellow, (those who understand what the words mean and those who don't will probably still agree that the narrator is some one of education.) (perhaps this is part of my criticism) In any event, I agree the vocab is a bit steep, but I was just having fun with this piece. I even had one or two words in mind and even constructed sentances around them. <br>
 Actually I didn't use the thesaurus, but i looked up the definition of one word. AP English exposes me to a lot of 'big words' so I am very much familiar with them, whether that is good or bad, i am not sure. Plus I was reading Crime and Punishment simultaneously as I was working on this, so maybe one or two words rubbed off.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/15/02 3:03:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=458.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eve of Revolution</span><hr size=1> I never said it was a bad thing and you definately pulled off the character...and it wasn't too steep it just makes you bend your brain in a few parts...using big words will make anything stand out....we only normally use about 300 words...anything outside that gets attention...<br>
and vociferated stands out because it's probably the strangest word in there...and a fun one to say...I thought it was funny that the dialogue didn't seem to match the situation<br>
I really like it either way...and I'm glad you excercised your vocabulary...most good writing comes when you loosen up and experiment...<br>

Thanks for your comments jefm, seems like you're the only one around here who takes the time to read my stuff. I appreciate that. Yeah, you're right about the word usage thing, seems like we get in a hait of using those 300 or so common word with a greater frequency than most. <br>
And about this piece, it was an experiment, so you nailed the part about describing the experimentation process of word usage. I am glad at least one person here appreciates my style and experimentation.<br>
