Even though he is little, really your shoulder width is proportionate to the rest of your body. In this picture, his shoulders are only a little bit wider than his neck (which is sorta wide if he's only a little kid), when really they should be at least two of his &quot;head widths&quot;. One other suggestion: It looks like you did this directly in photoshop, which is sorta a bad start for drawing people and such. One reason is that you really can't go back and &quot;reform&quot; a line, you usually have to erase it completely and start over or go through a whole long process of precise tracing with layers. If you can get your hands on it, use Adobe Illustrator, or if you have a scanner just sketch it out first. His head shape/facial feature placement could use some work too, but that's probably not your drawing skill, just the program.<br>
<br>

Wish I could have drawn something that well when I was your age! Anyway, aside from what anyone else has said, I've got one thing. Where his neck ends, there's these two little lumps...they look like maybe they were 'sposed to be pecs, in which case they need to go, because your pecs and your neck don't match up. I'm not too familiar with skinny little boy anatomy (my brother's starting to get chunky), so if you're skinny like this kid is, try just taking off your shirt and looking at yourself in the mirror to get a better idea of what to put there. It may help with the shoulder thing too. Oh, and don't make that little triangle between the back of his neck and his shirt flesh colored...there wouldn't be any body that high up back there, so it should be green for the shirt.<br>

Keep it goin, it's really cute and if you keep trying you'll soon kick da boo-tay!<br>

I still think the shoulders should be just a little bit broader but not too much.

One more thing that has already been mentioned but i shall mention anyway.

<br>
NITPICK TIME:  (whoot!)<br>
<br>
eyes go right smack dab in the middle plane of the head.  so there is the same amount from the chin to the eyes, as there is from the eyes to the top of the head. you kinda have that, but then you have this spikey hairstyle that would add some more height to the head.. so he needs to have a taller head.  and he doesn't have a forehead.  he needs one.<br>
<br>
do you have a scanner?  I would honestly suggest to you to draw on paper.  not in flash.  personally, I love flash, and I'm an avid maker-of-weird-little-animations, but to practice your drawing in there is a no.  because it is harder to draw with a pallette or a mouse then it EVER will be to draw with a pencil.  totally different experience, and I say you NEED the actual drawing on paper part.  it's just nicer.<br>
<br>
the face isn't lined up properly.  most is okay, I think the nose is in just about the right place, but the mouth is practically right underneath his eye.  it should be underneath the nose.<br>
<br>
the human head is sort of like the shape of an egg standing on the pointy end.  with cheekbones and other such fun features.. but still, the general shape is an upside-down egg... or is close enough to learn by.  (I'm trying not to get yelled at here..) so I'd suggest that you draw the general egg-shape of the head first.  your head is sort of shaped like a triangle with curved edges.  well, your person's head anyways, I really hope your head isn't shaped like that.<br>
<br>
he looks cross-eyed, because you stopped the white parts of the eyes before the other side of the eye.  and they're both sort of pointing towards the middle.  you have to extend the lines, or the white, so that he doesn't look cross-eyed.<br>
<br>
his ear looks a little too small to me, it would be right for a girl's ear, but it looks very petite.  I guess that would be okay for a small boy.<br>
<br>
little boys usually have big foreheads, and their eyes are just a smidgeon lower on their face to make the forehead look big.. something like that.  anyways, his forehead definately needs to be more pronounced, because he doesn't look young in this picture.<br>
<br>
you develop lines in your neck like that from neck muscles actually, which doesn't fit in with the &quot;young boy&quot; idea, but it's not bad... I don't think you need to show the one on the right tho (our right) it just looks strange being there.<br>
<br>
he's supposed to be wearing a hoodie, correct?  well, the hood looks somewhat like a small, green, inner tube.  you need to put a hoodie on yourself, and see how it falls around your shoulders.  because that looks too solid and round.<br>
<br>
the shoulders have been mentioned a million times.  so, I'm not gonna bother.<br>
<br>
my suggestion would be to take the A off the sweatshirt, until you perfect body figures and the way clothes lie more.  try and keep things plain until you get a good understanding of them, because details that don't lie properly will make your drawings look flat.<br>
<br>
the dark colours you used for the sweatshirt, make it hard to see if you gave him arms.  if you didn't, he needs arms, because how else is he gonna eat that cheeseburger, and kick those ninja's butts all the way back to katmandu?<br>
<br>
oh.  looking closer, there are arms.  but the lines look like they go up too high, because he's wearing a baggy sweatshirt, the places for armpits are lower a little.  also, you placed the folds in rather weird places.  shirts usually fit the ends of our shoulders quite well, or at least they hang off them, they wouldn't be bunched up unless we were sitting or something strange.<br>
<br>
his fave cast a shadow, but his nose didn't?  weird.... :P<br>
also, his neck would have shadows too, and the hair would have more shadows too.<br>
<br>
lose the cheesy cloud filter.  it's not adding anything to your picture, and we all know you didn't draw those clouds.  he looks like he's just come from a fight or something, and backgrounds can be used to suggest a little about whats going on.. where is he?  why is he fighting?<br>
<br>
also, he almost seems emotionless.  you might have been trying for a resigned but still a little angry look, and if so, then you hit it close to the nose.  but if you were going for the angry look, then he needs to look more tense... eyes need to be narrowed, more tilted eyebrows, a little expression in the mouth, etc.<br>
<br>
the pecs have been mentioned.  if they're pecs, lose them.  if they're collar bones.. thats not how you draw them.  collarbones don't meet in the middle, and they're more of a.. suggested shape then an actual shape.<br>
<br>
<br>
man, I'm so pick-aparty about everything.  I'm not trying to be mean, I just think that the best way to improve is knowing exactly what you are doing wrong.<br>
<br>
you actually have nice art skills for your age, and you just need to work on general body stuff.  people are hard, man.  but you'll get better, I guarrentee it. walk around, look at people's bodies.  copy drawings from other people.  it's not a bad thing to copy, imitation is the finest form of flattery.  just give credit where it's due, and no one minds at all.  good luck, and don't let me scare you away from polykarbon with my evil nit-picky ways. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://tremored.homestead.com/files/1ChelSig.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waltezmo>waltezmo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/13/03 11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8963.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> responce</span><hr size=1> I think its pretty good, AND im not going to put it down, for two reasons, one is that you are young (although Im only 13) and I respect that you dont brag about it.
