I want to be in lott!<br>
<br>
The other night in Kranor's castle the DT(Aka Dog Tower)! A Jade Mace drop! Well a VERY nice item and pretty pricey! Well the group began to lotto the item! Had a warrior name Aoledor and a Cleric name Alaura both members of LoTT(Lords of the Tar's Tai). The other ppl I wouldn't say the names! Aol rolled the 2nd highest roll and Alaura rolled the highest! Well rare is rare but WHY the heck would a cleric want a item like that(Greedy)? You let a cleric win a item like this and pass up the meleers! Then Im happy I can take my Wizzy to Lguk and get my a Fbss! On top of it being a cleric it was a person in his greedy! I wonder if LoTT taking apps! LOTT THE NEW UBER GUILD!! Look out!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mezumiiru>Mezumiiru</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/01 1:51:37 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://myshell.veriomail.com/cgillespie/Mezhead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My App for LoTT!! and a Flame</span><hr size=1> Um, perhaps you should have taken it up with Alaura at the time if you had a problem with it.....go whine somewhere else or offer to buy it from her... <p><IMG SRC="http://myshell.veriomail.com/cgillespie/Mezumiiru.jpg"<BR>

<br>
You slay me to the core... (I am dead serious)<br>
If playing for two years straight to achieve 48th level and a grand total of probably 4k plat.. and if you had checked my armor, all Temple of Ro quest, which by the way I went and quested on my own with little to no help... if you knew all the items I have camped explicitly for other people, and never asked or gotten anything in return... If you knew the sacrifices I made for my guild when I was guild leader of Jus Divinum (as Palliate)... if you would check my items and bank account against the items of 80% of the other players that are my level you would know I am not greedy or uber... Fact is I pay so little attention to loot I originally didn't know exactly how good it was... but once I won it and was told how rare and pricey it was I was tempted to return it to lotto.  Then I thought about the 80 plus hours I had spent camping the AC for j-boots for my wife's wizzy and how many loot hungry KSing a-holes I had defferred to in the camp, and I thought &quot;Guess what, I earned this... there was no other cleric in the zone and you couldn't have taken the item without me... I waited two real life years to get this one item in a lotto and I friggin earned it.&quot;  I have never sold any items I didn't need, they have all been given... got that?!?... given away for free, mostly to people I didn't even know who seemed less well off than me.  I stepped out of a dragon shield lotto in defference to another cleric who said how much she wanted it, and you know what she did?  She SOLD it the next day!!<br>
Now guess what?  I am going to take the mace and sell it, and I am going to use the money to buy T-boots for my wifes wizard since between the two of our accounts we can't afford even one pair (Pretty sad for two GREEDY people who never charge for gates or rezes.. but you wouldn't know about that because you probably wouldn't take a rez from someone if it wasn't a friggin 56 level one).  If I get enough money I will buy T-boots for myself.  You know why?  So I can friggin run around rezzing people on the other side of the friggin world FOR FREE a lot easier.<br>
So next time maybe if you feel that strongly about something you should ask nicely when I am sitting right there in your friggin group rather than coming here and being a major JERK!!<br>

Sorry, but you forgot to check the box on your app that informed us that you were a complete moron.  Perhaps if you spent less time playing 'one-handed' EQ, you could have had the karma to win the item yourself.<br>
<br>
Seriously though, If you have a problem with a member of this guild, the FIRST thing you should try is talk to THEM (I have a sneaking suspicion that this probably would have worked but you didn't even try).  That failing you can request audience with any officer there is usually one around.  Your method of come here into OUR house and slam one of OUR people will get you nowhere... Well, It will get you a prompt escort OUT the door but aside from that, we'll snicker and make fun of your pre-pubescent, snot-nosed whiney ways (dude, stop picking and use a kleenex).<br>
<br>
Next time you are in a party (hopefully never one of mine for I'll disband your sorry ass asap) why don't you ask about loot/lotto rules AT THAT TIME!!!<br>

You don't know jack about what happened in group or in private tell then!!<br>
NOT ONE ATTEMPT was made before, during or after the lotto to set a loot rule against me winning the item, either in group or in private tell and I was not approached even ONCE by any group members asking me to step out of the lotto.<br>
<br>
If someone in my group is complaining in OOC about a lotto and I am busy keeping my group alive, guess what the odds are I am reading OOC chat... about nill<br>
<br>
Now shut the hell up and stop talking about things you have NO IDEA about.<br>
<br>
Its would have been bad enough if you had been a group member complaining post fact, but to have someone OUTSIDE a group try to tell a group how to conduct their lotto's?!?!?!

Our members very rarely join any group for the purpose of obtaining loot.  Not that when offered, we turn it down, but when we need an item for a guild member, we normally just go get it for them as a guild.  I can assure you that in a DT group, our members where not there for loot.<br>
<br>
We have always had a nonchalant attitude towards loot, as we are a guild purposely built on friendship and with a sense of family.  Loot falls very low on our list of what is important.  Because of this, when an item drops, we normally just give it to someone who can use it.  When no one expresses an interest in an item, we will random it to all in the group.  The person who wins the item can do whatever they want with it.  Many times it is given to another guild member or is sold.  Our clerics spend most of their hard earned cash on stones and such for raids and other events.  I'm sure the members of that group in DT were properly buffed by our cleric, and with reagents she purchased herself.  Did anyone offer to reimburse her??  Doubt it.<br>
<br>
Now we look at the other side of the coin, those who live and breath for loot.  You see, it’s these people that take offense when an item drops and a cleric or wizzy wants in on the lotto.  And I can understand this, as many moons ago; I spent much time in LGuk seeking a haste sash. Heck, I killed over a million frogs and seen over 20 sash’s drop before I finally won a lotto.  And of those 20, most went to clerics and wizards.  However, without them there, I would not of had a chance to even lotto for one, much less win one.<br>
<br>
So you see, your showing your true colors friend, blaming us<br>
for what you in fact are guilty of...greed. <p><a href=http://terstai.trafficblast.com/drinal target=_top><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/chey_sig.jpg border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utariskattoreereg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tariskatt Ore Ereg</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council of Lords</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/01 3:54:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/tariskatt_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hey Joe</span><hr size=1> Ross, yer the man...<br>

Enough of that though. Joe, was this a LoTT run group? Did she force herself into the roll? Did anyone say it was a Need before greed group? Perhaps these things should have been discussed before it was rolled on. Sounds like not a DAMNED word was said until after a Cleric won and someone cried because they wanted it too, probably to sell no less. And like others said, try holding down DT without a Cleric. Get over it, it's a few pixels...there will be more... <p><font color=blue> Tariskatt Ore'Ereg </font> <BR> <font color=green> <i> Drunken Ranger, the newest class of Tunarian Warrior <BR> Bartender of the Ters'Tai</i> </font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=arkadyblackheart>Arkady Blackheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/14/01 6:21:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hey Joe</span><hr size=1> ok Joe post yer char name here i have my lil level 40 magi group with ya duel yah or invite ya to my house for a CURB STOMPIN how im not in lot any longer but i will tell you one thing you moron NEVER and i mean NEVER talk about these people like that.

It's risk v reward. If I'm going to risk in DT, I'm going to roll on the reward. And unless it was specificly stated the rolls would be need before greed, everyone should be rolling on the mace (including int casters who can't use it but can use the cash boost to the bank account, I know my baby cleric like the nice stuff I got her with the mace I won once ;-p). DT is not like Seb, or a raid where stuff can drop for everyone, it drops only 1 item: the jade mace. You want only melees to roll on it, get a group of all melees (and then beg a cleric for rezes after, after begging a wizard for a port/lev/invis to DL, and a rogue to drag your corpse). /rude <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukindo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KINDO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/01 7:12:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My App for LoTT!! and a Flame</span><hr size=1> Ive only been in DT a few hundered times now, so im new...What else is there for a cleric to roll on?  Cobalt Gloves which are Warrior only? Or a Mace that is useable by cleric.  If you want a cleric to be in your group you have to give them some chance for loot, they need to make a livin too ya know.  Id have no prob at all haveing a cleric or an ench for that matter rolling on the jade mace... and yes I AM A MELEER...but i cant do @#%$ with out a cleric.<br>
