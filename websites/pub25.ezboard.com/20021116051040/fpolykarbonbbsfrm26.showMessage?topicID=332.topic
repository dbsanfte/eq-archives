<br>
                             Avoidance<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent walked off school bus number 264 and looked around. The air was cool this morning, so he had worn a blue long sleeved shirt with his favorite red Hawaiian shirt over it, the one with the white flowers on it. The CBC weather report had stated that it was supposed to warm up to the mid twenties by lunch time so Trent had worn white shorts and black sandals as well, to compensate for this. He looked at the building and after watching the sun barely peaking over the horizon, glinting off the large windows of the building, looked down and shook his head, muttering to himself, &quot;its to damn early for this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent pushed his light brown hair up out of his equally light brown eyes and took no notice that it fell back to exactly the way it was before as he entered the building. After navigating his way around the massive throngs of people crowded around Horton Hall as per usual in the morning, like moths drawn to a candle, he then climbed the stairs to the second story, skirting around the railing that surrounded the open area over Horton hall, designed so that the light from the sky light above could shine down upon the denizens below. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yet another reason to avoid it,&quot; Trent thought to himself, &quot;Natural light, one of my greatest enemies.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sat down at his usual table and was quickly joined by his friend Figure, a tall thin guy with similar colored hair to Trent's. Figure's hair though was longer, about shoulder length, and tied back in a ponytail. He brought with him another one of his companions, Duff, who in looks, generally resembled a shorter Figure, with longer, blonder hair and glasses. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey Duff,&quot; Trent said to Duff, flashing a small wave/peace sign. &quot;Dude! 'sup?&quot; he then exclaimed in Figures general direction while giving him a slightly more energetic wave/peace sign. Then, with a puzzled look on his face, inquired, &quot;What class do I have first?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure looked at Trent and replied, &quot;WE have History. Like we have EVERY SINGLE DAY 5 SO FAR THIS YEAR!!!!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Whoa, calm down man,&quot; said Duff, a look of slight surprise on his face at the outburst. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Figure, sitting down at the table, &quot;its just every year for the past 13 years he has expected me to have memorized his schedule.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sooooorrrry!&quot; said Trent sarcastically as he rolled his eyes, &quot;Did we have any homework?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Only that big test worth 20% of our mark that's happening today,&quot; said Figure, a look of exasperation on his face. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;TEST!?!?!&quot; shouted Trent, &quot;TODAY!?!?!&quot; he shouted again, &quot;Oh @#%$,&quot; he sighed as he dropped his head to the table. Figure and Duff started to laugh. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You didn't study at ALL for it?&quot; asked Figure disbelievingly, &quot;we've been talking about it for the past 2 weeks in class! Its been in big letters on the board and we had study classes the past 3 days! how could you not have known?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You remember how I told you I was learning to sleep with my eyes open?&quot; moaned Trent, &quot;It worked.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well you are completely and totally screwed,&quot; laughed Figure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah, what are you going to do?&quot; asked Duff. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't know, I don't know!&quot; moaned Trent as he banged his head on the table. Suddenly he sat up and yelled out, &quot;I've got it!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Inquired Duff. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'll skip off the next two classes and then sneak out at recess while the parking lot has people in it and run home!&quot; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;One problem,&quot; said Figure, &quot;how are you going to avoid all faculty until recess, that's two hours from now.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;With my stealth assassin skeels!&quot; Trent exclaimed. Just then the bell rang and people started to leave to go to class <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well good luck,&quot; said Figure as he left for class. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah, good luck,&quot; said Duff as he got up too, &quot;you'll need it&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why, I'm not afraid,&quot; stated Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure turned around a quietly said, &quot;Oh you will be, you will be,&quot; and left silently laughing. Trent made his way stealthily down into the library. On his way in the librarian looked up from her computer and asked him, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you on a free?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Umm, yeah, sure,&quot; responded Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This seemed to satisfy the librarian because she went back to what ever she does on her computer. Trent grabbed a book about unexplained phenomena as he settled down in one of the comfy armchairs located there, put the head phones in from his discman, turned on 'The Wretched' by NineInchNails, and began to read. As the soothing effect of the music, and the fact that he wasn't writing the test and probably wasn't going to get caught reached him he began to relax and the next hour flew by. As the bell for next class rang he made a silent celebration for getting to the halfway mark without being caught. But he still had this nagging sense that he was forgetting something, something important, something VERY important. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He racked his brain trying to figure out what it was. This turned out quickly to be an unnecessary expenditure of brain cells because the answer was made apparent around 30 seconds after the second bell rang, signifying he was supposed to be in class. He got the answer when to his horror the teacher of his next class, one Mr. Frake of economics class fame, who had told them yesterday that today was to be a library class to research the project that they were working on. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before Mr. Frake, or any of his classmates could set eyes on him he threw himself to the floor and slithered commando style into a rarely used section. There he waited catching his breath and planning out his escape. He knew he must leave for the longer he stayed in one place the larger the chance was that he would be caught. He waited motionless, but ready to spring into action, until Mr. Frake lead the class into the computer lab attached to the library. He then bolted for the exit and as soon as he left the doors threw himself to the ground and rolled directly under the computer lab windows. He the crawled away from the library and ran to a stairwell that he decided was a good place to hide until recess, which was now only 45 minutes away. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After an uneventful 45 minute in which Trent sat in a dark little corner under the stairs jumping at any little sound the bell finally rang for recess. He quickly joined the crowds of people leaving their classes to go hang out in Horton hall, ducking slightly so he would be completely hidden. He made his way up to the front entrance and was about to make his way into the parking lot when his cell phone rang. He answered it and heard Figure say, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Don't look up, turn around, come back to the table, Delinch is right outside the doors talking with some teachers, We'll hide you until we can think of another way to get you out.&quot; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
            Trent hung up the phone and ran back to the table. When he got there Figure grabbed him, threw him under the table, chucked a couple backpacks on him and sat down blocking any view of Trent. Less then a second after this Trent's History teacher turned the corner and walked right past them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thanks&quot; breathed Trent as soon as the coast was clear, &quot;I owe you one dude.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You owe me so much more then 'One' my friend,&quot; replied Figure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; whispered Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh I don't know,&quot; replied Figure, &quot;My mind is drawing a total blank!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent looked sadly at Figure and pleaded, &quot;Help my Figure Four, you're my only hope!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure gave him an unimpressed look. Trent then sighed and pulled a copy of 'Half-life' out of his backpack and handed it to Figure, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Two Weeks,&quot; he sighed heavily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Three,&quot; Figure quickly countered. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Fine, Deal! Just tell me what I have to do!&quot; pleaded Trent. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
             &quot;Ok, I have a free next,&quot; said Figure, &quot;I'll watch out for you, via cell phone. I'll be your eyes and ears and hide you from all danger. In return all I ask is this game. And free beer.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Of course!&quot; exclaimed Trent with a look of shock on his face, &quot;free beer goes without saying! you know that!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Then its settled,&quot; said Figure joyfully, &quot;now that recess is ending you should head to the chemistry lab, my sources say that it is open but you will have almost half an hour before it is used. When the class starts preparing to enter my agent in there will give me a page warning me. I will then call you and you will proceed to the next way point immediately at top cruising speed, avoiding all Killrathy fighters along the way.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent looked at him rather puzzled, &quot;you mean teachers right?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;When you said Killrathy fighters, you meant teachers.... right? I mean avoiding Hetson is one thing, but avoiding the might of the Killrathy empire, that will be difficult.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How difficult?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;VERY difficult&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, this is not mission difficult Trent, this is Mission Impossible&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So there are Killrathy?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;O...K...?&quot; With that, Trent speed off down the hallway, towards the Chemistry lab, and freedom. He situated himself behind Chemistry lab station 17. His lab station for all those long year of Chemistry. He waited for what seemed like an eternity, afraid to move, afraid to breathe, even too afraid to start pilfering lab equipment. Then his phone rang, it was Figure, &quot;Get out now.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent started crouch running, as soon as he entered the hall Figure said, &quot;turn left, now keep running, lower, hit the ground, roll towards your left, hide behind the pillar, now MOVE MOVE MOVE! past the art room, now quickly, into Frakes class, he's down at the library again this period. You should be safe, until lunch, then your all in the clear.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent waited in the classroom, leaning against the desk, waiting for the bell to ring, or his phone, and wishing he had brought a book with him. 12 seconds before the lunch bell rang Trent's phone came to life. It, to no big surprise, was Figure, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;This is your moment to shine buddy, run to those doors, you should reach them as everyone else does, I have a car waiting for you outside, get in the back seat, stay down, they have instructions to get you to your house. Now.........GO!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent took off running, meeting up with the rest of the people going for lunch just as planned. he reached the doors and saw the car waiting, backdoor left open, just outside, 20 feet away from the doors, by which he was standing. He went for the door handle, ready to bolt outside, when Figures voice suddenly came through the phone quite loudly. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;ABORT ABORT! CANCEL MISSION! RETREAT! Hetson is right outside checking parking permits, you would be gone for sure! Come back to home base until we can think of something else.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent turned and started pushing through the crowd to get back to the table when the phone came to life again, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;@#%$, Delinch is coming this way, go left, go left, I don't care where just GO!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent had barely taken two steps when Figure started shouting again, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I can't believe this, Frake is coming from the right, get downstairs!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once he reached the bottom level of the school Figure came on again, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Its Balcoe, you know he would do anything to report you. You're screwed, just give up now, they might go easy on you, say you just got in.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;NO!&quot; shouted Trent, I can't give up now! not after all this!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There's no way out! your surrounded!&quot; argued Figure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh there's one place I can go,&quot; said Trent smiling cleverly. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Of course!&quot; said Figure, &quot;how could I have forgotten it!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Trent, But I'm sure glad I didn't.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He then promptly jumped into the garbage can and pulled the lid on. After the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, and Horton Hall cleared, Trent was again greeted with the ringing of his cell phone. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was going to suggest the bathroom, but your way works too&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh yeah, the bathroom! why didn't I think of that,&quot; exclaimed Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well the evidence would suggest that you're stupid&quot; replied Figure, &quot;Anyways, I'm going to class now, so radio silence for the next hour&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sure thing&quot; replied Trent as he switched off his cell phone, settled back, got comfortable, and thought yet again how nice it would be to have a book right now. Thoughts of books and comfort were cut short though when a full soda bottle, carelessly thrown into the garbage can by an unthinking student rendered him unconscious. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He was awoken by a hand roughly shaking his shoulder. He looked fearfully up and was relieved to see it was only Figure.<br>
             &quot;Way to sleep Trent,&quot; said Figure sarcastically. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thanks&quot; replied Trent when suddenly his conversation was cut short. He then heard Mr. Hetsons voice, from only about 6 feet away ask Figure, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Did you say Trent?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ummm. No,&quot; said Figure looking innocent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Trent doesn't seem to be here today, do you know where he is?&quot; asked Mr. Hetson. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Trent's Dead&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Trent is Dead&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But I just saw him last night&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah he just died&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;O..K&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent was then happy to hear the sound of Mr. Hetson walking away. Figure leaned over and looked in the trash can. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
            &quot;You're safe,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I have another free now so the plan is, you stay here until 3:15, then you run to the bus and hide under the seats until the bus clears the parking lot. If there is any problems with teachers or admin. being in the way I'll have a distraction created on the other side of the school. Don't worry, you're in good hands, any questions?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent thought about this for a second, then looked up at Figure and said, &quot;Just one, when did you become the leader of a secret cult that seems to run the school, and how didn't I notice any of this?&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure looked taken a back, thought for a second then stammered out, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ummm, NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ok, that's cool,&quot; was all Trent could think of as a reply. Trent sat in the garbage can, conversing with Figure when possible about the release of the new 'Seventh God' scenario pack for Myth 2 until it was time. Trent got out of the garbage can and readied himself to run. He stretched for a few seconds then got down into a crouch, right next to the Pepsi machines. All he had to do was run around the corner right past the stairwell, past the gym, into the math wing, down the math wing taking the right turn at the fork, then out the doors and one bus up to get to #264. It would take about 30 seconds, he would avoid any teachers who might realize he was skipping and stay out of the way of any administration. It was a simple plan, yet risky, for if spotted he could be stopped for running in the halls. Or possibly even tracked down to his bus where he would be brought back to be tortured for information. If either of those happened he had an Ewoks chance in a Rancor pit of escaping unpunished. He waited for Figure to count down from five. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;GO.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent was off. He rounded the corner in under a second, took two steps to start to pass the stairwell, and ran straight into Mr. Hetson. Before Mr. Hetson could get up or look around Trent was off running for fear of his life. Skipping off was bad enough, the last thing he needed was running in the halls and injuring the guy who would be deciding his punishment, he rounded the Gym as his cell phone turned on. It was Figure, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;YOU IDIOT! he practically saw you! He is almost sure it was you but he doesn't have enough proof to convict! If he catches you in the school though, you're a dead man. Get out, for the love of all that is good and happy get OUT!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trent needed no-one to tell him to get out. He was already halfway through the math wing when his cell phone kicked on again. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I've got bad news, he saw you go into the Math wing and he's locking it down, you can't get out, hide!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No,&quot; panted Trent, &quot;I can make it out&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No you can't!&quot; Figure argued, the door is locked!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;There is no door,&quot; responded Trent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;How many times do I have to tell you! THIS IS NOT THE MATRIX!&quot; Trent rounded the corner and saw the locked metal doors. He speed up and managed to gasp out, &quot;I AM THE ONE,&quot; before smashing into the door and blacking out. When he came to a second later his chest was aching, pounding and burning, his left shoulder was throbbing and his knee felt out of joint, but he was on the other side of the door, freedom was only a few feet away. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He got up and managed to stagger to the bus without looking back. He limped in and over to the third seat back on the left where he fell to the floor and rolled under the seat, he waited there until the bell rang and his bus filled up. He let out a silent prayer of thanks as the bus pulled away. As was decided he did not get into his seat until after they had left the school and then called Figure to report his status. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey dude, I made it out&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah, I heard, congratulations, now remember, never wear that outfit again,&quot; replied Figure. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I know,&quot; Replied Trent as he looked up and gave a thumbs up to Figure, who was sitting two seats ahead of him. He hung up the cell phone, stood up, made a Nixonesh victory pose and shouted <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'M THE KING, OF NO PANTS!&quot; Cringed in pain, sat down. and started rubbing his shoulder. as the bus took the slow ride, home.<br>

Well Trent didn't know he had the test until he got to school. So he needed to leave, but with my school (Horton High School, Nova Scotia) The Principals office is right next to the door out. So he had to leave with a crowd, (Recess and Lunch) and then it explains why he couldn't.  <p>There's no justice like Angry Mod justice
