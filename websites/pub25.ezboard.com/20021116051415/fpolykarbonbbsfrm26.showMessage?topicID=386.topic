<br>
<br>
   I listened close as mother sang, her sweet, soft voice echoing in my mind. Today was one of her sad days, and I<br>
   knew why. Daddy was dead, and today was the one year anniversary of his death. <br>
<br>
   I gave a little sigh and cuddled closer to her as we sat by the ocean's shore, watching the waves crash gently<br>
   against the cliffs and sand. The ocean seemed to mimic my own sigh, exhaling silently and sending a faint breeze<br>
   forth to fan out our hair, the dark strands entwining about one another. The evening was so calm, so peaceful,<br>
   even though the sky seemed to blaze with fire. The setting sun's fiery rays reflected on the snowy clouds and the<br>
   ocean mirrored the sky's fire, the salty waters seeming to turn to liquid gold. <br>
<br>
   I continued to listen to my mother's song, loving the way the cliffs around us captured and hung onto her words,<br>
   singing them even after they had already been sung. I could never describe why, but the song always comforted<br>
   me, chasing away my sorrows and fears. The first time I had ever heard it was only two days after my daddy’s<br>
   death. Mother was singing it to herself as she sat alone by the Eidolon wall, praying. I remember the wave of<br>
   comfort and relief I felt as I stood just out of her field of vision, listening to the words and the tune. Only when<br>
   she was finished did I reveal myself, not wanting to do anything that might cause her to stop singing, and I asked<br>
   her if the song comforted her as well. <br>
<br>
   She wasn’t at all upset that I had overheard her song like I was afraid she would be. Some people are just very<br>
   private about that sort of thing and will get angry with you for listening in on something that wasn’t intended to be<br>
   heard, thinking they were alone when they really were not. But mommy wasn’t like that at all. In fact, she looked<br>
   relieved that I had heard, as though she had been waiting for someone to share it with. <br>
<br>
   &quot;The day your father died, I felt so alone, like I was the only person in the world to ever feel so torn apart. But<br>
   then, I remembered a song my own mother used to sing to me whenever I was sad, and it always managed to<br>
   bring peace to my heart,&quot; She had smiled at me, wiping my own salty tears away with her gentle fingers. &quot;And it<br>
   still does. It must be a mystical song, or maybe just a simple reminder that I'm really not alone. But whatever it is,<br>
   it is now our song. Just as my mother shared it with me, now I can share it with you.&quot; <br>
<br>
   And she did. And she was. <br>
<br>
   We were connected in this way, connected by a simple tune, a simple melody. But it was a melody no one but we<br>
   could understand. It was our secret, our mystical song, and that was part of the reason why it was so hard to stay<br>
   in a somber mood when even thinking about it. It really did remind us that we were not alone, for we were the<br>
   only ones that knew it, and we would always be there for one another... <br>
<br>
   I raised my head as my mother finished the song, meeting her serene gaze, the tears on her cheeks long dry, the<br>
   only evidence of the sorrow she had felt being the saltine stains on her rosy features. &quot;We better go inside now,<br>
   little one,&quot; She said, looking to the sky which had turned from a golden hue to a bloody crimson, lined with clouds<br>
   that were ever darkening. &quot;It looks like there might be a storm...&quot; <br>
<br>
   She stood up, brushing sand from her slender legs, and held out a hand to me, which I took as she led me back to<br>
   the village. Behind us, the waves had begun to grow larger and the wind had begun to gain momentum, building<br>
   up with an unnatural speed... <br>
<br>
   Once inside the village, we were greeted abruptly by fellow villagers who had also noticed the rapidly changing<br>
   weather. Concerned mothers were gathering their children, dragging them into their houses as busy men worked<br>
   quickly to build reinforcements for their little homes. Through the drone of urgent voices I was able to pick out<br>
   one word that had been mentioned more than once: Hurricane. <br>
<br>
   Outside the village, the sky had darkened as night blanketed the land, the enveloping storm clouds blocking out<br>
   any light that might have been cast from the moons and stars. The wind had picked up, blowing dust and small<br>
   debris throughout the village. I closed my eyes to protect them from the blowing sand until we got into our house,<br>
   my mother pushing the door closed behind us. I could hear the ocean’s waves beating against the walls of the<br>
   village, roaring like some hideous monster, and I looked to my mother questioningly. <br>
<br>
   “What’s happening?” I asked, trying to keep the note of fear from my voice. Never in my life had I seen something<br>
   like this. Never had I seen a perfect day turn into a raging beast within seconds. <br>
<br>
   “They think it’s a hurricane...” She replied, and I heard her voice quiver a little. “They’re very dangerous storms,<br>
   but I’m sure Madain Sari will hold up. It’s survived worse than this.” <br>
<br>
   “Is there anything we can do?” <br>
<br>
   She shook her head. “Nothing. All there is to do is lay low and wait it out. That’s all...” <br>
<br>
   And that was what we did. That was all we could do. Wait it out. <br>
<br>
   We lay on the floor as the wind shrieked through the night, lightning illuminating the darkness and thunder<br>
   helping the wind shake the earth. I could feel the strong walls of our home shaking, delicate pottery falling from<br>
   shelves to clatter onto the floor. It felt like hours had gone by when it had only been seconds. It felt like if the<br>
   storm lasted any longer, our house would simply crumble around us. <br>
<br>
   But this was only the beginning. This was only the opening act for what was to come. <br>
<br>
   Cries soon began to ring throughout the village, the terrified sounds rising above the sounds of the violent<br>
   weather. Though most of the voices were incomprehensible, I could make out a few of the words that were said,<br>
   and among them, the one that most frequently came up was “Demon!”. <br>
<br>
   I felt my mother stiffen, her hold on my hand tightening. I whimpered, but not in the pain her grip caused. “Shh...<br>
   It’s going to be alright. Just hold on.” <br>
<br>
   As if on cue, the roof collapsed around us, just missing our huddled bodies, and the rain poured in. <br>
<br>
   I cried out in alarm but my mother, instead of being paralyzed with fear like I was, reacted quickly. Grabbing my<br>
   arm, she tugged me to my feet and dragged me outside and into the pounding rain just before what was left off<br>
   the roof crumbled, the walls following after. <br>
<br>
   The rain drenched out bodies within seconds, our clothes clinging to our bodies like a second skin. But I had no<br>
   time to dwell on the discomfort I felt, for the eerie crimson glow that everything seemed to be bathed in captured<br>
   my attention--and my breath. <br>
<br>
   A red eye was glaring down upon the village from the swirling black clouds above, lightning dancing about that<br>
   bloody orb. The wind continued to build up, and I clung to my mother’s arm to keep from being blown away as<br>
   she pressed her own body against the walls of one of the few buildings that was still standing... Until a fork of<br>
   lightning struck a neighboring structure, igniting it. The wind caused the flames to leap and dance from building to<br>
   building, destroying the undestroyed and demolishing the destroyed, seemingly unaffected by the rain. <br>
<br>
   “We’ll die if we stay here!” I heard one man cry after attempting to summon an Eidolon, only to discover that he<br>
   couldn’t. His face was haggard, wet with rain and his own blood, and maybe even his own tears. He must have<br>
   seen us, huddled together pathetically, for he approached us, fighting against the wind, to take my mother by the<br>
   hand and pull her to her feet. “Come on! We can’t stay here! Follow me.” <br>
<br>
   He half led us, half dragged us to the docks, where the ocean met the cliffs and caverns of Madain Sari. Tied to<br>
   strong posts in the ground were a few small boats, some of which already contained people. “Get in,” He ordered<br>
   us, pushing us toward one of the boats. My mother looked to him uncertainly, and then looked out to the ocean,<br>
   staring at the churning, oily black waves that seemed to meet and blend with the sky. <br>
<br>
   “We can’t go out there... The boat won’t hold up, not against those waves...” She said softly, or maybe her voice<br>
   just sounded soft compared to the howling wind. “It will capsize the second we sail out. We can’t go out there...” <br>
<br>
   “But at least you’d have a chance out there. If you stay here, you’ll both be either burned, crushed, or who knows<br>
   what else,” He warned. “That’s a demon up there, and it’s eye is on our village. It’s not watching the ocean.” <br>
<br>
   My mother took a deep breath, nodding. “Alright,” She said, stepping carefully into the boat, which lurched<br>
   forward as if in protest, nearly tossing her out. But she was quick and regained her balance. Crouching down in the<br>
   boat, she reached out to me, smiling reassuringly. “Come on, little one. This is the only way. Once we get out of<br>
   here, we’ll be safe...” <br>
<br>
   I took her hand without a moment’s hesitation. I trusted her, and if she said we would be safe, we would. <br>
<br>
   “Here, you may need these. It’s not much, I know, but maybe it can help,” The man said, handing us two leather<br>
   cloaks, which we put on quickly. “Good luck.” <br>
<br>
   “You’re not coming?” My mother asked, taken aback when he shook his head. “No? But, why?” <br>
<br>
   He sighed. “I have to stay here. My... My children were killed here, and... I can’t leave,” He said, sighing again. “Be<br>
   careful, you two.” <br>
<br>
   The demon’s eye may not have been on the ocean, but it might as well have been. The waves pitched our tiny<br>
   boat about the instant we set sail, the wind and water tearing the sail as easily as a cruel child might tear a<br>
   butterfly’s wing. Our cloaks clung to our soaked bodies, torn and of little use, and salt water stung our eyes and<br>
   any cuts that we received as we were jerked about. <br>
<br>
   I held on tight to the sides of the boat as my mother worked to steer it as best as she could, struggling to keep the<br>
   boat under her control and not the ocean’s, but before long the rudder had snapped, and all there was to do was<br>
   hold on and pray that the boat would not shatter beneath us as well. <br>
<br>
   The violent rocking motion made me nauseous, but I had no time to truly feel it. I just held onto my mother as<br>
   rain mixed with sea water and lightning illuminated our terrified faces, the boat creaking and groaning. I glimpsed<br>
   Madain Sari in the distance but hardly recognized it. In fact, I couldn’t recognize it. What had once been a beautiful<br>
   village was now but flame and ash... <br>
<br>
   My mother held onto me tightly, stroking my hair to comfort me, and I could hear her beautiful voice singing<br>
   softly in my ear the song that only we knew. Our song, our mystical song. I buried my face in her shoulder,<br>
   closing my eyes, and for that brief minute, I was away from this nightmare. For one brief moment all that existed<br>
   was her voice, our song, comforting me, telling me that everything would be alright. We would be okay, we would<br>
   make it. Tentatively, I joined in, my own high, tiny voice mixing with hers. It didn’t matter that I was off key, not<br>
   to her or me. All that mattered was that we were together, just like we had always been. Just like we would always<br>
   be. <br>
<br>
   I don’t know how I managed to drift off to sleep at a time like that, but I did. Maybe it was exhaustion, or maybe it<br>
   was just contentment. Whatever it was, when I opened my eyes, it was daylight. I lay sprawled in the sand, having<br>
   been thrown from the boat when it struck land, and my head ached terribly when I so much as blinked an eye.<br>
   Through my hazy vision, I could see figures gathered around me, their shadowy bodies highlighted by the sun. I<br>
   felt myself being picked up, and I did not resist. I was too tired to move, too tired to resist. <br>
<br>
   From the corner of my eye I could see a boat, shattered and splintered, a young woman pinned beneath it, still<br>
   and motionless. I didn't recognize her, but then again, I couldn't see all of her. I didn't want to see all of her... <br>
<br>
   I relaxed in the arms that craddled me, closing my eyes against the sunlight. I was so tired, and I couldn't even<br>
   remember why. It didn't occur to me then that I couldn't remember anything, but for some reason I was able to<br>
   open my mouth and ask who the woman was. The sound of my own voice surprised me. I couldn't recognize my<br>
   own voice... <br>
<br>
   &quot;She tried to kidnap you, child,&quot; The person that held me answered, an older man by the tone of his voice. &quot;But<br>
   you're safe now. I would never let anyone hurt my little daughter.&quot; <br>
<br>
   I tensed, but it was not in fear. Daughter? Then, this man must be my father. But... Why does that sound so<br>
   unreal, so false? Why does his voice sound so unfamiliar? <br>
<br>
   Then I remembered how strange my own voice sounded to me. If I couldn't remember my own voice, how could I<br>
   expect to remember others? Simple. I couldn't. <br>
<br>
   I let myself relax, convincing myself that this strange feeling would pass, and let myself drift swiftly off to sleep. In<br>
   my dreams I heard a song and a sweet voice, a voice that sounded so familiar but so distant. And then I realized<br>
   that that voice was my own. <br>
