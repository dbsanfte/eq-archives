-Getting up too late</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">Mattax2 was concived in the humble, yet inspiring town of Intercourse, PA. His parents, his Mother, a backwater farm girl from Arkansas, and his Father, a sucessful businessman from Boston, were traveling through the town, and were inspired by their name.

They, unfortunately did not know what they were getting into.

Upon ejaculation, Mattax2's sperm promptly used his cunning and technique to outsmart his fellow spermatoza to get to it's prize - it's sole reason for living - the egg.

It was love at first sight. The egg and the sperm clicked instantly, and began to make the little bundle of joy you see today, Mattax2.

At an early age, Mattax2 took on many atributes that his sperm had - he was sucessful in school, but only because he knew how to make people do what he wanted to do. Mattax2 would trick his teachers into giving him good grades, and trick his fellow students into liking him.

"He was a really good guy, although, now that I think about it, I don't know why..." says Tom Fritz, a fellow student of Mattax2's "he used to do this thing where he would make people do what he wanted them to do [laughs] it was so cool."

When Mattax2 reached the age of 12 though, something tragic happened. His Father, who had secretly been an undercover agent trying to reveal the wrongdoings of Enron, died in a horrible Oil Spill, which resulted in 4 billion dollars in losses, and 8 billion dollars in profit.

His mother, enraged by the accident, went back to her Arkansas roots and got out her shotgun. She went to the head of enron, and died in a horrible, horrible shoot out, reluting in 1 billion dollars in losses and 5 billion dollars in profit (ain't that right, you dirty, rotten liars!?)

So, before he even reached his 13th birthday, Mattax2 was on his own, living on the street. Fortunately, he knew he could make people do what he wanted them to do, and he used this to his full advantage. He joined a biker gang, and quickly rose through the ranks, building the liking of his fellow gang members. By the age of 14, he was the gang leader.

But, by the time he was 15, Mattax2 grew bored of this, and threw down his helmet and crowbar to go find a more satisfying way of life.

Mattax2 began to hitchike across the US. When he got to the pacific ocean, he stowed away on a ship headed toward Japan.

In Japan, Mattax2 (who knew little Japanese: Domo Arigato Mr. Robato) quickly recovered from his culture shock, and joined a local Akido Dojo. He practiced day and night for a year. By the end of that year, he got itchy feet again, and decided to move on. And, although he did not know as much Akido as he would like, he could still whoop up on someone. Mattax2 also learned more Japanese while in japan: "Watashi" and "Ohayo"

Mattax2, in the next year, travled to many different places, including Australia, where he learned the art of throwing a Boomerang, Brazil, where he learned the art of Poi, and France, where he learned the art of becoming a Mime and Juggling.

Then, at the age of 18, he met someone unlike anyone he ever knew. Her name was Bytemite (hey Byte -flashes a sparkling smile-) She was amazing, and best of all, none of his techniques to get he to do what he wanted her to do worked. Finally, a challenge. This is where he stands now, our Akido, Boomerang, Poi, Mime, Juggling master, trying to win the heart of the one challenge he has ever had in life.

He also awaits the day that some, strange, evil shall befall this land, so he can rise up and use his rare talents to defeat it. But, until then, Matt likes beef.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="mailto:mattax2@yahoo.com">mattax2@yahoo.com</a></span> </div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm14.showMessage?topicID=8906.topic" title="post" target="_blank">And finally... at 5:30 in the morning, Artemis comes out</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm14" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Color Art</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showMessage?topicID=8227.topic&index=57" title="post" target="_blank">Re: &quot;And the murderer is...
