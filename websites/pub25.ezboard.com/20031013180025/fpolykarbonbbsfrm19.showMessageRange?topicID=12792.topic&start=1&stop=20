Many people do not know, but the State of Hawaii was once a kingdom. Not just in appearance, but by law. The Hawaiian Government had signed a form stating their sovereignty and was signed and respected by superpowers of the time. America, England, France, and Japan i believe. So, now we have a legal binding contract recognized by mutiple nations. so then what happens. A small group of U.S. Marines decide to break the rules and storm Iolani Palace. Facing gattling guns at its walls. The demand was unconditional surrender. This however, was not just decided onright away. Many investors and politicians who knew much about hawaii's agricultural recources, had plotted the coup including the head of Dole cannery. You know of the company as it is still in business. So then the Queen desires for no bloodshed and requests that our troops stand down. Yes Hawaii had troops.  She sent a letter that requested the rogue invasion be stopped. As you can see by today, nothing happened. So now the sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii is overthrown. The twelve conspirators take down the Hawaiian flag and cut it into twelve equal pieces because they all wanted &quot;a piece of the action&quot;. I am not sure what side I take here. I am an American born Hawaiian, born in the state of Hawaii.  And i love being an American. But my homeland is more dear to me.  Even if we could gain our sovereignty, it would not heal the pain of genocide.  But sometimes I think about what being Sovereign would do for us. Well, thats my little story. Definantly not the version you would find in school books. So what do you think. Should a state founded on illegal actions be a legitimate state? And what would you suggest be done?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aisuru@polykarbonbbs>aisuru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/21/03 8:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12792.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aisuru.co.uk/saltire.jpg width=100 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sovereign Nation</span><hr size=1> most of the states owe their existance to the american revolutionaries taking control of british controled lands.<br>

I always wondered how it all happened. I think that what happened in Hawaii is sort of similar to what happened in Puerto Rico. What you face here my friend is an identity crises. You ask yourself are you Hawaiian before being American or are you American as it is?(let me specify that the term &quot;American&quot; is politically incorect because all those who live in North, South, and Central America including the Caribean have the right to call themselves Americans, inspite of that I will use the politically incorrect term to reffer to those that come from the U.S.A.) Puerto Rico's identity crises is much worse than Hawaii's. Since Hawaii is already a state it has a political definition, regardless of the probability of the existence of specific individuals that don't necesarily agree with the political state Hawaii may be defined by. Puerto Rico on the other hand has a identity crises on both sides of the coin, it neither has a politically defined State (its considered a Free and Asociated State, its not a state of the U.S., its neither a country per se nor is it a colony by U.S. standards) or a solid moral identity within the masses of the Puertorican population.<br>

<br>
If a state is funded under illegal actions then it is an illegitimate state. The bad news is that the people of Hawaii have probably not noticed it for some time. Hawaii would not be a pretty place if it would ever try to become independent. A physical revolt would be disastrous and a moral and political revolt (or refrased to what could be considered a &quot;peacefull revolt&quot;) would be rather futile resulting in a population that would feel depressed and powerless over their own destiny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=5hifter>5hifter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/21/03 11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12792.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://cloackedgyro.freewebspace.com/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sovereign Nation</span><hr size=1> I wish I could live in Hawaii <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think there is a broad difference between double nationality and subnationality. Your case would be that of a subnationality. Example: If my father were to be Chinese and my mother were to be French then my origins are crossed between two differnet cultures. But your case is different. The Hawaiian Nation exists only subalternately from the North American one. Yours isn't the case of double nationality. You are actually part of a subnationallity.  A subdivision of a great group of massive culture called North Americans. Come to think of it the independence of Hawaii would be very utopic because (from little that I know) Hawaiian natives are currently unable to create a political organ of an independent State. To begin with not even a formal political proposal has been made because there is no Nationalist Hawaiian Party that can even try to activate an independant not to mention the fact the the existance of a National Hawaiian Party would be obsurd because the only type of elections that Hawaiians have are U.S. presidential ones and those that are for selecting a Senator, there is no political way of ever becoming independent. I doubt though that in Hawaii's case Independence would become a solution. Your problem isn't just of national identity, its basically cultural. First you must understand that before ever being a US citiezen and part of its culture (theoretically) you are Hawaiian. Why are you Hawaiian before ever being American? First of all becuase there is so much the Hawaiian People do not share with those of the U.S. (culture, customs, history, ethnicity, race, religion, language, etc.) And second becuase the U.S. culture was imposed in Hawaii not demographically suggested like in many cases of the movements and mixture between different people from different areas but of the same great land mass. You as a U.S. citizen MUST promote Hawaiian Culture. Tell the US government, by any means posible, (via District Leaders, Govenors, Senators) to impose Hawaiian Culture in Hawaiian schools. The Hawaiian Language SHOULD be considered a 2nd main language in the school districts of your state and slowly formal ways of written and oral comunication should be bilingual. I can imagine that Hawaiian customs are still considered in Hawaii but no matter how &quot;unpure&quot; you are (racially) certain traditions cannot be ignored. Like I've stated before, its impossible for Hawaii to become politically independent, but this does not mean that it cannot be culturally independent.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=otakuxtreme>Otaku Xtreme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://gallery.passion4art.com/members/seph487/anarchy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/21/03 2:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12792.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> such is the history of the US...<br>

In 1993, the one hundredth anniversary of the invasion, the Hawaiian Government including the leaders of the hawaiian sovereignty group and senator Daniel Inouye (member of the 442nd american japanese fighting unit. the unit that coined the phrase &quot;go for broke&quot;) asked for a formal appology on behalf of the US government. their response was less than favorable. Almost insulting.
