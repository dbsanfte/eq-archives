Now to answer your questions.<br>
<br>
1)That was only the first half of the story, what i have actually hashed out is pages and pages.  This is just the rough, and I plan to build a script around the occurences later.  I want to set up the intrigue and stuff now and add the saying's later, so that it can be alot easier, and alot less arguable about what is and will happen.<br>
<br>
2)Cam doesn't want to keep Tex.  Tex is bad company, that Cam doesn't want, but kinda keeps around.  Eventually, as Tex comes around, they respect eachother for their differences, and decide to keep eachother around.  It's like when one mischevious kid hangs around another kid, who's all good and on the honor role.  They dont know why they are around eachother, it just happens that way, and makes for an interesting relationship and situations.<br>
<br>
3)Cam's trainer, Doj was one of the few good men, who was a philosopher and a scholar.  He was raised with strict morals, and passed them down to Cam in their disciplined training.  Doj put it in Cams heart do do what you believe is right.  Since he somewhat believes in Tex's limited sincerity, and he still has a crapload of money after he beat Tex, he decides it's the best thing to do for him.<br>
<br>
4)Read the whole story.  They get dragged into not only fighting the mob, but men inside the mob, and also helping out 2 new characters named Kojiiro and Hagane.<br>
<br>
5)Thanks alot.<br>
<br>
NOW FOR PART 2!<br>
This one is about Kojiiro and Hagane.<br>
<br>
       Hagane is from an almost extinct race of fighters known as Ninji. Their custom is to train them hard, for the first fifteen years of their life, and then, give them the best education of the galaxy.  They all usually become a group of peaceful philosophers that usually are the third party that settles disputes in the galaxy. But everybody wants to become a Ninji becasue they are the best fighters in the galaxy. But you are born into it. So one day, after the democracy is split up into Supreme Monarchy, the newly appointed king of the area came into power.  (This future supreme Monarchy is different from the conventional idea.  This sets up different monarchy's on each planet, each ruling however they want.  Most of which, in these corrupt times are Totalitarian.  They each rule over their respective planets, only meeting up on the main planet of Amanon to settle intergalactic disputes, such as universe threatening problems, or groups targeting different planets.  Ultimately, on these intergalactic disuptes, the Camberman has final say on everything, but becasue he owns this supreme power, he cannot be a monarch himself, and is only called upon for intergalactic disuptes.) He was corrupt, like most polititions of the time. In order to keep their monarchy supreme, they send their army to dispose of the Ninji. And they almost do. Hagane was about fifteen, about to start his education when his race was overwhelmed by the millions of men. After their numbers were greatly reduced to 13, his race fled to a different planet, and remained hidden in the catacombs. Hagane became a separatist.  Without his education and edge on philosophy, he was kind of the fallen rose, or the black sheep. He hated polititions, and everything about the new monarchy. He went about his Races ideals... but in the wrong way. In the Ninji race, they train you after the age of fifteen, so that your power can be balanced and checked by superior knowledge.  Only the very old and wise of the Ninji are aloud to take the extra step and learn the mastery techniques.  Since Hagane was left without the knowledge and philosophy, he learned this power at an incredibly young age.<br>
HaganeShine: Since he did not have the tempermental balance, and education, he was now able to do more advanced Ninji techniques, that only the elders could barely do. Hagane shortly thereafter became an apprentice to a politition.  He found out many things about politics, and with this knowledge, he killed many of the corrupt political leaders.  Continuing to do so.<br>
       Kojiiro was a lone traveler, and a master of Kobujitsu. He wanted to see the universe, and often did. Not much is known of his past, but what is known is that he and a woman who was married to a small time politition had an affair, shortly after which, he was chased out of the city, and began his interests in travel.  He has vast knowledge of many planets, most of which, he has been to. One day, while traveling along a barren road, he saw a carriage being robbed and a woman being raped. He saved them, using a minor part of his superior skill. What he didn't know, was that what really happened was that the King raped the queen, because he was jealous of the power she was gaining.  He then hired a group of thug's to play it off as a rape and robbery. Instead of trying Kojiiro's power, he made Kojiiro a superior guard.  With this new found position, Kojiiro's power became known. He had stopped various assassinations and often competed and won universal tournaments.<br>
       One day, as the supreme monarchy met up on Amanon, Hagane had a new lead on a man who loved to rape his wife and threaten her.  Often taking bribes and such just so she would stay out of power.  Hagane goes to kill this man, but is stopped by Kojiiro. Suprisingly, Kojiiro isn't enough for Hagane, but just enough to get Hagane to flee. The king is infuriated.  He know's Hagane's reputation. Kojiiro, however makes nice with the queen while the king is infuriated and trying to get himself protected. Kojiiro gets busy with the queen. Afterward, Kojiiro is notified that he will face Hagane. Hagane is lured to the arena. A special arena.  Containing such mystical power, that weapons and special non physical techniques of any kind are barred. So his sword, which is practically his whole life, is out of the picture. Kojiiro takes the upper hand immediately.  Hagane can do just barely enough to stop his attacks. But they make mistake. Kojiiro, even without his powers is strong, but so his Hagane. Hagane has more power because of his armor. He blasts a whole through the arena, and disables the field. It's game time. Hagane's power returns to him and he is able to use his sword. But at the same time, Kojiiro also has special attacks. Hagane has Kojiiro flatlined, until Kojiiro decides to whoop out the big guns. He uses his most powerful attack, Waves of Flames, only seen once. Hagane is done for right? wrong. Hagane uses the Eigth Gate of Hell where any number of laser dragons come from the firey pit of hades and does anything he so commands. They jump in front of him, as this powerful shockwave of energy is coming from Kojiiro. Kojiiro think's it's over. That is until Hagane breaks through the smoke, gashing him with his sword all the way from his eyebrow to his abdomen. Hagane begin's to explain why he does what he does. Hagane flees after they get the soldiers out on him because Kojiiro is hurt. Kojiiro returns to the queen, asks if everything Hagane is true She says yes. Kojiiro is enraged, and Hagane meets up with him. When this happens the king sends the troops. Hagane slaughters the ones on his end, and hs his sword aiming for the King's face. He spares the king so Kojiiro can kill him. Hagane goes down and kill's the soldiers taking on Kojiiro. Kojiiro kills the king. But one problem. Kojiiro is now a wanted man. Before he flee's to Koma City with Hagane, he returns to the queen, and tells her everything.  Shortly before he flee's, she tells him the truth of her origin.  She was a poor girlfriend to a mayor before the democracy was abolished, and she had an affair with a man, whose fruits came her only child, Fei.  She told him how after her husband had become King, how he changed her identity, name, and face, for a leader with such power could not be with a woman of such a humble background.  Fei was banished, and forsaken by the King.  Not killed, because of the Queens rising power.  Kojiiro's son.  She finally told Kojiiro who she was, and let her know that his son was still alive.  Kojiiro decides not to further danger the Queen and Flee's with Hagane.<br>
<br>
       So what does this have to do with Cam and Tex? as I said, this is the most powerful and first intergalactic mob. The one that buy's out many of the polititions. Once Hagane' hears there's a hit on someone that has evidence of their wrong doings, and could possibly collapse many of the corrupt polititions, and return the interstellar democracy, Hagane jumps at the chance. So as Cam and Tex are in trouble, guess who show's up? Hagane. Hagane takes everyone to school and flees with Cam and Tex.  There are flaws with this plan.  The vehicle, without knowing, is now lost.  The authorities do not know what car it is, and Tex is still seeing stars.  Cam, who had just found out about his friend continuing his misdimeanor traits, had no idea of the car or the person,  The only other person that could identify it was the man that it was taken away from, who was dead for his incompetence.  Hagane, along with Cam and Tex, flee to Koma City, in the world of Koma.  There, at Hagane and Kojiiro's base, they learn all about the misconduct in the Supreme Monarchy, and why they were targeted.<br>

I do use IRC from time to time, but not recently.

<br>
The followup has a lot of interesting premises, but to be honest, it's not quite to my taste.  Personal preferences aside, here's what I hope to be an objective c&amp;c on the followup:<br>
<br>
1) whitespace please.  I'm running out of visine. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) Sounds like you have a power level difference here, sort of like the Batman / Superman teamups.  What is an annoyance for Kojiiro would kill Cam.  Tex, even if so inclined, would have no way of ruffling Hagane's hair.<br>
<br>
3) While the empire does add another factor here, it may overshadow the whole planetary mob vs. Cam / Tex plot arch.  It's like adding one more airplane to the fleet to take on King Kong - &quot;Crunch all you want - we'll make more.&quot;<br>
<br>
4) The Tar Kin character is still undeveloped and that conflict is unresolved.  I don't see Tar Kin as a separate factor - he's just the Mob's muscle, right?  At worst, the cops will shoot at him as well as Cam &amp; Tex, but if he snarls &quot;I'm working for your boss, you fools!&quot; they'll back off quickly.<br>
<br>
5) There is no mention of Hagane's sword being magical or otherwise being somehow nullfied.  If it's a martial art, then at best you could take away the unique weapon (balance, strength, design) so they can't use it.  (Or just not let them booze up if they're using Drunken Boxing.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  The arena's negating effects needs to have some justification and ideally, some forewarning.<br>
<br>
I guess the whole thing is a question of scale.  The Cam/Tex portion made it seem very personal, very gritty.  The Kojiiro/Hagane is so much larger than life, it's like putting Casablanca and Superman on the same continuum: &quot;Rick fights the nazis, then retires on a farm where one day...&quot;  It's just jarring.<br>
<br>
By itself, the Kojiiro/Hagane story arc is very well done - it's nice and space / soap-opera-y.  I'm not a fan of external attacks (think Guardian Spirits from the Final Fantasy games) where out of netherspace external monsters / devices / artifacts suddenly appear to decimate the target.  I can accept chi-power, even if it has physical manifestation - hair standing on end, chi-balls, even force-fields.  I would prefer them used sparingly, or not at all.<br>
<br>
I like martial arts films, but not the hokey ones where the combatants scream the name of their super attack before doing it.  (I especially hate the ones where they then have the name in chinese superimposed on the screen, but that's another story...)  <br>
<br>
Superattacks are well, another story.  My version of a superattack would be something so low or so so dishonorable that they're not done.  So you do it, then kill them when they're shocked that you'd knee them in the sack.  No witnesses, no evidence.  But that's me.<br>
<br>
For me, a great example of showing ones martial prowess came at the end of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Once Upon A Time in China</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, where Jet Li's Wong Fei-Hung kills the villian by flinging a musket ball as you or I would shoot a marble.  It's subdued, and while it's impossible, it shows off the character's abilities rather than the special effects budget.<br>
<br>
One I'm planning to use for one of my stories is an origami master who folds a sheet of paper fine enough and firm enough to cause a paper cut with the fold.
