chapter of a long story i plan to finish, not even a whole chapter.... <br>
<br>
The story is based on my character from my match goin on in fight club: TAMARRA! check her out.....<br>
<br>
… For the sake of an avenger…<br>
<br>
-Chapter 1-<br>
<br>
&quot;It was silent, like a graveyard late at night. I could seem that life did not exist, only because of the silence, but it was not so. The world was under control by the vicious dark queen Akira. Wolves did not howl, birds did not sing, and even spiders did not move. The grounds of the earth had not seen sunlight for over 200 years. No creeks were flowing, no flowers were growing, and every stone of this dark world seemed to have an evil soul hidden within. Animals had been taken by Akira’s wrath, and few were still to find in the wild. Old cities were abandoned, villages burned and tormented, but is was all about to change, for in the deepest darkest forest, that was not yet taken by Akira, there was a hidden village, and in the far end of the village there was a house, and in the tiniest room a little baby girl was born, a girl born to save the world and free the slaves of Akira. <br>
<br>
The mother of this baby girl passed on as the birth was fulfilled. Some say she got ill, some say she committed suicide, Several years later, five to be exact the little girls father was captured by a group of outlaws in the lower ranks of the dark queen while they were out of the forest for food...the little girl was hiding in the bushes and witnessed her father being stabbed and kicked. And when he no longer had any energy left, he was hanged from a tree, to later be cut down piece by piece.  But in the little girls eyes there were no tears, only a little shiny red light, these were the eyes of an avenger, and this would be a moment she would remember for eternity. She was the avenger Tamarra, touched by both good and evil in her moment of birth. She was bound to be the one...! And this where out story begins…<br>
<br>
Little Tamarra did not return to the forest of freedom, instead she ran away. For there was another forest that was no longer under the control of Akira, The Toriyama - forest, west by the great falls of Edkeyes. Toriyama was under the watchful eye of a vicious monster known by the name of Aiorus! He had the strength of a hundred men, and the speed of 50.  Only by rumors did little Tamarra know of this, but she was determined that nothing, or no one could ever get in her way of making up for her fathers taken life. All she focused on was her new home. She was reminded by the myth told by her father, about the great Aiorus. He was the guardian of a wise man, who was sent by the great light forces above, to guide a forgotten soul in its desperate battle for peace amongst all living beings. <br>
<br>
As Tamarra wandered alone over the great plains of western - Edkeyes, she came over a wooden staff. It was about a meter and a half, and made of the finest magnolia - tree. It had a deep burgundy color, and the ends were rounded.  As she grabbed the staff with her small hands, a feeling rose through her body. She did no longer feel like the little 5-year-old girl she was, but fearless and powerful.  And at the same time, a little ray of sunlight made its way through the dark clouds. Tamarra felt weak and yet powerful at the same time. None had earlier experienced what Tamarra was about to, for this was the moment when she achieved the divine powers of time and gravity. And her journey for the free world truly began.<br>
<br>
After 4 days wandering across the Great Plains, she arrived at a waterhole, surrounded by many trees and bushes. She was not far from the Toriyama, but had still a couple of days travel ahead of herself.  She slowly approached the waterhole, and bent down for a zip of the muddy water, when she felt a cold breeze down her spine… she now found herself up in the nearest tree, deeply focused on what had brought her up there so fast. Silently she hid herself among the leaves, with a firm grip on her only weapon, the magnolia – staff. <br>
