I dont think the real issue the monks have right now is being able to out tank a warrior.. The real issue is monks are Pull Bitches and where you as a warrior will tank 1 mob in most situations the monk that brings you that 1 mob just split it from 3 others.<br>
So when your tanking quads for 300 on 1 mob<br>
The monks that split that spawn will have the chance to get hit by 4 mobs that will now quad us for 500.<br>
The nerf dosent really affect me in a raid manner at all, as im good enough at aggro control i dont take much dmg.. But it affects my soloing ability and pulling ability greatly..<br>
There will be a lot more monk deaths while pulling if a FD fails.<br>
<br>
The cleric nerf is no biggie as there will be very few 10K Warriors.<br>
The Wizard Nerf is actually a good thing it dosent affect anyone but the manaburn teams at all.<br>
The Mage Nerf Sucks because They dont have the raw casting power of a wizard and alot of the time the pets get them in trouble.. CotH is all thats left..I really do hope mages dont get thrown to the wayside on raids. I like mages... =)<br>
Monk nerf.... may not beable to pull or solo anymore.<br>

<br>
last night killing Rhag1 (which is probably the lowest level luclin &quot;boss&quot; ) i went pure nukes since rods were not needed.  the wizard that was there ran oom while doing about 25k damage (he actually did 28k, but admitted to sneaking 3 T-rods out from under the other mage there which gave him almost 2k more mana to use, so 25k may even be a high estimate) in the fight.  my mana turned out to be just a hair over 20k in damage.  since i don't have my epic (wizzy was epiced and decked in mostly luclin-boss level gear, so he had a bit more manapool also) i used a parse from another mage there who did have epic, to get a closer comparison as far as gear.  his pet, with BO4, no haste mask, did a about 3.5k damage, which is kind of low considering the fight went for a little over 10 mins, probably due to the high damage mitigation of luclin bosses, or possibly my log missed some hits.<br>
<br>
using those numbers it would seem that an well equipped epic mage could either do about the same, possibly slightly more, damage than a wizard.  or produce a few of the new rods and still stay just under wizards total damage.  two other considerations are: 1) Rhag1, like everything else in Ssra has ungodly AC meaning pets would do more damage vs a kunark or velious mob where they could hit for full more often.  2) over time while the wizzy is sitting on his butt medding (without rods for him) the pet is still doing a limited amount of damage.<br>
<br>
conclusions...maybe mages aren't as broken as people act.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
the cleric issue looks bad though, not the CH nerf, but a side effect of no rods.  the average cleric (assuming about 6 or 7 clerics in attendence), in a long luclin fight, uses around 15-23 T-rods and finishes the fight with under half mana remaining.  at 660 mana per rod (assuming they don't have to heal themselves) this means each cleric gets in excess of 10k mana per fight.  consider that even well equipped clerics only have around 3-3.5k mana total and you see a very real problem -- each cleric, during that fight, uses an amount of mana that is over three times what they have.  without T-rods you have to spread this cost around more.  eaning any mob that needed 5 clerics and 2 mages before will now need a minimum of 15 clerics.  the rod nerf was a stealth cleric nerf, clerics used to have infinite mana on raids, now they have exactly what they carry with them.  that is the heart of the T-rod nerf. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=797.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=797.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=797.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=797.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.threadControl?topicID=797.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=797.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=797.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lottdrinalfrm1">The Courtyard<option value="lottdrinalfrm2">Ters'Tai Barracks<option value="lottdrinalfrm11">The Library<option value="lottdrinalfrm13">Applications<option value="lottdrinalfrm3">The Great Hall<option value="lottdrinalfrm14">Epic Might<option value="lottdrinalfrm8">Ters'Tai Marketplace<option value="lottdrinalfrm12">The Treasury<option value="lottdrinalfrm4">Council of Lords</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/blottdrinal>Lords of the Ters'Tai - Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm1>The Courtyard</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.terstai.net">Lords of the Ters'Tai</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
