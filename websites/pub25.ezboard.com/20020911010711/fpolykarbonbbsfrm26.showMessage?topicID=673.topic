Rushed beams of moonlight tainted by claw like branches found their way to an old and rickety barn once adorned with activity and life. Now it’s boards have twisted and browned, once vibrant crimson paint has chipped and been reduced to an ugly shade of gray. Standing tall ripping through the sky like a scream prolonged for an eternity. Long ago serving a great purpose but is now merely sitting place for birds, birds depositing there putrid waste upon the peaked roof and a lifeline to all the grotesque life being supported within its rotting planks. <br>Surely, nobody enjoys its presence, nobody but Jane Omara who sat against a tree sketching it, but not its present self, rather with the traits of the day it was built. She began to roll up the finished sketch. With a rather odd thought Jane approached the barn and pushed the drawing onto a rusty nail sticking out from the door and began the short walk home. <br>Creeping in through the small window was an easy task for her, with a quiet laugh she thought of how good of a burglar she would make and the thought even excited her.<br>Sleep didn't come easy that night, and when it did unpleasant dreams filled her head. She found herself in water first no more than 1 foot underwater then plummeting looking up at dismal light resembling the moon, but she didn't care any light was good at this point, then the light faded into total darkness, spiny creatures bashed her into awkward summersaults. Finally regaining control she pushed off of the mucky bottom and just as easily as she plummeted down she soared to surface and with the deepest and best breath of her life she opened her eyes to see the first beams of pleasant sunlight projected on her bedroom wall. <br>Jane lifted her foot off the soft bed and expected a cold hardwood floor under her foot, instead she felt an extremely sharp pain in the ball of her foot. &quot;DAMN!&quot; she hissed through her plaque covered morning teeth while blood began trickling from the small puncture wound. She hopped on one foot until she reached her dresser and when she did pulled out a sock, pressed it to the cut and sat back down on the floor by her bed being extra careful not to sit on whatever had sliced her foot. Seeing nothing on the floor she slowly ran her hand along the floor, nothing for the first foot then her thumb hit something sticking up through one of the floorboards. Not being able to pull it out she inserted her long nails into the end of the wood segment and with astonishing ease lifted up from the floor. Her eyes widened and her heart rate increased as she saw what was spread out in front of her eyes, a small black leather bound book, a wrinkled black and white photo and a large knife with a bone handle. It’s blade propped up against the book with a small drip of blood on the tip of the shiny blade. &quot;Who would do that?&quot; she whispered to herself picking up the knife. The blade was five maybe six inches long, gently curving upwards for the last 3 inches, it still adorned a superb shine and a clean appearance. She then picked up the picture and examined the small girl standing next to a barn. The thought passed right by her until she noticed something that sent chills from the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, a nail on the doorframe supporting a wooden bucket. The thought of her standing in the exact same spot as that dead little girl, she didn't know why but it angered her, not a meaningless anger, but a frustration intertwined with an unsettling emptiness. She quickly flipped the picture up side down and grabbed the small book and opened it carefully. She instantly realized that it was the journal of the girl in the photo and forced herself to read the first entry. <br><br>July 7th 1942 <br>Dear Journal.<br>I have never had a journal before. But I thought this would be a good time to start. Things have been weird since we came here. Dad just suddenly packed up all our bags and made us leave. He even hit mom when she protested. I don't like this place very much so far. Sometimes it smells funny.. almost like what I'd imagine death smelled like. The barn creaks at night and I've been getting more and more nightmares. I would really like to go visit home.. I miss my friends and my old house. I'll write again tomorrow. Goodnight.<br>Jane stopped reading, and looked up at the ceiling. To think, years and years ago another girl, younger than she had lived there. Maybe this had even been her room, since the book was hidden there. Her curiousity pulled her back to the book, and with one swift hand motion she flipped several pages into this girl's future.<br><br>Dear Journal.<br>I'm cold.. it's so cold. I've been here for almost 2 days I think. But I can't remember the time anymore so maybe it's been a year. I don't understand why daddy got so mad. I didn't want him to hit me like that. I just wanted him to stop hitting mom. My face is still red and bruised I think. It hurts when I touch it. It's dark too. I can hardly see what I'm writing. I'm so hungry and I can hardly breathe anymore. This shed smells like--<br>Jane pulled her gaze away from the book suddenly. This girl had been tortured, abused by her own father. He had also abused her mother. As she turned her attention back to the book, she noticed something that had not caught her eyes earlier. The paper was hard at the bottom, and blood red. &quot;Oh!&quot; She exclaimed, dropping the book into her lap. Now she wasn't just reading a dead girls diary, she had touched her dried blood. She needed to know more about this girl, so again, she read on, flipping just one page ahead this time.<br><br>Dear Journal<br>Dad finally let me out. And then he fed me and gave me water. I am starting to feel better, but I have not spoken to him yet. I have been looking for mom, but I can't seem to find her. I think she may have left, but both the cars are still here. I don't think she would have left me here with him alone, so I bet she'll come back soon. I hope real soon. <br><br>Dear Journal<br>Today the worse thing in the world happened. I am crying now, and you are the only one I can turn to. I wish you were more than a book and could respond though. I was walking in the forest behind the barn when I tripped over something. It was a bloody knife. I didn't know where it had come from, but I wish I hadn't looked. I found mom's body and I-<br>Then it stopped. &quot;What happened?!&quot; Jane suddenly exclaimed out loud, unable to hold back her curiosity.  Her eyes darted to the next line. “I walked up the dead body.  It couldn’t be her, it just couldn’t be.  The worst part was that I looked into her cloudy dead eyes.  For a second I thought I saw them move and made me jump and I began running. I ran for hours until it was almost dark.  I was afraid to go home and face my dad , he would be very angry.  Then I thought of the killer being with me inn the woods and I forced myself to run home.  When I got there he was sitting by the fire, when he saw me he got up and walked over to me but instead of smacking me he hugged me, maybe he really did love me.   <br><br><br>I havent edited it or anythin yet but i'll get around to it <p>DA SCORP</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujadescorp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jadescorp</A> at: 7/10/02 5:32:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=samspade>samspade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/22/02 10:43:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=673.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First SERIOUS story</span><hr size=1> Hi there, <br><br>I shouldn't worry too much about posting stuff, you usually get good responses from here. <br><br>You start out great, it's an evocative piece of writing.  Here are a few tips: <br><br>Don't overuse overlong words such as &quot;obtrusively&quot; it's not really needed - simple and basic language is the most effective. <br><br>As above, the second sentence is overlong and gets bogged down in grammar. <br><br>You cut between past and present in the same sentence too many times, save the past for one sentence and sum it up in a short phrase. <br><br>&quot;Standing like a scream prolonged for an eternity.&quot;  this sentence lacks a subject, which is important for all sentences. <br><br>There is a repetition of birds in the last sentence.<br><br>I think you should focus your attention to one solitary house, rather than generalise. <br><br>I've rewritten your piece here for you to look at the changes I've made. Much of it is your own writing just reorderd, or cut out, with the focus changed. <br><br>&quot;Peeked and bleak shadows danced obtrusively against the solitary house in Salem, Massachusetts. Rushed beams of moonlight tainted by claw-like branches found there way to the twisted and ugly gray slats of wood. The once crimson coloured house had warped into a scream.  A shuffling black mass of birds sat upon the peaked roof depositing their putrid waste and providing food to all the grotesque life supported within its rotting planks...&quot;<br><br>My last piece of advice is to never rest on your laurels and always try to find a better way to write things, I've checked this message five times already. <br><br>Oh, read a book on punctuation and grammar something that any writer, from age 12-80, should do. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Life is just one damn thing after another - Frank Ward O’Malley</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujadescorp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jadescorp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/22/02 10:56:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=673.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://angelfire.lycos.com/cgi-auth/webshell WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First SERIOUS story</span><hr size=1> hmmm I think I need to make this peice more understandable, I started out with an overveiw of the city then I cut to a barn, and in the sentence about birds crapping on it i didnt mean the bugs an stuff ate it I didnt use punctuation becuz when im just writing my first thoughts down its just easier that way, I understand wat you mean though about cutting bak and forth, also do u think I go on to long about describing it?
