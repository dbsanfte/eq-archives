So I bought her a flower and she said thanks, yesturday later after school I ask her to the dance and she says she'll have to see if shes free that day. So today she tells me that she can come to the dance, but she has a boyfriend and we'll only go as good friends. I guess she has a BF that goes to another school and the 2 months i known her I never heard about him. So now I was totaly depressed all day and have no idea what to do next. I dunno if i wanna call the dance off or go and be &quot;brain dead&quot;. I really like her but Its hard to be just friends since everything I'v done is based on love. So if I cant be with her than It's hard to be around her at all. I really dont know the status of her relationship with her BF and if its really good or haging by a string. Should I try to go as far as possible without crossing the lines and see what happens or just go on and hope for the best? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noahrei>NoahRei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/28/02 5:19:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11533.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  hey...</span><hr size=1> I've been through that before!

You don't want to go out with a girl that would cheat on her BF (trust me, you don't), and you don't want to go to a dance with a girl that's only interested in you as a friend (let alone getting her current BF jealous). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monkeydispenser@polykarbonbbs>monkey dispenser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>

In fact she said just the opposite. The sort of girl that'd cheat on her bf wouldn't even have told you about him - and yes, you should avoid those ones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Several years ago I met a girl I really liked (though I was a little older than you, just entered uni) and we just got on, went to the pub, nightclubs, cinema, etc with other friends. She had a boyfriend and had no intention of cheating on him...<br>
<br>
...we've been together now for 10 years, married about 7, have a 2 year old son and another kid due in April. That's got to tell you something.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, the moral of this story is - just go out with her if you like her. Be honest about how you feel if you want, but be aware of what she will and won't stand for. There's no point saying 'be my girlfriend or I won't speak to you anymore' - what would that tell YOU about someone if they said it to you (psycho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  !). You may find that you don't get on that well after all and the 'love' you have will fade fast. If she really starts to enjoy being with you you have a real chance of moving forwards, but if she doesn't then there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.<br>
<br>
I have a couple of friends that are fixated with certain girls that are friends of theirs. It's always guys that have this problem! Thing is, they're still friends and they've learnt to live with the facts and accept them. There really is nothing you can do but wait and be yourself, except for calling it a day and moving on - but this is always hard no matter what anyone says, and it's only you that can make that decision.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd give it some time as friends. No pressure from you, just friends.<br>
<br>
And just remember, it does sometimes work out. I'm proof of that. <p><br>

Just let her be ok?<br>

When she told you that, it was a sign to back off.<br>
