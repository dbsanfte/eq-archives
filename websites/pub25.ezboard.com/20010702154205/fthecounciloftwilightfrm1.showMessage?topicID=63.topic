If the group as a whole is too high for the creature(s), any LORE, MAGIC, or NO DROP item WILL NOT DROP.  That way higher levels can't farm for easy stuff.  But I have to admit, when I heard about new items in the Warrens, I wanted to use Cashew to get some cool stuff.  So what to do?  Well, I think the zone is around early 20s, or late teens.  There are a bunch of us lately where this zone might be perfect.  But all the way in Odus (Lamest continent in the game, BTW, IMHO)  Easily Oakwyn, Galadhriel, and Cashew can port the lot of you to Toxx.  Where to bind though if you're evil?  Would Paineel be the ideal place for evil races?   And I did just think of this, it is possible for the higher levels to get the cool items.  How?  Well, after killing the creature(s), just bring up a higher level character that has to be nearby and loot.  Cheating? Well, not really, just a way around it.  But if this policy of looting is established throughout the entire game, this changes everything, EVERYTHING, think about it.  <br>

<br>
I can already see a problem with their thinking on the items not dropping if no experience is given.  Given that I don't know the make-up of the deeper parts of the Warrens (I had a level 3 SK on Test go just inside the entrance), but if it's typical of other dungeons, you won't be fighting 1, 2 or even 3 at a time.  You'll be fighting 4, 5 or 6, maybe even 7.  Now say these are all level 20th level or so, the 30th level group wouldn't get experience for any of them, but due to their numbers, it could still be a respectable fight.  It seems especially in dungeons even the riff-raff that would give no experience to anyone in the group will join in an existing fight, not to mention run early to get more help.  It seems for something like this to work, they'll have to figure out some way to factor in the numbers of the monsters, not just the raiding party's level and numbers.  If they're going factor in our difficulty to the mobs, they should do the same vice versa.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure exactly how to do it technically, but if they were to have a &quot;difficulty rating&quot; for each creature.  It would start out as if it were just itself.  Then as it's engaged and gets more help, it sense that it's got help and it's &quot;difficulty rating&quot; goes up.  Let's just take &quot;difficulty rating&quot; as level of the creature and whatever assists it all combined.  Maybe if the combined levels of the encounter is within 10-20% of the party's, the loot will drop, even if no experience is awarded.  Would be nice if experience was given, but I think people will have more issues with the loot.  Hmm, maybe I should be making a post to the EQ message boards. hehe<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm all in favor of the 10-15 crowd going there.  Of course maybe it'll be crowded at first, we'll have to see.  I'm not sure how the evil Erudites of Paineel react to strangers.  I do know (also from Test server), that they don't like Erudite Paladins.  I would imagine that they probably wouldn't like ogres and trolls, might accept the dark elves.  Any high elf enchanters might want to consider changing their form, and going invis to make sure.  Hmm, maybe with the loot rules, it won't be very crowded, as the younger folks might be reluctant to explore it until more is discovered.  We could be pioneers!  Best port for most would be Cashew's I believe, since there's usually druids at druid rings that might not like us dark races.  If that's not the case in Tox, we could plop a few plat to daddy Oakwyn and take us all over there.  The guards at the newbie area are supposedly around 10th level, but hit hard.  Invisibility would be the best bet until we could get a con off on them.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Infekt is for that idea or the Upper Guk idea that was thrown around yesterday.  And we have to teach Carabas how to use mez like a good little enchanter.  He did buy that spell, right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyways, see you all later, take care!<br>

He also drops a Chitin etched shield AC 11 +10hp +7 FR +2 PR. I have no clue where he spawns but I think some of our higher level druids and clerics might like this item. It may take the higher level team to fight our way to the spawn point, but this froggy seems high enough to give use exp.

Also, I had the opportunity to level up an evil erudite cleric, and found this to be a pretty great dungeon for a low level.  Maybe a little too great, as my cleric was in a group of 5th - 7th levels, and we saw our fair share of bronze weapons.  We also got a lot of Kobold Molars, which can be turned into Paineel (maybe also Erudin) for faction, experience and occassionally ringmain armor!  Well, to have a level 6 cleric with about 6p in cash from loot, all his spells, and 4 pieces of ringmail armor, not to mention some dusty burlap armor (same as cloth with different name), in a level and a half of fighting there is not too shabby!  Of course sometime after I was done fighting there, they brought the zone down for an update, which probably modified the drop tables.  Bronze isn't usually supposed to drop off level 6-8 creatures, which is what we were fighting.  So of course, the dungeon is new, so they'll probably be tweaking it for a while.  While there I also saw a few corpses of 30th level players, so it's not a cake-walk of a dungeon.  There were massive trains, greater than anything I've seen in Blackburrow (I even caused one, since I didn't have my gate spell yet, and was about 20 spawns into the dungeon, luckily for me clerics get a spell called Divine Aura <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Well, if this is something we want to do, I'm for it.  Kin, Lora or Marken would be up for the task.  Oh, and every kobold gives faction with both Heretics (Paineel) and ErudinHighCouncil (Erudin).  So it's a great place to get those factions up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.showMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.showMessage?topicID=59.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.threadControl?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm2">Character Bios<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm1">Got news?<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm12">Oake's Treehouse<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm7">Quest Questions and Answers<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm3">Stories<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm8">Item and Equipment Grab Bag<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm9">Dear Santa...<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm6">Agendas, Plans, and Procedures! - Guildites Only<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm4">A safe place to gripe! - Guildites Only<option value="thecounciloftwilightfrm10">Guest Book</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight>The Council of Twilight</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1>Got news?</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href="http://www.crosswinds.net/~thecouncilsplace">The Council of Twilight</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
