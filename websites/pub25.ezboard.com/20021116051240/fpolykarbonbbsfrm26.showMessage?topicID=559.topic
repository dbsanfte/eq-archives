Go ahead, say whatever you think about it, cuz' I can take criticizem when it's in a HELPING MANNER! &lt;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok, it's kind of like Dragonball Z in some parts, but you have to give me credit cuz' I began writing this before I started watching DBZ. &lt;takes a deep breath&gt; well, here it goes. Fare game now:<br>
<br>
   The story takes place back in the days of ancient Japan and China and all that. Along with Humans there is another race of beings known as the Skailocke race (pronounced sky + lock... doesn't mean anything in any language cuz' I made it up). They have the power to grow wings out of their backs when they want to fly, and then put them back in when they don't need them. They have monkey-like feet (opposible toes), and pointy elf-like ears, but other than that they look like humans. They have their own martial art, and their own weapons, one of them being a special blade that blah blah blah it barely enters into the story. A Skailocke's wings don't come to them from birth, they have to earn them by getting strong enough. A Skailocke's wings holds all their power, and they have an energy capacity, once that being reached the wings will grow, though few Skailockes make it to even the second size. The main character of this story is a young Skailocke warrior named Cain who decided that the Skailocke martial art wasn't effective enough so he travelled to Japan and learned a style called Tenken-Ryuu (Heavenly Fist in Japanese... basically Kung Fu that I can play around with) from an old Chinese monk who knew Wing Chun, but liked the power oriented styles of the Japanese. His name is Master Chan but he's only in the beginning. Cain comes from a royal family. His father's name is Roandirth, who is the Skailocke commander (it's not as cheesy as it sounds I'm just trying to make this as brief as possible). Cain's brother's name is Shintagao, who is actually the most powerful Skailocke around at the moment, though that's with Magic. Cain could easily top him with martial arts. The villain in this story is named Arnock, and he's the cliche' really powerful mean-ass dude, but he's not a fool. He uses Magic, and could easily wipe out any Skailocke if he wanted to, which he does, so he threatens their race. He has a skilled son named Sai who doesn't talk much but could kick Cain's ass with his superior Kung Fu though Cain doesn't know this until they fight later on. Anyway, Arnock isn't completely heartless, so he (after beating the @#%$ out of Shintagao and listening to Shintagao go on and on about how Cain will surpass him by 10 times and all that) decides to give them a chance. He'll give Cain 15 years to train, and they will battle to the death (once again, trying to keep it brief). It is thought that all is lost for the Skailockes because Cain was sort of living in Shintagao's shadow so nobody really thought that he could do it. Roandirth (Cain's father) however, sends Cain through the forest to train with a special Skailocke master named Budataka. Now, in this story, there's magic, and then there's chi, which is the better version of magic. It comes from the soul, not the body, so if one has a strong soul, then they will have strong Chi. If you'd like to know my complete concept of Chi, then you can email me at swingerchampion@hotmail.com but in the mean time I'd like to get back to the story. Cain learns to use Chi and becomes really really powerful and all that. He learns many new techniques and blah blah blah. He faces the trials in his training with Budataka and finally prepares to fight Arnock. But before he does, a wizard chick emerges from the forest and steals his soul, then posses it, then turns it on Cain. Oh, and Cain's Chi name is Kibou, which means The Hope in Japanese. So anyway, Cain fights himself and beats himself, ridding his soul of evil with his Tenken Wakizashi, which is basically a Wakizashi with a soul so it has some kick-ass powers (another time, keepin' it brief), and finally he fights Arnock only to find that Arnock knew how to use Chi all along so they duke it out soul style, which is just their bodies hovering cross-legged in the air while their souls go at it. They finally end up pretty much killing each other, but they slowly recover and Arnock tells Cain that.... wait, you can't know that, It's a surprise! Anyway, if you'd like to know more about my Chi which is pretty much the same as the &quot;real chi&quot; but I've created a whole other section to it. But remember, I'm just keeping this short. Yes, this is short. If I had told everything about this story and made it sound good instead of cheesy, then it would probably be like 3 or 4 times as long. Also, I don't have ANY cheesiness. It's all traditional Chinese and Japanese martial arts, and there aren't any spikey-haired people dashing around shouting their techniques. Well, not after Cain starts using Chi instead of magic, which is what I can explain if you have any questions about Chi. Remember, you can email me at swingerchampion@hotmail.com. Oh, and the fighting doesn't suck ass cuz' MY fighting doesn't suck ass. I've been taking Kung Fu for quite a while, now, so I use my knowledge of martial arts in this story. Just so you don't expect the DBZ style fighting. I suppose it can look cool, but whoever wrote those battles certainly couldn't have known much about martial arts. The DB fighting was better than the Z fighting. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kibo>Kibo</A> at: 3/15/02 8:25:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uselenesama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selene sama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/16/02 8:45:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://selene.eigomanga.net/Chibime.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get some popcorn cuz' this is long... but could it be go</span><hr size=1> lol... I heard a wise person say this before ...It is full of potential. ^_~ . Tis I, Selene. <br>
   I will agree with you about it sounding a little DBZ, but hey it doesn't mean it can't stand independently or even one day get published. Think Digimon, Monster Rancher, and dear I even udder this name in public * cringes* Pokemon... they all look similar on the surface. Boy meets monster, monster looks cute but can rip your head off, boy makes monster fight. But in the end they are almost completely different. So more power to you on this story. ^_^. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kibo>Kibo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/17/02 5:28:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get some popcorn cuz' this is long... but could it be go</span><hr size=1> Thanks Selena. But yeah, remember that it's not as cheesy and DBZish as I made it out to be. The brief version is all DBZ-like, but if I went deep deep deep deep into the depths of Chi and showed you that this story is more martial arts than launching enormous beams at each other, then it would seem much less like DBZ and more like a Chinese martial arts story. I've changed the story several times. See, this is what I mean by a story needing time to teak and bend until it's just right. Originally it was supposed to be a futuristic story, and the character's name was John and he had a pack on his back that made metallic wings shoot out when he needed to fly. Yeah, back when it sucked royal balls. I changed the setting, the names... well, everything except the wing part. I liked that alot and decided to keep it. 2nd evolution, the character's name was Skailocke, and he was a human with special powers, one mysteriously being able to deploy wings and all that. 3rd evolution was just DBZ with a different name. The race was the Skailockes, they loved to fight, they were more powerful than humans, and they didn't like humans... eh. 4th evolution, they had no problem with humans, there was a reason why they were stronger than humans, the reason having to do with Chi. Cain's name was Kain, and he was the first student of Kung Fu. Eh. 5th evolution, Cain was Cain, the Skailockes were the Skailockes, they used magic, Cain used the art of Tenken-Ryuu, and the authentic Chinese setting was added, but there was still something missing. 6th evolution, Cain was Cain, he used Tenken-Ryuu and Magic, then he converted to Chi, which wasn't added until this evolution, there was an authentic Chinese setting, the use of traditional weaponry, and Budataka's race was changed from a human to half Skailocke half unknown species that died out hundreds of years earlier. 7th and as far as I'm aware final evolution was the real Mcoy. I added in the Chi personality apart from the regular personality and changed some of the main storyline to not so much revenge but... well... I don't really know what to call it. But email me again, I'd like to hear more about your story. It was interesting! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=559.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=559.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=559.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=559.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=559.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=559.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
