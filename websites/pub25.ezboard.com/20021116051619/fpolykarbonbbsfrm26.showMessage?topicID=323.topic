<br>
  <br>
<br>
A massive white light filled space, blurry and formless. Light that normally clarified objects only seemed to dull any that existed in a supernatural opaqueness. His eyelids, he realized were still shut. Was he dead? Was this the entrance to heaven? Thoughts were racing through his mind, like light racing to an event horizon. There was a hardness underneath him as if he were lying down on something, he sat quietly for a moment, his breath filled him and the realized that he could not be dead. No, he was very much alive, as of now. The sight that gradually illuminated before him, materializing out of the blur that had once been, was not the scene he had hoped for, but the one that had been most realistic in his mind. Doctors in white lab coats and clusters of operating lights were present in visage. <br>
<br>
“Where am I,” he breathed, still finding his vocals to be in proper working order. A young good looking female doctor approached the table. <br>
<br>
“You’re on the 5th ring planet, Aural. This is NEXUS underground research facility number 3.” <br>
<br>
“NEXUS? The secret government operations unit?” The boy on the operating table said to those who stood above him. The others, there were five of them, three male and two female, to be exact, remained with unchanged features as he replied in awe. <br>
<br>
“ A lot has changed, I’m afraid. We now operate independently of the government of the United Federation, although one must note that many elements still overlap.” One of the male doctors replied. His lack of concern for general information security made the boy suspicious. <br>
<br>
“If you are wondering why you are here and why you are being told this,” the doctor began, obviously he had enough sense in him to anticipate the boys upcoming question and had proceeded to the next logical step. Which was to elucidate that which was hitherto undefined. “You are now part of NEXUS organization.” <br>
<br>
He didn’t move for a moment, captured in thought. Things didn’t make much more sense at this point, in fact things were more complex now then ever. And looked like they would get a lot more complex before they got any easier to understand. He wasn’t going to say anything stupid right now. Rudeness was quite out of the question, though, he could not overlook the tense feeling of opposition that was churning within his soul. At any point in his life he would have killed to get into an organization such as this one. But that was under normal conditions, this if anything, was far from normal. <br>
<br>
“My name is Francis Macby head of research for this division of NEXUS,” the man who had answered his question said. The pretty blond doctor next to him was Aya, then an older man named Jacob Shelton, next to him was a Bridget Carlson and finally Thomas Chen. <br>
<br>
                Bridget moved forward closer to the operating table so he could see her in full figure. She had blondish hair with a light brown under pinging, an attractive figure and a seemingly charming disposition, but he noticed that her movements were somewhat deliberate and somehow flaunting in nature. The words that came out of her mouth, were deliberate dry, and seemed to be flowing form somewhere else, as if the were incapable of coming from the form which she commanded. <br>
<br>
“We’ve spent the past four days reviving and reconstructing you,” she said in a short and to-the-point manner. “Your body has an interesting ability to regenerate, so we were mere aids, serving to catalyze the process. We’ve implanted in you the C –12 Universal Piloting Node. It is a dynamic organic-internode.  In short it can update and upgrade itself based on the abilities of a machine and its pilot, making the word obsolete in its case, obsolete.” <br>
<br>
Dr. Jacob came forward next. A clean cut, good looking, man in his forties with a clip board and pen in hand. “The C –12 system has been specifically retrofitted to interface with the Dragoon Class Space Systems,” He said tapping the pen on his clipboard. “Making it possible for you to tap into all bio and bio-mechanical computer systems in addition to the piloting core computer. You’ve been assigned to the prototype Dragoon ND-003.” <br>
<br>
Aya spoke again this time. It seemed each of the doctors had his or her specialty and each was taking turns distributing his or her information. Here voice was soft and the tone was pleasant. <br>
<br>
“Initial training for you, Tanner Parker, will begin at 0900 tomorrow morning in the virtual simulation capsule. Try and get some sleep so you can perform to the best of your abilities. You’ve healed remarkably well, you should feel that you’ve all your normal energy back tomorrow morning.” Tanner’s questions for the doctors were far from over, however, his choice in the matter was of little consequence to those around him. His eyes closed as they wheeled him out of the operating room. <br>
<br>
                Tanner lay on the small hard bed in the room they had given him. His eyesight rested on the silver-grey Delta symbol printed on his hand. It marked him as a pilot. The symbol on his hand was the surface of the Universal Piloting Node, the system ran through his entire body and was present in many places, but did not show. Markings on the hands of pilots was not uncommon, symbols varied in different degrees depending on which type of machine the person piloted. Such things as the Universal Piloting Node, which had been described by the doctors, were however, uncommon, but not surprising. Coming from an installation such as this it was probably considered a routine occurrence. These types of Facilities by their normal nature were not common and so gave way to more uncommonness. A node that could interface with any machine was something dangerous and wonderful all at the same time. Virtually all machines other than cars and appliances required a human to be implanted with a piloting node for operation. The node increased efficiency and ease of operation. Although all machines had manual controls they were often to complex for any ordinary person to figure out. Interface node implants were thus quite common and were standard for many people in the United Federation. The fact that he now had one was of little significance to him at the moment. All ships and vehicles in the Federation ran off semi-sentient bio-mechanical computers, and required an interface node of some sort for the pilot. <br>
<br>
                But, now, was he in over his head. If things didn’t work out he wouldn’t be able to just leave NEXUS in the blink of an eye. This new system that was easily implanted, but impossible to remove and could very well turn out to be his death warrant, he thought. These types of organizations that riddled the warring planets of the Federation were notorious for certain ‘accidents.’ They were tight on security and even more desperate to hold onto any ‘weapon’ they managed to manufacture for the war. <br>
<br>
                Tanner turned over on his side. The walls in the room were bare, blank, and lifeless. The room didn’t feel like his own or could ever be that way. The feeling was not hostile or confining, as a prison would be, just strange, strange in its newness and lack of anything defining. The surroundings were unfamiliar and this drove a certain, strong flame of aloneness into his soul. <br>
<br>
                His last memory had been seeing his city incinerated, his whole family and all his friends wiped out in the blink of an eye. By some miracle or by some cruel form of justice he had been saved. Now he had no one. He realized it so well he was beyond fear, he was beyond everything… Closing his eyes or opening them only made to worsen the intense feeling of aloneness and nothingness he already had, there would be no escape this time. Even if NEXUS killed him he had nothing in the first place when he came here, so he’d have nothing to loose when he was dead. <br>
<br>
                What he hated most of all was being alone, like he was now. That feeling was worse than anything, worse than death. At lest if a person was dead they couldn’t think at all. Knowing that no one else in the entire universe cared about him or cared that he existed scared him. The doctors didn’t care about him, to them he was just a pilot, part of an experiment, just another weapon for the war; the thoughts were flooding his mind. Thinking was as much of a curse as it was a blessing; although, more often than not it was a curse. <br>
<br>
                When he awoke it was pitch dark, even the light that had been flirting with the crack between his room and the outside had been extinguished. He was sweating profusely. Beads of  water had formed on his forehead and his hands were white and clammy with moisture. Had he been dreaming, if he had, he couldn’t remember anything. It must have been something terrifying, the only other time he had remembered something like this happening was when his sister had been sick in the hospital. He’d awaken one night after a particularly vivid dream of her death to find himself in a similar state as he was now. But now he was on a different planet. There he’d been in the waiting room chair in the hospital. The circumstance was different; this time there was no relation to his previous life. The blackness and emptiness of everything around him including his heart and soul made him feel, as though, had there been a gust of wind, he would have been blown away and fragmented into a billion pieces. Silence he was finding was a particularly cruel enemy. It kept secrets and it kept him from hearing the voices of people he cared about and who cared about him. Right now it was his only foe, but not the first or last. <br>
<br>
                When his eyelids lifted for the second time it was close to 0900 hours and the artificial lights in his room and already gone on. He went over and ran the sink to freshen up. It was an industrial grade, dull metal, cut at hard angles and completely uninteresting. The water that flowed from its tap was cold and stung his face as it contacted his fair skin; he hardly cared and continued to wash his face despite this. There was a closet imbedded in one of the walls and hardly noticeable except for the handle. There would be clothes in there, but he didn’t want any of them. <br>
<br>
                The simulators turned out to be three very large cylindrical capsules, held by hydraulics, and raised to 45 degree angles in the center of the room. The room was comparatively big volume wise to the few other rooms he had walked through on his way to the testing facility. The room looked to be roughly three stories high and the tubes seemed to be more like prized museum possessions than test capsules. There were three, in number, with polished steel exteriors, and branded with the NEXUS logo on them. (NEXUS logo: it is a yellow circle with a red outer band. One quadrant is shaded a dull red and the NEXUS lettering runs in bright red from the SW corner to the NE corner.)  A smaller Delta resided under the NEXUS logo and had a number inside, different for each capsule. Capsule one had a blue Delta with a numeric one inside, the second a green Delta with a numeric two inside, and the third one a red Delta with a numeric three. <br>
<br>
                He saw Dr. Aya coming forward to greet him. She was the computer technician in charge of the Delta Class Dragoons. At 23 she was the least different, in terms of age, from him than the rest of the Doctors he’d met with. Having looked at her bio last night he knew a bit about her. She was brilliant, graduating a year early from the Federation’s most prestigious university Xenn. Only once every four or five years did someone have the ability to make it through in less than the standard time. Aya had a special talent for bio-mechanical engineering and programming. Now, with the near unlimited budget of the NEXUS organization, they had, no doubt, put her talents to good use. Although she seemed to be content with what she was doing, Tanner could sense that there was something she was masking from them, something that was deep within her soul. <br>
<br>
“You’re in simulator three, get suited up,” She ordered pointing to a piloting suit that hung on the wall. It looked like a second body, with slight exaggerations where muscles on a fully developed person would be. The fitting adjusted to his specifications as he put it on. The suit was very comfortable and he could hardly tell that he had put it on at all. She smiled at him and looked very pretty in the soft glowing light. She had her hair bunched up back behind her head and was holding a clear clipboard with specifications on it. And intense crystal blue eyes that captivated his senses for more than just a mere moment. <br>
<br>
“Hope you like the new suit, we had it made just for you in the new style,” Tanner nodded his consent for the new suit and took the circular shaped elevator pad from the ground floor up to inside the cockpit. <br>
<br>
                Inside there were three screens and two columns with silver spheres on him in front of the piloting seat. He recognized the silver spheres immediately as the interface nodes where the pilot placed his or her hands wile operating the machine. These spheres also had a red delta imprinted about the polar regions. It would all seem much more alive and real once he ‘synced’ with the computer. The computers would extend virtual reality so that it would seem like the head of the machine was his own head, it would mimic his movements. Virtual reality was a powerful force, but also very dangerous. Under certain circumstances of intense combat or when damage was done to the vehicle, the force feed back system could inflict severe mental and physical trauma on a pilot. The system was like a double-edged blade. <br>
<br>
                 A holographic image of Dr. Aya appeared in space in the cockpit and she began speaking to him. “During this exercise you will be placed in a simulated Delta Dragoon Aventel. They are the stealth fighter, space combat, vehicles. They different than normal space mechs in that they have increased mobility and speed, but are not designed for close combat. Unlike the other Delta Dragoon mechs’ Sori, Ventral, and Deveron, which can morph between human body design and winged mode, the Aventel’s are built in wing only mode.” Aya looked at him for a moment before continuing. “We’ve decided to place you with Aventels one and two in a space combat situation. Normally we would start you out with a training sequence, but since the program has to be loaded on to all three capsules we’ve had to put you with a more advanced simulation. I’m sure you can handle it,” she winked and the image faded.  <br>

there is a couple speeling errors spell check won't pick up in there...as well there is a lot of grammer problems like run on sentences...one of the worst is redundancy...and repetitiveness...hearing the same word or the same thought too often...even in the same sentence isn't very good...It also smells like eva...and uses a lot of elements that can be pretty readily identified...<br>

Cruel Thesis Feels way way too evangelion...<br>
the unfamiliar surroundings sounds like one of the first few episodes called unfamiliar ceiling...<br>
and NEXUS feels a little eva like...that might be because I started thinking that way with the title...You could try some short cryptic acronym that has a cool ring to it...like FBI or CIA...Most start with a consonant and have at least 1 more vowel<br>
how about NIO...Nexus Intelligence Organisation pronounced Neo...your logo would be easier to draw as well...since it's shorter...Of course you could do whatever you want for it...<br>
I was scared about the simulators for a second too...they sounded like entry plugs...but I guess simulators don't look like anything on the outside anyway <p>--

Well I liked your idea about the NIO acro. Creative the way you thought to word it 'neo'. I still like the NEXUS elemet because it initiates a visual stimulus in the text. People kinda used to three letter acros. like FBI NSA CIA ... but 5 letters is enough to draw attention. For me when your reading a bunch of text its nice to have some visual stimulus once in a while. I know there will be an on going debate on eva elements. But, i wasn't actually planning to do anything with this story at all. I just write all the time and one night i started writing this. My own style of writing is enough originality to keep the story away from complete eva, but i also wanted a mecha story people could relate to if i decided to post it. Using familiar elements is a good way to hook people into a story, then you become really original. Especially if you don't plan to publish it commercially. But, i dunno, if i can get some good editing done. This one may have a shot. If your interested I can post a bit of my more original work. Also if you've done some I'd like to take a look.<br>

You're very good at creating images with words but sometimes you end up over describing and creating redundancies...or using the same word too much in a small area...a thesaurus will help the second one...moderation will help the first...<br>
The grammer is bad...but you mentioned it was a first draft...from experience the grammer is usually wretched...my story the first draft looked like how I type my posts...after 3 or 4 drafts...I got to a more finished form <p>--

I hardly did any proofing before i posted it. which in retrospect was somewhat of a mistake on my part. then again as we have said all along it's only a first draft. I think a lot of my problem that i have when writing is that i lack control. I have a lot of ideas and i try to say them all at once some times or reinitiate them at wrong times. As you have noted redundency. I think i do this because i realize something that i should have put in the original idea, but say it later in stead. probably i could say, for example, with one concise sentance what the two fragmented ones say. I once recalled what someone said about writing: that we first write with our hearts, then we write with our head. Meaning in my mind that your first draft should be an expression of everything you are feeling. Then later in revision you go back and clean up grammar, spelling, add in more color, expand certain sections, delete others. To me i like to be unrestrained when writing, that is why i enjoy it so much. The product of this style is some what cryptic and chaotic. But once edited could prove to be a very nice work. Anyhow, thats just a bit of my philosophy on writing.<br>

I used to do that...it takes more time editing that way...<br>
Now I have everything mapped out...who the main characters are...how they relate too each other...important plot points or ideas...or interesting lines...<br>
anything that pops into my head...all of that on a very messy sheet of paper...then I put it together in my head and put it into the order I want it on paper in point form...then into something more pleasant to read...<br>
It works faster for me...That way I don't get stuck forgetting something I really wanted to put in <p>--

It gives you a general outline while still allowing for development. I have to be more disciplined in doing things like that. Some general structure is essential to good writing. In some cases I kinda just like to sit down without a real structure in mind and just write and let my subconcious take over. It gets chaotic more often than not, but its kinda cool because you never really know where you're going to end up. When I write i usually try to work certian elements of symbolism, metaphor, motif etc into my writing without having a certain ending in mind, leaving the story essentially open ended. If you've read Farewell to arms by Hemingway I think my endings would be somewhat like his. They just sort of terminate, leaving no real resolution. In life I think most things end with out a very definate resolution, we might have a mometary relief or to but essentially the next day is something new and unforeseen. <br>

sometimes it's good to empty your head onto paper...normally when I do that it sounds good as I write it but turns into such a mess...no grammer...no real plot...I usually end up killing all the main characters because I get sick of them...I can never write very long stories. <p>--
