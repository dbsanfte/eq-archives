Chapter 1<br>
<br>
Cold air filled the lab with its undeniable presence as the scientist worked with violently twitching hands. His face permanently twisted in a devilish grin; a sign that his mind housed only an ignorant belief, and a forgotten sanity. His thin, malnourished body now shook from impatience and the numb-like temperature around it. His wide eyes, entangled in the disheveled mass of dirty hair, watched unblinking at the mechanisms he worked at. <br>
&quot;Soon-soon-soon, it will be soon! My creation will awaken soon!&quot; he whispered in a trembling maniacal voice. Adjusting the circuits quickly, he scrambled to the other side of he lab past the operation table where there laid a female body. Completely nude, her ivory skin gave no reaction to the sharp, icy air. Her feathery-white hair lay strewn about the table, trying desperately to cover the multiple wires and cables that jutted out from the left side of her neck. She did not breath, or gives the slightest hint of life until the deranged scientist connected the cables to another jumble of circuits. <br>
&quot;Live my child, live!&quot; he screamed, as the metal table suddenly became a wild feasting of electricity and hot lights. The small body stiffened as its ribcage lifted off the table with the many volts that pumped throughout its limbs. The scientist shut off the power as a small gauge on one of the machines reached maximum. The female went limp once more. Suddenly, the only sound in the lab was the infrequent spark of a shorted out generator and the Scientist’s heavy breathing. A small twitch in her fingers made his eyes widen even more. “Yes! Yes! Yes!” he shouted as he paraded around the room. Stopping at the window and looked to the dark sky with open arms, he announced with a demented laughter” The prophecy will be unleashed, my sovereigns! This world will meet the inevitable! Babylon lives-Babylon lives!” Suddenly his madness was cut short by the door being blasted off its hinges. Men in black armor fatigues materialized from the smoke cloud and aimed their artillery on him. He whirled around to face them.<br>
“Dr. Crane, you are under arrest! ” <br>
He slowly trained his dark eyes on the military men through his stringy gray hair. “Oh you think so do you…never!” he shouted as he lifted a large scalpel into the air. No sooner had he raised his hand did the shots ring out one right after the other. Some of his blood became airborne as he fell lifeless onto the floor. Red droplets found themselves to his creation on the table and splashed onto her face. Her eyes suddenly sprang open. She sat upright in one quick movement only to be struck down with a bullet to the forehead, brought on by a shaky trigger finger. She fell lifeless once again…<br>
“You idiot!”<br>
“I’m sorry, sir. I just-<br>
“Shut up. Miller, Davidson; bag the cyborg and let’s get out of here.”<br>
“Yes sir!”<br>
<br>

<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
“Dr. Crane; former scientist, gone insane from his research on the Tao Civilization. Escaped from an institution after murdering his assistant, but the body was never found.” Sergeant Lynn stated emotionlessly at the Hologram photos and information that flipped on the large screen of the office.<br>
“I always knew work was bad for your health.” Detective Murdock answered back, sarcastically. Lynn walked over and pushed his crossed legs off her desk with a quick shove. “Be serious for once in your career, Murdock.” She said desperately. <br>
“Alright, alright. Keep going.” <br>
“Thank you…Dr. Crane was spotted in downtown New York by our surveillance.” She clicked a small device and the monitor flipped to a few pictures taken from intense satellite cameras. “However, once we infiltrated the suspected hideout, he had vanished.” <br>
“Oh I see he’s a Houdini head-case!”<br>
Lynn ignored him and continued with an aggravated sigh. “He was then spotted in Tokyo a few months later where witnesses say that a group of men in military or police-like uniforms infiltrated the labs and killed him on site.” <br>
“Tch, trust in the police to shoot now and ask questions later...” Murdock spat as he slammed the empty coffee mug on the paper-conquered desk. <br>
“Not this time. Both the Tokyo police and the Japanese military state that they had nothing to do with this.”<br>
Murdock looked at his attractive boss with a raised brow. “What are you getting at?” <br>
Lynn returned his look with a stone-face expression. “That’s for you to find out.”<br>
Aggravated, The hotheaded detective waved her off. “This whole thing stinks!”<br>
“That may be true but it’s your case, and your responsibility to track down these imposters, and find out about that thing Dr. Crane was working on.” She stated firmly as she pulled him out of her chair and to the door. “Now you have your briefing, so get out of my office and get to work.” <br>
“Oh I just love it when you act so dominatrix, Lynn. How bout a date this weekend?”<br>
The remark didn’t faze the sergeant. She was used to Murdock’s pathetic pick-up lines by now.<br>
“Work, Murdock.” She replied as she closed the door and sat back down at her desk. <br>
The blonde-haired Detective opened her door again. “What about a cup of coffee?”<br>
“ You just drank the last of mine, now get out of my office.” She replied in her usual harsh tone.<br>
“…What about sharing a bag of peanuts from the vending machine?”<br>
“Out!”<br>

Overall, the dialogue seems pretty good...especially as helping to define the characters.  The very first paragraph seems a bit off though.  The violently twitching hands...is it because of the cold, is he nervous, anxious, scared?  You could probably reword that one line just a touch to capture the exact feeling of the moment you want to get across to the reader and I think the rest of the paragraph will fall into line nicely.  Anyways, like I said, it looks good so far...we gonna get to see more of it?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unaveenfoxthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NaveenFoxthorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/15/01 5:14:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=420.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://smoothimages.homestead.com/files/gsc2AV.jpg height=85 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Babylon Feeling</span><hr size=1> well the scientist is insane. some insane people tend to twitch alot. in this case, he's anxious about completing his creation. <br>
and yes, that first chapter COULD be used as a prologue....that's a good idea, thanks ^_^<br>
and i see where your coming from, on the description of the twitch there. i'll be sure to re-word it a little. chapter 3 is under way, however, im facing the same problem like i do in all of my stories; multiple storyline syndrom. i cant decide wich path to go with the story-AHHHH!!! &gt;_<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.grafixsguild.homestead.com"><IMG SRC="http://grafixsguild.homestead.com/files/sigpic.jpg"BORDER=0></A> </p>
