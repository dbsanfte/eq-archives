I also did alot of research on CHEATING at roulette for this.  it was fun.  I pretend-gambled on the internet for like 2 hours one night.  I am NOT going to vegas, lol.  this particular story was written for school.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Roulette by Chelsea birch<br>
<br>
<br>
Max strode casually up to the Roulette table.  He placed his bets on: Black, Even and 8 Or 11.  A $300 bet total.  The dealer passed his hand over the table and declared, “No more bets.”  The dealer spun the wheel a few times, and dropped the little white ball into the ring.  The spinning slowed and the ball dropped into the black “8” pocket.  The dealer handed Max $2100 in chips.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max Doyle pocketed his chips and walked over to a couch.  He sat down and hailed a waitress over.  He asked her for a drink, took one, and watched her walk away.  He laughed to himself.  Maybe he’d go find some of his gambling friends and tell them an amusing story about himself that never really happened.  That’s the way it was in the High-Roller rooms of the Ivory Tiger Casino.   No one actually knew anything about each other, except for names, which were very probably made up too.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max found the man who called himself Roland, and handed him a $25 chip. Roland tossed him back one of the same.  It was one of those things; Roland wouldn’t talk to you before you exchanged chips with him. “Roland.  How are you, my friend?” Max asked.  Roland inclined his head towards Max to signal that he was fine.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roland could talk; Max had heard him a few times.  He had a deep, sonorous voice, which made everyone in the casino wonder how he was important in the world.  Roland was important in the world, he was the owner of a large “dotcom” company, and lived alone in a mansion somewhere in the countryside according to rumour.  Roland never acknowledged or denied the rumors; he didn’t seem to care what anyone thought about him.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There were two other people who Max was involved with in the casino.  Silver, who was Roland’s significant other, but a lot of people said that the only reason that she was involved with him was because he was the High Roller of the casino.  Silver was tall, blonde, and absolutely gorgeous.  The other person Max knew slowly weaved her way to the tables towards them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lucille Severanti was average height, had long, straight brown hair with red highlights, and deep, emerald green eyes.  Max thought that no one ever called her by her real name; she was introduced to everyone as “Lucky Seven”.  Max had asked Lucky to marry him about nine times now.  She had refused him each time, but saying that she would one day when he had enough money to have them live a lush life somewhere in the suburbs of Beverly Hills. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lucky Seven joined Roland and Max, and tossed Roland a $10 chip.  He returned one of the same and greeted her with a wave.  Lucky stared at Max until he was very self-conscious, then said, “Well, how much did you win tonight?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max paused.  “I’m not done yet.” He finally answered, “But $1900 profit so far, one bet.”  Lucky beamed at him.<br>
  “You are amazing.” She whispered, and then signaled Silver over to join them.<br>
Silver walked over and joined them.  She flipped Roland a $100 chip and let the one he tossed back to her fall onto the floor.  Roland greeted her with a booming, “Good Evening, Silver!” as if he hadn’t seen her in five years, even though they most probably came to the casino together.  Max stared at Silver.  Even with Lucky right there, he couldn’t help but be totally stunned by her.  <br>
Lucky and Silver went off somewhere to find a place to play slots, and Max drained his drink and walked towards the back of the casino to the Roulette tables.  He signaled the dealer that he should come talk to him when he had his break.  The dealer quickly closed the bets and came over to Max.<br>
“Whatcha wanting, Max?’ the dealer asked.<br>
“I want to boost the odds for me, Murdoc.” Max replied.<br>
Max explained his plan to Murdoc, the dealer, detailing exactly how to loosen the pockets on the roulette wheel, and where to drill the holes in the rim.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I dunno ‘bout this, Max.” Murdoc said. “Whatcha gonna do if I get busted? Are you gonna take the rap? I can’t, man, I’ll lose my job.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If you lose your job then I’ll get you a new one, in a new casino.  It’ll be okay, you know where they won’t be able to see you, then after that, how are they gonna know you’re the one tampering with the wheel?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They ain’t, but you gonna get me a new wheel? Mine’ll be messed.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m not getting you a new wheel, you can buy your own with your half of the money.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, I better get half, man.  Nothing betta change, Max, I’ll kill you dead. DEAD, man!” Murdoc exclaimed. “I’m not joking.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max walked away without answering, there was no talking to Murdoc when he got angry and crazy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The plan was this:  <br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tamper with the Roulette wheel.<br>
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Place large bets and win six million dollars<br>
3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Divide the money 50 / 50 <br>
4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take his half and split to Beverly Hills with Lucky<br>
<br>
Of course, that wasn’t going to happen.  They were going to win the six million and everything, but then Max was just planning of skipping town, and having the whole six mill’ to himself.<br>

<br>
<br>
The next evening, Max put on his black-tie gambling clothes, and left a note for Lucky that he was going to the casino and that she should meet him there later.  As he walked into the casino he thought to himself that he had better get a gun, if he was going to pull this thing off.  So he made arrangements with Roland, who just happened to deal guns on the side, to get a handgun from him.  Max chose a “Desert Eagle” a large, powerful gun.  He concealed it in the glove compartment in his car.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max walked back into the casino and headed towards Murdoc’s Roulette table.  Murdoc signaled that he had done the work to the wheel, and Max placed his bets.  It seemed that lady luck was leaning in his direction.  Max got $2,000.  $5,000.  $10,000.  $1,000,000.  People were beginning to be suspicious.  Max took his chips, traded them in for cash, and had a drink with Roland and Silver.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp $3,000,000.  At $5,000,000, Lucky joined him.  He put his arm around her waist as he placed his last bets.  “We’re going to Beverly Hills, baby!!!”  The wheel spun.  $6,000,000.  Six Million dollars. He traded in his chips for cash.  Time seemed to slow down.  “C’mon Lucky Seven, we’re gone!”  They ran to his car.  He revved the engine and started to speed away when Murdoc came bursting out the doors.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Murdoc grabbed the nearest car.  He slid into the driver’s seat of the ’67 Mustang Shelby GT 500 and slammed hard on the gas petal.  The two cars zoomed down the streets of Vegas and into the countryside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Max pulled out onto a long, straight stretch of road.  He pulled his brand new, fully loaded Desert Eagle out of the glove compartment.  He told Lucky to take the wheel, and turned around and shot half a round at Murdoc.  Unfortunately, Max was a terrible shot.  He missed with the first two shots, and dinged the side of the car with the third, doing almost no damage.  He ducked and pushed Lucky out of the line of fire as three shots came flying back at him from the other car, one hitting his mirror, one his tire, and one his steering wheel.  The back left wheel deflated.  Another shot thudded into his front left wheel.<br>
The car started to tilt.  Murdoc Pulled up beside him and yelled, “I said that you were DEAD, man, I wasn’t joking, I was serious!!” Murdoc steered his car so that it scraped the right side of Max’s car.  Max lost control of the vehicle.  The car swerved off the road, and down an incline.  The car rolled, side-over-side-over-side.  Max held on for his life.  The car stopped rolling, stopped moving.  Time stopped.  Max flickered in and out of consciousness.   <br>
Murdoc towered over Max.  “I only wanted half, man, ain’t that hard. Shoulda done what you said you’d do. Sorry it had to end like this, I thought you were cool, man.”<br>
Murdoc grabbed the cash from Max’s shirt pocket and helped Lucky Seven out of the car.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sorry Max,” she said. “But I’ve got to do what’s best for me, and I still really want to go to Beverly Hills.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, I can take you to Beverly Hills on my way to Mexico, Lucille.” Murdoc said.  “I’ll take you there and leave this lying jerk here.  I really am sorry, Man. Sorry.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Murdoc aimed the gun at Max.  Max stared down the barrel of a gun for the first, and last, time of his life.<br>

what you're missing is style. and with this kind of story you have to have style. <br>
right now the story is very to the point. you want to write it so we can see the action in technicolor and hear the noises as if we were there. <br>
don't say Max put on &quot;black-tie gambling clothes.&quot; say he gets duded up, or puts on a gorilla suit (just another term for a tuxedo) or even better he's wearing one of those flashy colorful suits that sparkle a lot. this isn't a classy guy. show us how cheesy and low class he can be while at the same time make him seem cool. <br>
i really think if you wrote this in first person it would be so much better. put us right in Max's shoes and in his head. <br>
and incidentally no one at a casino would sell you a gun. he'd have to get the gun somewhere else. i mean, someone who works at a casino might sell guns on the side, but they wouldn't be dumb enough to be selling guns inside a building that has hundreds of millions of dollars inside. <br>
<br>
anyway, just a few suggestions. you may not be interested in rewriting this but if you do give a little thought to how you can give it a little more punch. <br>
