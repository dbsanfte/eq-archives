<br>
I can't even fathom how the people who make those books can even take their techniques seriously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here is a diagram in my own illustrative style. I exagerated and simplified lots of things for the sake of character, however I won't tell you about them. Oh.. and here's how to draw an eye, it doesn't look like a real eye, I know, but you should still learn from it so you can one day have a style that will inevitably look like mine and any other artist you copy&quot;<br>
<br>
I think they should recall all those books, tear off the covers, install new ones and mail them back.<br>
The new cover should read...<br>
<br>
&quot;How to draw like everyone else&quot;<br>
By (scammer's name here)<br>
<br>
Learn to draw fantasy characters, occult, horror and battles<br>
(all convieniently illustrated with disproportionate women showing lots of leg and neck-line. y'know, for coherance sake.)<br>
<br>
I think they're just trying to cash in on young people who see anime and want to draw just like it.<br>
Like any typical scam they don't tell you anything about observational drawing, or understanding realistic anatomy.<br>
<br>
I don't see a problem with people who just want to have fun with it. But I think too many artists who aspire to be pro start falling in with the whole promotion aspect of those books... so they follow the tutorials... the very limiting tutorials.<br>
<br>
Dynamic Comics by that Chris Hart guy is good though. As it allows you to understand 3D form and why the body is formed the way it does... it also teaches you good gesture.. which is a nice spring-board into figure drawing.<br>
I don't reccomend any other chris hart book though. Especially manga mania or whatever the heck that is... ick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lewstherintelamon@polykarbonbbs>lewsTherinTelamon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/28/04 6:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p084.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6290.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Some good points.</span><hr size=1> Kenny, you have some good points there but I think that the intention of the people who make those books is to provide inspiration, not to get people to copy their style.

I have several assorted books by Christopher Hart and those Japanese 'How to Draw Manga' books, as well as that book Bomu made (Ben Krefta).<br>
<br>
I'm feeling where Kenny's coming from, that if you just copy everything in the book, that you only mimic the guy who wrote it, but I also agree with Toast, Lews, and Legacy that the books are good for drawing inspiration and ideas from.<br>
<br>
I personally never copy from my books, but I only get ones that have a lot of interesting-looking material inside, and I find now and then I can flip through one of them and find a really nifty pose or get some ideas about how to handle a particular issue with something I'm trying to draw.<br>
<br>
I don't feel they should be a substitute for experiance, but not everybody is at the same level for perspective, figure dynamics, foreshortening, clothing, etc. and the books can serve as good <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>aids</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to help you along the way.  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What are you going to do, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bleed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on me?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I don't get it, where does it say this? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I own a couple of them and I page through them every once in a while when I see them on store shelves.<br>
<br>
They're mostly instructional in purpose and contain 'how to' diagrams (emphasis on diagrams) on how to contruct the figure.<br>
These diagrams aren't accurate to real life and are more a representation of the artist's style rather than appropriate proportion and anatomy.<br>
<br>
When I started in art college in september there was a class full of people at totally different levels. There were some people right out of highschool, some people who were in their mid twenties, some people almost thirty.... some of these had apprenticed under local painters before, others of them just had a mild interest in drawing, others had taken college-level classes before, and by the 'anime' artists by far caught on to any technique the slowest. They spent most of their time struggling to forget the anime and comic proportions and just trying to learn to draw what was in front of them.<br>
<br>
Art fundamentals are extremely important... it's what you start off with and build most of your skills off of. Their are good sources... such as formal drawing courses, or informal observational drawing... and there are bad sources like the artists who the do the 'how to draw manga books'.<br>
Maybe they're good for inspiration, but when I page through them I see innacurate diagrams that a young artist is going to be basing their stuff off of.<br>
<br>
No hard feelings though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=infiltrator@polykarbonbbs>Infiltrator</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.deviantart.com/deviants/dualmask.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/1/04 10:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p084.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6290.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://a.deviantart.com/avatars/d/u/dualmask.gif height=50, width=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Drawing Book</span><hr size=1> From what I read here, it appears that there really is no 'best' drawing book except for those that focus really specifically on human anatomy. Any manga, comic or other form of drawing book is going to be drawn in someone's own style. Even the tutorials here at PK are drawn in someone's individual style, so you can really only follow them so much if you're trying to individualize yourself.<br>
<br>
Given that, a general piece of advice for any aspiring artist (and even many that consider themselves 'pros') is to get their hands on a book that covers anatomy with photos or photo-realistic drawings. Then get a book that covers specifically the kind of art they want to do. For comics, look up books on storytelling and perspective, and study drawing real life objects and scenery. For manga, look at a few different sources of manga and anime to get an idea for distinct styles, then develop your own from there.<br>
<br>
Me personally, I enjoy using Andy Smith's Drawing Dynamic Comics for help in constructing figures and putting together comics, but I stick to my life drawing practices and anatomy books when it comes to the details. I also have &quot;HTDM: Illustrating Battles&quot;, even though I'm not a manga artist, I like how the book details diverse ways of drawing a great deal of physical attacks, from a variety of angles. <p>My Alter Ego:<br>

<br>
Then the point is don't get a book... no books can tell you how to draw what's in front of you, except something like ... forgetting the name of the book, but the point was mind exercises to get you looking for certain things, laying things out, ect.<br>
<br>
And I don't think you ask about the 'best drawing book' when you want people to tell you to draw what's in front of you. I do realize that many people don't get teh concept of drawing what you see, but there are also those who don't intend to draw what they see, and it gets irritating to be constantly told that. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">You are Wolverine!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<br>
And I don't think you ask about the 'best drawing book' when you want people to tell you to draw what's in front of you. I do realize that many people don't get teh concept of drawing what you see, but there are also those who don't intend to draw what they see, and it gets irritating to be constantly told that. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I honestly don't care if it gets 'irritating'. And I never said to only 'draw from life' ... my response was more about books than just that simple answer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In order to be a good representational artist it's important to learn 3-demensional form and structure... those manga books don't teach that.<br>
They teach 2-Demensional reproduction which makes bad artists in my opinion.<br>
<br>
If all any artist did was draw out of their head they they wouldn't advance past those typical drawings 8-year-olds do with crayons.<br>
<br>
and the book you're thinking of is probably drawing on the right side of the brain by betty edwards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't really like the Manga lines... and for no other reason than i would rather have a more &quot;traditional&quot; approach to drawing figures.  I think for the most part the people that buy the Manga Series (any of them) are looking for that style, for that inspiration, and KNOW what they are buying.<br>
<br>
Personally i would have to agree that Andrew Loomis's books are among the best.  Even though they are not the newest books around, they stand up to the test of time quite well.<br>
<br>
Other than those, i don't buy anatomy books.  I have a few left around from school, and the only other anatomy references i need, i can get for free online by doing a simple image search, and grabbing a random photo.<br>
<br>
I did see a book that i thought quite interesting not too long ago.  Japanese Comickers.  It is basically a collection of 6 or 7 Japanese artists, their style, a sample piece, and how they made it.  There is a great range of styles (from watercolor to CG) and i found it very interesting.  It is far from an anatomy book however.  Just worth a look. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esmeca>esmeca</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/11/04 4:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p084.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6290.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You guys...</span><hr size=1> The only book that I think it really helped me a lot is &quot;How to Draw Shoujo&quot; from ANtarctic Press.I think it' a great book.<br>

They're a just a quick and easy way of milking money out of the general public and from kids who think that they can become art gods after reading a book.<br>

You should see how to draw Manga by Katy Coope.<br>
It is THE WORSE how to draw manga book out there, a blatant attempt by Scholastic books to milk the franchise.<br>
I mean this book is just total trash.<br>
<br>
Want drawing books?<br>
Try Loomis, Hogarth and the traditional art books.<br>
They take their craft seriously and you'll actually learn something from them.<br>
