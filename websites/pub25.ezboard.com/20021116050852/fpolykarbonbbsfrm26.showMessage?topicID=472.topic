<br>
        &quot;Gene! The divice located an escape route that <br>
could possibly lead to the exit. But...&quot; paused Coveth.<br>
Silence grew and Gene could only hear the water <br>
splashing in every direction for the moment. &quot;But what C?&quot; Coveth heaved a sigh&quot;It's on the east side of the <br>
2nd floor...with a Death Sager, umm, seems to be<br>
 gaurding about half way of the route.&quot; buzzed the walkie-talkie type of device on Gene's arm gaurd.<br>
<br>
        Gene and Coveth were on the 3rd floor and they <br>
were sick of finding the exit. It had been days that <br>
Gene and Coveth(fully trained Sagers)had been trapped <br>
in the Sostage Building. They were on a mission to <br>
track down the Glasto Sagers,(bad guys)but it had <br>
turned out to be a trap. The deserted building was <br>
a total maze, water had flooded each floor coming up <br>
to knee-high length. And from the 8th floor, a green poisning mist had started to make it's way down. The remaing floors were the 1st though 3rd.<br>
<br>
        Gene clicked on the send button,&quot;So C, how do we <br>
get to the 2nd floor?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Er..Let's meet at the lobby, there's a tube <br>
shaped passage way that we could slide through.&quot;<br>
Gene grinned at the last 2 words, he questioned,&quot;Slide through?&quot;<br>
                                <br>
...<br>
<br>
<br>
A dreadful slithering whisper filled the east path <br>
where the evil Death Sager stood.<br>
&quot;Kill them...kill the 2 Sagers.Drain their blood and <br>
let their precious little life fall...Kill&quot;<br>
As the Death Sager listened, the words that were said seemed to strengthen him. His eyes glowed like <br>
burning lava, and he let out a deadly scream.<br>
The phrase repeated again...<br>
&quot;Kill them...kill the 2 Sagers.Drain their blood and <br>
let their precious little life fall...Kill&quot;<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Coveth sulked as she shuddered.<br>
&quot;Huh? What's wrong C? Do ya sense something eeeevil?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I'm not sure, but it's like something we just<br>
aren't ready for..a surprise...a dangerous surprise.<br>
Didn't you hear that scream a few minutes ago? It gave such a queer and freaky feeling.It was probably the <br>
Death Sager, but as far as we know...Death Sagers <br>
don't scream...they can't scream...they have no voice...&quot; Coveth closed her eyes thinking deeply into <br>
her thoughts.<br>
&quot;Hmmm, I get your point Coveth. A Death Sager...that screams...it's very true that D.S's can not scream...<br>
what is that something out there...&quot; Gene tried to use his head to find any information..but he struggled to keep alert.<br>
&quot;You know what C, I think we should survive and get <br>
out of here...that's the 1ST thing we should do. Then, <br>
we'll go right back to our comfy dorms and research <br>
about the whole thing while we're resting, m'kay?&quot;<br>
&quot;What you said!..Oh, look! We've been walking and <br>
talking so much, that we're right infront of the tube thingy!&quot;&quot;Ladies 1st Miss!&quot; &quot;Thanks!&quot; Coveth slid in <br>
and dissapeard into the tube. Before Gene got in, he looked around...and through the glass ceiling, there <br>
was a thick green mist...fogging the area.<br>
<br>
The way to the 2nd floor took a few minute, sliding <br>
and turning more than 20 times.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhg! That was a uncomfortable trip!&quot; &quot;Heh&quot;chuckled <br>
Gene, &quot;I didn't noticed, I just slept through the <br>
whole thing...what the cake?! This just led us to <br>
the south-western part of the floor!&quot; And it was <br>
true for Gene's compass was flashing the south-west direction signal.&quot;Goal-dangit!Now we have to find the eastern side!&quot;moaned Coveth.<br>
&quot;We don't exactly need to find it...&quot; &quot;Huh? What do <br>
you mean?&quot; &quot;Looks like somebody's already cleared the <br>
way for us...&quot; whispered Gene as he pointed to the progression ahead. Coveth gasped. &quot;And could that somebody be a Death Sager? Could it have been roaming <br>
the floor looking for any living thing to kill?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah~ C, let's not think that far yet...wich is not...<br>
but stay on your gaurd.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both Sagers started on the path, each footstep so faint and light.<br>
It was about a half an hour when Coveth nudged Gene.<br>
&quot;Didn't you just hear something?&quot; &quot;Huh? what?&quot; <br>
&quot;Listen!&quot;A dead lonely voice rised in the air...<br>
quietly but to be heard &quot;It is your blood that drip <br>
drip drips. It is my hook that scrape scrape scrapes.<br>
It is your voice that speak speak speaks...but no <br>
sound is to be heard.&quot;<br>
Gene and coveth froze in their places...The words, <br>
the person or thing felt so close...like right next to <br>
your ear...softly, giving you an electric spark <br>
to run down your back.<br>
Suddenly, a black figure flashed over-head. Sending <br>
thin sharp knives at the two Sagers. Those were easily dodged, but that was only an attack to distract the <br>
two. &quot;WE HAVE TO SPLIT UP, COVETH!&quot;<br>
But as they were spliting up, the Death Sager had <br>
 given out a ultimate icy freeze beam aimed at <br>
Gene. Coveth's eyes widened, but she had one choice <br>
left...to destroy the Death Sager...It would be very difficult, but possible.<br>
<br>
Coveth was cornered by the bloody Sager. His red<br>
eyes dripped out steaming lava, wich fell onto <br>
Coveth's shoulder. Burned in so hot making a loud<br>
sizzling sound. Coveth groaned with the unbearable <br>
pain. &quot;In one minute, this thing'll kill me...&quot; <br>
thought Coveth, but she had been wrong. Without <br>
knowing it, Coveth had plunged her powerful blazing <br>
sword 2 times into the Death Sager's hearts. The <br>
heart of life, and the heart of blood. Coveth sank <br>
to the ground, breathing quite heavily.<br>
<br>
The Death Sager vanished, he did not sink into the <br>
ground like all Death Sagers. <br>
Coveth thought &quot; Wait a second! I'm actually AT the <br>
east side!...What happened to Gene?...&quot; <br>
&quot;GENE?! GENE...ARE YOU ALIVE?!&quot; Coveth looked around, turning her head helplessly. She got up with all her strength and tried searching for Gene.<br>
&quot;Gene! There you are!&quot; exclaimed Coveth in a relief to find him recovering himself with his unfrozen hand.<br>
&quot;Gah...that is definately not a normal Death Sager!&quot;<br>
He's just given me a weak side of his power...<br>
probably when he's mad, he'll blast me into peices!&quot;<br>
Coveth rejoiced at Gene's normal behaviour. But she lifted her head and sniffed the air. &quot;Gene!We've got <br>
to get out of here!Smells like poisining!&quot;<br>
&quot;True...Last time I saw the green mist on the 4th <br>
floor.&quot; &quot;WE'VE GOTTA GOOO~!THE MIST IS ON THIS VERY FLOOR!&quot; Coveth helped her partner up, and they started running.<br>
Faster and faster they went. Faster and faster the <br>
mist came. &quot;Look! The window! We've got tah jump out <br>
that huge window!...That is our exit!&quot; And within a minute with their hand making an &quot;X&quot; over their heads with one foot in front, they smashed through the <br>
window falling onto the yellow weeds. Immediatly, <br>
both Sagers got up and ran apart from the Sostage Building.<br>
<br>
In a short time, they were on a cliff showing the <br>
area of Sostage Building wich was fascinating to view.<br>
&quot;C'mon C, we had a horrifying trip.Let's go home.&quot;<br>
&quot;Let me look at Sostage for the last time.&quot; She <br>
turnedaround playfully at the scene. &quot;It's creepy.<br>
..but still beautiful.&quot;<br>
And Gene turned around starting to head home, smiled <br>
with his head down.Then looking up to the fresh sky.<br>
&quot;Hey wait up Gene!&quot; Coveth ran up to Gene and started walking beside him. Gene looked at her with a good-natured face.&quot;It's good to be alive.&quot; <p>- I Can LITHP! -

<br>
     It had been a tiresome day at S.I.T Academy. It was 11-o-clock and Gene was sitting up on his bed, reading the &quot; Hidden Sagers&quot;. He thought the book was quite interesting for it explained how ordinary Sagers had been tortured and brain washed to evolve into a horrifying creatures. Gene's eyes were beginning to droop, so he placed the book aside and lied down to sleep. And the light no longer was to be seen, for his eyes closed and the moment of sleep had overcome into Gene's body.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Foot steps...from behind him, and infront of him, all aound him...and a<br>
 queer voice spoke leaving fear in the air.<br>
&quot;It is your blood that drip <br>
drip drips. It is my hook that scrape scrape scrapes.<br>
It is your voice that speak speak speaks...but no <br>
sound is to be heard.&quot;<br>
Where had Gene heard that from? So familure, yet unrecognizable.<br>
Suddenly, a dark shape had risen from <br>
the ground. Gene was petrified...he felt dead with <br>
only his eyes buldging. Closer and closer the figure advanced, and harder <br>
it was for Gene to breathe. He noticed a hook covered with red stain.<br>
Gene had reattained his voice. He rememberd the <br>
ghostly figure. &quot;Death Sager? But how? I thought <br>
Coveth killed you...&quot; But all was to be heard was the phrase of words<br>
 from the Death Sager.<br>
&quot;It is your blood that drip <br>
drip drips. It is my hook that scrape scrape scrapes.<br>
It is your voice that speak speak speaks...but no <br>
sound is to be heard.&quot;<br>
Instantly, the Death Sager transported like a <br>
thunderbolt, right infront of the young man's face.<br>
The Death Sager looked more deadlier than the 1st <br>
time Gene had seen it. White with blood streaking <br>
down it's face, and bloody lava dripping from it's <br>
eyes. Gene was being chocked, the Death Sager wasn't moving,<br>
but it was like having invisible hands around his neck.<br>
Blood was all over Gene...and then everything blacked <br>
out...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
There was a little cottage by the mountains near the Nexdale Village.<br>
A little girl peaked out the window for she was extremlely bored.&quot; Daddy! <br>
Look! There's a hooded stranger outside of our house!&quot;<br>
The girl's father looked up from his reading&quot;Hmmm? Who could it be?&quot;<br>
The mother walked over to the door and she looked out the peeping hole <br>
of the door. She froze at the sight.  Eyes staring back at her...Eyes that <br>
were burning with magma.Suddenly, the poor girl's mother...breathed her <br>
last breath on the world. The next day, there was no cottage by the <br>
mountains. No family...no life...only a mark on the ground where a small <br>
cottage use to stand. A red...glowing mark...<br>
<br>
Coveth knew something terrible was out there. Roaming across the lands,torturing people's lives. But what was it? What kept on making her <br>
so worried? <br>
An image flashed across her mind. &quot;What tha?&quot;<br>
&quot;uhhhhh uhhhh BOO!&quot; Gene shouted.<br>
Interupted from her thoughts, Coveth turned around slowly. She stared at <br>
Gene for a moment. &quot;Uhhh, AAAAAAH~!&quot; Coveth replied.<br>
&quot;Hehe. Seems like your slow today? What's up?&quot;<br>
&quot;Eh, not much...&quot;<br>
