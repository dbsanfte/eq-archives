I donno, but when I was a kid and I'd see a scary movie it would freak me out for weeks.  I remember seeing some old movie called Its Alive and how I couldn't sleep in the same room with my baby brother because I was scared he'd eat my face off.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I admit that I can still be freaked out but nothing that really lasts much after the movie is over.  :yes<br>

i did see a movie that really freaked me out this year. Has anyone seen Frailty. i kept turning me head away when people died but they never even showed someone die.

And the Shining was scary, especially when a couple weeks later you're in a hotel in room 237 or whatever it was. (Hey, it's been a while since I watched it). I think people who didn't find the shining at all scary or disturbing missed something or didn't understand it. I'm serious.<br>

The Omen is another great movie. And scary.

Pretty good movie and I enjoyed it. My wife was all freaking out in it and holding my hand and squeezing it when a suspenseful part came along.<br>
As with my experience with the Ring and Signs is this: I wish that other people would shut the hell up when watching scarry movies. Ok, I know folks will scream and freak out when something scarry happens, but please for the love of God (or whoever else you worship or don't)... when something scarry is going to happen, don't go &quot;Booo&quot; to your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend/significant other to try and get them to freak out before the scary part actually happens! Crimeny!<br>
There was a scarry part that happened that I couldn't help but laugh at because someone in the audience just FREAKED. Remember the part when Rachelle was watching the tape in the farmers house, and then you see the farmer standing behind her when the light from the light house shines on them? This lady a couple seats down just SCREAMS like someone was killing her! I have never heard anyone scream like that before in a movie.<br>
<br>
Spoilers!!!!<br>
<br>
There were a couple parts that freaked me out. What really got me freaked was when the kid was coming out of the well and when she was walking she was moving unnaturally and they would skip frames. Freaky! Also, when she comes out of the TV... then kind of warps forward a few feet towards the guy... that was really cool! It was freaky in a cool way!<br>
<br>
My next part here is to ask what people thought of the ending to The Ring? Did anyone get what the Ring really is?<br>
Why did Rachelle live while the other guy died? Why did her son freak out when he found out they found the girls body? Why then does Rachelle make another copy of the tape and tells her son to make someone else watch it?<br>
My wife and I were talking about it and came to this conclusion. A ring or circle has no beginnng and no end. That's what the &quot;Ring&quot; is. The tape is supposed to be seen and passed onto others. If someone sees it and doesn't show it to someone else, they will die. If that person shows it to someone else, they live. Then the other person has to pass it on to survive. Think of those chain letters you used to get that said something bad would happen if you didn't pass it on.<br>
The four teens died because they didn't show it to anyone else. The guy (Rachelles' friend) eventually dies because he doesn't show the tape to anyone else. Rachelle lives because she shows the tape to her friend. Remember at the end when her son says: &quot;She wants to be heard&quot; (or something along those lines)? That's why she makes another copy of the tape for her son and tells him to show it too someone.<br>
Break the ring, you die.<br>

I don't think very highly about people who don't know what the @#%$ they're talking about and then insult me for their mistakes and/or assumptions.<br>
<br>
When did I say it was a good thing not to be scared by scary movies? I just said I didn't find the movie scary. I LIKED the movie, and I like many other movies, whether or not they scare me. You watch &quot;scary&quot; movies to be scared? Good for you. I'm NOT you. Just because I watch movies for a different reason, that doesn't make me wrong. Also, when did I ever say that just because I'm not scared that I cosidered them stupid? <br>
<br>
And the biggest mistake of your whole post is this idiotic &quot;scary&quot; movie crap. A &quot;scary&quot; movie? I believe that would be quite a subjective way of categorizing a movie. I like HORROR movies... I believe that would be the actual term for these movies. In fact, that is one of my favorite genres. I don't appreciate your assuming that everyone should watch them for the same reasons you do. Whether I derive my entertainment from being scared or anything else from watching one is my own damn business, and just because my reason for enjoying them is different from yours doesn't make me or anyone else wrong for doing so. <br>
<br>
And that idiocy about people not being scared because they don't &quot;get it&quot; is pathetic. Even if that were true, that's the fault of the movie for not conveying that feeling properly. And last time I checked, being frightened wasn't some especially cerebral activity. It's not like after contemplating the deeper meaning of The Shining that all of a sudden you'll break out into cold sweats and get freaked out.<br>
<br>
Now get off your high horse and recognize that people don't necessarily have to like things for the same reason as you. <p><html>

Anyway, I too saw the exorcist when it was re-released in theatres a couple of years back. It was SO funny. Yeah, I wasn't afraid of it either. But thats to be expected. And now for my 2 cents. <br>
<br>
Of course, first I'll point out that the Exorcist first came out decades ago yadda yadda yadda. Now for the important stuff. Yes, there were subliminal messages in it, as was pointed out earlier by someone who's name I can't remember. But, all that stuff hasn't been in the movie for 25 years. Lemme just clear thing up.. The reason why people were so scared of the movie the first few weeks wasn't because the effects were new for their time, but because at the really frightening parts of the movie, the editors replaced individual frames of the movie with never before published Holocaust photographs. The audience didn't notice it with their eyes(duh), but their minds did... and that made them think that the movie was the scariest damn thing they've ever seen (keep in mind, these are HOLOCAUST photos). Then a couple of weeks later, the producrs were caught, the movie was put on the shelf for a while, the pictures were taken out and the movie was eventually put back into theatres, advertised as being &quot;scarier than ever before&quot;...which it wasn't...and is even less so today. The end. Wasn't that a great story? <p>&lt;b&gt;NieA loves you.&lt;/b&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wantsomepie>wantsomepie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/26/02 10:27:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11319.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/wantsomepie/animations/sloface.gif width=57 height=89></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: R</span><hr size=1> In response to Komikono[SPOILERS]<br>

<br>
While what you said about the ring being a cycle could be well, probably is true, I think the more obvious answer to the question is just that the ring was what Samara saw after being trapped in the well.  In the flashback/hallucination/whatever that they showed near the end, when Samara looked up she could see a ring of light coming in around the lid of the well.  If I am remembering correctly, that ring looked exactly like the one in the tape.  According to Rachel, Samara died 7 days after seeing that ring of light, just as viewers died 7 days after seeing the identical ring in the video.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why did her son freak out when he found out they found the girls body?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Oooooooh, that was a great moment.  It seemed like everything was all fixed up, and the sudden change in the music tone and the boy's facial expression just sent chills down my spine.  I believe he was so scared because he knew that Samara's intent was always going to be malevolent, regardless of whether or not she was helped, and thus he realized that they hadn't solved the problem at all.  *Shivers*<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why did Rachelle live while the other guy died?... Why then does Rachelle make another copy of the tape and tells her son to make someone else watch it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think that making the copy was just as vital for one's survival as showing it to others.  Remember that Rachel didn't make the last copy herself; she guided her son's hands as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>he</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pressed the buttons to record it.  I believe that in order to truly be spreading Samara's pain, which is what had to be done to not be killed, people would have to both make their own copy of the tape and show it to someone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=komikino>komikino</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/27/02 1:39:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11319.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://schleiferstudios.com/dance80.gif height=80 width=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: R</span><hr size=1> Interesting points, Wantsomepie.

I really did not find this movie scary at all - a few jumpy parts (I'm extremely spastic) but I found it to be less of a scary movie and more of a drama of some sorts. I usually find that a concept can scare me much more than sights/sounds/film tricks...and I don't think the concept of a video tape that kills you is enough to get worked up over.<br>

I agree - the concept of warping straight into Hell scared the hell out of me. (pun intended.) Innovative use of sound and ideas...it had me pretty scared throughout. <p><div style="text-align: center;">

Saw it and was sorta let down, after the start things just sorta dwindle down. Story wasn't too amazing, characters were like able. My fav thing was the imagery. The video itself is amazing. It's like the NIN closer video but more creepy, the sound really complements the imagery. <br>
all in all a good movie, 7 - 10 for me.  <p>Sorry, try again...<br>
