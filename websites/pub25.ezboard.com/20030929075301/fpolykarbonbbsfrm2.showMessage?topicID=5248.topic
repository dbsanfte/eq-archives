I have lots of free time, but for some reason I keep putting off working on a particular drawing, or starting a new one. What's funny is that while I'm bored, the one thing I would like to do most would be drawing. It seems I just have trouble getting self-motivated to resume work. Drawing is the most relaxing hobby I've ever found, but I still feel that I need a bit more discipline in terms of devoting enough time towards it (so I can be more relaxed ^_^) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=retrotorque>RetroTorque</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/20/03 7:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Staying motivated to sketch/draw 5 hours a day?</span><hr size=1> If you're having a hard time starting, just start cranking out thumbnails for ideas and to help get your mind in gear. I usually spend about an 30 minutes to an hour on making a ton of thumbnails when I begin a project.  <br>
<br>
If your having trouble keeping your intrest in something then try working on something else for a while. Then come back to it. Having multiple projects going at the same time helps give you something to do, and you'll always have something that could use some working on when you don't want to start a new thing. I recently finished a digital painting between several drawings. When I got bored of the drawing I was working on, or wasn't quite ready to do a new thing, I'd just open up the painting and start messing with it. <br>
<br>
Another thing to do is just keep a sketchbook were ever you go and just doodle in it when you get some free time (this works well for me because I don't have to much of that). I typically work on concepts and portraiture in my sketchbook and take the ideas I put in it back home for future use.<br>
<br>
And instead of pushing yourself to get five hours a day of drawing, just focus on drawing every day period. Unless you are doing something for a job, don't whip yourself to meet your time allocation. Just work on drawing something, don't finish... hey at least you did something and that experience builds up. Forcing yourself to draw and be creative doesn't always work and can get you frustrated.  <p>Be well, do good work, and keep in touch. -Writer's Almanac NPR</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mechawashu@polykarbonbbs>mechawashu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/20/03 7:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Staying motivated to sketch/draw 5 hours a day?</span><hr size=1> I'm not having any trouble being creative, or coming up with content, nor am I becoming frustrated. I just for some reason end up either gaming, or watching T.V instead of doing what I really want to do (which is draw). One thing that I've got in the awful habit of is just drawing symterical shapes on a small pad while watching T.V. I pretty much visualize a certain shape in my head while watching T.V, then draw it, then every few minutes I glance down to see what the results are. Most of the time their dead-on (unless it was some type of really detailed narrow curve).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=retrotorque>RetroTorque</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/20/03 8:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Staying motivated to sketch/draw 5 hours a day?</span><hr size=1> If you go play games or watch the T.V. instead of working on your drawings then it's probably because you are bored with them. So challenge yourself with something. Draw a blow your mind out battle scene with over the top detail, go outside and draw the tree in your yard, set up a mirror and shoot faces in it to draw, or use a media you haven't tried before. <br>
<br>
Also unplug your television and game consols. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Try one hour then when you get a groove going, extend that time bit by bit.<br>
<br>
Also, spend most of the time doodling. Give yourself one serious goal to do and sped the rest of it doodling. This way you can warm up to get a flow going then do something serious then warm down. When you doodle, you usually don't care about correctness so there are no boundaries to tell you what to do. Once you get that mindset, you should be able to work better on the serious stuff because your creative mind is in control while your analytical mind keeps a back seat still giving pointers.<br>
<br>
But it's important to not set your goals too high AND that you can also come back to a drawing and don't have to finish it in one go (that's one of my problems).<br>

This is a pretty good idea. If you`re distracted, remove the distractions. I find I draw best when I`m away from home or at school.<br>
<br>
When you say you have trouble starting... well there`s two things I can think of. You`ve decided to draw five hours a day? Then set aside time to draw in; say, start at 9:00. You might also want to break that five hours up. To say you`re going to draw for five hours is going to put you off drawing.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if you have trouble with wanting to play games or watch TV, then alternate. When I was studying for exams, I did something similar, sort of a reward system, just with studying instead of drawing. Draw for two hours, play games for an hour, draw for an hour, watch TV half an hour. It works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=superrats>Super Rats</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/23/03 6:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.happysoda.com/images/avatars/anime19.png height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting started</span><hr size=1> A lot depends on your personality.

Working 40+ hours a week, going to night school and being a gamer, I too find it difficult to make time for drawing. I used to try to force myself, and I can personally vouch for the fact that it doesn't work. You just keep starting projects you don't finish because your heart isn't in it from the start.<br>
<br>
Instead, what I do is, when I absolutely cannot draw (say, because I'm at work) but I really want to, I'll whip out the word processor and type down what things I'd like to create. (Of course, handwriting works, too.) I make up characters, write out their weapons designs, their vehicles, their settings, etc., and then I have something I can print out and look at later for motivation whenever I finally do pull out my paper and pencils. But I am a writer as well as an artist, so writing feels just as natural to me. <br>
<br>
And like someone else said, sketching thumbnails works well, too. I like to grab those yellow sticky pads and just quickly scrawl out a scene or a character, and I keep the sticky until I get time to do some drawing, and bam, I've got something I want to create right beside me.<br>
<br>
You've got to wrap your mind around what exactly you WANT to create, and then you won't have any trouble getting motivated to do it. Forget time constraints, just work from your heart.<br>
<br>
My character design teacher said the best thing to do is try to draw either two hours a day or six hours a week, whichever fits you best. If you can do that, you'll be getting in lots of practice.<br>
<br>
Good luck and don't stress it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mukkinese>Mukkinese</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/23/03 7:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting started</span><hr size=1> I know this a 'late' reply to the topic, but this kind of problem is generally a recuring one. <br>
<br>
So, when I have trouble getting down to work my technique to motivate myself ( this is guaranteed to work for me -hope it works for you too ) is; look at the piece you are working on (if you haven't already made a start doodle for a few minutes then contemplate the doodles ), that's it. <br>
<br>
Yes, I'm serious just spend some time looking at the work you have already done, don't try to 'force' yourself to do anything, simply spend some time contemplating what you have drawn so far. Don't say to yourself things like 'I have to get something done', that just associates pressure with the work and makes starting more difficult.<br>
<br>
What happens when you contemplate your work? You know from past experience, soon enough you will see something that 'just needs a little corection/touch-up' or an idea will occur to you that would be fun to put in the image, next thing you know you're working.<br>
<br>
Sounds too simple to work? Give it a try -you never know, it may work for you too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pencilsoldier>Pencil Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/23/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5248.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebs.com/pencilsoldier/pencils.txt  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting started</span><hr size=1> Dont try to set a time for drawing practice, draw until you dont want to anymore.

 i think that's a good idea to go by, generally. a lot of people start drawing when they're very very young, just out of a natural craving to.  i believe the ones who keep drawing, coloriung, etc as they grow aren't doing so soley because they're improving (which usually they do improve), but because they still enjoy it. <br>
 On the other hand, if you're trying to make a career out of drawing, then inevitably you're going to have to drawing even when you don't feel like it.  <br>
