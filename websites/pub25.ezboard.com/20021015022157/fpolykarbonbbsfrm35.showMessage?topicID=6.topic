Hopefully Homestead sticks with me and doesn't choke up here.<br><br>Okay, here's what we have to start with.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>From scratch, your going to notice pencil and ink smudges, doubled up lines, that sort of thing. (Circled them here for reference, but they should be fairly obvious most of the time.)<br>So...<br><br>-==Step 1: Line cleanup==-<br><br>First off, if the layer with lineart is listed as 'Background' with a lock next to the name over in the layer palette, you want to double click it, name it LINEART when the popup appears, and click OK. <br>(I use all Caps for important layers as not to mess with them later.)<br><br>Now your going to want a small or medium size brush, hard edge, to get crisp lines. Hit D (Sets your Fore and Background colors to default, Black and White) then X (Will switch which is FG and which is BG). So you have white selected as your paint color. Zoom in on areas with smudges or needing cleanup, and just paint over the smudges. You can thin out lines this way too if it's needed. (Ctrl-Space-LeftClick is the Shortcut for zoom. Ctrl-Alt-Space and a click will zoom out). <br><br>Once your done, everything should be squeaky-clean with the lines:<br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>-==Step 2: Base Colors==-<br><br>First order of business is to create a new layer and drag it under the LINEART layer. Select the LINEART layer, and in the drop down for blending mode, set it to multiply. <br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen001.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Now go back to the blank layer under the lineart layer you just created. Pick where you want to start coloring, grab what color you want. (In this case I'm starting with Kai's hair, so I've picked up a dirty blondeish yellow.) Right-clicking the layer and renaming it Hair is useful later. Do this for all your different layers so you can keep track.<br><br>From here, simply paint on the blank Hair layer under lineart and it'll come through as being under the lines, but not covering the lines like what would happen if you colored on the lineart layer itself. Having the Line layer set to Multiply makes it so that all White is transparent without actually deleting it. <br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen002.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Don't bother with the paint bucket, on the blank layers it'll fill up the page and on the line layer it'll leave nasty jaggies near the edges of lines. Coloring under the lines keep things crisp. Just alter brush size as needed to speed things up by getting larger areas at once.<br><br>If you need to touch up outside of lines, use the eraser tool and softly cut away at excess paint.<br><br>Just keep creating new layers and dragging them down as you need them, and take your time. This step can be the time consuming of all, no point in trying to rush it. If you rush, it'll show. Likewise if you take your time. So be patient. Also keep in mind you can condense sets of colors to a single layer if they're spread out. (No point in creating 5 layers for hair when they're spread out and you can just color them all on a single layer, right?)<br><br>Final base colors look a little like this:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Keep in mind that only the layer with the lineart was made transparent. Take advantage of it.<br>For example, I colored the hair up, then moved onto skin. Well, putting the skin layer under the hair layer means that you color under the edges of the hair color like so. This way you don't leave white jaggies, and it pulls things together real nice and clean. Example? Example:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen003.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen004.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Go ahead and create layers way at the bottom and do backgrounds this way too, skipping skies or places where you will be doing effects, we'll cover those later. Meet ya on the next step. (Note: While you get done with the base character colors, you may want to create a layer under all the character layers, but above the background ones, and paint solid white under things like eyes and teeth. It will save some erasing later.)<br><br>-==Step 3: Paneling==-<br><br>I do these before shading and effects so that I can simplify the process of speedlines and the like a little bit.<br>Make a new layer above the Lineart layer. Here, get the Rectangular Marquee and make a selection not quite as big as the page. Invert the selection. (Shift-Ctrl-I, or go to Select&gt;Inverse.) Grab the paintbrush, hit D to get black as your fore color, and press Alt-Backspace to fill the outside border with black.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_4.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Go back to the rectangular marquee and select blocks between panels, and alt-backspace as needed to fill.<br>For added flavor, you can grab a small hard edged eraser and cut away at the panels where something can be 'popping out'. I used it here for Taylee's hair in the bottom left corner.<br>Here's the page paneled up:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_5.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>And a zoom-in on where I used to out of frame thing on Taylee's hair:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen005.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>-==Step 4: Shading==-<br><br>Shading is helpful to convey a mood even moreso than the general colors. A scene covered in shadow conveys a sense of evil or gloom better than a well lit room. Cel-Shading was decided on for use in Field Of View, so of course that's what I'll be using here.<br><br>Grab a hard edge brush, medium size. Set it to black. Up top in brush options, you'll want to set its blending to Multiply, and about 15%. (Use a higher number if you want stronger or more pronounced shadows.)<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen006.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Pick a layer to start, and over in the layers palette, select it, and check the Lock Transparent Pixels box.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen007.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>In a continuous brushstroke, paint in your shadows. It needs to be continuous because if you paint over another shadow, it will darken that as well. If you have trouble, sample the color of the shadow, and set your brush back to normal mode, 100% and paint that way. Little less convenient, but it may help for some of the trickier shadows you might need to do.<br><br>Still on multiply (Put it back to what we had if you switched), and paint in darker shadows, drop shadows, and the like. My example here is the drop shadows from Kai's hair, and the ridges in the ear.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen008.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Do the rest of the character shadows in this manner. If you have an important background area, take the time to do it this way as well. Otherwise, there's a shortcut for extra background things, but I'll cover that in the next section with effects.<br><br>The picture is getting there, but it's still missing some bang.<br>(Apologies here, forgot to screenshot this one.)<br><br>-==Step 5: Effects==-<br><br>This is where we break out the razzle-dazzle and things are going to start to shine.<br>I'm going to start with the background trick I promised. Go down and grab the layer that has what you want to start with. I'm using the buildings as my example.<br><br>Grab the marquee of your choice. Lock transparent pixels like you did with the character shadings, and make a selection around the first thing that needs shadow. It doesn't need to be a tight selection, thats what the lock transparent is for. The selection just makes sure it doesn't bleed to things on the same layer in other panels.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen009.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>With the area selected. Go grab your gradient tool. (Click and hold on the paint bucket tool, gradient will be on the flyout menu.) Hit D to reset to black and white. For the majority of things, you'll want multiply, a turned down opacity, and the default gradient set to multiply. (Linear) But in most cases, dramatic lighting can be just as effective as normal lighting, if not more. <br><br>Here I used the Reflected Gradient, hit x to switch black and whites places, set my gradient to screen and 85% opacity. Then I just dragged outward from the center. It gives a nice focus on the main point of the frame, Kai getting smashed. The bright white in the center pushes the viewer's eye to the middle and the fade outwards keeps the background where it belongs, in the back.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen010.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Hit Ctrl-D to deselect, and move on to the rest of the background that needs done with the linear gradient (Use multiply, black in foreground. Play until you get the hang of it and it becomes pretty simple). Keep in mind for rounder objects (Say, the trees), you may want to try the radial gradient. Remember to keep your lighting as consistent as possible. Next up will be how to play in the skies.<br><br>First you're going to want colors fit for the sky. Pick a light blue, and a darker one, both should look kind of faded or washed out. <br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen011.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Unless you want a more pronounced sky, in which case feel free to pick something brighter. Same way as the backgrounds, except you want full opacity, and normal mode on a linear gradient. Select the area, drag and voila. <br><br>The next effect are the glowy sort of lines around Kai. I actually have custom brushes made for speedlines and this sort of thing. (Make a new document, ~300 pixels long or so. Put a single black in the middle. Ctrl-T to get the free transform box, and stretch that dot out long. It should have a tapered and faded edge, might not see that til zoomed in though. Press Ctrl-A to select the document, and go to Edit efine Brush..., name it, and you're good to go.)(Polykarbon.com hosts a tutorial that will explain it better than I can if your having trouble, it's where I got the idea in the first place.)<br><br>First I put the normal sky gradient behind Kai. Then I grabbed the custom brush just made, and pulled it down with a dark blue using quick sharp strokes. Next grab a lighter blue, set the brush to Screen at about 60% opacity, and do the same thing over that. Lastly, grab a white-blue, set the brush to Color Dodge, about 30%, and go over it once more. Should give off a nice soft glow for the speedlines.<br><br>If you want it more pronounced or a harder light, make a selection around the frame, press Ctrl-J to set a duplication of it on it's own layer, then set the duped layer (the top one) to hard light. Nice and sharp.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen012.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Next up was the frame with Syn grinning (Frame #4), all I did was take a vertical version of the speedline brush. (Make it the same way, but stretch it up. Alternately, if you kept the other speedline document, you can rotate it around to get whatever angle you need.) I selected the area, took a dark gray, almost black, and just waved it around behind him. Easy enough, eh?)<br>(Note: I also did this to Frame #7)<br><br>Last up is the frame of Kai's arm. I was instructed to give this a dark magical glow. And so I shall.<br>Grab a sort of big soft-edged airbrush tool. Set it to normal, 90% opacity. Grab a dark green and a light green.<br>Starting with the dark green, brush around where you want the glow. Doesn't look like much, does it?<br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen013.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Now take the brighter green, a smaller brush, and go over the inside of the glow. Thats getting better.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen014.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Next up take white, set your brush to Color Dodge at about 60% and go over the very inside of the glow. Be CAREFUL, Color Dodge gets bright VERY quickly, especially at high opacity. You should have a nice bright inner glow that fades out. Or at least we're moving up the ladder.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen015.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Select the frame if you hadn't already and next are the touchups for the glow so it doesn't look so ragged. First up is Filter&gt;Blur&gt;Gaussian Blur, use a full 3 pixel blur and click ok. Follow up with a Filter&gt;Blur&gt;Radial Blur, use about a 25, and set it to zoom. Click OK. Hit Ctrl-F to repeat the filter.<br><br>Last up I want to add tendrils to the glow. Grab the smudge tool. (It's a finger.) Set the pressure to about 70-ish, soft-edge brush, and remember to vary pressure as you need to. Smudge it out like flame tendrils, from the very inside to get that hot part of the glow to show itself a little more. When your done, voila! Nice, clean, and um, glowy.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen016.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>(Note: The light cast on the arm is covered in the touchups step later on.)<br><br>As a nice added touch, keep your greens. Grab a radial gradient and go back to the layer with the ground. Set the gradient to screen at about 20% and drag out from the hand. (Or in, depends which green is in front). It will give a nice drop glow that makes the flame seem like its really there after all.)<br><br>Last but not least...<br><br>-==Step 6: Touchups==-<br><br>This is the simplest step of all. But it's an important one. Go around to all the line edges you have, (Yes, all of them) and with a hard eraser, cut away bleeding paint.<br><br>Also, you may want to add highlights to things like metal and in the case of this particular page of the comic, drop glows on Kai's arm and glove for the last panel. Grab a white soft-edge brush and just set it to screen at about 30%. And go over edges of things that could use an extra glow. For Kai's arm and glove I used green with the same settings.<br><br>Last of all its time to do word balloons and sound FX.<br>Text is pretty much dependant on what fonts you have available for use, they're all over the web for free so it shouldn't be hard to find decent ones. (Most of the ones I use come from Blambot.com)<br><br>All there is to sound effects is grabbing a suitable font, typing out say, &quot;THWACK!&quot;, with the type tool, and fiddling with size. Right click on the text layer and click 'Rasterize Layer'. After which you can hit Ctrl-T to get into Free Transform and rotate and move text as needed. Press enter to apply any tranforms. Just remember after you raster a layer, you can't edit the text there anymore with the type tool.<br><br>Also, if say you have black text, but its hard to read. Ctrl-click on the layer with the text, go to Edit&gt;Stroke, and pick a number depending on how much stroke you want (This will vary a lot, so fiddle with undos if need be.) and stroke with white. Reverse goes for white text, just use a black stroke.<br><br>(Side note: Should have mentioned, make sure all type is above even the layer with the panels.)<br><br>Actual text needs word balloons. First off type out the text. Use the type tool, most likely you'll want center alignment, and your font of choice. Fiddle around with the breaks in the text and whatnot until it looks good. Eventually you'll get a feel for it. After that, you'll want your default colors, black and white, and the Elliptical Marquee tool. Make a selection around the text. <br><br>Next grab the polygonal lasso, and holding shift, click where you want the point of the balloon tip (that will point to the speaking character) to be, next click inside the balloon, then move the tool a little to the side and double click to close the selection.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen017.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>Create a new blank layer under the words, and still with the selection, press Ctrl-Backspace to fill with white. (Assuming white is in back, if white is foreground it will Alt-Backspace). Now go to Edit&gt;Stroke, and put a 3 pixel border on the outside of the selection. Hit Ctrl-D to deselect, click the word layer, make sure the word balloon layer is directly beneath, and press Ctrl-E to merge the words down onto the balloon. This will leave you with a nice mobile text balloon.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen018.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>For panel 3, I used the type tool on left align, rasterized the layer, and did a 3 pixel white stroke. (Same as with the word balloon outlines, Edit&gt;Stroke)<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/screen019.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>The only other semi-tricky part is the &quot;Whirrrr&quot; sfx in the very last panel. Put every letter or two on their own layers, rasterize them all, and then use Free Transform (Ctrl-T) to rotate and move them all to form to the upward curve. The green outline is the same as any other stroke, just change the color of it. Everything else on the page is the simple word balloons we covered before.<br><br>Once your done with word balloons and FX, look over the page for what might need cleanups. And if there's none then breathe a sigh of relief, you're done!<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://chiyoko.homestead.com/files/p7_6.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>And here's a larger version (linked for size):<br>http://chiyoko.homestead.com/p7fin.jpg<br>Hope that's of use to someone out there!
