Depression is crap.</span><hr size=1> I am so not in a good mood right now.  I just had a fight with my mom...its not the first...this woman is psycho.<br><br>She supposedly suffers from...&quot;depression&quot;...a condition which apparently binds you to the chair of your bedroom for years at a time...and makes you watch tv 24 hours a day..GRRR!<br><br>She says that her dad did naughty stuff when she was little...even gave her brother some mental problems (blows to the head or something)...but that was back when she was little.  She needs to get over it already!  <br><br>She just sits...and stares...then one day (2 years ago)...she starts this whole thing about going out and getting a job which I thought would be good.  She worked night-shift...inventorying crap...so while she slept during the day..I was in charge of taking care of everyone...she keeps this job for about a year and a half...and now teaches...but still when ever she is home...sit and stare at tv.  Never doing any work herself...always demanding that the house be spotless (which is impossible since she never taught any of my siblings how to clean up after themselves...).  I still do all the cooking...  <br><br>She just got this new drug...her &quot;happy pills&quot;...she says that she is coming out of depression...I dont believe a word.  After the drug started taking effect...she was up and about...doing things on her own.  Now...(still taking drug)...she is back to her chair...and her t.v.  She complains that I act like the parent too much.  I try and explain to her that I have kind of had to take care of my brothers and sisters since she has been either gone/mentally unstable...She thinks I am wrong.  I think that she needs to do her job.  She is a parent...she chose to be a parent and to have kids.  Now...I obviously am paying the price!  It isnt my fault that there are hungry kids begging for food and all she wants to do is nothing.  Our house is bereft of discipline...and when I try and do something about all the whining..and fussing...she gets mad at me.  She accuses me disrespecting her.  <br><br>My siblings dont make things easier either.  The more I try and get them not to fight the more they do it.  They dont care about the messes they make...because they are not made to take responsibility for them.  This is why...I don't want to have kids...not until I am like 30 or something.  There are the good things...but you know..I have to take care of my brother's and sisters and that is a big pain.  I can't imagine doing it with an adult's often busy schedule.<br><br>Depression...is crap.  It's an excuse to be slothful.<br><br>*i am probably wrong. <p><center> I'll turn him into a flee....a harmless little flea.

Depression is c</span><hr size=1> I am in no way trying to &quot;disrespect&quot; her.  All I know is that she obviously lacks the modivation to take care of her kids.  I try and do something she jumps down my throat.  Her whole world would collapse if she didn't have a television.  I cannot stand to be around her anymore...she is so pessemistic!  Let's say I clean a part of the house (which I do often)...and she doesnt even notice.  I try and get the other kids to do something besides bust each other's heads open with shovel handles and she says at that point I am acting like the parent.  She says...&quot;I know..I am trying.  I know this has been very hard on you...but I am getting better.&quot;   <br><br>She does that to me!  Makes me feel like there is some hope in the world of her actually becoming normal so that I can be &quot;normal&quot; too (in other words...not cooking, cleaning, teaching my little brother's how to read, etc...)...she tells me these lies!  And they are lies!  She has been saying stuff like &quot;I am getting better&quot; for a long time now.

Depression is c</span><hr size=1> Umm, Wiggle...When someone is seriously clinically depressed, it is either the result or the cause of a chemical imbalance in brain chemistry. Those 'happy pills' aren't a cureall, and people with depression are, on some levels, not responsible for their actions. Pardon my comparison, but have you ever talked to someone with bad PMS? It is like they are on behaviour altering drugs. It is very similar with depression. I suppose it is difficult to explain...I know that when I was ill, I was conscious of my actions, but my perspective was GREATLY altered. I had a very warped sense of reality, perspective, the intentions of others. I honestly thought that everyone was against me, or laughing at me, or had some sort of hidden agenda. I can tell you that now that I am well I regret many of the things that I said and did, but that I can't feel too much remorse as I know that most of that just wasn't me.<br><br>I strongly suggest that you and your family show your mother the love and support that she needs, even if she doesn't seem willing to recieve it. Eventually, if she gets better, she will. She really should be in counselling of some kind, as medication is only an aid and doesn't address specific problems that may be troubling her. <p>Disclaimer: All opinions voiced by Lina may potentially be only so-much-B.S.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uearlofchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>earl of chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/29/01 12:48:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7829.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pyrodesign.xoasis.com/temp/pyro4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What is with this woman I call mother?!

Depression is c</span><hr size=1> Alright!!!  That just really pisses me off!!  I understand you are upset and dealing with someone with depression is hard but what you said about depression being an excuse to be slothful is insulting!! <br><br>First off - you need a real outlet.  Your mother has a problem that is not easy to deal with and makes her do stupid things that ... well depression makes you act stupid.  You need to speak to a school counselor or someone so that you have a way to learn how to better cope with your mothers problems.  It sucks what you have to do around the house ... been there and done that.  Find someone to talk to ... not just to vent ... but someone on a more professional level.  Start with a family doctor or school counselor.  Please ... I mean it.<br><br>I suffere from clinical depression and I can attest to hard it is to do some things.  I can feel it inside but sometimes I just can't bring myself to act.  Right now is really hard because my hormones are all out of whack and I can't control my depression as I would normally be able to.  I go to work and I just don't want to bother, I don't want to move.  Sometimes when I think about it, it makes me cry.  Why can't I just sit here and wait it out ... why do I have to do anything ... I don't want to do anything.  I sit online ALL the time ... it's the only way I can get through .... I can't explain how or why it's near impossible to do anything else.  I have to sit here ... I have to.  Yes, it's hard for Jessica and maybe the only difference between myself and your mother is that I have explained over and over (when in a mind to) exactly why I am the way I am and how hard it is to fight against this horrible thing that eats away inside me.  I can't help it ... I know the difference and I still can't help it.  I don't want to push myself ... I don't want to cry ... I don't want to think ... I want to sit here where it is safe.  I'm not lazy ... I'm scared and I'm hurt.<br><br>You say your mom explained about her childhood and that she needs to just get over it.  You think it's that easy do you?  You are wrong.  I still carry so much pain with me from my own childhood and I try to put it behind me ... and I have had many successes but it takes a lot of time and a lot of work and it brings so much more hurt to the surface.  I don't always understand why I feel the way I feel other than it's connected to my childhood, but unless I know specifically why it hurts or effects me I cannot really deal with it.

Even to us here.  Whatever helps you to deal.  If you could just get your younger siblings to help out.  You gotta stick together to wade this thing through.  And don't stick around...I mean, when you get to college level and all...don't stick around because of your mother.  Sometimes ya gotta be selfish.  Hopefully your siblings will be strong enough to be with your mother without you but...don't let her drag you down.  Somethin' like that...sometimes people have to fall flat on their faces before they realize what they are doing.  I'm talking from experience myself.  Your mother loves you I'm sure.  When the time comes, be strong enough to leave.  Maybe then she'll see.  I'm...a little on the manic depressant side...up and down, up and down...I think just about everyone has gone through some sort of depression.  So try to relate if you can.  Maybe you can be your mother's therapy.  You said she doesn't talk about it with you so you don't understand what she's going through.  Maybe you can try to talk to her about it.  Sit down civilly and just talk.  &quot;Mom, I know I won't truly understand what you're going through but...I want to know...what's it like?  How can I help?&quot;  <br><br>You'll be alright.  You made it this far, neh?  You're strong and you know it.<br><br> <p><FONT COLOR="6A5ACD"><center>Heaven has no rage, like love to hatred turned...nor Hell a fury, like a woman scorned. </FONT> <br><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/lotus_blossum/avatars/bars/4.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jynxdaddy>JynxDaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/30/01 4:46:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7829.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hi</span><hr size=1> oh, poor u wiggle, i havent really had many family problems, none that i can remember myself, only ones ive heard, i live wif my foster parents, they are nice and give up alot for me, my bro and my sis, i never really knew my mum, and have no idea who my dad is. since i dont really know much about what ur going thru i cant say much but i hope u and ur mum start feeling better. parents can have troubles, they are only human remember <p><dl>  <dt><small>"The artist is nothing without the gift, but the gift is nothing without    work.
