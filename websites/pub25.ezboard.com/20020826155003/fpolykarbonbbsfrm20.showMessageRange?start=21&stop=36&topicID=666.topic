He will fight relentlessly to protect a freind in need and once you finally befreinded him and earned his respect and trust you have someone you can count on for life in any situation. You'll probablly hear him grumbling and complaining about it the whole time but he'll be by your side til the end. He never forgets when he's been wronged or when he's been treated right. He likes to drink (allot for human standards) but his tough dwarven guts can take allot before he starts feeling the effects of it. He can't stand theives (sorry Ap hehe) cause he believes you should earn everything you get and stealing from someone who earned it justly is just plain worng. He can be very quick to anger and will fight to the death if he feels he has been dishonored.<br>
<br>
Did I mention he really hates water? And he cannot stand to be called &quot;little man&quot; as thats the quickest way to earn his Ire.<br>

  His name is Rinko and he is a cleric of Shardon.  He is young and out doing his missionary work to become a full member.  The shurch is very strict and as such he reflects it.  However he is young so sometimes he losses himself and shows his imaturity.<br>
  He has a natural HATE for the undead, and the hate is fueled by fear.  His spell book is actually larger then in the pic...about as big as his torso.  It is a magical book bonded to him by the church and it floats at his command.  Its his choice of way to carry it.<br>
  He is always a peace maker, and a tad nervous around ladies, he doesnt know what to do with them.  He always has a kind word or atleast an honest one.<br>
  He does have battle magic, but its naturally stuff like holy fire and things like that.  If you are not &quot;evil&quot; his magic cant harm you.  <br>
  Most of his spells deal in healing, shielding, and defensive stuff of that nature....and of course light. <p>On a long enough timeline,the survival rate for everyone drops to zero

Her name is Stretch, which is a nickname given to her cause she is soo tall. She doesnt look as tall as I wanted her to be in the picture, I was running out of room at the bottom but wanted to get the design in without having to redraw it n.n; Anyway, shes a duelist, a swashbuckling type. Lives for the fight, and finding the greater challenge so to speak. <br>
<br>
She but also knows some magic, a bit of offensive and defensive. I was going to make her a healer at first, but since someone took the spot, I went for this instead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
The kind of spells I had in mind for her were more of the aiding as well as some status effect spells. The aiding would include spells like Haste, magic armor, magic shields (protect), dispels. Basically spells that would help protect the party and make them stronger. The status effect spells are things that can cause poison, darkness, confusion. Things that can be used to hinder an enemies attack. <br>
<br>
Other than that, she's really good with a sword, usually rapiers since it fits more of the duelists style.<br>
<br>
She is a bit arrogant, and overconfident sometimes. This tends to get her into trouble a lot. And when challenged she cannot resist a fight, no matter how outclassed she might be.<br>

all i've done is just change his hair style and demeanor slightly. he can do both styles of hair, but goes for the badass hair in this pic.<br>
the little ball creature in this is something of his familiar and sidekick, a magical monster that he was supposed to have befriended in a FC before this one. like a pokemon, this creature can only say it's own name/species, and as far as anyone knows it's a &quot;Quooechi&quot; (ko-ee-chee). the lil bugger has a slight empathic link with him, bonding as mage and familiar do. Neydor can't sense what quooechi is thinking or feeling, but quooechi senses his feelings and aids him if he's in danger he can't handle. if the need arises, it can polymorph into some kind of simple object to aid him or anyone friendly to him.<br>
i have a good idea of how Neydor will react with the party assembled thus far, so i'd like all of us involved to start creating the interactions between each character some time... <p><b>"Without a <a href="http://www.liquid2k.com/optica">Vision</a>, the people will perish..."</b>

ok, some basic character traits on my guy. As a warrior-mage, he's a competitive and sometimes headstrong. Magi who've heard of him, know him as something of an intimidating 'mage-slayer,' and as such, Neydor will take his small reputation and use it. He has a strong distrust of other mages, and most magic-users in general. Since he excommunicated himself from society at large, he dislikes authority figures and their so-called 'standards' and 'morals,' afterall, he turned himself into a rebel. He's battled many demi-human and humanoid foes in his time, so he has a loathing for any kind of barbaric monsters. His greatest fear and hate are for sorcerers that are aligned with evil. His greatest foe was a powerful wizard, so he'll naturally make no hesitation in slaying a mage that seems to be of evil intentions. Liches more or less scare the crap out of him, but who wouldnt be scared, eh? <p><b>"Without a <a href="http://www.liquid2k.com/optica">Vision</a>, the people will perish..."</b>
