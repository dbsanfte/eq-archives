Anywho, that's why Eva00 goes berserk when you first see Rei in the show.<br>It's Akagi's mother rejecting Rei basically.<br>So for Eva01, Shinji's unit, yeah, it was his mother. I can't recall...but I think she was the first to test out Eva01? Or...something? But as a result, passed away, and I suppose her spirit was imprinted into Eva01.<br>Jeebus...I really can't remember a thing o_O<br>Sorry man.<br><br>And your third question...I dunno.<br>I guess it was to just trick the Angels into thinking that Adam still existed, and that the Human Instrumentality Project could go through (as that...organization wished for it to happen, as was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls). The Human Instrumentality Project was the next step in human evolution. The organization wanted that.<br>But Shinji's father didn't share the same view.<br>Remember how it was the organization who sent the last Angel directly to NERV?

You did - When Rei Merged with Lillith a big explosion destroyed all of Japan and some of Korea.  In the crater was Lillith's Egg or the Black Moon.  <br>note:  Nerv Central survived barely because they burnt out their nuclear shielding devices defending fromt eh explosion.  Though the scene is quick and you don't get see what the shield is or what is actually does to shield.<br><br>2.  Yes.  I don't really know how a spirit or something to that nature is imprinted onto an Eva it just is and is required for the Eva to function.<br><br>3.  Adam is Eva-01.  That is why when the 17th agnel attacked and charged for Eva-01 Eva-00 was ordered to intercept.  If the angel made contact the third impact would have started.  Gendo got Lillith from Kaji when he delivered it to him after Eva-02 was introduced in the series.  If you remember Kaji and Misato thought what was down there was Adam.  Gendo did this to confuse everyone (story wise) giving him more control of the situation.  What is weird is that Rei was able to merge with Lillith.  As I understood any two angels could merge... merge with the Angels held on earth by the humans I think.  But Rei was born from Lillith's blood so how could Lillith bond with Lillith?  Oh well little things over looked I guess.<br><br>4. The human instrumentality project is the complimentation project.  It's basically the Eva project (which is all of nerv) and useing them to set up for complimentation.<br><br>Seele is the organization and they are the business leaders of the world.  So that's where all the money and political power comes from for everybody to do this.  Basically no one knew where Adam was and as far as I could tell Lillith would still get the job done.  What I don't understand is how did Seele and Gendo's agenda differ?  Seele wanted man to be complimented or become whole... well doing this will reunite Gendo with Yui which is what he wants.  But, he killed Yui during the beginings of Nerv.  Did he not know what the human instrumentality project was back then and later on choose to go against Seele to get Yui back?  And if getting Yui back ment that complimentation had to happen why did he want to merge with Rei at the end?  Would that have made him &quot;god&quot; so that he could see Yui and no one else had to be complimented?<br><br>I don't know I really wish Gendo would have talked more in the series/movie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umaharett18.showPublicProfile?language=EN>maharett18</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/13/02 5:40:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1378.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   rei and gendo</span><hr size=1> it is know that gendo is quite close with rei and all the other rei round, hehehe.. during the series there were two posibilities or two realities. first the eva piloted by shinji was from adam. adam was turn into an embryo during the percursor to the third impact. second, rei could be a clone of  yui, but in the movie rei was already a child before yui died.... quiet confusing actually.<br><br>yui died from a fialed experiment when she piloted the firsft eva prototype. i can remember correctly but i think she just vanished inside the entry plug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kenshinsamurai>kenshinsamurai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/14/02 12:18:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1378.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Rei and Gendo Ikari</span><hr size=1> In one of the episodes of neon genesis evangelion, it is a flash back to where Yui is talking to Gendo about naming a baby Yui asked what he was going to call it he said &quot;if its a girl....rei if its a boy... shinji so my question is: is rei's body that was displayed as a clone a clone of gendo ikaris first child. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kenshinsamurai>kenshinsamurai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/14/02 12:20:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1378.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  eva</span><hr size=1> is evangelion unit one which contains the spirt of Yui Ikari a child of Adam or is it Adam itself ????????? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unaokochan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naoko Chan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hot Sexy B*tch <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/14/02 10:15:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1378.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://naokochan.xoasis.com/ayako02.gif width=60 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  N</span><hr size=1> 1.  It is shown in the End of Eva, but people were lead to believe that there will be a big explosion like the second impact.  But that was a different case back then.  The explosion was the result of Adam being reduced to an embryotic state.  If you look at the movie, there was NOT a big explosion when Rei and Lilith combined.  Only when Shinji combined with them.<br><br>2.  I'll just add that power is needed to restrain the eva unit.  To contain the monster within.  Not to power the unit itself.  I'll also add that Unit 01 aquired an S2 engine by eating Zeruel the 14th angel in episode 19.  By aquiring an S2 engine, it has unlimited power.<br><br>3.

I'll just say that all the angels wanted to go back and merge with Adam, from whom they were spawned.  Kaworu says that he is a spawn of Adam and has the desire to merge with Adam.

You can see third impact in the End of Evangelion<br>2.  While Unit 00 (Zerogoki) and Unit 02 (Nogoki) and the other EVA's were made by cloning Adam, Unit 01 (Shogoki) was actually made from Lilith, making it very special.  Eva's have souls in them to keep them stable.  Unit 01 has Yui in there, who disspeared during the first activation experiment.  That's why it protects Shinji.  Unit 02 has Asuka's mother, and Unit 00 has Dr. Agaki.  Dr Agaki commited suicide after killing Rei I. She jumped of the Magi housing.<br>3.  Remember when we see the flashback of how Nerv was formed?  Gendo explains to Fuyutsuki that the Geofront wasn't excavated, it was already formed.  This is called Lillith's egg.  Lillith, officially the second angel, is the mother of all mankind.  She was found there when Seele looked for it, after they read about her in the dead sea scrolls.  They used the Lance of Longinus to keep her under control, so that the same thing as with Adam wouldn't happen.<br><br>you have to see EVA multiple times to get it.

Nerv never got back the spear of longinus until episode 12.  When Gendo Fuyutsuki went to the South Pole.  And what was on the carrier that they were riding on?  A very long something that was covered up (it can be argued that they went there to retrieve the spear).  And then at the end of episode 14, you see Rei in Unit 00 going down the corridor with the spear of longinus.
