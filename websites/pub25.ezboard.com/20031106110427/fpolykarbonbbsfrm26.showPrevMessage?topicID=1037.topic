a world thriving in life. Ahura, the creator of Endura kept a watchfull eye over the world. She was happy with they way life was unfolding on her creation. Every now and then problems with the many different races that inhabited the world arose, but for the most part everything was they way it should have been. Life went on like this for centuries, and Ahura was happy. During the life span of Endura, technology began to thrive and take over. Computers, high tech weaponry, and modern science began taking over. Ahura did not like this but decided to let this go unanswered. But science didn’t end there; it grew and prospered. Faith in Ahura was replaced by faith in machines. <br>
<br>
The people of Endura stopped believing in Ahura and forgot about her. This angered Ahura and she began to let her rage lose on the world of Endura to restore the people’s faith in her. But this attempt at restoration was met by and increase in the belief that machines would take care of everything. Ahura stopped at nothing to try and regain the faith of those she created, but nothing came of her attempts. Finally Ahura fed up with Endurian’s lack of faith in her decided that she would strike down on Endura like nothing before. During the course of a hundred years Ahura created an army of Hu-Rahs. Hu-Rahs were creatures that she knew would strike fear in the hearts of every living being on Endura. She created these creatures to only obey one, and that one was her. Along with the Hu-Rahs she created a single crest that would control all Hu-Rahs created thereafter. This crest she wore with her at all times. <br>
<br>
With her newly raised army Ahura struck down on Endura with all of her rage. Little by little the massive armies of Ahura destroyed villages and towns of those who did not believe in Ahura any more. Those that still believed were welcomed into her army. Ahura’s army grew by the thousands as time passed. It seemed as if Ahura would gain back what she created; that which was taken from her so long ago.<br>
<br>
But the spirit of Endura would not falter so easily. Word traveled fast about this unbeatable army. The High Council of Endura gathered and devised a treaty between all living beings on Endura to come together into one force to meet head on with the army of Ahura. Humans, elves, dwarves, and all other races came to the town of Lyna the capital city of Ternion to amass the largest army ever created on Endura. Word of this amassing army spread quickly through the towns and villages of Endura. Word finally reached Ahura and she decided that her army would move onto the land of Ternion, the land of the Three Powers.<br>
<br>
One and a half years passed and after countless battles, the time for the final stand had come. The Army of Ahura had finally laid foot on the soil of Ternion. It is there on the plains of Omegus that the final battle for all of Endura would take place. The battle began on the morning of August 12th, the three thousand year anniversary of Endura. The battle raged on for two days. On the third day Ahura brought an end to the last of the Army of the Three Powers. There she stood alone, victorious. That which was taken from her was now hers once again. The remaining strength she used to end the remaining life on Endura. She wanted to start over and didn’t want any remembrance of the history of Endura planted into any being’s mind. But something like this is never truly forgotten. Though all life had been eradicated, books and journals remained.<br>

Her power was not as strong due to the fact that she had been at war, and that which she made perfect before, was now flawed.  With her last bit of strength Ahura gave birth to an elf child Ailill.  Into this child Ahura placed her knowledge and remaining strength.  And to this child she gave the Life Crest and the land of Ahura.  This crest would endow her child with life even in death.  During the course of this childs life the crest was stolen from her by a petty thief named Jared Highwind.  The child was filled with rage when she found out her crest given to her by her mother was stolen.  But time passed on and the rage died away.  On Ailill’s 21st birthday she met Sol Bardok.<br>
<br>
Sol a human and the king of the neighboring land of Solaris.  He was known for ruling his kingdom with an iron fist.  His army was undefeated and merciless on the battle field.  Ailill and Sol eventually wed each other bringing together to of the major forces in the world of Endura.  Now the land of Solaris belonged to Ailill herself and her King was willing to do whatever she commanded.  Ailill now having the power of Solaris under her wanted to take complete control over Endura.  She wanted all power like her mother.  So the forces of Ahura set out to take over Endura.  Once again the Three Powers rose up to face this threat to Endura.  During the final war Sol Bardok was slain.  This brought great misery upon Ailill and she went into a deep depression.  During the years of her depression the land of Ahura went from rolling green hills to dark gray rock.  One day while walking the halls of Lothor Durame, she remember the gift that was given to her by her mother.  The Life Crest could bring her husband back to her and give him eternal life.  She remembers the name of the thief who stole her gift.  The name Jared Highwind.  <br>
