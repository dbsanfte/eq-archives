Chrono Trigger IV?</span><hr size=1> Wooh! I just finished Chrono Cross... What a pain in the arse that game was. Even after completing the game, I don't fully understand the story, so can anyone clear it up?<br>
<br>
S<br>
P<br>
O<br>
I (If you haven't played CC)<br>
L<br>
E<br>
R<br>
<br>
I understand that Schala and Lavos became one entity after Schala was flung into the dimensional vortex and absorbed by Lavos.<br>
But why wouldn't Crono and the gang have come into contact with the evolved &quot;Time Devourer&quot; Lavos, instead of the original Lavos in Chrono Trigger? Schala was absorbed into Lavos RIGHT after Zeal was destroyed wasn't she? If so, then wouldn't the Lavos that destroyed the world in 1999 A.D. in Chrono Trigger, been the evolved &quot;Time Devourer&quot; Lavos that absorbed Schala, thus destroying Schala and Lavos, which would, in turn, completely obliterate any other threat? (FATE, Lynx, Time Devourer, Time Crash, Etc...)<br>
<br>
I personally think that they just slapped some bogus story together just to please the fans, becaue I notices WAY too many plot holes.<br>
<br>
Or can they just give excuses for the plot holes by using the two dimension concept.<br>
<br>
But since you fought the Time Devourer in &quot;Another world&quot; which was the world in which CT took place, and was the original world, that would COMPLETELY obliterate any chance of using the dimension concept to cover up the plot holes.<br>
<br>
If you would fight the Time Devourer in &quot;Home World,&quot; then, since it was a different dimesnion from CT, it would make sense that Crono wouldn't have fought him. <br>
But even THAT wouldnt matter, because the dimensional split took place AFTER the events of CT. Ten years after CT in fact, so it doesn't make any sense that the Lavos that Crono and company killed was the original Lavos and not the Time Devourer (so Home world and Another world have nothing to do with CT.)<br>
<br>
And another thing! Where is old man Melchior? I understand that he was old, but I'm sure he had at least 30 more years left in him (given i guessed his age at around 60, and since he was a guru, he should at least have lived to be a hundred or at least 90 years old.)<br>
<br>
What happened to Doreen? How did she, who existed in 12,000 B.C. in the kingdom of Zeal, travel ten thousand years into the future? Masa and Mune lived through ten thousand years because they were part of the sword Masamune, but Doreen wasn't part of the Masamune. How did she survive the fall of the Kingdom of Zeal, to end up joining with her brothers to become the Mastermune (a stupid name for the GrandLeon sword which was the Masamune in the Jap version. The Mastermune was called the GrandDream in the jap version of CC.) <p><p><center><i>Datenshi online manga</i>

Chrono Trigger IV?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, you use the chrono cross after entering i think the followine elements: yellow, red, green, blue, black, white, Chrono Cross.<br>
Well, maybe not that order, but I remember it starts with yellow and ends with chrono cross <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's easy to do because all you have to do is get everone's element level at 8, all of their stamina at 7, and wait for Lavos to attack, then you begin the color sequence and you'll finish it before that slow bastard has a chance to attack again.<br>
<br>
I did that, freed schala and then lavos just broke into pieces and vanished (like all bosses do for some reason.)<br>
The true ending completely sucks, and the game is a total mind blower.<br>
I remember Schala/Kid become united into one complete person, and all of everyone's memories are erased. Supposedly, because Serge asks Leena about Terra tower, and the frozen flame. Leena doesn't know what he was talking about and tells him to get up and make her that komodo scale necklace, or something.<br>
After that it just goes to the credits... <p><p><center><i>Datenshi online manga</i>

<br>
The art was directed by Akira toriyama (sadly) where Crono looks just like a red headed Goku, Magus lookes like Vegita with purple, long, slicked down hair, and Lucca looks JUST like Buruma with prurple friggin hair (That's why I hate Akira Toryiama's style of art, they all look the same.) <p><p><center><i>Datenshi online manga</i>

On another note, I like Toriyama-san's style, even though it does look the same. The faces look so well. And he did, after all, do the artwork for CT The Original, ya know. So, I was happy to know he did the sequences. And I think Magus looks wicked tight on the remake. And Crono does look like Son Gokuu with red hair, but hey.. The Japanese DBZ is tight.. The fansubs.

What I would like to see is for them to return to 2d graphics, but not at all like CT. What I would like to see would be like what capcom did with Breath of Fire 3 and 4, and what Square did with FFT. That is tall, 2d character sprites with well designed polygonal 3d backgrounds. I guess I can only hope, because the probability of them doing it all in 3d is 100%. They focus too much on looks nowadays, and frankly, I don't think 3d is attractive at all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukagebu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kagebu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/12/02 7:19:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thearbiteroftime>The Arbiter Of Time</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/12/02 3:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=376.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ....</span><hr size=1> Hahhahahah.

Heheh, apparently, you haven't been on this board for long enough. For some reason, DBZ and Akira Toriyama are very volatile subjects, and usually anyone who says that they think his artwork sucks, or that DBZ sucks, they go into a flaming rage that usually ends up in the thread being locked.<br>
<br>
I guess you can call me old fashion, but I think that 3-D is far too messy for me. All those shapes and colors just don't blend well, that is the ones made by Squaresoft. I fel in love with Skies of Arcadia, and their battle system, along with their 3-D battle system and environment. But I don't think that Square does a good job with 3-D as well as Gamespot does. <p><p><center><i>Datenshi online manga</i>

I never experienced his art outside Chrono Trigger, so I like some of his illustrations still. They were a nice break from the almost fine arts style of FF3 (which I really like now) and the typical saucer eyes of imported pop anime at the time.<br>
It was funny because every time Nintendo Power magazine came out with a new RPG, I'd pretty much copy every and any character illustration into my sketchbook. They're still hanging on my wall for some reason...<br>

Of course you have! You ever read the dragonball series? that's his work. <br>
Frankly I think that whatever he draws, it all looks the same. (which is why I hate it.) He also gives everyone HUGE muscles. Did you see Crono? He had way too much of a large build. I just think his art is boring. <p><p><center><i>Datenshi online manga</i>
