<br>
 &quot;How does it feel? How does it feel to see the horror breakout in your backyard instead of in the neighbors’ living room? How does the fear feel when it squeezes your chest, the panic that provokes the deafening sound, the flames out of control, the buildings that fall, that terrible smell the gets into the bottom of your lungs, the eyes of the innocents that walk covered in blood and dust?<br>
How do you live in your own house the uncertainty of what is to come? How do you get out of the state of shock? In a state of shock once walked on the 6th of August in 1945 the survivors of Hiroshima. Nothing was left standing in the city after the American pilot of the Enola Gay dropped the bomb. In few seconds 80.000 men women and children died. Another 250.000 would die years after because of radiation. But that was a far off war and television didn’t even exist.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How does horror feel today when the terrible images of television tell you that what occurred the 11th of September didn’t happen in a far off land but in your own country? Another September 11th, but 28 years before, died a president named Salvador Allende resisting destitution of his presidency that your government planed for. Those were also times of horror, but that happened very far away from your borders, just another unknown South American issue. These “issues” were at your backyard and you never worried much about it when your marines would go out with blood and fire to impose there points of view.   <br>
Did you know that from 1824 to 1994 your country made 73 invasions towards Latin America? The victims were Puerto Rico, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Haiti, Colombia, Cuba, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Virgin Islands, El Salvador, Guatemala and Granada.<br>
Your governments have been at war for almost a century. From the beginning of the XX century, there almost hasn’t been a war of which the people of your Pentagon haven’t participated. Of course, the bombs exploded out of your territory, with the exception of Pearl Harbor, when the Japanese aviation the 7th fleet in 1941. But the horror was always far away. <br>
When the Twin Towers came down in the middle of the dust, when you saw the images on television or heard the screams because that morning you were in Manhattan, did you think for a second what the country men from Vietnam felt for so many years? In Manhattan, the people would fall from the heights of the skyscrapers like tragic dolls. In Vietnam, the people would shriek because the napalm kept burning their flesh for so long and death was terrible, so much as those that would fall in a desperate jump into the abyss.<br>
Your aviation didn’t leave not one factory or bridge standing without destroying it in Yugoslavia. In Irak 500.000 were killed. Operation Desert Storm took half a million souls…How many people bled to death in exotic places like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Angola, Somalia, Congo, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Camboya, Yugoslavia, Sudan, and a many more? In all these places the projectiles were made in your country, and were aimed by your boys, by people paid by your Department of State, and only so you could keep on enjoying the American way of living. <br>
Ever since a century your country has been at war with the rest of the world . Curiously, your presidents launch Apocalypse’s horsemen in the name of liberty and democracy. But you must know that for many countries in the world (in this world where everyday 24.000 habitants of this earth die of hunger or incurable diseases), U.S.A. does not represent liberty, but a foreign and terrible enemy that only brings with it war, hunger, fear, and destruction. You have always had far away conflicts for you, but for whom live over there it’s a very close and painful reality, a war were buildings fall under bombings and these people encounter a horrible death. And the victims have been 90 percent civilians, women, seniors and children.  <br>
How does it feel when the horror knocks at your door even if it’s just for a day? What’s to think when the victims of New York were secretaries, stock broker or maintenance employees that punctually paid their taxes and never hurt a fly?<br>
How does it feel to be afraid? How does it feel, yankee, to know that the long war finally on September 11th arrived at your home?&quot;<br>

Inevitable. Any world power has and will always have those who hate it for both good and some petty reasons. I'm sure Britain was real popular when it was a super power, or Rome, or Greece, or Egypt. Would the Aztecs have loved to hurt the Spainish when they crushed their civilization? I bet they would, as would an people who has been stepped on. One day America will be just a shadow of itself and another country will be either very powerful or maybe even a world power. And they'll have their own barbarians at the gate, whose reasons may be right or wrong, to deal with. <br>

Pointing the finger at us for attacks on central America and Asia makes about as much sense as condemning us for racist policies before the civil rights movement.  This is just the kind of angsty, emotional writing that makes things progress slower because it gets people all worked up about things they have very little knowlege of.  The same views could easilly be expressed without getting on a soap box and pissing people off.  This is only slightly less annoying than Bush's adding the word &quot;evil&quot; to everything.  People in other countries seem to believe that all Americans are gun-toting, war-mongering, oppressive idiots who believe their country has never done and can do no evil.  That couldn't be farther from the truth.  In public school in History classes we are taught the history of American imperialism and why our country was wrong for doing the things that we did in Central America, the Philippines, and Asia.  Contrary to popular belief, we are taught that America did NOT win the Vietnam War and that our country was at fault for a lot of wrong doing throughout the Cold War and that we do not have to agree with what the government does.  We can freely opose our own government's decisions if we want too, which is a lot more than you can say about a lot of countries.    <br>
<br>
Sorry for flying off the handle there, but I'm just really frustrated with all this hostility towards Americans lately -_-;;  I'm not a patriotic flag-waving kinda person or anything.  I just think this kind of generalization of &quot;Yankees&quot; is not fair. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://emeraldwinter.com">Emerald Winter</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> :   art, free dowloads, forum.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koji150>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/21/03 12:55:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12053.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Article on 911, terrorism</span><hr size=1> More anti-American garbage.

<br>
 kijo150: run by violent drug cartels? goes to show you don't know much about south american drug cartels my man. can you spell CIA? or better yet did you know that these drug cartels are sponsered by certain banks with diplomatic inmunity? where do you think that the columbian guerrilla gets their helicopters, bazookas, short range missiles, up-to-date artillerry and armed forces that are superior to the armed forces of the very columbian goverment. no, not e-bay my friend but you're close though. let me let you in a a little secret:capitalist countries depend on these cartels. and another thing the reasons the u.s. invaded south american borders wasn't because of drug cartels and the stupid &quot;war on drugs&quot;. think about the canal of panama, and think about how important it is for the u.s. to have certain control over the political affairs of it's neighbors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dropping the bomb ended WWII, athough I dispute the usage of it, it still ended it.&quot;<br>
<br>
of course you dispute it, if it ends a war why not right? then why throw another one in nagazaki? it was as if it weren't enough to drop one on hiroshima, filled with civilians, then why not try out the other one which was a neutron bomb, of course not as strong as the first one but hell if you dropped the first one lets take a go at it with the second just for the fun of it right? <br>
<br>
&quot;More anti-American garbage.&quot;<br>
<br>
it's not anti-american, it's more anti-imperial, Garcia Marquez has had many american friends ant i doubt he considers them &quot;evil&quot;, remember that he condemns the previous presidents of the U.S. for the human crimes of their wars not the poeple of the U.S., although in a way in his article he repeats the frase &quot;did you know&quot; alot, so he also claims that theirs a certain ingnorance of alot of americans towards the faults of the U.S. during history. as for being garbage, there's alot of truth in it so you seem to have a very strange consideration for what is garbage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=originalronin>OriginalRonin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/21/03 10:07:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12053.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Article on 911, terrorism</span><hr size=1> Frankly, the poplation of america is powerless in almost any descision regarding war or high government.

American culture is definitely backwards of how things should be, only americans and most europeans can't see this. It's anti-religion, anti-moral, anti-peace, anti-love. And we can''t see it, it looks so good, and we convert others to it with it shiny exterior, inside it is a rotting carcass.<br>
<br>
Our government has been screwing with everyone from the day after we dropped the second Atom bomb and became a super power. During the cold war we manipulated many many countries, just as the U.S.S.R did. Only there is no U.S.S.R. anymore. <br>
<br>
Only about 700 people have any real power with these things, the senate, the house, and the president plus staff. American people should be fighting a war against their government. True patriots challenge what their government thinks and does. How can the few amount of people in government represent the millions of American citizens.<br>

very intersting thing you said there, you put into trial the democracy of your country, or better yet democracy as a system. you question it don't you? very interesting.<br>

&quot;Honestly, I am ashamed to be called an American.&quot;<br>

american marines have ravaged the shores of my country and killed many dominicans but that should never mean i should disrespect the patriotism of any american at all. your country has given the world incredible men and women.

<br>
Yes we know what the government does, no not all americans like what they do, yes there are lots of americans who think 9/11 was nothing compared to other tragedies. Want to know what Bush said about all the anti war protests here concerning Iraq? &quot;We respect their opinions. But they have theirs and we have ours.&quot; Im willing to bet in other countries like your own that you never hear about anti war protests going on in America, so it creates this ignorance like in that article that all Americans agree with the government. Just this week in my small city there was an anti war protest and they actually had to use tear gas because of how large it was and how the people wouldnt just back down and leave.<br>

the typical domincan has cable, CNN in english and spanish. i think that they know pretty much what's going on in the world, not to mention that we have the most advanced national comunications system in the caribbean. we know about things even most americans don't know, we get european channels as well so we know what the germans and french think about all this mess. finally, we are protesting as well my friend. <br>

he uses second person verbs, reffering to the american citizens, but when did Garcia Marquez blaim the people of the u.s. for the atrosities their goverments made? please quote a part of the article that does so.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koji150>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/21/03 4:01:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12053.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Article on 911, terrorism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Only about 700 people have any real power with these things, the senate, the house, and the president plus staff.

you're distorting it way too much. that's a bad interpretation my friend. you probably took it a wrong way. don't put words in his mouth. trust me, if he wanted to say that he would've done so, he's a very blunt and honest man.<br>

yes, they was one in puerto rico last, 2 groups of protestors one in favor on one side of the street and another against on the other side of the street, my mom who lives in the Dom. Rep. (i live in Puerto Rico) told me she saw a few groups in mexico on tv in favor of the war. like i told you, we're informed well.<br>

I think some people like Gabriel Garcia Marquez prove that they can't see past the &quot;bad&quot; that a country does and only sees that. He mentions the bombs on Japan but doesn't mention anything about what would've happened if we hadn't stopped the war that way. More loss of life on both sides, Russians willing and ready to invade Japan on their own. I'm sure Japan would be happy to be under American control and not Russian control. Hell, doesn't Russia still have a few Japanese islands and are not willing to give them back for what they did?<br>
He mentions the other &quot;invasions&quot; that we did but doesn't state anything on who/when/or why we were there. Gabe just makes it sound like we had nothing better to do that weekend so we had to go pick on the little guy. Whenever there is an &quot;invasion&quot; there is  a reason behind it.<br>
When I read his little letter here, I don't think &quot;Yeah, Gabe is right. Gabe knows what he's talking about.&quot; I instead think, &quot;Gabe just needs a big hug because he's just jealous of America&quot;.<br>
Here's what made me fall out of my chair laughing:<br>

Well, obviously Gabe doesn't know squat about all the world aid we provide. We don't have to feed all the poor starving people in Africa... but we do. We don't have to help the Haitians with their AIDS epidemic... but we do. Just think of all the medical supplies, food, technology and all that we provide to other countries... just because we do. I wonder what kind of aid Gabe has provided to the world other than another &quot;rag on America&quot; that was made just to stir up trouble. <br>
Whenever I hear this kind of talk, I think we should just pull out of these countries and not give them anymore aid, food, supplies, help when a disaster occurs. You know who they are going to call on first when they need help... yep, America.<br>
