<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well this is most unfourtanate, were stuck on this God Forsaken Island with a wrecked ship and only a few gold pieces.  To top it off we arent even near the fleet.&quot;  Ivar muttered while stringing his bow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well Ivar, if you had not have beached the long boat into a rock then we would have a crew and could have cast off again after the storm.  Bastard what were you thinking.&quot; Hrolf sneered.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, My fault was it I'd like to see you steer a long boat with 40 oars!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah, It was your fault and if ya'd like to argue then comeon&quot; Hrolf remarked casually while drawing his sword. &quot;Lets see ya wimp bow take 15 spans of hard steel!&quot; Hrolf yelled brandishing his sword.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tha's it, Im going to give you a womping that Thor himself couldn' take&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I would like to see you try.&quot; Hrolf said, as he sidestepped to Ivar's side. &quot;How about this like it?&quot; At that moment Hrolf hit Ivar's head with the but of his sword.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;BY ODIN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!&quot; Ivar cried.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You said you were going to womp me so I smacked you, can't take it I see. Well we better be off to meet with the main force, Lets go.&quot; Hrolf chuckled.  &quot;There, look a town, lets go buy ourselves some food and armor.&quot;  Hrolf and Ivar began walking towards the smoke, oblivious to the fact that they had blond hair and blue eyes and looked nothing like the local Britains, not only that but they could barely speak the language of the britains.  They reached the town gates, which were around 3 times taller than a man and made of wood, as was the rest of the town.  It seemed to have been hastily built to withstand Viking attacks.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, might as well get some ale while were here eh.&quot; Ivar remarked his large stomach growling with hunger. &quot;And some food!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That's what you get for being a fat fool Ivar.&quot; Hrolf sneered. Hrolf was thin and muscular and a greater warrior than Ivar, but Ivar had a skill with the bow that was unsurpassed by few.  The two entered a small pub, roughly the size of a longboat cabin, filled with britains a little less than sober.  At that time an idea formulated in Ivar's mind.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, Britain give---&quot;Hrolf began in saxon  as he was elbowed in the stomach by Ivar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Excuse me, Barkeep, we are Christians from the north and would like any alcohol you have, it is hmm whats the word, ahh necessary&quot; Ivar said to the britain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, I usually dont serve your type but if you can pay large amounts of gold or any other valuable resource, I can reconsider.&quot; The Barkeep remarked.  Ivar, the far brighter of the two nudged Hrolf out the door, who was still dumbfounded by what had happened.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We will be back, I must check our umm beasts for supplies&quot; Ivar proclaimed in shaky saxon.  As they walked out of the pub Hrolf began to speak but Ivar hit cuffed him.  He was looking for something to bartar with, and then he saw it, in the back of the pub was a pile of logs.  He picked up a few and Hrolf did also.  They carried them back into the pub.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sir, I will trade you this lumber, dry and ready to be used for 2 kegs of hard liqour.  This would have been a great deal for the barkeep, if it hadnt been his lumber, so the barkeep agreed, and sold them the kegs, Ivar and Hrolf each took one and walked outside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So what new plan have you got Ivar the Brainless?&quot;Hrolf sneered his thin lips in a frown.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come over here put some logs on your keg, and hide them in these bushes, were going to burn this town to Loki's Realm!&quot;Ivar exclaimed.Ivar poured some liqour on logs next to the pub and then walked down a small alley inbetween the pub and a small house.  The dry wood of the buildings were perfect for Ivar's plan.  He countinued to put alcho covered logs next to all the houses in the small outpost and by the wall, being carefull to have them all touch to make a chain of higly flammable fuel.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hrolf, go into that common room and take a torch, and do it quickly.&quot; <br>
Hrolf muttered as he entered the common room, but emerged with a torch in hand.  Ivar snatched the torch and then exclaimed &quot;Hrolf go outside the gate NOW!&quot; Ivar yelled as he tossed the tourch at the beggining of the chain of logs.  They both ran outside as the fire lighted.  It grew faster than the speed of Thor's hammer in battle.  The town was soon consumed in flame and the two could hear the screams of the inhabitants.  It sounded like the wails of banshees in hell.  The fire consumed the wooden town such as a bear would consume a fish, the walls of the pub and common house fell and people dissapered into ash.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ivar chuckled, realizing he had figured out a way to kill many saxons and later he and Hrolf could pillage the town.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubloodiedspykes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bloodied spykes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/15/02 9:05:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=775.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: viking Story beginning, please CnC</span><hr size=1> Somehow the words of this story dont give the action justice.  Add in Some descriptions, as in what did there clothing look like? what condition were there weopons in? Imagery is what makes the reader stop thinking &quot;These are just letters.&quot; and really get into the story.  Another suggestion would be to put some emotion into the fire scene like &quot;The ghastly screams of the burning villagers had no effect on the vikings steel hearts.&quot; or at least make it VERY apparent that many lives were ended by the vikings to add some emotionel depth.  I know you did add something similar but the wording could be improved, although akward sentences do add an interesting flare to a story i dont think you should have used one here since the action should smoothly flow in this particular section.  As to how the vikings are speaking to one another it doesnt seem to natural.  Think of how a viking would talk ide change  &quot;Well, might as well get some ale while were here eh.&quot;  to something like &quot;The two vikings exausted and frustrated walked towards a small pub with the joint thought of some nerve soothing ale.&quot; all vikings like ale right? and they wouldnt be asking somebody to get some they would tell you or just do it, of course thats just my opinion on viking dielect and attitude. This peice has potential and I think with some revising and thought it will be a great begining.  Post up more of it when you get time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugekido1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gekido1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/16/02 8:41:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=775.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> thanks</span><hr size=1> thanks, I wanst to sure about viking dialect but ill try to fix it a bit and write some more when possible, which should be soon<br>
