Where, exactly are you drawing the line between what is and isn't a problem?<br>
<br>
The way I see it, and I think anyone would find it difficult to argue otherwise, is that this is yet another form of abuse - the sort of thing the western world is so keen on these days. All he's done is picked a form that won't get him into serious trouble, but that doesn't mean that this is any different to a sexist or even racial attack.<br>
<br>
And please don't tell me to not take it seriously, or that I should just ignore it. Maybe if less leople ignored the unfair @#%$ that was going on around them the world wouldn't be in such a state of hatred all the time.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a complete tree-hugging hippy. I have no problem with people laying into each other in a fair fight...that's their business. I do have a problem with attacking people who are not in a position to defend themselves, or simply putting people down for your own gain.<br>
<br>
The reason this guy does it is to get the admiration of those that think it's clever. There is no difference whatsoever between this and bullying. You guys are the same as the guys that hung around with the school bully to try and make up for your own inadequacies. Don't do it.<br>
<br>
Say someone did this to you. Not just one person slating your achievements, but a whole group of his folowers talking about how right he is about your crap work. Would you enjoy that? People pretend that they could, that they're 'hard' enough to take it, but they just happen to be good liers. Ever heard the phrase 'do unto others...'? Well kids happen to be particularly succeptable to abuse. It harms them for the rest of their lives, they simply don't have the defences you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>claim</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have. They need someone to stick up for them, and not just their parents but society in general (some parents aren't worth @#%$ to be honest and are the main problem, probably put down a lot when they were kids...). Where the hell else are they supposed to learn how to behave?<br>
<br>
Maybe you'll understand one day when you grow-up yourself.<br>
<br>
At least I hope you will. <p><br>

<br>
Actually, I find it very easy to argue otherwise, because it's one of the most rediculous statements I've ever heard in my life. People make stupid humor pages all the time, and to assume that they are sexist or racist because they make jokes like that makes you just as ignorant as you claim they are.<br>
<br>
What sort of humor in this world doesn't involve making fun of some group that isn't in a position to retaliate? I doubt that this guy is walking up to little kids and telling them their art stinks. If he is, then you ARE right, he is a jackass, but otherwise, he's just some guy doing what half the internet does, which is trying to amuse himself or his friends, even if it's not in a funny way.  <br>
<br>
Either that, or he's doing it to intentionally piss off people who take themselves too seriously, which obviously works considering your reaction.  The REAL problem in society is that too many people have sticks up their asses and not much common sense to spot jokes or sarcasm when they see it.<br>
<br>
If your 2 year old kid is reading his website and getting offended, I would have more questions about why you aren't monitoring the sites he sees than about the content. Actually, I would have more questions about how the hell a 2 year old is smart enough to use the computer and find the site in the first place, but that's another issue altogether.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, then fine, don't read it or let your kid read it. But seriously, don't make such broad generalizations about society just because of a few dumb humor pages. Quit being so absurdly overdramatic. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteneon>DynamiteNeon</A> at: 12/4/02 2:36:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monkeydispenser@polykarbonbbs>monkey dispenser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>

Quite a lot actually. Most humour of that type tends to involve people poking fun at themselves, rather than someone that never asked for it. Also, most forms of humour aren't outright offensive - not mainstream ones anyway. You only have to look at popular comedy shows for evidence of that. And he's not attacking a group, that at least gives some insulation, he's attacking individuals.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Either that, or he's doing it to intentionally piss off people who take themselves too seriously, which obviously works considering your reaction.

Well I must admit that I've never been accused of taking myself too seriously. If you mean I get passionate about things I believe in, then yes, I'm guilty of that one. If you mean I don't just let things slide by without saying anything, then yes, guilty of that one too. You could just say I'm my own worst enemy.<br>
<br>
On the other point you raise I think I can throw the 'one of the most rediculous statements I've ever heard in my life' right back at ya. You think that's the reason for societies problems? So all the road rage and the stealing and the shooting is down to people being a bit too 'stuck-up'? While I was in the USA a guy was busy going around sniping people. When they coaght him I didn't hear any reports of a stick up his ass - just a lot of hatred. Teach people to hate and reap the rewards!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    It's that oh-so-negative, hate-inspired, me-first culture I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
And you're accusing an Englishman of not being able to recognise sarcasm? That's even more rediculous...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you don't like it, then fine, don't read it or let your kid read it.

This doesn't really have anything to do with my kid, I was just trying to make the point that children are innocents who don't have the thick skin some of us claim to, someone has to protect them. And yes, there's no way I'd let him use the internet without supervision, but that doesn't mean he won't find a way.<br>
<br>
And you're telling me not to do exactly what you're defending about this guy! That's rediculous. He can offend me (and I'm not saying I am particularly offended, I just don't find it fair or right) but I shouldn't make an attack back at him? Why not? Free speech anyone? Hey, if you don't like what I write then don't read it (you see, it isn't that easy to do that!).<br>
<br>
Before anyone goes on about being over-dramatic just about one site, I think this discussion has taken in a wider issue now. Have you noticed how most game-shows, real-life tv, etc, these days is so negative? 'You're the worst in this group so you're out' is the way it's done now. We no longer judge people by their merits, more by their failings - and I just find that very sad. <p><br>

<br>
You've projecting your frustrations with society onto this not so funny webpage and I think you could have chosen better if you really wanted to rant about the downfall of society.  My main point is that if you want to complain about society, fine, but I don't see how it applies to this particular website.<br>
<br>
I don't think the site's all that funny, but I have more respect for people who provoke others and make them think than those who just make dumb jokes.  If you read some of his other articles, it's pretty clear he's just trying to push buttons.  You may assume that he's doing it because he actually has negative feelings toward these people, but I still think he's doing it to poke fun at the people who take themselves too seriously and get offended by his articles which is apparent considering he likes to post the hate mail and make fun of that.<br>
<br>
I also think you and I have a different definition of what that means.  It's not just as simple as saying they're &quot;stuck up.&quot;  I'm not only referring to people that think they're better than everyone else, but also people that can't laugh at themselves.  And yes, I still think that it's just as much of a problem as the ones you listed because what kind of thinking do you think causes those problems?<br>

If you don't like his site, then just don't look at it, if you have a kid who draws like that, then just don't show him the site, I doubt your child knows how to read yet so I don't think it would be a problem. What is this crap about your &quot;Western Society these days&quot;. Don't you dare quote what I am about to say right now or flame me for saying it, but being rude in the media etc. is what sells these days. So if you don't like it, switch off your tv and computer and anything else that can be rude so you don't hurt you, your son and his 'scribbles'. This guy that you hate right now, is just having fun, he is old enough to hate himself and people and children, he just wants to joke about because he wants to.<br>
<br>
But I should stop now because if you would like to keep arguing about how you are overreacting then that is fine cause thats your opinion.<br>

<br>
I also think that if people were that negative about your own artwork (which some artists here deserve to get negative feedback but we're just to @#%$ nice) you would feel bad or be like &quot;He doesn't know what he's talking about&quot; and so on... How do you think the parents of those kids who drew those pictures feel towards that guy. Sure the pictures suck but they're art skills have not developed since they are just children so I don't see what makes that so funny and this is a form of bullying.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showMessageRange?topicID=11305.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=11305.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=11305.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11305.topic&index=31><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=11305.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=11305.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11305.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11305.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm38">Christmas Contest 2002</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19>Member's Lounge</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
