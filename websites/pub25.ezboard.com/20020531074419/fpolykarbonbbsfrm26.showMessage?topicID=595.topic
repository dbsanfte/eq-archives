The light streamed lazily through the tall arched windows, making golden puddles on the subdued blue of the smooth slate. Renildus had been standing at the window as though gazing out into the garden, and yet when he had turned around there was a solemnity to his posture that indicated that he had been contemplating some more troubling middle distance. Thomar realized, belatedly that Renildus had spoken to him and he looked up in confusion. “I did not ask you here to discipline you,” the Abbai said gently. “You may get up.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar felt his face flush and he quickly pressed his forehead back against the smooth stone floor. “But Abbai, I have sinned.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How have you sinned?” He asked in surprise. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I struck Brother Jacobii.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah, yes.” There was a moment of silence. “Why did you strike him?”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I was upset.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Did you mean to injure him?” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar hesitated. “I do not know, Abbai.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then perhaps as your penance you should pray for Brother Jacobii’s swift recovery.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, Abbai.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now get up off the floor and take a seat,” Renildus said firmly. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar picked himself up off the floor slowly and sat down in the chair nervously. The Abbai stood watching him for a moment, his lips pursed thoughtfully and then he turned to gaze out the window. “Tell me about last night.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar swallowed hard. “I had a vision, Abbai.” He paused. “The Lady came to me in my dream.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Renildus frowned. “Brother Aelred said that you woke in the night with a cry of anguish and fled into the chapel.” Thomar nodded. “When the Prioron and the other brothers followed they found you weeping before the shrine to Mai’irha.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, Abbai.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “They thought you to be in some sort of waking dream and attempted to lead you back to your cot, but you struggled with them so violently that they were forced to leave you there.” <br>Thomar bowed his head. “Yes, Abbai.”  He twisted his fingers tightly through the prayer cord that hung from his waist. “Mai’irha told me that I must leave here.” <br>“You are to go to another lamasery?” <br>“No! I must leave Thaleanderalin and the silver groves.” <br>“Why?” Renildus asked in astonishment.<br>“I do not know.” He sucked his breath in through clenched teeth and let it out again slowly. “I begged The Lady to tell me what I had done to merit this discipline but she was silent.” He looked up at the Abbai in distress. “I do not wish to leave here, to leave my land. But I have taken an oath of obedience that I cannot break.”<br>Renildus sat down slowly, folding his hands carefully in his lap. “I can offer you no advice on this matter, Brother Thomar.” <br>He looked up and it felt as though he was gazing at the Abbai from a great distance. “With your permission, Abbai Renildus, I will go make preparations to leave in the morning.”<br>Renildus nodded slowly. “Yes, of course.” Thomar stood and moved to the door. “You are certain that it was The Lady who spoke to you?” Renildus asked.<br>Thomar paused. Perhaps if he said no… “I am certain, Abbai.” There was a weight in his chest and he swallowed hard. “I am unable to discern the purpose in this, but I know that I must leave.”<br>The Abbai sighed. “Very well, then. I will notify Prioron Umalin that you are to be provided with whatever you may need for your journey.”<br>“Thank you, Abbai.” <br>“You may go to your cell to begin packing. I will send Umalin to you shortly.”<br>Thomar stepped out into the hallway and pulled the dark wooden door carefully shut behind him. He had no wish to speak with anyone and kept his head bowed and his hands clasped behind his back as he walked somewhat hurriedly back to his quarters. The others seemed to respect his desire for silence, even if they did not know it’s cause and made no attempt to speak with him. <br>He wished only to take shelter in the privacy of his room and yet it seemed that every detail caught his eye, reminding him of the great beauty that he would be leaving behind. The sweet smell of sun-warmed grass mingled gently with the scents of a dozen other flowers as he crossed the gardens between the library and the brothers quarters. It was late spring and color covered everything; the carefully tended climbing vines sending streamers of white Moon-blossom and crimson Lovers-heart spiraling amoung the silver branches of the haalendaer trees. Drifts of Creeping Mary washed up against the smooth moss paths, pale violet against the lively green. <br>Thomar walked quickly up the broad steps to the dormitory and down the wide corridor towards his cell. Even inside, the architecture mimicked the spreading trees of the forest, with tall thin columns that ran up to form interwoven arches overhead, thick rugs of rich green covered the brown, stone floors. He entered his cell and closed the door swiftly behind him. Though small the room had a sense of space to it with a high ceiling and tall narrow windows that flooded the room with golden light. Thomar had spent countless hours here, in study and in prayer but today the room held no comfort and he sank down on the bed and wept.   <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Early morning fog hung in the trees and the rising sun painted everything in gentle shades of rose and gold. Thomar stood at the entrance to the lamasery and looked at the road beyond in silence. Behind him the rest of the brothers and the Abbai stood watching. They had all come to say farewell but he almost wished they had not. Something in his heart said it would have been easier for him to slip off alone, that the pain would have been less. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We shall pray for your safe travel and quick return,” Renildus said quietly. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomas turned and knelt in the dew-damp grass. “Give me your blessing and then I shall leave; I pray, only to return before many years have passed.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Abbai placed his hands gently on Thomar’s bowed head and softly he sang the words of blessing.<br>“May the road lie safe and straight before you, <br>May you always have a light to guide your feet, <br>May your heart see what your eyes cannot <br>And may Mai’irha herself guide your way <br>And bring you safely to the end of your journey.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Renildus made the sign of blessing over Thomar and there was a murmur from the brothers as they voiced their assent in the blessing. “Go in peace, Brother Thomar,” Renildus said solemnly. <br>Thomar stood reluctantly looked at the lamasery and the gathering of brothers one last time. The sunlight was stronger now and everything was limned in silver; the brothers haloed like Mai’irha herself, every leaf and blade of grass sparkling beneath the net of morning dew until the whole place was filled with light. He felt the ache in his heart begin to grow and when he spoke his voice was uneven. “Mai’irha’s blessing be upon you until we meet again.” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  He turned away quickly and began to walk down the road, the shreds of fog closing in behind him to surround him with the incredible morning light. If he turned to look back he knew that he would see nothing but the silver white of the fog and the brighter gleam of the haalendaer trees with their ivory trunks. Even so he refused to turn around, afraid that even that small act might break his resolve and lead him into disobedience. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Prioron Umalin had been anxious that Thomar have everything he need for his journey, staying up late into the night scouring the storerooms to make sure that nothing had been forgotten. While in the lamasery the brothers were accustomed to going barefoot, the well tended grounds providing no threat even to the tenderest skin. For the journey into the outside world, however, Umalin had found a pair of soft, yet sturdy sandals for Thomar so that he would not be forced to resort to the clumsy boots made by Men. A cloak, pack and bedroll had all been procured along with provisions that were both lightweight and durable and neatly packed away along with his extra robes.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Thomar had joined the order and entered into life in the lamasery he had given up all things that belonged to his past life, including personal possessions. Amoung those had been the plain but serviceable staff that had been his main tool when he had studied the magic arts. He had thought that the Prioron would return it to him when he left the lamasery, but Umalin had presented him with a much different staff. Formed of a haalendaer sapling, the staff was slim and straight. A single moonstone and an emerald were caught in a net of spun-silver strands hung in the natural curve at the top of the staff, and various runes were etched into the silvery surface of the rod. Thomar had tried to refuse the gift of the staff, protesting that his old staff was grand enough for a humble brother, but Umalin would have none of it.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar swallowed hard and took a deep breath. The fog had melted away and it was a clear morning full of clear light. A mild breeze tugged at the edge of his robes and the sun warmed the back of his neck with gentle fingers. Small bright birds fluttered across the road, their piping calls hanging in the air as though caught in crystal. He shuddered to think that within a few days he would leave all this behind him. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He came to the top of a small rise and before he could stop himself he had turned to look back the way he had come. The Mai’irhan retreat was far behind him by now but it seemed, as he looked down the road, that he could almost see it back amoung the trees and he took several steps that direction before he realized what he was doing. He stood for a moment struggling to turn away but found that he could not and he sank to his knees in the road. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why are you weeping, Thomar?” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked up and saw Mai’irha standing in the road, clad in a pale green robe with a bloodstone set on her forehead, her feet shod in sandals of silver. “Forgive me, Lady,” he whispered, bowing his head. “My heart is breaking from leaving my home.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She was silent for long moment and when she spoke again her voice was like deep bells. “I cannot compel you to leave. That choice is yours alone, but there are things I must show you before you make that choice.” She pointed over his shoulder. “Look, Thomar!”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He turned and saw a great plain stretching out to the horizon. The ground gaped wide with hideous cracks that belched steam and fumes and the earth itself smoked like a damp fire. In the distance a forest pushed up through the ground, every tree a twisted obscenity, a mockery of everything natural with branches that clawed at the overcast sky, dull grey leaves hanging like dirty rags. Thomar turned his face away, a sickness settling in his gut. “What is this place, Lady?”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This was Gamandreialaran, the most beloved of all our groves.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Cuahuirhan,” Thomar exclaimed taking a quick step back. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes. Now look.” She pointed again and he turned and saw that the land had shifted. To his left the Imperial City stood tall and proud, bright banners fluttering from every tower. All around lay broad fields and gentle rolling hills, small wooded places nestled in shallow valleys and clear streams chuckling their way to the vast lake that lay to the south of the city. Thomar looked at The Lady in confusion but she only motioned for him to look and he saw that the land had shifted again. Rugged foothills gave way craggy mountains, their peaks brilliant with snow. In the valleys, huge stone gates led to the deep dwarven cities and crystal rivers sang as they cut their way to the sea. The vision blurred and he looked at smooth grey plains and sod houses that seemed to grow out of the very ground. Halflings puttered about, tending their gardens and their sheep. One last time the land shifted beneath him and he stood back in the lamasery, with the graceful buildings and gardens alive with color. Slowly everything began to change. The moss-lined paths turned brown and the grass shriveled and died. The climbing vines began to choke the haalendaer, and the trees themselves twisted and shrank, their bark cracking and oozing like an untreated wound. The plants grew thorns, their colors became rancid and spoiled and they gave off a putrid stench. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thomar turned to The Lady in anger and alarm. “What is this?” he demanded. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This is what will happen if nothing is done to prevent it. The Shadow will rise and this time it will engulf all of Ilairkahlemeran.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why are you showing this to me?” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So that you may realize a small part of your purpose, Thomar. So that you may make your choice.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I do not understand,” he said weakly. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I did not say that you would understand.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then how am I supposed to choose?” The twisted groves began to fade and as they did so did Mai’irha. “Please, you must tell me what to do,” Thomar said desperately. <br>The Lady smiled sadly. “You must do as you have always done and choose as you have always chosen..”<br>Thomar stepped forward as if to grasp her robe but she was gone and he stood alone in the middle of the road. “I do not understand,” he whispered. In the distance a single bird trilled mournfully, a sound that hung eerily in the still air.  He stood, grasping his staff tightly, his mind a storm of confusion. His choice, The Lady had said. And yet, what sort of choice was it? How could he return to the lamasery knowing what might happen if he did? But what could he do to prevent what he had seen from coming to pass? <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He stood for a long time, gazing back down the road. Finally he turned and began walking again. He didn’t know where he was going or what he would do when he got there, but he knew that he couldn’t stay. <br><br><br>things i already know:<br>it's a little cliched, but i was aware of that when i wrote it. so please don't say &quot;it starts off like every other fantasy story.&quot; technically every story starts off like every other story (once there was a guy/girl and they lived in a certain place until one day something happened.) the important thing is how the story is told. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>anyway, i hope you enjoy it. please let me know what you think. <br>thanks! <br><br>e.p. <p>"saving the world in style"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukadeity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kadeity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/23/02 11:29:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=595.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tolkienesque story</span><hr size=1> I have an awesome storyline you would love.e-mail me and say TERRA MAKU as the subject if your intrested.<br> <br>      Kadeity_@hotmail.com<br> <br>                                 -Kaden <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uemmapeel1601.showPublicProfile?language=EN>emmapeel1601</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/27/02 6:29:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=595.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tolkienesque story</span><hr size=1> eh, well. <br>i thought the point was to give me advice about how to make my writing better, not plug a storyline that you made up. <br>no offense, but i'm not looking for ideas. i'm looking for critique. <br>*shrugs*<br>oh, well. <br><br>e.p. <p>"saving the world in style"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/urixius33.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rixius33</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/28/02 12:27:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=595.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tolkienesque story</span><hr size=1> hey thats a nice story...im thinking it takes place in the renisance?...anyways you did a great job on it...i dont see anything wrong with it.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uascendedbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ascended Bob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/28/02 12:40:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=595.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tolkienesque story</span><hr size=1> I like it.
