Are we the ones making stupid people fight? No.  They kill the people doing these things with some of their friends dying in the process. I don't think that you know what it means to have an American come in and &quot;throw his weight around&quot;. Imagine that your family is being held at gunpoint, your dad is being tied and beaten, they are about to do horrible things to your mother and sister, and some really mean guys think you're a nice plaything for their dogs. Now here come the bad Americans.Do you still have the same attitude? I don't think so. You should put yourself in those shoes and be thankful that we have a mighty big nose. Saying otherwise is just being selfish because you don't know what its like to be rescued from opression or certain death. I am proud of this country as are many others who were not born or raised here. They move thoushands of miles away from their homeland just to become an American. I welcome them as my brothers and sisters. We are all glad that this nation helps those that need it regardless of ignorant comments. <br><br>   Well Bob to begin with I think that I know well enough about foreign invasions due to the fact that Dominican Republic(my homeland) was invaded twice, inecesarily by american troops. In other words that those american military acts solved NOTHING in my country, actually it made things worse and brought terrible political consecuences.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I don't think that you know what it means to have an American come in and &quot;throw his weight around&quot;.

The American administration stole hundreds of acres from southern farmers, these farmers rebeled violently and were immediatly dispatched, while farmers would battle with matchets and musquets American troops would masacre them with a few machine guns. for more than a dozen years we were victims of a military tyrany, all acts of freedom were opressed. After 1924 when the 1st world war was almost over this place was no longer as strategical as it was before so they abandoned the military ocupation.<br>   In 1965 though a civil war broke out in the DR, the first democratic president ever to be elected during the last century was forced to renounce becuase of the threat of a part of the military and a few social sectors of the upper class. Revolutionists fought back bravely to restore constitutionality, but well what do you know American troops burst in out of no where with the excuse that there was a &quot;comunist revolution&quot; going on and that they were here to &quot;restore order&quot;. 10,000 marines arrived at Dominican shores, most of them didn't even know where they were, most of them thought that they were in Guam! 5,000 dominicans died in that conflict. Dozens were tortured by Americans as well(you heard right, tortured). Luckily a photo of a tortured dominican was sent to international press. <br>   Because of this intervention the political concecuences were disastrous. After the Americans signed a peace treaty and leaving us be again, a horrible year of political instability followed which lead u to the rise of another dictator.......12 more years of an anticonstitutional goverment. Still today we're still traumatized by those wars and sadly this has given the Dominican people a horrible impression on Americans.<br><br>Well Bob just so you know the facts, and I asure you that my last comment was NOT an ignorant one.      <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A
