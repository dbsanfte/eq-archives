That means you!</span><hr size=1> Well, after the last picture of the same character with the same gun (don't worry, that mysterious grey glob will resolve itself into a Mateba 6 Unica), I thought I should do another.  And now that I have finally found a bit time to do it, I thought I would post what I have gotten so far.  Unfortunately it is not finished.  I don't think the vast majority of the pic is a &quot;work in progess&quot; so by majority rule it goes in this forum.<br>
Stayed up until 5am working on this and when I woke up I got back to work on it.  And this is the result so far.<br>
Damn Jpeg compression.  If everyone had an OC3 connection I could upload an uncompressed tif and post that...<br>

That means you!</span><hr size=1> Face: Agree about the lips, they seem kind of separate. Maybe tone down the color, make them less saturated. Also, the teeth are screaming white. Throw some shading from the lips in there to set them back some. The shading under her left eye is getting a little too purple, almost as if she's bruised. Nose looks great, so does the hair. Eyes are good except for the insides. Like the teeth, they need some shadows to set them back, and tone down that white. The pupils seem a little unnatural in color as well.<br>
<br>
The rest: Breasts look off. See the angle of her clavicles compared to the angle of the line created by connecting her two nipples? They're going at opposing angles. Seems that the right one is off. Seems too low, and even a little bigger than her other one. Might want to calm down with the wrinklkes in her shirt, at least around her side. It makes it look really flat, like it's sitting on the floor and not hanging on her torso. There's kind of an abrupt value change in the skin around her neck. It should hit on some of those areas around there, and also on her face. As it is now, it's the only area that light. The hilight on her hip looks funky. Belongs on something metallic, not human skin. That whole area seems totally different from the rest of the pic (not just the skin, but how it's all rendered). The white strip on her pants looks odd too, but I don't know what you're doing there anyway.<br>
<br>
Overall: It looks like a good base, just needs some more work. I included pretty much everything I noticed, though I'm sure some of it is the way it is because it's not complete yet. I'm not sure if you plan on doing this, but adding a definitive light source would help out a lot. Maybe some more bold hilights and shadows would help give it some form, because right now it looks kind of flat. The shirt area in particular seems confused, there's weird shading everywhere. Think you went way too dark with that shadow on the area of the shirt between her breasts. It'd have to be super tight, and the fold would have to be folded up under itself to create a shadow like that. And considering how wrinkly the rest of it is, I don't get the impression that the shirt is very tight at all. <p><html>

I took all of your suggestions and improved the picture as best I could at this point.  The eyes, lips and teeth now have different chroma values.  The breasts have been reshaped, although I am not sure how much of an improvement I really made.  The hips don't look as much like plastic.  And finally I reworked the shirt to lose the abnormal amount of wrinkles.<br>
How does it look?<br>

<br>
Looks better. Shirt and the hip area are the biggest improvements. Might want to touch up under her left eye a little more, it still looks kind of bruised (not as badly though). Think you should still add some more dramatic shading, but that's a personal preference, so that's up to you. Think you need to work on the separation of the cloth and skin some more, too. It's fine around her stomach, but it just seems to shift colors on her arm and neck. Add a little strip of shading in there to show that they are two separate things and the cloth is above the skin. The forms of the arms and hand look good (except you added a sixth finger!), but the shading looks off. From the rest of the image the light source seems to be coming from the upper left, yet the lighting seems kind of random on her arm. There's a hilight on the right of her shoulder, and shading is on the left of her fingers, while at the same time a hilight is on her palm. Seems like it should be reversed.<br>
<br>
Looks to be shaping up nicely, though. Just keep at it. <p><html>

That means you!</span><hr size=1> Okay, now for the latest update:<br>
I changed the lightsource, dimmed the whites of the eyes and toned down the shading on the left one, defined the shaidng on the shirt a bit more, reversed the lighting on the hands.  I am going to start to work on the background now, so I will soon be adding some colored lighting to the piece and some bounce lighting... what fun!<br>
I seem to have gotten a lot of comments on that sixth finger.  I was toying around with having her hold something else like a knife in between saves, but I decided it didn't look as good.  You guys have only seen the gun (or blobby silver thing), but there is also a layer devoted to a switchblade.  I have completely finished the switchblade, but it lacked the impact of the gun.<br>
Mhael:  Yes, I am using a tablet.  It is the best $300 I have ever spent.<br>
Malfunction609:  Why did I change the shirt?  Because it looks bad.  Unreal.  And she is not supposed to look like she got doused with a firehose.  This is not a picture to excite teenage hormones.<br>

That means you!</span><hr size=1> I like the latest version. I have a few crits though,<br>
<br>
Her skin and nails seem a bit dull, I think they need a few sharper highlights to strenghten them.<br>
<br>
Also think the contrast could use some work. A few brighter highlights, and darker shadows to help the volume and make it pop.<br>
<br>
Looking at the face more, I think you need more shadows from the hair to show it as part of the face. It almost looks like the hair is floating around the face, and is not actually <br>
&quot;attached&quot;.<br>
<br>
