I just got done an exchange like that...my school and a school in japan have kind of a deal going...It's a really relaxed exchange and it's only for a month (in the summer)...so it's not quite the commitment it takes for a full year...the only catch was you had to pay for the plane ticket which was $1500...The student came back here and we had a great time...I had ridiculously good time there...words can't describe it...If you do go...don't say no to anything...sure you'll eventually hit some things you don't like but you don't want to miss out on something you may love...If you look around there are some adult exchanges...the same teacher that does the exchange at our school does an adult exchange...it's about $5000 but that's all inclusive...you should be able to find something...as well you could make friends with someone there and stay there and go on vacation...or do what I plan on doing after post secondary...Teach english...it's a good way to see Japan for a few years and get payed to do it... <p>--

You have to tell me more about it. I am so excited about going there this summer. I went down to the local university in my area and checked out some books on japanese language just to get a jump start. It's a tough language to learn, but i figure once i am in college i can get help there. What sort of places did you go to while you were there? I hear karaoke is a big thing there. My grandparents went there a few years back and they said that they had a grand time. Are there any places that are really worth making the effort to see while there?<br>

I was in the tottori prefecture (about the same as a state or province)...<br>
it's on the korean side about 3hours west of osaka...<br>
what you should do is go to the old area and see the stuff in Kyoto and Nara...especially this massive buddah...ask any japanese they'll no what you mean...it's a buddah that's about 6 storeys tall and you might see pictures but nothing makes sense untill you're there....there's also a big building made of gold<br>
also go up the mountains...there's roads up most of them but they're hard to find...Try going up the mountains at night so you can see the lights...bring a flashlight though...I didn't and had to climb down without one<br>
and if you're in the tottori prefecture...try and go to the daisen fire festival...I didn't get to go but it's supposed to be sweet...<br>
If you like cars and know what you're looking for in the stats go to a car dealership and get some brochures...they're free and you can learn katakana and some kanji...as well autotrader style magazines help too... <p>--

Hopefully the exchange program wont restric my movements too much. My friend went to this one Zen temple place on a mountain or hill or something and they said it was really cool. I forget the name so I have to talk in generalities. (zen temple on mountain top = very vague) but oh well... I was trying to do some research and get a collection of places that I wanted to go. I wanted to pick up some swords over there too and a couple of other martial arts things. I just hope with all the crazy terrorism stuff I'll be able to ship them back through customs. Now that hell registration week is over at my school, I will actually have time to go in and talk to the people that run the exchange program and find out more about it.<br>

you can get nice stuff over here...but I know it's not the same...I'm sure you can do it but it likely won't be easy...or cheap...and you can't hide it in an x-ray machine either <p>--

You can get them imported would probably be a better idea and it will save you less hassle during your trip too.  You can find good programs through various schools but right now I would take the one that would be the most inexpensive as well as being able to see all things you want to see in japan.  Where do you want to go? Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa......  You should think about that too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5>Japanese Language Help</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
