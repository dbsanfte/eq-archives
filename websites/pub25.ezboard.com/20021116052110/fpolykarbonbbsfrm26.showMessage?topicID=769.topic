Lot of scientific mumbo-jumbo but it's needed to understand what's going on. Any question's you might have about the gene therapy stuff going on just ask me. C&amp;C please.<br>

<br>
Story:Story start’s off in a laboratory with two people talking. One male and one female.<br>
((Story sometime around 1985-1986))<br>
<br>
Jonathan: “Don’t worry so much about this. It’ll turn for the best”<br>
<br>
Elizabeth: “Bu...but if they find out, they’ll surely take him. I can’t let that happen, I love him so much already.”<br>
<br>
Jonathan: “We’ll that’s expected, your his mother. Liz I won’t let anything happen to him or you. After all he is my son to.”<br>
<br>
Elizabeth: “I..dunno, maybe your right.”<br>
<br>
Jonathan: “Of course I’m right.” And with a hug and a kiss, everything seem’s to back to normal once again.<br>
<br>
Story turn’s to yet another laboratory. Except this one is much greater in size. Filled with scientist’s one and all alike. They<br>
work night and day -- only stopping every once and a while for a well deserved break. <br>
They all have one certain job, which is to produce a “working draft” sequence of the human genome.<br>
The human genome project was first started in the late 50's. The project was started to answer our meaningless<br>
question’s such as, “What make’s who we are?” and “How can we find out?”. Thus the Human Genome Project was underway.<br>
The basis of the project is that everything about us, from the color of our hair to the presence of a monobrow, is all<br>
written into our gene’s -- gene’s come from our parent’s, who mix their’s up and pass them to there offspring. Scientist’s<br>
believed that not only are physical trait’s are present in gene’s but other more subtle aspect’s of are being are also present. Yet<br>
scientist’s had not only been screwing around with humanity, but messing around with other specie’s as well, such as the<br>
cloning of sheep and growing ear’s on rat’s.<br>
Well thing’s weren’t as simple as they thought. There’s allot of stuff that control’s different factor’s. It would have<br>
taken ten more year’s before they could have made any use of there finding’s.<br>
While the Human Genome Project [HGP] was busy tapping around with other specie’s, another group was making<br>
head-way with their studies’s. The other group named Fourth-World, was performing there experiment’s not on animal’s, but<br>
on people. They were trying to create a superior specie’s. One that doesn’t get hurt, one that doesn’t get sick, one that is<br>
invulnerable, immortal. Superior skills to those of Olympic Champions, “The best of the best”.<br>
This secret organization controlled and funded by one with no name, no face. Only to be known by the name Black<br>
Mask(or possibly the name Father?). A rich man with unimaginable power. Not much else is known about him other than he<br>
moved to the US from Russia.<br>
Black Mask brought together the world’s top scientist’s to do his work. His plan for a superior race was well on it’s<br>
way to completion.<br>
With his money he was able to get the best in technology. By the 60's HGP had only sequenced two percent of human<br>
DNA. While Fourth-World can sequence one thousand base pair’s per second at a very low cost. Fourth-World had nearly<br>
ninety percent complete.<br>
With this much done Black Mask found out that with this sequencing technology, it would allow him to “read out”<br>
the entire base pair sequence for any individual. Chromosomes’s are built from the sequencing data, allowing reconstitution of<br>
the genetic material of a long-dead person. Which is then inserted into a “blank” egg and embryo genesis started -- generating a<br>
clone.<br>
That in the Black Mask’s hand’s he could have an entire army of clone’, but that wasn’t enough. He wanted his<br>
specie’s to have power’s of god’s. This is where virus’s come in. <br>
A virus -- a short sequenced DNA (or possibly RNA) encased in a protective protein shell -- approaches the bumpy<br>
surface of a human cell. Surface feature’s of the virus have evolved shape’s that are complementary to the feature’s on the<br>
cell’s outer membrane, so that when the two come together, they attach like the hook’s and loop’s of velcro, forming a tough<br>
bond. This set’s off additional mechanism’s in the virus. The trigger’s signal the protein shell to inject it’s nucleic acid cargo<br>
through the membrane and into the cell. Where it will commandeer the machineries’s of reproduction and produce copies’s of<br>
itself by the million’s upon million’s. In other words you can take a trait from one animal, give it to another and that animal<br>
take’s on the other animal’s trait.<br>
If the virus is of a special type known as retro virus, then it has an additional trick up it’s sleeve: the DNA bundled<br>
with additional wetware that, by a process, not completely understood, transport’s it directly to the cell’s nucleus and splice’s it<br>
directly to the genome of the cell -- a safe and comfortable home where no immune mechanism can touch it. Unfourtanetly for<br>
the virus, though, cell nuclei do have a habit of switching gene’s on and off. If this happen’s to the gene’s left in place by the<br>
virus, then the interloper can then lay dormant, a short segment of “Junk DNA” in the long, long sequence of the cell’s genome.<br>
And if the infected cell responsible for the production of sperm or egg’s, this junk, which produce’s nothing, may become part<br>
of a genetic makeup passed along to the host’s children.<br>
<br>
<br>
Story the switches to 2002, today. At a Los Angeles highschool, where a 15 year old boy goes’s through the same ritual of<br>
getting punked and bullied everyday. The boy’s name is Christopher Senn. A tall, lanky child with messy blonde hair. The kid<br>
doing the beating is Keith Riddor, Chris’s childhood friend. Keith changed when they reached highschool and started picking<br>
on Chris for unknown reason’s. Chris run’s home, keeping back the tear’s he is so scared of. <br>
Chris’s home, a bad, bad place for a child. He live’s with his loser drunk step father, who beat’s Chris from time to<br>
time. His step mother a lost soul, who is only looking to get out of this place any way she can.<br>
Chris rushes upstair’s before his step dad see’s him. He silently shut’s his door and then throw’s his backpack at the<br>
wall. He rummage’s through his closet, looking for the only thing that give’s him joy in his sad life, his comic book’s. He<br>
read’s them day and night. He lay’s on his bed listening to melodic rock music and read’s his favorite comic &quot;Artic Chill&quot;.<br>
Suddenly deep down inside Chris’s stomach, he feels a great intense pain. He rushes’s to the bathroom and start’s vomiting<br>
right away. Tear’s and sweat fall from his face. Not knowing what is happening he lay’s down on his bed and stair’s up at the<br>
ceiling. Trying to suppress his pain, he turn’s on the radio, but the pain get to be to much and Chris passe’s out on the floor....<br>
