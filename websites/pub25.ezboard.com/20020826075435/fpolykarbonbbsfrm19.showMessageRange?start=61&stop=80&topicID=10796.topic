Medieval war I believe is so romanticized because it's so basic and feral.  Personal, face to face violence that just isn't present today.  I'm not saying it's good, but it's foreign.  Medieval times had their problems - if you weren't nobility you were trash.  Pesants were nothing more than another resource to kings and kingdoms.  <br>
<br>
But the very fact that the kings and such fought to protect their way of life is much more noble to me than the opposite which is war now.  <br>

Maybe, maybe not.  I personally think no.  I still give a lot of credit to our instinctual selves, the part of everyone that screams for survival at all costs.  We may do considerable damage to our world and to each other but we would never destroy ourselves.  The idea of ending human civilization everywhere is too much to bare for anyone.  Not only would it mean the death of the individual, but also of the human legacy.  All our songs, are art, our ideologies, our achievements, our dreams would all be burnt off the face of the universe.  We would fall into total oblivion, absolute death for all and for everything that we've ever accomplished as a race both good and bad.  However big our differences, we would never chose a course with such horrific totality, never.<br>
<br>
As for war, it is well proven that war is seriously traumatic for all those involved.  Post traumatic stress syndrome is the largest body of that proof.  Anyone here who's suffered emotionally or psychologically knows that there's no worse place to be.  In war, you have pretty clear objectives as a soldier, but once the fighting ends and you survive, you have to live with all that you've seen and done.  For many, that's when the hauntings begin.  One thing war isn’t: definitively over.  There's always a long aftermath for the survivors, where they suffer emotionally with memories that aren't physical there and that are far more challenging to deal with.  For some, it's either a quick death on the battlefield, or a possible long drawn out march towards suicide.<br>
<br>
I never want to experience war first hand.  I know I would be one of the marchers if I survived the first part of the thing.  Psychological torment is not something I would wish on my worst enemy. <p><p><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Brian Bork</FONT>

Precisely.<br>
<br>
It's never been about personal confrontation. Back then it was people rushing into each other while the archers on the back line rained arrows into the crowd, and more recently it's people shooting at each other while artillery and mortars on the back line rain explosives into the crowd. It's the same thing over a greater distance.<br>

Anyone want to speculate on what war will be like in 2507?

the way i read it was that the act itself was noble, not the cause that they were defending - as in, the rulers don't just tell their drones to go out and kill ethe enemy, they actually put their life on the line for what they feel is right, even if that's seen as wrong by today's standards <p><BR>SPYDERS17

I'm sure that when people noticed what's been going on, when it's gotten so bad that you can't ignore it that they'll change and try to make it better.

But it used to take a lot more bravery and honor to kill a person than it does now. Now we have &quot;progressed&quot; so far that one soldier doesn't walk onto a battle field and kill an enemy that he see, and fights. Instead, one man pushes a button somewhere and kills a &quot;target&quot; that target can be a massive number of people. Now terrorist after terrorist, little boys and even women walk into buildings with bombs strapped on their chest and kill numbers of innocents. Try finding that many people who can carry a sword into a building and kill the same number of people. FIVE YEAR-OLDs shoot each other by playing power rangers, I don't think a five year-old could pick up or land a descisive ble with a sword. In a way, smashing someones skull in is less barbaric than dropping one bomb and wiping out a population. <br>

       Also, I am registered for draft, if I were called on i would glady serve and kill but I would not do it away from my enemies. When the WTC was bombed, kids in schol were wishing for a draft because they wanted to go over there and smash Al Queda and that coward Bin Laden. <br>

And as 'card said, I don't feel it's right to go blaming a particular race for the state of the world.  No race has a flawless record - honestly I don't see why people always need a scapegoat. <p><small>Darkness breeds the dark,<br>

I don't think they did put their lives on the line. Kings wouldn't be kings for very long if they fought in the battles with their men. They would clearly be the prime target for all attacks and would not have lasted long. I serious doubt MOST kings would ever put themselves in serious danger. <p><table width=100% border=0>

Hah!  Very true and very important too.  That's the thing with the &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; philosophy of the 20th century.  The leaders themselves would also be the targets and destroyed too along with all the rest, bomb shelters or no.  If they actually did survive, what kind of country would be left to legislate over anyhow?<br>
<br>
If you where a leading Monarch of the middle ages than the only thing you really had to worry about in war was absolute defeat.  That's when you would lose your life.<br>
<br>
Also, what kind of causes did they fight for in the middle ages?  Where they really that noble?  The great wars  of the 20th century where heavily centered on ideologies like the defeat of Nazi fascism or communist Vietnam (failed attempt of course), etc.  <br>
<br>
The wars fought in the middle ages where about land, wealth, the rights of one over the other, pure conquest, who was the rightful ruler of what and so forth.  Most people in our time only consider the revolutions that came later to be of a more noble sentiment than the bickering and greed mongering that war was centered around in the middle ages (of course greed and bickering are staple elements of war in most cases too, exceptionally so in the middle ages and before).  The crusades where heavily ideologically driven but the results where much less spectacular and questionable to say the least.  Also, peasant revolts where very common in the middle ages too.  These would have been the foot soldiers who went to war when called upon by their leader whether they wanted to or not and would have suffered the most from war.  Draft dodgers are prosecuted in our day and age via jail time... could you imagine the penalty for such a thing in the middle ages?  It's far from noble and far from romantic.  I have a hard time believing that these men went into war all full of pride for their cause and energized with some kind of noble sentiment.  I'm sure many did, but not the majority, especially based on how they where treated by their lords.<br>
<br>
As for Kings on the battlefield, it happened but they never lead the charge that's for sure.  This ain't no King Arthur crap which is where most of our romanticized view of the middle ages originates from.  They would have remained behind the lines planning attacks with their generals and organizing their resources.<br>
<br>
I read a book called &quot;A History Of Europe&quot; by Norman Davis.  As it suggests, it's a summaric account of European history that was enlightening to say the least.  The Middle Ages is far, FAR different than what we've been made to believe by our romanticized culture.  It's worth looking into. <p><p><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Brian Bork</FONT>

Well, I don't know about you, but our history classes tend to focus almost exclusively on European and American history, and glossed over any non Western culture. You miss a lot of good that way, but you also miss a lot of the bad. <br>
<br>
I don't see what the point of worrying about who caused more of what matters anyway. <p><table width=100% border=0>
