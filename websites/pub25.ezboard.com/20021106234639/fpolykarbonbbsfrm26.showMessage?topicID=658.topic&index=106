<br>
Stand up on your feet/<br>
It's time for you to meet/<br>
The f*ckin executioner/<br>
The pro-retributioner/<br>
I'm the comeback king/<br>
So get out the ring/<br>
Of pro killers and mad rhymers/<br>
A little lessons for you first timers/<br>
We go off like explosions/<br>
Let me give you a notion/<br>
To not include yourself in this war/<br>
Cuz your's skills are too poor/<br>
And with you I'll mop the floor/<br>
Before I kick you out the door/<br>
<br>
TIME TO GET BRUTAL.......<br>
<br>
I'm on a  one way crash course/<br>
With an untameable force/<br>
The shogun mic gripper/<br>
Slashin like Jack the ripper/<br>
But you can call me ZO/<br>
It won't matter when you go/<br>
Straight down six feet/<br>
Cuz you couldn't take the heat/<br>
So all amatuers take a seat/<br>
while I murder this f*ckin beat/<br>
I repeat/<br>
Me and infested have taken over/<br>
Your out of luck we got the clover/<br>
But it's really cuz of skills/<br>
That make you fakers pop pills/<br>
To combat depression/<br>
So you better learn a lesson/<br>
Anyone talking sh*t/<br>
Won't have a chance for confession/<br>
Just a little session/<br>
With the masters/<br>
To take out you little bastards/<br>
We do it ten times better/<br>
And 20 times faster/<br>
<br>
This'll be my last transmission/<br>
From this little prison/<br>
I like to call my mind/<br>
But then again I find/<br>
The demons make me stronger/<br>
And able to rhyme longer/<br>
<br>
Enough for now........<br>
