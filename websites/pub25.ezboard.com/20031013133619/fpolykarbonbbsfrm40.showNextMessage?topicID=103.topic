<br>
Endura; a world thriving in life.  Ahura, the creator of Endura kept a watchfull eye over the world.  She was happy with they way life was unfolding on her creation.  Every now and then problems with the many different races that inhabited the world arose, but for the most part everything was they way it should have been.  Life went on like this for centuries, and Ahura was happy.  During the life span of Endura, technology began to thrive and take over.  Computers, high tech weaponry, and modern science began taking over.  Ahura did not like this but decided to let this go unanswered.  But science didn’t end there; it grew and prospered.  Faith in Ahura was replaced by faith in machines.  <br>
<br>
The people of Endura stopped believing in Ahura and forgot about her.  This angered Ahura and she began to let her rage lose on the world of Endura to restore the people’s faith in her.  But this attempt at restoration was met by and increase in the belief that machines would take care of everything.  Ahura stopped at nothing to try and regain the faith of those she created, but nothing came of her attempts.  Finally Ahura fed up with Endurian’s lack of faith in her decided that she would strike down on Endura like nothing before.  During the course of a hundred years Ahura created an army of Hu-Rahs.  Hu-Rahs were creatures that she knew would strike fear in the hearts of every living being on Endura.  She created these creatures to only obey one, and that one was her.  Along with the Hu-Rahs she created a single crest that would control all Hu-Rahs created thereafter.  This crest she wore with her at all times.  <br>
<br>
With her newly raised army Ahura struck down on Endura with all of her rage.  Little by little the massive armies of Ahura destroyed villages and towns of those who did not believe in Ahura any more.  Those that still believed were welcomed into her army.  Ahura’s army grew by the thousands as time passed.  It seemed as if Ahura would gain back what she created; that which was taken from her so long ago.<br>
<br>
But the spirit of Endura would not falter so easily.  Word traveled fast about this unbeatable army.  The High Council of Endura gathered and devised a treaty between all living beings on Endura to come together into one force to meet head on with the army of Ahura.  Humans, elves, dwarves, and all other races came to the town of Lyna the capital city of Ternion to amass the largest army ever created on Endura.  Word of this amassing army spread quickly through the towns and villages of Endura.  Word finally reached Ahura and she decided that her army would move onto the land of Ternion, the land of the Three Powers.<br>
<br>
One and a half years passed and after countless battles, the time for the final stand had come.  The Army of Ahura had finally laid foot on the soil of Ternion.  It is there on the plains of Omegus that the final battle for all of Endura would take place.  The battle began on the morning of  August 12th, the three thousand year anniversary of Endura.  The battle raged on for two days.  On the third day Ahura brought an end to the last of the Army of the Three Powers.  There she stood alone, victorious.  That which was taken from her was now hers once again.  The remaining strength she used to end the remaining life on Endura.  She wanted to start over and didn’t want any remembrance of the history of Endura planted into any being’s mind.  But something like this is never truly forgotten.  Though all life had been eradicated, books and journals remained.<br>
