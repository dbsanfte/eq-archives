A big hearty congrats!  Yahoo!!<br>

So what does this mean for the rest of us for leveling?  Do we stay at 25?  I suggest that the limit be taken off.  Many of us have secondary and even tertiary (even quartary) &lt;sp?&gt; characters that we play  It seems like if some of us do go beyond 25, we have other characters that can group when it's time for guild hunts again.  Maybe it's being a bit selfish, but I want Cashew to get 29.  Group TP is so droolworthy.  And believe me, I want to help the guild out as well.  Anytime you want a TP, it's yours!!  And I do expect the money to roll in too, I'd love to lend out money whoever needs it. <br>

<br>
Just wanted to pop in and give my thoughts on this.  I wasn't really aware that there was still a limit of 25th level imposed.  I know a few of us have surpassed that already, myself included (at 27 now).  One thing I have noticed is as we get on in levels a little more, the easier it is to have a gap in levels.  At 24th I was grouping with 30th and 31st level players and still making really good experience.<br>
<br>
As Cashew pointed out, several of us have different characters in these levels also.  I for one don't see any reason for there not to be an advanced group for those of us who want to spread our wings and get the benefits of the higher levels (clarity, group teleports, rezzes, etc.) and also enable the guild as a whole to share in those benefits.  Not to mention even the experiences the higher level characters get in adventuring can bring new hunting ideas and strategies to the younger group.  If you've ever thought to yourself, &quot;If I knew then what I know now...&quot;, you know where I'm coming from.<br>
<br>
Now granted, I'm not expecting to rocket to level 50 in a month or anything (although I am hoping for 29 by the end of next week), so I should be within grouping range for a while, and Kin will probably always be.  I enjoy grouping with guildmates more than anything, and wouldn't put that in jeopardy by being too high a level.  I've really enjoyed levelling of late, and clarity is so close I can smell it (damn that Boceifis for casting it on us in Rathe Mountains...need....crack)<br>
<br>
Well, those are about my thoughts, anyone else wanting to give their opinions, please do so!  See you all in Norrath!<br>

I want to get Nine up to Twenty Nine. Clerics get a no experience ressurection. It will no longer matter where the warriors are bound. I can just call them back to their corpse. I can always dust off Opus to play with a low 20's group. Also the experience penalty is not an issue at higher levels. A low 20 and a high 20 can mix and both will get experience. The only guild member who does not have at least one 20+ level character is Ziag. We should try to help him catch up. So in summary my vote is to press on to level 29.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cashewribs>CashewRibs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/2/01 10:51:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The race is on, and we have a winner</span><hr size=1> With the bar raised, I think it's put quite a few of us in a fever!

I'm aiming to get 29 by the end of this month.  If I get it sooner, then I'll feel even better.  With Loralana getting Clarity at 29, Nine can do resurrections, wow, seems like the guild is shaping up to have some great powerhouses!!  We're all hunting in South Karana of late, I'd never have thought that I'd end up back there, I think the aviak incident turned me off a bit.  But the gnolls give great exp and great loot, if you have the right spire.  The south spire is so slow, but it's at least safe.  Here's to a safe leveling to 29!!<br>

<br>
If you need a teleport let me know.  Luckily, I have the group teleports that are most helpful in completing the Gem Inlaid Gauntlet quest that many of us are doing now after hunting the gnolls outside Splitpaw.<br>
Once I ensure this level, I will probably ease off on hunting for awhile (tries not to listen to Cashew whispering in her ear about the teleport spells to Velious).  I have so many other tasks that have been awaiting my attention:  teleporting for money to recover from buying all my new spells, learning tailoring, raising my brewing skill so I can bring something yummy to Oake's party...oh, the list goes on and on!<br>
<br>
I agree with Loralana on Cirroc catching up.  I know that Brynhilde and Melwyn will be more than happy to go hunting with Cirroc once he gets back from his sabbatical.<br>
<br>
This is so exciting!  I can't wait to get a teleport from Cashew and a Clarity from Lorlana!<br>

Ok, last night I was at the very very edge of 26.  I went to SK to look for a group, when someone said that spots were open in Treants.  My gosh, this spawn is highly sought out.  So I fight them.  My gosh, unbelievable.  2 Treants spawn regularly every 3 minutes or so, I kid you not.  Kill one quickly, med for just a bit, maybe about 2 bubbles worth without Breeze/Clarity, and the other pops up.  So breaking the spawn is easy and a must.  The loot?!  How does 6pp sound?  BUT sometimes the loot is in silver and gold.  No wonder bankers are wanted all the time at this place.  And I tipped the bankers that did come pretty well.  So Galadhriel, ain't nothing wrong with banking here, 'cause I'll probably do it!!  Oake, Galadhriel, and Gilraen all freaked when I told them what I was killing.  Why?  The faction hits are pretty bad.  Qeynos Guards, Qeynos Ranger Guild, PineTreeFolk, and one other I think.  So get this, I started playing at the spawn 7:00 at night.  Guess what time I left?  8:00 in the morning.  You heard me right, I stayed up the whole night killing these trees.  The exp is unbelievable.  AND the loot is nothing to smirk off.  The coinage is great, but once in a while a Great Staff will be dropped, worth 17p.  So the whole night I probably made at least 250p.  And I made level 29.  I'm barely into it.  I need my FIB badly.  So what about the faction hits?  Well, Qeynos I can fix by killing BB gnolls, that's a cinch.  As for the others...hmm...I'm sure I'm not welcome in SureFall Glade.  Why?  I conned the druids outside the ring in NK.  They glared at me threateningly.  So what does that mean?  KOS.  Was it worth it?  Can I fix this faction?  That I don't know, if anyone knows a way, I'd be happy to hear it.  If not, oh well.  One, I hardly ever go near druid rings anyways, and since I myself am a teleporter, I won't need a druid to tp me.  So what fools fight treants then?  Well, Loralana did fight by my side for quite some time, but not the whole night like me.  She probably won't fight anymore.  She quit when I quit.  Mainly dark races fought, I never grouped with so many dark elves before.  Races who are good are fools to fight treants.  To be KOS right as you get tp to a druid ring.  FOOLISH!!  Oh well, 29 is mine.  I'm here at work, pretending to work.  I got no sleep whatsoever.  Was it worth it?  Oh of course.  And it was quite the challenge!  Since I played so long, I went through many groups.  Easily 3 people can hold it, the right combo of course.  4 or higher is definitely easy.  And the spawn rate, unbelievably fast.  So my point is, DO NOT kill treants.  You can kill some, but don't kill a lot, like me.  But since I can teleport, that's my way around it.  Oh, and it was a treat when Oake stopped by.  He is now a Preserver, level 55, hooray!  I saw his bear pet.  Very cute!  Ok, that's it.  Just wanted to share my tale of triumph and tragedy.  Like Galadhriel has said, I am so willing to TP anywhere by your command.  But Galadhriel has better destinations than me. I only have GF, NK, and Toxx.  She has BB, NK, Toxx, and WC.  WC is a vital one, with Freeport, the Commons, and Oasis in reasonable reach.  I won't tp to WC until level 39!  EEEK!!  Oh well, although level 34 is juicy, I will take a break for awhile, I do mean it.  I'll concentrate on Ribs maybe, or Stabb or Carabas even.  Not sure about Connect.  Ok, I ranted enough.  I'll see you all soon!!<br>

Group teleports are hers as well!<br>
<br>
The downside was in the choice of huntees for the evening.  Found hunting to be sparse, all gnoll spires were full, I could not find a group.  I even ventured to Highhold Keep to try to find something there, but to no avail.  So the call came out to head to the treants in South Karana.  Cashew is no longer welcome at druid rings, and I came close to it.  As a follower of Tunare, my heart was never into slaying the innocent treants, but sometimes you do what is necessary to improve the big picture.  I desire very much to attone with Tunare, and have some thoughts on appropriate penance.  I will have to discuss them with our Preserver, Oake.  First is my vow to never get into another treant group<br>
<br>
On the bright side, I was the first passenger on the Nutty Express to G Fay, where we did some much needed banking, and purchased several spells.  I have my spells ready for me when I do reach our current goal of 29, including Clarity for everyone!  I know especially you group tpers will be hungry for it. hehe<br>

And if worse comes to worse, we'll just do some mass powerlevelling. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, I look forward to grouping with any of the guild members, young or old.  Everyone can contribute something to any group, don't ever forget that.  See you in Norrath my friends!<br>

Don't worry big guy, I'll group with you!  That is if you're not busy on some dragon or plane raid, I don't think I'd fit in too well in either of those.  But let's see, what would you want to do?  Kill some hill giants?  Or maybe some of those Velious giants?  I've already started with helping kill cyclopses (what the heck is the plural of cyclops?), so that's a step in the right direction.  I like killing those big guys, so I'd be game for that.  Give me a tell any time.<br>

I would love to group with you and expel any forces that plague all that is natural.  You would know better the immediate threats to all that has been created by our beloved Tunare.  Tell me when and where, and all my combat skills and magics will be at your disposal.  Or we can run amok in Solusek's Eye, I really like that place. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, here's hoping for an upcoming grouping adventure, I'm sure it would be quite fun.<br>
