<br>
I look forward to watching every Sat. night (Even If I HAVE seen most of them 100 times). Then without warning they put some OTHER crap on! I feel like I've fallen for the Bait and Switch routine! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
AND....If they're going to put a warning on the shows (Suggestive content blah blah blah...Not suitable for anyone under 18 blah blah blah) then how about putting the UNCUT versions on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ! My Kids aren't 18 but I'm a pretty with-it guy and let them watch because it's USUALLY GOOD stuff (No worse than you'd see on regular TV anyway! just watch a friggin Soap Opera in the afternoon or a Jerry Springer Show and that's on REGULAR TV NOT CABLE!)<br>

First of all they're not &quot;butchering&quot; them. Cowboy Bebop is only minorly edited (cuss words not allowed on TV, nudity, etc). I doubt most of the shows that premiered on Adult Swim are that bad off in censorship. Outlaw Star, or anything else that aired on Toonami first, probably is worse off though. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I agree they go a little crazy with those warnings considering nothing is even rated higher than TV 14, but that doesn't mean they hacked them down to get those ratings. <br>
<br>
And I think most of the shows are at least decent. Cowboy Bebop is great, as are the two Gundam series, Yu Yu Hakusho is okay, and Outlaw Star is alright sometimes. The only one that I'd really consider awful is Pilot Candidate.<br>
<br>
And about it not being on tonight... big deal? It's one weekend. It'll be on again next weekend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukempokatt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kempokatt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/24/02 8:28:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1909.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebs.com/kempokatt/outlawstar08.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Adult Swim Not On AGAIN!</span><hr size=1> It seems like they do it ALOT to me....<br>
<br>
I Like the shows wether or not they're cut but i'd MUCH rather see them UN-CUT.<br>
<br>
It's like watching a good movie on regular TV and KNOWING &quot;That's not what he said&quot; it get's on my nerves....<br>
<br>
Why bother putting all those warnings when they are NOT needed. (Guess it makes the younger kids WANT to see them more...)<br>
<br>
Oh well, I just needed to blow off some steam (It's kinda like late night quality time with the kids and now it's not on! I think that's what pisses me off the most...)<br>
<br>
Almost like when they talk over your favorite song on the radio...it makes you yell &quot;SHUT THE HELL UP SO I CAN HEAR THE SONG!!!&quot;.....know what I mean?!<br>

They aren't cutting anything that they don't have to. You cannot show nudity on US TV. You cannot say certain words on US TV. Cartoon Network has no control over that, they can't show it COMPLETELY uncut unless they are free of those. Most episodes of Cowboy Bebop are not cut at all (as far as I know). I've seen both versions from episodes 1-5, and if they changed anything, it's very very minor because I didn't notice any.<br>
<br>
And this is only the second time it hasn't aired at all. I know they played marathons for a few weeks, but it was still airing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukempokatt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kempokatt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/24/02 8:56:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1909.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebs.com/kempokatt/outlawstar08.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Adult Swim Not On AGAIN!</span><hr size=1> What?<br>
<br>
They can't show nudity on TV?! They show homer simpsons butt on Fox. They show Ms. Chokesondik's boobs on Comedy central....examples of &quot;Animated Nudity&quot;....They even show PUPPET nudity (Boobs and all) on Comedy Central! (Crank Yankers).<br>
<br>
They even show REAL nudity on FX (Male and female butts and female boobs) - (The Shield) they say the F'word, S'word and any other number of words on that show....Basic cable....Just like Cartoon Network.<br>
<br>
Why cut them at all?<br>
<br>
Guess I've got a one track mind....Leave things the way they were made! (It's like the movie E.T. why change the guns to walkie talkies!? why change Terrorist to HIPPIE!?) I thought it sucked both ways but LEAVE IT ALONE ALREADY!<br>

They can show nudity on TV, but it's usually in very limited ways. I know in educational shows they can show almost anything, and yes, occassionally they show someone's butt briefly in other shows. I don't ever recall them showing breasts (with nipples showing) on The Shield, and trust me, I watched that show religiously. If they did, I must have missed it, which is very possible.<br>
<br>
Rrarely some shows will have s*** spoken. I know NYPD Blue has done it, and they do it regularly on The Shield. I have never heard anyone say f*** on network or basic cable that I know of.<br>
<br>
And these are relatively rare cases, and in limited ways. The taboo words are kept to a minimum (well, except that South Park episode) and the periods of nudity are very brief. Scenes like in Tenchi (the famously edited bath episode where swimsuits were added onto everyone) would never fly becuase they were nude almost the entire episode. The shower scene in Cowboy Bebop revealed a bit too much to leave uncensored also.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing that the edits aren't stupid and unecessary, becuase I agree, and would love to see them untouched. But the fact is Cartoon Network didn't make the rules, they just have to follow them. Yeah, sometimes normally taboo words and nudity are shown, but those are exceptions to the rule, and I imagine that they carry some sort of fine for obscenities (or otherwise they probably wouldnt be so uncommon). I believe this is the case on radio as well.<br>

I'd like to see an ENTIRE network of just Japanese animation! I don't care if it cost extra either! (Kinda like an HBO for Anime!)<br>
