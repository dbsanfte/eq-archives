but post great anime vs the poser crap.<br>
im not saying i hate anyone who watches these, but i personally think that yu-gi-oh is crap. why? they play cards for 22 mins an episode. i mean really, you dont see an anime with people playing Magic: The Gathering or anything. the plot is bad, the voice acting is terrible, sure its drawn alright but that doesnt make it good. that series was made solely for money. second on my list, beyblade. a whole show that revolves around spinning tops. everybody wears these martial arts suits and they're &quot;skilled warriors&quot; all for some stupid tops! and they say in that show &quot;you have to have strategy to win&quot; how can you have strategy over a spinning top that you have no control over? i really dont like that series. another is pokemon. it is rather plotless, watching people do the same thing over and over. have pokefights and catch pokemon. and if nintendo wasnt so damn supportive of this show it wouldnt be popular at all. i'm sorry but i just cant stand entire series that revolve around something that someone does continually (in yu-gi-oh its playing cards, in beyblade it's playing in the sandbox with plastic tops, in pokemon its obsession over monsters). also, ash ketchum cries too much.<br>
<br>
im not going to list all of the great anime, cuz im doing that on my website -.-;;. but shows like excel saga and hand maid may and ranma 1/2 are great anime. i cant say i've seen cowboy beebop or yu yu hakusho or any of that (i live in canada, i dont get the cartoon network). though i have heard a lot about those shows and intend to buy some dvd's.<br>
<br>
anyway, list whats good and what isn't <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismrx>PrismRX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freewebsitehosting.net/websites/OneWingedAngel/JackAvatar.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/23/03 9:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2256.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebsitehosting.net/websites/OneWingedAngel/JackAvatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: True Anime V.S.

Corporate Crap</span><hr size=1> What you've listed tend to be shows designed to sell things, and I agree that they're not always that great. However, the age group targeted is a thing. If you aren't the age that'd be buying Pokemon, well, you aren't *supposed* to like it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'd agree that it's junk...however, from a different standpoint, it's incredibly well done. They sold tons of Pokemon stuff, marketed by the anime. Bravo. Just don't make me watch it. I laugh at Transformers Armada, but if I was 6 or 8 (like I was when Transformers was on originally) I probably would eat it up. <br>
<br>
What I'd like to see is them market Hikaru No Go here...instead of playing with a CCG, it's an anime about playing Go, which is in some ways more complicated than chess. From what I understand it's also a fun anime to watch.<br>
<br>
Other stuff is just plain bad anyway. Like the Street Fighter Alpha movie, Fatal Fury anime, um, Darkstalkers anime...for examples. It doesn't have to be a corporate sellout show to be bad. Heck, I'd list Dragonball Z in with that too, though others might not.<br>
<br>
As long as it's not people now disliking anime for being popular, I tend to respect opinions on it. Remember that it's not free to make anime, so nearly all of it will be made to make money in some fashion...just perhaps not by selling packs of cards.<br>
<br>
The problem is that there's very little market for anime *not* aimed at little kids and selling them things in this country. Cartoon Network is actually really bad about keeping series on other than DBZ. I know people that are quite pissed with them for showing half of the first Gundam series twice...and my roommate is now saying that they're cancelling Inuyasha (believe it when I see it). If you haven't seen that...and like Ranma...you'd probably dig it. Same creator.<br>
<br>
Anyway, yeah, Cowboy Bebop is great. As is Trigun, Kenshin, Evangelion, Nadesico, Hellsing, and on and on. One thing to do is go to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.animenfo.com" target="top">www.animenfo.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and see what people have said about shows.

Yet everyone seems to love getting all nostalgic about all those 80's cartoons, which were the exact same thing.<br>
<br>

Huh? That stuff was obviously only made because it would sell on name recognition whether it was good or not. Though I actually thought the Darkstalkers anime wasn't that bad. Animation was good, and the story was pretty decent (especially considering it's based off of a fighting game). At the very least, it was better than any other fighting game based anime I've seen, though that's not really saying much.<br>
<br>
And Inu Yasha hasn't been cancelled. It's not airing right now while Reign is playing. After it finishes airing through the second time (it's only 13 episodes), Inu Yasha is returning to Adult Swim. I don't know when, or if, they're getting any more new episodes though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themightyservo>The Mighty Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/23/03 12:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2256.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/cmayer/images/servo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: True Anime V.S.

Yeah, on second though I agree...fighting game anime is a sellout too (just a different kind). Sorta like movie based games...there are the occasional good ones, but most are just bad. Bad example, but there's still bad anime (or badly done anime) without marketing tie ins...
