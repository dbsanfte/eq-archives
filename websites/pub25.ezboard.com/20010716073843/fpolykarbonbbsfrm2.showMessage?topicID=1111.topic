<br>
And now, you don't need to paint the cells, it's all done with conputer programs. It's faster and easier. You rarely see a cell animated movie. As for the time, to animate a few sec can take weeks depending on how clean and fluid you want your animation. But you must know that tons of people work a long time for one single episode. But it's difficult to tell how much time it really takes. It depends on the studio , on how much animators there is and on the qualitity they want to acheive for the show. <br>
<br>
As for the frames to look a like....PRACTICE!!!! No trick there. With time anyone can manage to do it.

I have made some animations and yes, it takes hours just to draw and animate a character.<br>
It takes 30 drawings/frames per second of animation.  Then you have to test the animation to <br>
see if the movement came out ok.  If not, its back to the drawing board <br>
to redo the animation.<br>
 It takes a big crew of people to color and finish an animation. The more people, the better. <br>
We also use a set palette of colors per scene. Thats how everything comes out looking good.  Also, painting cels do take too long to make to create an animation, so we are now using<br>
programs such as Photoshop and Toonz to color the drawings. All you have to do is scan<br>
 the line art in and these programs will color them.  (it's like painting by number ^_^)<br>
Yup, animation is a long process but seing your artwork becoming alive is pretty kool! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Very few tv animation is done in the USA or in Canada. Everything is done in China now. That's kinda sad because the animation is not very good and even if there is some mistakes they won't correct it because they are payed so cheaply. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And my teachers told me that when they receive the papers and they look at the bad animated scenes they do feel sorry. They can't correct it because they're not payed to do so. It's all a matter of business.<br>
<br>
Only publicities and big movies will all be done in America, because the studios pay big bucks the get the best result. But everything else is made here: storyboard, layout,colors, background conception, charater conception, camera, exposition sheets, EVERYTHING except animation. That's a bit sad.

Depending on what they are making, tv series tend to have a very tight schedule.  So what do they do?  They use lots of shortcuts.  No more than 3 different cells for mouth movements when talking.  Lots and lots of stills and/or moving stills.  Heavily reuse of previoulsy animated segments (ie. Sailor Moon's transformations).  The animation gets better if the project is meant to be an OVA or a movie.  <br>
<br>
Lets look at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gainax</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Notorious for the techniques mentioned above especially because they have tiny animation department.  Tiny is an understatement.  Anywho, their shortcut techniques can be easily seen in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Neon Genesis Evangelion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as well as their more recent stuff.  But since a lot of people have seen NGE, I'll concentrat my analysis to that series.  <br>
<br>
To save time, they constantly reuse animated sequences that are previously reused.  You may not notice it like Sailor Moon's transformation sequence, but Gainax does it with alot of scenes BUT in small amounts.  Like in the EVA launching sequence, really short scene (about a second or two) but they reuse it alot.  They also reuse the &quot;Shinji walking home on the sidewalk&quot; sequence alot as well.  I count 12 times spanning the whole tv series.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gainax</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is also notorious for using stills or moving stills because its basically easy to film/animate and doesn't take that much time.  Problem is that they grossly over use that technique. They try to be creative, like Misato slumping over and her arm covering her mouth so they don't have to animate Misato talking.  Or using silhouettes of characters while they are talking, thus not having to animate it.  And who could forget the long still of Unit 01 holding Kaworu... FOR OVER A MINUTE!  Dramatic pause my ASS!  What's also infuriating to me is the use of text.  CONSTANT USE OF TEXT in their scenes.  You can say that they are being &quot;artistic&quot; and I can say, &quot;And monkey's might come out of my butt.&quot;  It's all about time and money, which <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gainax</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has really very little of.  I hear they are having noney problems right now, and thats not compounded by the fact they they are being investigated for not being accurate with their profits.<br>
<br>
Of course it's a different ball game when it comes to OVAs and movies.  Hardly any of the tv techniques are used... maybe the 2 - 3 cells for mouth movement.<br>

in classical animation the animators do the key frames then the in-betweeners draw the frames inbetween the key frames to make the movement and keep everything pretty close to the same...the colors are also very specific so you don't get really weird color changes and the cleanup people go in afterwards and make sure there aren't any little glitches and keep every thing the same...the animators don't even have to worry about color...just the line art...another neat thing is the sound is prerecorded and timed and put on to sheets (hard to exlplain without seeing one) then the animation comes after...Eagle can probably elaborate more...this is just stuff I learned in my english class  <p>--

Yeap, You can find pretty much everything on it:<br>
the timing of your animation, the dialogue (as he said it's prerecorded and written on the sheet) you will also find the character lips. On a model sheet you already have lip models with number (or letters) for each face. So you have a face for the &quot;a&quot;,for &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;f&quot;,&quot;m&quot;...you get the idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
You're also right for the key frames and the inbetweening. Clean-up artists will clean each frames and correct those frames if there is some small animation mistakes. So the animator's work can be a rough drawing. (meaning that the drawing isn't perfect but still clear)<br>
<br>
Colors keys are done after the character conception. Someone decides what are the best colors to use for each characters and those colors will always be the same (each color is a specific number).<br>
<br>
So you really need a lot a people to work on a tv serie. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ueaglemaina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EagleMaina</A> at: 4/14/01 6:15:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sofianime>sofianime</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/17/01 5:40:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www16.brinkster.com/sofianime/lilicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: animation..</span><hr size=1> Does anyone know how much the <br>
