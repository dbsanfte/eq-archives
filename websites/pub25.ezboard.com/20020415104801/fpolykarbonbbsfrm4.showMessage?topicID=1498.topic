It's a working combination. I don't think that violence (to the level of DBZ, Gundam or Macross) would make Pokemon any better. It would change the target audience a lot. I think Nintendo did a good job targeting Pokemon to kids. The kids will play the game and collect things for a few years until the fad dies off. Then they will find something new to play and spen d time on. Just think of how many kids were exposed to anime through Pokemon and will then look for new anime related things to fill the void after Pokemon is gone. I remember when this happened with Robotech back in the 80's. If it wasn't for Robotech, anime might not be that popular as it is now. <p>Komikino/Richman<br>"You sank my Scrabbleship!"<BR><a href=http://www.schleiferstudios.com>www.schleiferstudios.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/useikendenstsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeikenDenstsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/23/02 2:39:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1498.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://geckos1.xoasis.com/tigerman.jpg width=130 length=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: anybody knows why POKEMON is so famous?</span><hr size=1> Nintenda really took advantages of the simple minds of little children.

I loved that episode! 'First level of Chinpokoman game - bomb Pearl Harbour'<br>No, really, Pokemon is so popular with sprogs in Britain partly because it's actually the ONLY manga on British Terrestrial TV (apart from Sailor Moon, but that ended after a coupla episodes - thank god!) and because it provides a not-so-violent party-based RPG that kids can get into. Because it's a lot more simple than RPG's like AD&amp;D and Final Fantasy, and has 'cutesy' twee characters, little kids can find a game which won't risk giving them nightmares (Try showing a 3-year old the Creepers on FFVIII or the Mimic on FFIX and see what I mean) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=berserk>berserk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/28/02 8:49:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1498.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Southpark/pokemon</span><hr size=1> Why is Barney famous?<br>Whatever the children are exposed to at an early age is what they like.<br>for example, my old chemistry teacher got her children hooked on &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; <p>------------------------------------------------------------<br>I don't believe you:<br>you had the whole damn thing all wrong<br> He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1498.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1498.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1498.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1498.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1498.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1498.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1498.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4>General Manga/Anime Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
