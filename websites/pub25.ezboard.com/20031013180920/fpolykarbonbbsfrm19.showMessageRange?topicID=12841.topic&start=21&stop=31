About socialism, it may sound great in practice it has never been implemented well.  There has always been severely decreased civil rights and millions of people killed.  The Soviet Union, China, Germany (the Nazi Party was a socialist movement, &quot;Nazi&quot; was slang for national socialism), Vietnam, North Korea, and Cuba are all perfect examples.<br>
<br>
While we're on the topic of taxes let me throw my belief in.  I believe there should be a flat tax rate where everyone pays a certain percentage of their income.  While I'm not quite sure what the exact percentage should be, I'm guessing it's around 20%. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koji150>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/30/03 1:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dynamiteneon>DynamiteNeon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TBA</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/30/03 1:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mangaden.com/pics/junk/b.jpg width=75 length=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> I actually agree with koji.  I can't see why it's unfair to take the same PERCENTAGE in taxes from every person.  Sure, the rich would pay more, but they would still have more than the others in the end.<br>
<br>
The government gets too much money to begin with, and they are mismanaging it.  They need to simplify the system, but realistically, those in power like it complicated since it's easier to take your money that way.<br>
<br>
Consider all the taxes you (more likely your parents) pay right now:<br>
sales tax<br>
federal taxes<br>
state taxes<br>
taxes on all your utilities<br>
property tax<br>
<br>
and there's more, but I can't think of them all right now.  It's absurd that we're paying somewhere between 40%-50% just in taxes.  Consider the fact that the Amercan revolution way back when was partially due to stupid taxes, and it shouldn't be too surprising that we're due for an overhaul.<br>
<br>
Of course, that sort of common sense idealism hardly ever gets you anywhere in a system like our's.  I think the last person to seriously suggest a flat tax was Forbes a few years back and he was just made out to be insane by the media for even suggesting it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aisuru@polykarbonbbs>aisuru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/30/03 5:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aisuru.co.uk/saltire.jpg width=100 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> i really dont understand why many of you can not understand the distinction between socialism and communism. <br>
<br>
communism is a much more extreme version of socialism, which shares many of it's principles, but does not intrinsically mean a dictatorship or oppression. the united kingdom has had many socialist governments throughout the 20th century, and still exists because SCOIALISM works. the soviet union no longer exists because COMMUNISM is flawed. you all seem to forget that tony blair is leader of the (left of centre) labour party, though his real personal political leanings are much in debate.<br>
<br>
anyway, socialism is not the same thing as communism. germany had a social democrat government for many years, through the seventies and early eighties and look at how strong their economy is. <br>
<br>
however the national socialist party, aka the nazis, of the thirties and early forties were not really socialist. one of the first groups of people that they persecuted was the communists. not exactly left-wing that, is it? national socialism meant socialism for the caucasian prodestant germans and nobody else. the nazis were extreme right wing, socialism is left wing. try applying a little logic koji <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

on the subject of taxes, why, if taxes were voluntary until the late forties, did a number of gangsters, including al capone, get sent to prison for tax evasion? <br>

<br>
the boston tea party was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a protest about the taxes on tea. the tax on tea that was levvied on the poeple of the british colonies in the 1770s was, in fact, LESS than the tax levvied on people in britain's tea. the party-goers were in fact smugglers, who objected to the fact that british tea, officially imported from the british colonies in india, actually undercut their own tea prices. taxes were not a problem unless you were a rich land owner, who could afford it. for example, the richest man in the americas, mr. george washington. <br>

higakun, I'm not sure I follow why that's unfair.  If you have a better suggestion of how people should be taxed, I would like to hear it.  The way I see it, there's 2 general ways it could go down for a flat tax (which has always been based on income).<br>
<br>
1)  every person pays X AMOUNT.<br>
<br>
now, let's say that was $5000 per person.  Well, that means the wealthy guy with $1000000 would be paying a small amount compared to what he makes.  Ok, fine.<br>
<br>
but, what about the middle class or poor?  What if they only make about $20000 per year, which is common?  That means, they're having to pay 25% of their income every year just in taxes.<br>
<br>
A flat amount like that doesn't work and isn't fair to the poor.<br>
<br>
2) every person pays X PERCENTAGE.<br>
<br>
ok, this time let's say it's 5% of a person's income.  Now, the poor man that makes $20,000 only pays about $1000 of his income each year.  The rich guy pays about $10,000.  I don't see why this is really unfair considering the rich guy still ends up with considerably more money.<br>
<br>
The rich SHOULD pay more.  It's not punishment, it's merely the fact that taxes have always been based off income.  I also think you need to step back and consider the definition of greed since in your scenario, it's the rich that are greedy, not the poor.<br>
<br>
There are some alternatives, like the sliding scale and tax brackets, but it still requires the rich to pay slightly more than the poor.<br>
