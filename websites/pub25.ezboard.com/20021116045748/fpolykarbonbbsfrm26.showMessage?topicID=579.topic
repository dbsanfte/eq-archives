55 FICTION RULES<br>
<br>
How hard is it to write a 55-word short story? We bet you've<br>
been reading these stories and thinking to yoursel£ &quot;Hey, I can<br>
do that. Give me a pen and paper.&quot;<br>
We think you can, too, which is why we've included this handy<br>
dandy section of Official Fifty-Five Fiction Rules so you can know<br>
exactly how to go about it when the urge strikes.<br>
But be forewarned: Writing a Fifty-Five Fiction story isn't as easy<br>
as it looks.<br>
A haiku poem is short. So is a quarterback sneak. But nobody<br>
thinks they're simple to execute-it's just that the people who do them<br>
well make it seem that way<br>
Taking a great story concept and developing it within such a lim-<br>
ited space is a little like carving a beautiful sculpture from a tiny block<br>
of wood. The working range is truncated and intimate, but the goal is<br>
no different than if you were creating on a much larger scale: to per-<br>
fectly merge various elements into a coherent whole that ultimately<br>
makes people say, &quot;Wow, that's really great!&quot;<br>
But don't be discouraged by such a lofty goal. Great storytelling<br>
starts with fair storytelling and gets better with practice. Ray Bradbury<br>
once told an audience that if they wanted to learn how to write, they<br>
should compose a short story every day &quot;If you do that, &quot; he said, &quot;by the<br>
end of the year you'll have written 365 stories-and, at the very least,<br>
three or four of them are bound to be good! because it's impossible to<br>
write 365 bad stories!<br>
We've often thought about that when judging our Fifty-Five<br>
Fiction Contest each year. It's the perfect way for someone to apply<br>
Bradbury's One-Story-a-Day Theory of writing. When you've mas-<br>
tered 55 words, you can go on to 110, then 220, and so on until you've<br>
written that great novel that's been inside you, struggling to get out.<br>
But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Fifty- Five Fiction is the name<br>
of this writing game, a tiny literary genre with a proud tradition<br>
stretching back a full eight years to a time when finding good copy to<br>
fill our arts and entertainment publication, New Times, was tough to<br>
do. Out of this necessity rose Fifty- Five Fiction.<br>
The first rule we always tell Fifty-Five Fiction writers may seem<br>
obvious, but it's broken more often than you might think. We tell them<br>
to remember that we're talking about fiaion, not essays or poems or<br>
errant thoughts. A lot of people have a hard time getting that straight,<br>
no doubt because they have a hard time believing that writing some-<br>
thing so short is really possible. They usually end up with only part of a<br>
story, often with their character stranded in a situation going nowhere.<br>
<br>
So although some may have a more complex definition of just<br>
what constitutes a &quot;story;&quot; for our purposes, a story is a story only if it<br>
contains the following four elements: <br>
1) a setting<br>
2) a character or characters <br>
3) conflict<br>
4) resolution.<br>
<br>
For those who think this limiting to their creativity, consider for a<br>
moment that:<br>
.All stories have to be happening someplace, which means they<br>
have to have a setting of some kind, even if it's the other side of the uni-<br>
verse, the inner reaches of someone's mind, or just the house next door.<br>
.Characters can have infinite variations. People, animals, clouds,<br>
microbes. Anything-<br>
.By conflict, we merely mean that in the course of the stor~ some-<br>
thing has to happen. The lovers argue, The deer flees. The astronauts wait<br>
in anticipation. Even in this last example, something is happening. even<br>
though no one is moving or talking. There is conflict, which leads to:<br>
.The outcome of the story, known also as the resolution. This<br>
doesn't necessarily mean that there's a moral (&quot;Justice is its own reward,&quot;<br>
&quot;In the end, love triumphs&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or even that the conflict itself is resolved. It<br>
may or may not be.<br>
<br>
But what it does mean is that when the story ends, someone has to<br>
have learned something. Tony found out his wife wanted to kill him<br>
after all; the soldiers successfully eluded the enemy when they thought<br>
they'd been discovered; Barbara was shown to be as much of a liar as her<br>
father. It's even possible to have none of the characters learn anything.<br>
But if that's the case, then we the readers must.<br>
Consider &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; by Jeffrey Whitnmore on page 13. Be-<br>
sides having a terrific story idea, Whitmore also goes about telling it<br>
well. How he does so is worth examining.<br>
Notice how much he achieves through suggestion. We know the<br>
characters are lovers, but the author never says so. We also know there's<br>
a gun in the story, but it's never directly mentioned. In fact, Whitmore's<br>
tale is actually two stories. The second one-the other conspiracy-<br>
reveals itself in the final two words.<br>
You'll also notice that there are no descriptive adverbs or adjectives,<br>
and yet we see the entire scene perfectly. The author then stretches the<br>
form by having his story start even before his narrative begins, and end<br>
beyond his final phrase, making it seem longer than just 55 words.<br>
The main advantage to suggestion is conveying information eco-<br>
nomically-when the reader knows what you're talking about without<br>
your saying so, fewer words are needed. The disadvantage, of course, is<br>
losing sight of whether the reader is following you. Too much sug-<br>
gestion becomes obscure and confusing. That's a common error. So is<br>
trying to tell too complicated a story in such a tiny space. Fifty-Five<br>
Fiction demands a tight focus.<br>
Telling a story in a traditional narrative mode is probably the best<br>
approach for new writers, but keep in mind that Fifty- Five Fiction<br>
encourages experimentation.<br>
Can an entire story be told with every word starting with the same<br>
letter of the alphabet? Sure it can. You'll find it on page 67.<br>
<br>
How about revealing a family's ongoing woes through just an<br>
answering machine's message? Check out page 125.<br>
And on page 29, lovers meet clandestinely and discover more<br>
than they bargained for, in a tale with only one sentence using almost<br>
all nouns.<br>
Surprise endings are often found in Fifty- Five Fiction, but they're<br>
not a prerequisite for success. They probably turn up a lot because<br>
they're easy to work with, and because many writers instinctively aim<br>
for the impact of a twist at the end. H. H. Munro had similar instincts<br>
in his finely crafted mini-short stories. So did Rod Sterling and Alfred<br>
Hitchcock in their famous half-hour TV programs. Pretty good story-<br>
tellers to emulate.<br>
A few other important points to keep in mind:<br>
.You can write about anything you like, but you can't use more<br>
than 55 words. Yes, you can use fewer if you'd like to, but we don't know<br>
why anyone would-don't shortchange yourself even more than we<br>
already have.<br>
And what, exactly, is a word? Simple. If it's in the dictionary; it's<br>
a word.<br>
.Hyphenated words can't count as single words. For example,<br>
&quot;blue-green dress&quot; is three words, not two. Exceptions to this are any<br>
words that don't become two complete free-standing words when the<br>
hyphen is removed. Like &quot;re-entry.&quot;<br>
.Also, please note that your story's title isn't included in the word<br>
count. But remember that it can't be more than seven words long.<br>
.Contractions count as single words, so if you're really seeking<br>
word economy (as you should be), keep this in mind. If you write, &quot;He<br>
will jump: it's three words. But if you write, &quot;He'll jump: it's only two.<br>
Veryeconomical. By the same token, any contraction that's a shortenedform of a word is also counted as a full word. Like using&quot; 'em&quot; for &quot;them.&quot;<br>
.An initial also counts as a word (L. L. Bean, e. e. cummings, etc.)<br>
since it's basically an abbreviation of a full word. The only exception is<br>
when it's part of an acronym like MGM, NASA, or IBM. The rea-<br>
soning here is that the wide use of these acronyms has in effect made<br>
them into single words.<br>
.Remember that numbers count as words, too, expressed as either<br>
numerals (8, 28, 500, or 1984), or as words (eight, twenty-eight, etc.) But<br>
keep in mind our hyphenated-word rule. &quot;T wenty-eight&quot; is two words<br>
when written out, but only one when expressed as 28. Don't cheat your-<br>
self out of an extra word that you may need.<br>
.Any punctuation is allowed, and no punctUation marks count as<br>
words, so don't wOrty about being miserly with them if they work to<br>
some effect.<br>
There are a few clich~s we suggest you avoid. Unless you can come<br>
up with really fresh takes on these old chestnuts, stay away from stories<br>
where the reader eventUally discovers the protagonist is a cat (or some<br>
other animal); characters who appear to be having sex, but it turns out<br>
they're doing something innocent and mundane, and you just have a<br>
dirty mind; and any character who wakes up at the end and says, &quot;Gosh,<br>
it was all a dream!&quot; These go in the trash faster than the speed of light,<br>
as well they should.<br>
So now that you've digested all the rules and you're putting all<br>
those great ideas of yours on paper, what are you going to do with the<br>
best ones after you've shown them to friends who all think you're bril-<br>
liant? Good question. Here's a good answer. Send them to us so we can<br>
consider them for out next Fifty- Five Fiction book.<br>
You can submit as many stories as you want, but remember that<br>
each story must be typed on its own sheet of paper. That means one<br>
story per page.<br>

When Werling woke wondering what<br>
wife Wilma was wanting, we wondered<br>
why Werling wanted women. Werling<br>
was without wisdom. Women want<br>
