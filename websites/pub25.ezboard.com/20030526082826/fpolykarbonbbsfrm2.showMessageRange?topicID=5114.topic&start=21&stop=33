I almost knew people would take it the wrong way as soon as I posted. Maybe I should have editted.... <br>
You're totally wrong. My comment was not made to make you post art to prove that you don't suck.<br>
I should have explained myself better. I'm always interested in people's definitions of 'realism' because it always seems to differ depending on who I talk to.<br>
So far, this board by far has the most widely different views on what realism is. It really makes me interested because when people on this board discuss 'realism' I wonder whether each person is even thinking the same thing, which can also be irritating.<br>
I was trying to prove a point if it was possible. I think it would have been really interesting to have you and someone else post their idea of 'realism' and come up with two entirely different styles.... and I don't mean personal styles either. Styles that you could actually argue whether they're really realism, idealized, representional or just LIFE DRAWING perhaps.<br>
I don't think you need to prove that you don't suck, shintake. I'm not sure if I've seen your art on the board before, but I don't think I've ever associated your name with the phrase &quot;I think I'm better than him&quot; like I've done with others. Intentionally or not.<br>
So, post your art. I'd be interested in seeing it.<br>
Simply because I enjoy seeing people's different definitions of the same style.<br>
For example.... I was always told that expressionism had to have textured brushstrokes and wavy distorted forms. Not always true.... in fact.<br>
In the end, I just like finding people who disagree with MY former art teacher on the definitions of stlyle, and hopefully agree with me.<br>
That's why I didn't elaborate a whole lot on why I wanted to see 'realism'.<br>
I don't think I've ever done it on this board before.... but whenever my friends have claimed to draw realism, I've always asked to see it. Because I think it's the most widely used phrase (especially on this board) and can mean so many things.<br>
I just wanted to see what you guys meant by 'realism' is all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/17/03 6:05:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5114.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re</span><hr size=1> I think when most people say they draw &quot;realism,&quot; they really mean that they draw in a &quot;realistic&quot; style. <p><html>

Please do me the kindness of explaining your statements in the future so i don't give you a chewing.  Things are a little stressful at home at the moment, so I am sorry for flying off at you.<br>
<br>
Realism, as i have perceived from others talking here, is life drawing.  Obviously from retro's fine example it is not limited to such, but i maintain that if you can put what you see on paper with a decent degree of similarity, you will be successful be it comic or realism.  I am 27 years old...i have seen many sides of drawing, and realized many things about it.  Im not wise, mind you (too young for that), but it has been my experience that the mode i enter to draw a comic is the same mode i enter to draw a real, live person.  You simply have to be in the mode of drawing what you see.  Your hand isn't picky over wether you draw comics or realism, it just draws what you tell it to.  So if i look at a person and tell it 'draw that', it will.  If i look at a comic book character and say 'draw that', it will do that too, and with the same degree of ability that i drew the real person with.<br>
Maybe I'm the exception to your rule, but i never really focused on realism, and im comfortable with my own ability with the pencil.<br>
<br>
And btw, the reason i don't say im better than anyone else on this board is because every one of you does SOMETHING better than i...and honor demands that you respect those abilities that you do not have.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kennygeeze>Kenny Geeze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/17/03 6:32:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5114.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lespaul.com/menu1/deluxe.jpg width=080 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Hurray!

I don't think that they're saying you can't draw what you observe, just that your knowledge of anatomy and proportions won't be as acurate as it would be if you had learned from life. When you take the majority of your learning from stylized works, you're not getting the whole picture. You're learning the decisions that artist has decided to make, and it severely limits the choices you can make because you don't know how it really looks. I don't think anyone is claiming you've learned nothing, or that you can't get fairly proficient at what you're doing, just that you could learn so much more if you would also take the time to learn the fundamentals by direct observation. <p><html>

If I read THAt much into what they say, then Im not really agreeing with their opinions, im crafting it to be what i can IMAGINE they mean.  Anyone that wants to make a solid point, especially one that can potentially be this controversial should place some backup facts/explanation or those that they are speaking to will not understand what they are getting at--and people like me that agree to disagree will find no obvious basis for their argument and pipe in.  Much like i have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  People that make a statement to the effect of 'draw realism first or you will suck' needs to back the statement up or elaborate.  The reason i spoke up was because they didnt do that.<br>
<br>
On the context of your statement i agree...you cannot know musculature or anatomy properly unless you draw or study what it really is.  However, I also tend to disagree that you can 'screw yourself artistically', because even after having drawn for 23 years(17 if you subtract the recent 6 in which i didnt) i can STILL go look at an anatomy book if i need to get a muscle set right. It's just a matter of being more resourceful, but you don't have to MEMORIZE the human anatomy to draw it, just have a resource handy.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not concerned wether they think i've learned less than they--im not insecure about my art.  I just raise the point simply because i don't like to see people discouraged by others' claims that they may have started out wrong or that if they dont learn the human body they'll never succeed at drawing it.  I don't know about anyone else, but i am here for honest crits and encouragement, and that it what i offer in return.  Im pretty sure nobody wants to hear cynicism, sarcasm, or cruel bluntness, they are here to get better.  I mean i am way out of your age group and i come here to get crits.....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=funkenstein@polykarbonbbs>Funkenstein</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://freespace.virgin.net/aggs.art/blambotfunk.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/18/03 10:30:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5114.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://freespace.virgin.net/aggs.art/funk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I see.</span><hr size=1> Actually you did mention Jim Lee in your first post, and Jim Davis later, but that's just being pedantic.<br>
  I do see your point, and I'm not saying that you'll never be a good and employable comics artist. I just believe that comic language, styles and soforth are something which should be built on top of observation. I don't believe you can &quot;screw yourself artistically&quot; by drawing only comics, only that you'd be better if you'd learnt from life. My &quot;backup&quot; for this argument is that I have never met a proffessional comics artist or illustrator anywhere who has shared your view. Sorry. I would actually be very interested to see some of your recent drawings. Not it a spiteful way, I assure you, I'm just interested. As you said, it's not worth arguing over. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Go to a park or coffee shop with a sketch book.  Start drawing people.  The typical person, even when sitting, moves around a lot.  You never have time to focus on details and not only are you learning anatomy (and on top of that, all sorts of body shapes, unlike most of the shapely figures you draw in a typical life drawing class at school), but you're learning to draw quickly and accurately.<br>
<br>
It's EXTREMELY frustrating to begin with, but as you become accustomed to it, you can really learn a lot.  And you learn to draw quickly, which is a notorious complaint by employers about most artists. <p>I know it's asking for a lot, but please try to think before posting.<br>
