I wrote that at three in the morining and I'm apparently a diffrent person at three in the morning, some type of &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot;.  I was just sick of all the little newbies drawing nothing but nude chicks when you can draw something else. And yes I know about the warning system there, but it is not nudity that bothers me its the reasons people draw it.  Be lenient with your drawing of human anatomy it would be a better world not to give kids the option of looking it up.  And what CVO said about the &quot;draw a nude body first and sketch the clothes over,&quot; Is what I was talking about in my first explanation in which I wrote something to explain why it was better to draw clothes cause you already know how to draw someone in the nude.  Personaly, Alucard, I have seen your work and Definately do NOT consider your art under the catagory in question. You have done some damn good drawings and you by far are permited to draw nudity in my belief on the matter.<br>
        I really have lost things to say on the matter the fact of the matter is I was going to edit my original post and say disregard.  But I stand with my belief still.<br>
One more thing, I do go to the nudity posts (usually not the ones lable &quot;Babe&quot; &quot;Hot&quot; or &quot;Busty&quot;) But for the Critiqing,which some deserve and others do not.<br>

*edit* If nudity is natural, Then why do wemon wear bras to position their breasts to prevent them from drooping in a disgustion manner that happens to most nude african tribes. If you really wanted to see natural you would be in a 3rd world country.  I should not have written that, But its the way I feel on the matter. *Edit* <br>
<br>
*re-edit* I'm writing at you guys as though you are wrong, I'm sorry, I'm dropping the subject here unless you wish to keep the discussion going its your call,  guess its not up to me to decide so I have no option in the matter.*re-edit* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/urogueyun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rogue Yun</A> at: 12/16/01 9:10:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/16/01 11:46:30 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is it really?</span><hr size=1> I get what you mean by that. I know some people aren't doing it for learning purposes, they're doing it to get attention. I still don't think it's necessarily wrong to draw pictures like that, but I can understand getting sick of seeing them all over the place. <br>
<br>
Now on the other subject, about it being natural. Nudity is natural, bras are not. I'm not saying I'm 100% comfortable with nudity and would walk down the street naked if I could, I'm just saying that there's nothing wrong with nudity, and the only reason it's shameful is because we've grown so accustomed to our clothes. I'm not saying that clothing is bad either, just that we take it for granted when it's really just glorified protection from the elements that we've come to rely on. A lot of tribal cultures don't have that, and good for them, but no, that doesn't mean I want to go live there just to see some free range boobs :P <p><table width=100% border=0>

I didn't bother to read what you wrote except to see that you think nudity is an issue.<br>
<br>
I believe I opened this up for discussion in the Member's Lounge and I believe that there was input on both sides of the issue.<br>
<br>
Nudity has always been a part of art.  Look back to the ancient Greeks and you will see that nudity was rather common place in art.  Look to all the ancient cultures and you will see that it has always been there.  We are ALL born nude and the human body is a beautiful thing.  <br>
<br>
Sure, some people only draw the human body as an object of eroticism, but others still draw the body as a matter of fact and there is much to learn from drawing the human body.<br>
<br>
No matter how we each feel as individuals, there will always be places that allow nudity and places that do not allow nudity.  I do not see a point in fighting agains the nudity that I do not like or trying to force everyone to accept nudity just because I don't (in general) have an issue with it.<br>
<br>
As far as this board in particular goes, there are rules in place and those rules provide for a warning so that those offended or just not interested in seeing nudity are not exposed.  I don't think you could ask for a better system to be in place.  For those people who continue to take issue with the nudity that is allowed on this board, I can only suggest that maybe they just not utilize the forums here.  <br>
<br>
If I got away from whatever point you were trying to make I apologize.  Again, this topic was open for discussion in the Members Lounge and I am the one who started the discussion.<br>
<br>
Oh ... on the matter of women wearing bras (which I just spotted as I was about to post this) ... our society pretty much dictates what is and isn't decent and ... in case you haven't noticed many women do NOT wear bras as it's becoming less and less an issue.  I'm not going to try an explain how the social structure works ... as it would get too far off the topic of art. <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

1st.  Thanks Alucard for support and understanding (I really shouldn't have said what I did, I am truly sorry), and I am seeing your view clearly.<br>
<br>
2nd.  Thanks Stinky for your support as well, And the blunt comment that made me laugh a little.<br>
<br>
3rd.  Thanks for writing an intriguing opinion.  I can see where you are coming from Anyte.  But it is also true that women... And don't take this as an insult (I don't know why you would)... where treated EXTREMELY poorly in the Greek and Roman times, in fact most women of the past did not have much choice in society, and many (if not all) were not artists... Already you can see the &quot;Man's&quot; influence.  Also, I'm sorry I was not there for your post, just consider this one my trip into the subject. Last of all I am not for complete banning of Nudity just stricter regulations over what the newbies draw, and I request that you read what I had to say on the matter, because you seem to be missing my point (tell you honestly you can kinda' disregard my point entirely cause its not quite yet decided).<br>
<br>
Rogue Yun<br>
<br>
Also I have a tendency to speak my mind and usually offend people that is why I keep saying &quot;I'm sorry&quot; or &quot;Forgive me&quot; or &quot;Don't take this wrong&quot; In general I'm actually trying to keep a good mood.<br>

<br>
Let me say this.  Take another look at ancient art and you will see that a large percentage of it is MALE nudes.  This isn't about sexism ... it's about nudity in art and nudity in art has ALWAYS been there.  Female nudity is more predominant in art today than it was in ancient cultures.  I draw both male and female nudes, though I don't share them.  And ... in case you haven't guessed (some people don't make the connection between the avatar, the name, and myself) I am female.<br>
<br>
I do not like the blatant eroticism in the art that is posted on this board at times, but to deny those who see nude art as eroticism would be to deny the serious artists who see nudity as purely art.   <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

I don't think I can make clear my position on eroticism in art.  I've seen the works of Boris Vallejo and others like him and am not bothered by the work at all.  I rather like Vallejo's work.  I'm not necessarily bothered by eroticism in cartoons either.  I think it's more the ill proportioned, in your face, look at my HUGE breasts, see my behind as I spread my legs or bend over type of art that gets to me.  Hmm ... I guess it just boils down to what I think is tacky and what is not.  I think Boris Vallejo does some very nice work and I don't think the way he depicts women is degrading, while I have seen many drawings on this board of females with breasts that are seriously the size of their head, and again with the tacky cropped tops and the short short skirts.  Again, it's all about the artists intent.  (and i only pick on the artists here because it's the work i'm most familiar with that i don't like - i don't see a lot of stuff out there like that) <p><br><br><p align=center><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN"><font color=red><b><i>Read my profile </b></a><font size=1>and find out what kind of top secret stuff I've been up to.

<br>
I have nothing against nudity in art. I just find it a fine line to walk when trying to moderate it. You always get immature guys that want to draw bent over chicks and pole dancer stuff and they claim it as &quot;art&quot; but if someone posts a guy bent over or messing with his &quot;junk&quot;, then they are the first to run screaming out of the room. I have to keep the board an even playing field for all sexes so I try to have nudity limited to partial and non-erotic. <br>
<br>
it can be sexy...but not overtly sexual. See what I mean? fine lines. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/01 10:03:25 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/anyte/photos/bsnap7.jpg width=120 length=102></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is it really?</span><hr size=1> I know what you mean.
