---------<br>
I'm in a new building today, a new room with two windows, windows.. New windows with clean bars on them. The sills are big enough for me to sit on. There is a mirror, and a table, and a bed. Today, I sat at the table and drew pictures. Doctor Williams brought me food and said a psychiatrist was coming to see me. I ate the brownie, the rest was nothing, nothing at all. After that, I sat on the edge of my bed and looked out the window, the door opened behind me, and a bird passed by the window. A urgent voice said something.<br>
<br>
&quot;Courtney?&quot;<br>
<br>
I smiled to myself, because Courtney was a good name. &quot;Courtney, I'm Ethan Gray, I have to speak to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wanted to see him, so I turned around on my bed and looked. <br>
<br>
&quot;E-than, Gray. What are those in your hand?&quot; He had a bunch of papers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, these are from of my other younger patients.&quot; I turned back around and looked out the window. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look at this one.&quot; I sighed and grabbed the paper, it was a drawing, mountains and trees and animals. I turned again,<br>
<br>
&quot;Ethan Gray, hah!&quot; I said, with satisfaction, and threw the paper to the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Courtney, I brought a few other things...&quot; He layed a Snickers Bar down on the bed in front of her, &quot;Chocolate...&quot; He layed the rest of the drawings and a few other things on the bed. I threw them off of the bed, except for a drawing of two cars driving next to each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who...drew this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Uh, twelve year old, Jimmy Smith.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ethan Gray....Get out of here.&quot; I didn't like that drawing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't, Courtney, we have to talk.&quot; <br>
<br>
I took the chocolate bar and climbed up on the window sill. I liked the song I was thinking of, so I sung it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hush...little baby...mockingbird.&quot;<br>
<br>
She had forgotten most of the words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Courtney, you've been in and out of these insitutions for 9 years, and you don't seem like you need all these locks on the doors...What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ethan Gray! Leave, LEAVE! Ethan Gray. LEAVE, LEAVE LEAVE, GET OUT, LEAVE, OUT, OUT, LEAVE!&quot; I threw the Snickers bar at the ground, thankfully, he left.<br>
<br>
September the next day 2002<br>
<br>
I must have fallen asleep on the ground. I saw the chocolate when I woke up, and ate it. I sat on the other sill and sang another song I'd heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;You give your hand to me...then you say.....he...llo&quot; I itched my finger on the bar and laughed. The door opened again, and I hid my face<br>
<br>
&quot;Courtney, it's me, again. Doctor Gray.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Liar. ****ing liar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon me?&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't like the drawing of the cars. &quot;Well, Courtney. I have a family at home.&quot; Family, ahh, I peeled a peice off of the tile on the sill.<br>
<br>
&quot;A wife, and two children...Two daughters.&quot; Two daughters, that was funny.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are the names?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Sarah and Cassandra.&quot; I rolled my eyes, and climbed off of the window sill. &quot;Sarah is nine, and Cassie is fourteen...Say, Courtney, have you ever heard of an ink blot test?&quot;<br>
<br>
I stepped over to the mirror, and tapped it,<br>
<br>
&quot;They watch me through this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that's right, it's bec-<br>
<br>
&quot;It's because they want me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; I giggled, and looked at him through the mirror, &quot;You do too, I saw you looking...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Courtney, these little gam-&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Games, no...Not games!&quot; I hit the mirror, leaving fingerprints, &quot;So, Ethan Gray, I don't think I like you, and I don't like the doctors that watch me through here.&quot; I hit it again, growled at my reflection, &quot;Not at all, not one BIT!&quot; I hit the reflection again, with both hands, again, again, and again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you stop it!?&quot; The good doctor said. I did, and turned to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;No help,&quot; I said, reassuringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm paid to do this, Courtney. It's my jo-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is she now? Cassie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha? She's....She's at home, watching the news. Now, I am going to show you a picture, and you tell me what you see.&quot; He held up one of those ink blots.<br>
<br>
&quot;Four.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The number?&quot; I didn't answer, just waited. He pulled up another one.<br>
<br>
&quot;A dollar.&quot; He sighed, another one.<br>
<br>
&quot;A butterfly,&quot; another.<br>
<br>
&quot;A doll.&quot; another<br>
<br>
&quot;.....A car......&quot; My eyes....They were filling up, with cry.<br>
<br>

Definately post some more I want to see how it turns out!<br>
<br>
The only advice I would have is that you get somewhere fairly soon, if it kept going like that I think my questions would've gotten too big and i would've given up.  But  maybe you are getting somewhere right now, so thats a pointless critique anyways...<br>
<br>
Really liked it!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lakeoffire>Lake of Fire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/22/02 4:47:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> <br>
&quot;Courtney?&quot;<br>
<br>
I stared blankly at the shape, a hot tear ran down my cheek. All was very quiet for several moments. &quot;Courtney, you have to tell me, in detail, what happened nine years ago, with your parents.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, can't do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay...Here.&quot; He reached in his bag, and put a peice of white paper and a pen on the table. He slid them over to my side of the table. Drawing?<br>
<br>
&quot;Write it down.&quot; I stared at the sheet of paper. Gray added, &quot;Write down what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll fly...fly fly fly, fly, fly fly...Fly, away...away..aw...ay.. I can't tell you, it's a secret.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who killed them, Courtney?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Never.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Was it someone you knew?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did your parents know them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Were they wearing masks?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; Were they driving cars?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dunno.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me who they were.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHO WERE THEY!?&quot; Gray said in a horrible, disgusting tone. The next thing I knew, the pen was broken, and I was sitting on the table on my knees. I grabbed his neck with my hands and leaned forward. It caused his chair to fall backwards. I felt the power, I was on top now, I could scream and scratch, scratch scratch! &quot;You...You leave...You leave them alone...LEAVE THEM ALONE!&quot; I screamed and closed my eyes and clawed. Suddenly, I felt huge arms and hands grabbing me. Holding me, pulling me away. I kicked and screamed, and fought their rugged tools. It was only seconds before their sweaty, huge, masturbating paws were holding me down, and sticking a needle in my arm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uinspiredelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inspired Elf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/3/02 4:21:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> I'm new to EZ board and I just read this story.
