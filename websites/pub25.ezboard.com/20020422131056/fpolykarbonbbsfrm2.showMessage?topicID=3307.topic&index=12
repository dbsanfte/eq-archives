Being vector-based it can give you certain advantages:<br>
<br>
* The drawing tools are more &quot;forgiving&quot; than in regular bitmap programs such as Photoshop - you can set Flash up so that when you draw a line, it's automatically &quot;smoothed&quot; slightly (not the same as anti-aliasing as shown in the image posted by SpikesCafe, although Flash also automatically anti-aliases everything). The result is a nicer, &quot;steadier&quot; line<br>
<br>
* Because Flash is vector-based, anything you draw can be freely re-sized and moved around. For example, if a character's head in your sketch ended up being slightly too small, you can easily &quot;lasso&quot; it and re-size it with absolutely NO loss of quality. With bitmap programs the resized lineart becomes fuzzy, not so with vector art. And if by the time the sketch is finished you feel like printing it out on a large paper, it's no problem at all. You simply export an image in the size you want, with the DPI resolution you want, and have it printed (although I believe there is an unfortunate limit of 8000x8000 pixels for the export images). If you had drawn the image in a bitmap program, you'd be banging your head to the wall because there's simply no way you're going to have a 800x600 pixel image at 72 DPI printed on a big paper without some serious fuzz (this, of course, assuming that you never &quot;thought&quot; you'd need to print it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
* Yet again because Flash is a vector program, you can easily &quot;tweak&quot; your sketch once it's done. Although Flash can automatically &quot;steady&quot; your lineart as you draw it, the lines might still feature small &quot;squiggles&quot; here and there. Instead of re-drawing them, you can select a line containing squiggles (with the lasso tool), and then simply apply the &quot;Smooth&quot; action on it. The more you apply it, the smoother the line will become<br>
<br>
* And naturally Flash supports pen pressure and layers, although these don't really set it apart from other programs such as Photoshop and Painter (which also support pen pressure, and atleast Photoshop supports layers)<br>
<br>
In the end, even Flash isn't the be-all program for an artist. Due to it's vector nature it's not the best program for shading and coloring your drawings, although this once again depends on what kind of style you're after. For simple-ish comicbook art and anime style (and I don't mean that comicbook art and anime are simple to do - they do require talent) it's ok, but for art-type projects the limitations of vector art become clear. Although with some clever &quot;zoning&quot; you can shade an image (like this unfinished older picture of mine - the only one I've even tried to shade to this level in Flash : <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.saunalahti.fi/~jspuonti/wildwest.jpg">www.saunalahti.fi/~jspuonti/wildwest.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ), you're going to miss Photoshop's airbrush and eraser tools which give you the ability to apply &quot;softness&quot; to your image.<br>
<br>
What I usually do myself is use Flash the way I used to use pen and paper - I sketch an image with it, clean up the lines where required, and then export it in a large resolution (thousands of pixels) for further coloring and shading in Photoshop.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujspuonti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JSPuonti</A> at: 4/6/02 10:10:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uddrmaniax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ddrmaniax</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://markara.freeservers.com/icon-Rina.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/6/02 3:19:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3307.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://markara.freeservers.com/icon-Rina.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Completely Digital Process vs Traditional</span><hr size=1> i have flash but rarely use it....cuz i [for some reason] hate the small working space...its like 4 inches of space ...well i dont use it much....so im not sure how to work it to make it bigger...<br>

I can perfectly understand that the &quot;clean cut&quot; look might not be what some artists want, and it's true that compared to a pen and paper sketch, Flash drawings (atleast mine) tend to have a lot less &quot;life&quot; in them. That's why I pointed out that Flash really fits only certain styles.<br>
<br>
But as for having only &quot;4 inches or so of drawing space&quot;, that has to be some kind of misunderstanding <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Because Flash is vector based, you don't necessarely have to draw in the &quot;100%&quot; -view. You can zoom in to, say, 400% and have a whole lot more drawing space. In the end it really doesn't matter at what &quot;size&quot; you draw in Flash, because it's all vector data and you can freely resize it to your liking. If you tried to do this in Photoshop - zooming to 400% - you'd be drawing with individual pixels. In Flash, this doesn't happen. Flash doesn't &quot;see&quot; things as pixels. It sees things as &quot;points&quot; and &quot;lines&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I  haven't tried Painter myself, but apparently I need to give it a spin. Need to find out if there's a demo version of it available. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwhitemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WhiteMage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/6/02 11:35:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3307.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sphosting.com/darkhalo/GIR4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Completely Digital Process vs Traditional</span><hr size=1> I don't have access to a scanner when I'm here at school (left my scanner at home due to space restrictions) so I do all of my sketching directly into the computer.<br>
<br>
I start out with a really rough sketch, then I start cleaning by putting a new layer on top of the sketch and refining the sketch.  By the time I'm satisfied, I may have 4 or 5 layers of just sketch.  When I'm happy, I delete or just hide the bottom sketchy layers and start inking in a fresh layer.  I use a hard-edged brush or pencil tool and get all of my heavy lines first, then turn off pressure sensitivity and start to tighten up the inks with my brush set between 1 and 3 pixels and by using the eraser to carve off any excess and to shape my lines.<br>
<br>
With practice, it doesn't take *that* long to ink digitally...I'd say my last pic took maybe 6 hours total, and that includes the sketch, the inking, and then all of the cleaning and tweaking.  Plus it winds up looking a lot cleaner than what *I* would produce using traditional inking methods...I'm not that great with a pen. =P <p><font size="1">----------

I'm not sure what you mean with &quot;no line variation&quot; [in Flash]. Flash does support pen pressure (with Wacom tablets anyway - are there others?), so you do atleast get different line widths. If you're referring to having different kind of &quot;pen tips&quot;, then sure, it's a bit limited there. You only have circle, square, horizontal oval, vertical oval, horizontal rectangle, vertical rectangle and three different types of bottom left-top right slashes and can't load your own brushes.<br>
<br>
As for saving PSD files.. that's sort of given <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm glad it exports PNG though, as that's all you really need if you're doing lineart in Flash <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=3307.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=3307.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3307.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=3307.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.threadControl?topicID=3307.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3307.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3307.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2>Photoshop and Art questions</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
