Da Vinci worked on the Mona Lisa till the day he died if you didnt know. The original had two columns but Da Vinci didn't like them so he cut them off,  And it is also unclear if he did the whole background. ALSO he did use revolutionary techniques (Chiaroscuro, Sfumato) so don't even start saying it was just a portrait, Of COURSE portraits were around long before than, but if you look at them the backgrounds were never as extravagant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rocketpig>Rocketpig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/02 4:08:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11559.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rocketpig.net/images/Click-Icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: gay movie makers</span><hr size=1> I had completely missed the line saying &quot;the Mona Lisa wasn't that creative&quot;.<br>

Okay, so let me get this right:<br>
<br>
The Mona Lisa wasn't creative, Citizen Kane wasn't creative; what exactly do you consider &quot;creative&quot;?  Because at this rate, you're knocking some of the most impressive and influential pieces of their respective mediums.<br>
<br>
Next, are you going to tell me that Beethoven wasn't very creative when he wrote his 5th and 6th symphonies as complements to each other?  Or are you going to tell me that he is overrated, too?<br>

It's very hard to appreciate something that is not of your era (take clothing in the past for example, it seems to look silly now)...But at the time, those things were cutting edge. I remember during film production class a lot of people were bored while watching that movie. Most of them were expecting the violence, the explosions and action that we've grown up on. *shrug* I like it, and i really don't care that my mates think i'm weird because i liked it. <br>

My vote for worst movie, as always goes to Crouching Tiger.

As for what I do consider innovative and original, bands like Throbbing Gristle, who are probably the most influensial, innovative and original band in 50 years. Art-wise, things like Dali, Kandinsky and Alex Grey. Bookwise things like Chuck Palahnuik, Nietzsche, Kirkagarrd.  <p>Alone and Empty.<br>

I'm with you on that one. I wasn't bagging him out, i was pointing out that he's making more money than most people will see in their lives. I don't really care if other people don't like it (yeesh, you think people you've known for 18 years could get over the fact that you like manson), i think he's creative. Most people just can't get past some of his lyrics or the stuff he does for publicity.....for his act.. <br>
<br>
As for arguements/discussions....both parties usually walk off thinking they are right because that's what they believe. I wouldn't say it doesn't solve anything, it does get you to look at it from a different perspective....Unless one or both people are arrogant and deject anything but their own biased view.

I agree, a natural transition and not sure why the hell that's considered hilarious. Music is for everyone though, goth or not. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't consider myself gothic (although i've always been interested in things considered gothic) and i like it...<br>

We can have Bush as Palpatine, Kofi Annan as the Republic Chancellor, and Saddam Hussein as that whiny leader of the Trade Federation.  I leave it to you to decide who the good guys should be.<br>
<br>
As for worst movies watched: I'd have to rate Wing Commander as among the worst I watched.  Not only did it not follow the story in the game it was based on, it also violated the Negative Impossibility rule of science fiction:<br>
<br>
[i]If it does not contradict KNOWN science then it's fair game. [/i]  <br>
<br>
WC abused the laws of physics in soooo many ways.  Quasars inside galaxies?  Humans that can get a &quot;feel&quot; for hyperspace jumps?  Wreckage FALLING when it's pushed off a spaceship?  Oh, please...<br>
<br>
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within makes the grade as the second-worst I've seen - it's saved from being the worst by virtue of the superb graphics and fair-or-good voice acting by Ming Na, Donald Sutherland, James Woods, and Alec Baldwin.  I realize it's supposed to be a &quot;fantasy&quot;, but it has all the trappings of an SF film, and thus I judge it as such.  FF:tSW once more violates the Negative Impossibility law on at least 2 occasions:<br>
<br>
1. The Spirit Wave effect.  This is based on a simple law in wave mechanics: superimpose two equal and opposite waves on each other and they cancel each other out.  The trouble is when the Spirit Wave is finally generated, it lacks one thing necessary to cancel out the massive Phantom presence: amplitude (i.e. strength).  They got the opposite part right, just not the equal; hook that Spirit Wave up to a huge amplifier, Dr. Sid...  <br>
<br>
2. Destruction of the Zeus Cannon (or: oops!  We're in orbit!)  This is simple Newtonian mechanics here... we see fragments of the Zeus Cannon (including that large sphere which did in the General) falling towards the Earth... forgetting the fact that if the cannon was to explode in reality, those fragments would remain in orbit.<br>
<br>
There are other spots, but these two are the biggest reasons why I failed to like FF.<br>

But ohh well, it didn't really play attentiosn to that part, I was clipping my finger nails.<br>
<br>
I jsut watched it for the part where the Phantoms are rampaging through New New York.<br>
<br>
Worst movie would be probably...  Hmmmm....  Mummy Returns for accuracy, I mean it contradicts the whole first one.<br>
<br>
That or...  Tremors 3(I mean... it was a crappy sequel to the sequel, I mean the second one was actually good, the only scene I liked in Tremors 3 was Bert's house getting blown up and the irony behind it), most Sci Fi original pictures(excluding those rare good ones like Dog Soldiers), TBS original pictures(One quote: &quot;It's a NUCLEAR TORNADO!!!!&quot;).<br>

The worst FMV I've ever seen is the uncut Resident Evil Original Intro.<br>
