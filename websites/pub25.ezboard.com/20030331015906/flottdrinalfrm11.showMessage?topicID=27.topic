I think it deserves an epic telling from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Part I &quot;The Quest&quot;<br>
<br>
I decided that I had come of the age to stop wandering aimlessly, killing Sarnaks and Cockatrice' in The Overthere and put some direction in my life as a Paladin and follower of Brell Serrilis. After much research in the hallowed and gigantic library of Allakhazam, renowned collector of facts, history, and personal accounts of previous quests, I decided to find the legendary Paladin single handed sword &quot;Ghoulbane&quot;. I found the personal account of a Paladin who had made the same quest many seasons prior and wrote down the names and locations of the people I needed to talk to who could provide me with the details of how to go about obtaining this weapon. I thanked the Librarian and made sure my dues were paid in full (you should too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), and headed for the EQAtlas mapshop, run by Muse, a renowned and respected adventurer and cartographer. I picked up copies of the maps I would need for my journeys, again made sure my dues were paid in full, and having had a full day, made camp, determined to start early the next day.<br>
<br>
The next morning, I broke my camp in the halls of the Nexus, on the moon of Luclin. I tossed back a skin of milk (It does a body good), choked down an Iron Ration and headed to the Antonica Scion, to be transported to the wizard spires in the Eastern Plains of Karana where my first contact, Ryshon Hunsti, would start me on my quest. I spoke with Ryshon for a surprisingly short time where, upon determining that I was seeking enlightenment in my life, he spoke of a sword with a special power, a &quot;Sword of Nobility&quot;. I informed him that this was the very same sword that I was seeking, whereupon he gave me a sealed note to take to one Kanthuk Ogrebane in the land of my birth, the Butcher Block Mountains. This old dwarf I remember seeing in my youth, standing on the shore near the docks, gazing out to sea, not speaking to anyone unless he wished to. <br>
<br>
Thankful for the recent discovery of the opening to the moon, and the wizard transportation system setup therein, I ran back east across the beach to the wizard spires and headed back to the Nexus. From there, on to the Faydwer Scion, to be ported to the wizard spires in the permanently gloomy and overcast Greater Faydark woods. I ran across the wilds of Faydwer, ignoring the pesky Orc pawns and centurions, who also carefully ignored this sharply dressed Dwarf Paladin in Blackened Alloy armor, wielding a nasty looking Blackened Alloy Longsword (known for its light weight and exceptional handling qualities), and Shiny Brass Shield. I entered the lands of my birth, the Butcher Block Mountains and made a bee-line for the docks. <br>
<br>
I headed to an area of beach to the north of the sturdy walls surrounding the docks, located Kanthuk, hailed him, and handed him the note from Ryshon. He instantly perked up, saw that I was a bit tired from my long travels, and bade me to sit on the beach while he told me a tale about a true friend of his Amstaf Trunolis and a woman he fell in love with, Ambreen. It was a heartfelt tale that spoke of battles, courage, love, and the harsh winter weather of Everfrost he endured, and almost died in. Amstaf saved his life during a particularly brutal storm and suffered greatly, Ambreen was also caught up in the snow, and perished. Amstaf dragged him to an abandoned cabin and, in a vision, left him forever that night, escorted by the spirits. All he had left was Amstaf's pendant. <br>
<br>
He then told me to go to find Llara, a childhood friend of Amstaf's and give the pendant to her, it seems she had a vision that same night and he thought she could clear things up.  Llara it seems, was located in the broken landscape of Dagnor's Cauldron, outside the entrance to the Estate of Unrest. By this time, I was getting hungry for some real food, and my newly acquired taste for alcohol, so I headed to the city where I grew up. Kaladim. Not much needs to be said about this fortress carved in the living rock of the Butcher Block Mountains. It is a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of the Dwarven people. I stopped by the bank, picked up some spending Plat, headed to an inn I had not visited before, and grabbed some muffins and a short beer.<br>
<br>
I headed back to Faydwer to ask the resident druids if I could pay for a Spirit of the Wolf for my long and dangerous journey through Dagnor's Cauldron. Having successfully obtained a SoW, I headed back toward the BB's and plotted the best route through the unforgiving landscape that is Dagnor's Cauldron. Running toward the entrance to BB, I shot passed a vaguely familiar face, but at my enhanced speed, I did not recognize her. Suddenly I heard a shout, &quot;Radnor!&quot;<br>
Putting on the brakes, and digging the heels of my blackened iron boots into the soft earth of the Faydark forest I ground to a halt and turned around to see none other than Lissi, a druid from my guild, laughing heartily. She told me she saw me running and was going to give me a SoW, but determined, by the blurring speed my legs were churning that I already had one. I explained I was off to talk with a lady in Dagnor's Cauldron, so she cast levitation upon me, refreshed my SoW, and wished me a safe journey. I thanked Lissi Heartily, and shot through the pass into BB, I headed Southwest to the opening in the mountains that led to DC. <br>
<br>
I navigated my way through the twists and turns in the mountains and emerged on a landscape I had never seen before, momentarily forgetting my destination, I gazed at a land twisted and tortured by some unknown power, a lake glistening in the distance. Shaking my head and remembering my goal, I referred to my maps and notes and headed for the western shore, following this, I traveled unmolested at a safe height, thanks to the lev provided by Lissi, over the heads of confused aqua goblins and made short time of the trip to the entrance to Unrest. There, I spotted Llara standing on a rock. I glided up to her, and bobbing slightly in the light breeze, I handed her the pendant and when she asked me where I had gotten it, I told her from Kanthuk. She told me she grew up with Amstaf and learned of his ability to dismiss undead creatures with seemingly little effort. She told me about her vision the night of the snowstorm, and that she had seen desperation in his face, something she had never seen before. She searched for others who might be able to tell her more about her vision of Amstaf and the snowstorm. She met a woman named Walnan in the Dwarven hunting grounds, and after rambling for a bit, she told Llara to seek out Ruathey in Lavastorm, who is known to be able to look into people's souls and find truth. Llara gave me a note to give to Ruathey and sent me on my way. Not wanting to sit and dwell on how I would get to Lavastorm, and possibly have my levitate wear off, I bid Llara farewell and headed back for the comfort of BB to figure out my next step. <br>
<br>
I was none too late, because just as I was entering the passage to BB, I felt my lev starting to wear off, I dove for the bottom of the ravine and only a few feet above the earth, with a slight pop, landed safely on solid ground. Upon entering BB I made contact with Lissi to let her know that her Levitate was much appreciated and made my perilous journey almost pleasant.<br>
<br>
Sitting down and perusing my maps while chewing idly on an iron ration, I tried to determine my best method of reaching Lavastorm. I decided to turn to my guild, having run out of ideas on my own, and was able to make contact with my good friend, a particularly cute (and now married) Halfling Druid, Racle. She graciously offered to gate me from the druid rings at BB to Lavastorm. Gathering my belongings and making sure I picked up my ration wrappings (Leave No Trace), I headed straight to the druid rings. There I met with Racle and Ceelia, a stunningly beautiful High Elf cleric I met in the wilds of Kunark, near the Lake of Ill Omen, and who now never seems to leave Racle's side. Greetings were made all around and we were off on an instant journey across the Ocean of tears to the Lavastorm mountains and deposited at the druid ring therein. Now being a dwarf, and knowing a bit about mountains, I thought I could not see any land as tortured as Dagnor's Cauldron. <br>
<br>
I was wrong.<br>
<br>
I had never actually seen a live lava field before, only read about in books and heard in stories growing up. I was unprepared for the sheer immensity of it all. That and the fact that the druid rings were literally swamped with adventurers apparently preparing to do battle with a dragon named Nagafen. It took me a few moments to locate Racle and Ceelia in the crowd. Racle seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, so with a momentary browse through her well worn spell book, she cast SoW and Levitate on me and bid me well. <br>
<br>
I worked my way to the edge of the ledge that the druid ring was perched on and gazed out across the terrain. Fountains of lava belched into the sky, and heat waves distorted the air. I felt my heart speed up a bit as I referred to my maps and plotted a course to the location where I had heard I could find Ruathey. Putting my maps away, and tightening the straps on my 5 backpacks and portable spit, I took a deep breath and headed across the fiery landscape.<br>
<br>
I found Ruathey just where I hoped I would. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I gave her the note from Llara. Not wasting any time, she immediately asked if I was seeking the holy sword that Amstaf wielded. Somewhat taken aback by her abruptness, I stumbled on my reply and lamely asked her which sword she was talking about. She told me that there were many of the holy swords with the ability to dismiss the undead rumored to be hidden throughout the world, though only a few had been found. Amstaf had one of those that he had found, and she gave me a magical bag to place four items in that will summon one of the hidden swords to me. She told me where to find the items, and surprisingly, I realized I already had possession of one of them, the Blade of nobility. <br>
<br>
I remember venturing a bit too far from Kaladim when I was very young, and I came across the rotting corpse of a crazed goblin, poking at the stinking carcass with my short sword, my blade clinked upon a raw sword blank. Being ever curious, I strapped the sword to my back and headed back to the safety of Kaladim and placed the puzzling object in my box at the bank.<br>
<br>
Coming back to the present, I realized I was all alone, Ruathey was nowhere to be found. I strapped the bag she gave me to an empty spot on my back and headed back to the druid ring, not wanting my levitate to wear off while I was running next to one of the many lava pits. I made it back safely, and after being gated back to BB by another guildmate whose name escapes me at the moment, I headed off to find another paladin who had earlier asked if I would like to hunt goblins in BB with him. <br>
I found him, but because the goblins he was looking for were being systematically killed by a group of high level adventurers who had agreed to let him loot anything they did not want, I found myself with some time on my hands.<br>

I sat down outside the bank and decided that the rest of the items I needed for the bag would require a group of adventuring peers to successfully acquire. At that moment, I heard one of my guild mates Xyzor declare that he was having a grand time killing death beetles and such in the Estate if Unrest. I figure this was a good opportunity for information gathering, and I decided to travel to Unrest to hang with Xyzor and scope the place out for my eventual battle to get my ghoul's heart. <br>
<br>
This time, without the aid of a levitate, I made my way across the broken landscape of Dagnor's Cauldron and eventually arrived at the entrance to the Estate of Unrest. I stared at the ugly scar in the rock that marked the  entrance to the most reproachable haven of undead creatures around and self-consciously wondered why I had not been here before. Brushing that thought from my mind, I boldly strode into the Estate. <br>
<br>
My senses were assaulted with the sounds of screaming and mayhem. Ah, lovely place this. I quickly found Xyzor gleefully hacking away at several skeletons, noticed he was not looking too well, so I slapped a heal on him and watched as he dispatched his newfound friends handily. I sat down again and looked around at the others hanging by the entrance. It appeared to be sparsely populated with adventurers, so I was content with helping out Xyzor and stopping the occasional train headed to the zone.<br>
<br>
There I met a nice Halfling Rogue named Alisam. After a little discussion, we decided to go check out the second floor of the Estate where my Crazed Ghoul is supposed to drop his heart. So, with me and my trusty Invisibility versus Undead, and her with her exceptional sneak and hide skills, boldly and we strode through the back door to the first stair landing. Whereupon my IvU started blinking (Did I mention that after I cast it I stopped a few trains, healed Xyzor a couple times and offered a 10 percent res to someone? No? Well I did...) Thus with a gut wrenching realization, and Homer-like D'oh! I tried to recast before the nasties realized I was there... Two fizzles and lots of sweating on my part produced about 3 skeles, and a ghoul who proceeded to pound on me, with more streaming into the landing from upstairs, according to my peripheral vision. <br>
<br>
Valiantly, I started swinging my Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword, hewing and slashing undead with great vigor and enthusiasm (read stupidity), I heard Alisam shout out that she was assisting me, and forged into the quagmire of undead. Only after I was half dead and bleeding profusely did I notice Alisam screaming her Halfling lungs at me to run. so I turned down the staircase and stumbled toward the back door. It was then I noticed that our little group of 5 or six mobs had increased to about 8 or 10, even after killing more than 3 of the vile things. <br>
At that point, seeing as how I caused that little ruckus, my goal was to get as many of the creatures away from my Rogue friend as fast as I could, to allow her to escape unmolested. I lurched across the back yard, all the while hearing the sickening crunching of my bones as darkened skeletons and at least 2 crazed ghouls pounded their way through my armor. I made it almost to the hedge when...<br>
<br>
Loading, Please Wait...<br>
<br>
I appeared at my souls bind point on the moon of Luclin with one thought on my mind, Did Alisam make it through that cluster I created? With a heavy heart, I cautiously asked her, &quot;Are you ok?&quot; She responded with a yes, and I started breathing normally again. It appears her sneak and hide skills are very effective, especially when all the attention is focused on the Dwarf Paladin running and screaming &quot;Train to Zone&quot; through the Estate backyard. Suddenly as I was waiting for the Faydwer Scion to notify me that the portal was becoming active, good 'ol Xyzor pops into my head and asks...<br>
&quot;Dude, you die?&quot; <br>
<br>
I responded that indeed I died a glorious and noisy death with half the resident undead population of the Estate whacking me soundly across the decrepit lawn. He kindly offered to drag my corpse to a safe location. What a guy...<br>
<br>
After the Scion transported me safely to the Faydwer wizard spires, I started to hoof my way back through the Butcher Block mountains and back toward Unrest. Trygin and Sylinea came up in guild chat and asked if I wanted some company in Unrest, not one to pass up good company, I heartily told them I would love some company. I met them at the zone line to DC when Xyzor pops back into my head an informs me he found a nice level 24 cleric by the name of Dour to give me a rez. With much joy I eagerly awaited the somewhat disorienting astral journey back to the location of my corpse. After gathering my belongings and strapping my armor back on, I dispassionately watched my now naked corpse fade into the ether and sat my butt down to regain my strength and general well being (Being resurrected is no small feat mind you).<br>
<br>
Trygin and Sylinea showed up and we all sat down to discuss the strategy for entering the Estate. We determined to make some pulls to the back fence of the backyard and see how it goes, rather than just foolishly striding right in. I made some tentative pulls from the octagon room and it went rather swimmingly. We decided to move into the octagon room and pull to there, knowing a quick exit was at hand. I pulled from up the previously mentioned fateful staircase and one of the mobs was my Crazed Ghoul! Hacking and slashing, we dispatched all the mobs and when I went to loot the corpses, I held my breath as I searched the remains of the Ghoul, my heart!! Success!<br>
<br>
Getting bolder (read stupid again) I started pulling from higher up the staircase. <br>
<br>
Mistake.<br>
<br>
I was seemingly able to empty almost the entire section of that part of the Estate. Alisam, ever the reasonable Halfling I came to realize, suggested we vacate the premises. In other words, she and everybody else were screaming &quot;RUN!&quot; at the top of their lungs. I valiantly stayed behind to keep the agro so my friends could escape when Trygin asked me, &quot;Rad, you coming or not?&quot; Not wanting a repeat of my last debacle, I fast footed it toward the hedge and the zone line. Running along the west wall I shot past the gazebo where I picked up a few more baddies. Running with all the speed of a wolf late for a lamb barbecue, I whizzed past the startled people mulling around the entrance to the zone line shouting &quot;Train to zone!&quot; I only slowed when I noticed Trygin stopped and looking back. I turned around and saw the mobs interspersed among the gathered adventurers and headed back with Trygin to finish them off, with an old adage in my head, &quot;Many hands make light work&quot;.<br>
<br>
After cleaning up that mess, We somehow came up with the idea that we should try to go to the top of the stairs, clean out that room, and pull to there. So, with IvU on Try, Syl , and myself, and Ali with her sneak, we walked casually up the stairs past the oblivious mobs, and stood in front of &quot;The Door&quot;. Ali, who had been the most reasonable member of the group as far as I could tell (and I had NO idea why she was still hanging around), calmly told us that we should jump out the window if we get overwhelmed, because the mobs will follow us down the stairs if we go that way. Naturally, I agreed, &quot;Yep, makes sense&quot; says I. We opened the door and saw 3 mobs, all blue. No worries!<br>
<br>
I was wrong.<br>
<br>
Those 3 went down fairly quickly, when I noticed that I was not being healed anymore. Syl had apparently fallen out the window, and suddenly the room was full of mobs streaming in through the still open door. What did I do you ask? I ran down the stairs of course. And promptly got lost. Running around opening doors a random is not a good idea, have you ever heard that before? I think I did once, somewhere, not sure where though.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back at the hoe-down…<br>
<br>
I realized I was hopelessly lost, and kept bouncing into Trygin every so often, I determined to die in as conspicuous a location as possible, so I found the largest room I could and turned to fight to my dying breath. Foolish I know, but it made me feel good going down swinging.<br>
<br>
Loading, Please wait…<br>
<br>
Ah the Nexus, my home away from my brain, I mean home. I hesitated a moment when I realized that Trygin was also bound up here, and figured we could do the naked run together (wait, that does not sound right…). I was just trying to piece together what happened, when, and my heart skipped a beat here. Alisam piped up and said that she was safe, and would we like some rezes from one of her guildmates who was there in Unrest watching the carnage (with some amount of humour no doubt). Then! Ali cried out that she had died as well. <br>
<br>
I wept.<br>
<br>
It turns out she died just as she reached the sanctity of the entrance, the irony was not lost on me. I was not turning out to be such a good raid leader it seems, and I needed to do some serious thinking about how these things are supposed to go. So I sat down and memmed my favourite spells from my thin battered spell book while listening to the rezes going on and calmly waited my turn. I consented Ali (bless her roguish Halfling heart) to drag my corpse to safety and waited for the message that I was being resurrected. <br>
<br>
After being resurrected for the second time that evening, Trygin had the good sense to ask the burning question &quot;How could we do things differently next time?&quot; How indeed. We all sat around recovering from our rezzes, stopped a few more trains while not quite healed up, and people started realizing the time. First, Ali had to get up the next morning for a swim meet, then Try and Syl had to leave. I whined pitifully, and they agreed to stick around a while longer, but I don’t think any of our hearts were in it. <br>
<br>
We ended the night reassuring each other that we had had great fun, died gloriously, and none of it really mattered anyway. I had my Ghoul's heart and a strong determination to learn from my mistakes.<br>

I got my chip from the Scion, and sat down to wait for the portal to whisk me back to the moon. Up at the moon, I ran into Danekes and he offered me some upgraded armor. A Breastplate of Ro, and Greaves of Ro. He also gave me a very nice necklace whose name and stats I can't recall at the moment, and some Charred Boots. I quickly thanked him and he asked if I would do an item transfer for Cyndal, again I agreed and tried the armor on while waiting for Cyndal to show up.<br>
<br>
All in all, it was a learning experience, and great fun. I hope to have the tutelage of someone wiser for the next step in my quest, and until then, I am determined to go back to Unrest and see if I can figure out the dynamics of that place.<br>

This Thursday, April 11, at the wizard spires in North Karana, 7:30CDT( &lt;--- shameless plug)<br>

Our first stop was in Highkeep, just like was planned. It was a bit of a tight fit with 11 Lords, I think I go to hit a mob maybe 3 times... lol (Special thanks to Branwen and Sindiin for grabbing the camp early!) In fact, I spent most of my time staring at the spawn point for my Crazed Goblin, listening to the sounds of death and destruction in the background... lol. Well, he did eventually spawn, and after little more than 15 minutes with the whole crew in the mines, I had my Scroll.<br>
<br>
So, off to Najena.<br>
<br>
This was not as successful as High Keep, in that we never did see the Hilt drop. We had 12 Guildies in zone, and 5 others who probably wondered what was going on... lol. I broke the groups into upper level, and lower level, and after several people *found* the traps in the floor (names withheld to protect the innocent), and got out of jail thanks to Sibian, we were on our way to clearing out the zone. Killing every Darkbone, Large, Greater, and just plain &quot;A Skeleton&quot;s, but no luck. This went on for a couple of hours. Finally, people who have normal jobs had to log and I stuck around to see if I could get lucky and find it on my own. Branwen logged back on to let me know that she had found the quest online, and that my targets were the plain &quot;A Skeleton&quot;... D'oh! if we had known that, we would not have had to be in the lower part of the dungeon at all, they were as green as could be. The regular Skeletons were light blue to dark blue to Radnor, who is 34. <br>
<br>
So, armed with Branwen's updated info, I scoped out the 3 places they popped and just killed them one after another. Still no luck. I may need to actually kill the Large and Greater Skeles at the spawn points also, which I were ignoring, they may be place holders or something. /shrug<br>
<br>
I will not be online this evening, I will be visiting my Brother, but I will see all you crazy wonderful people Saturday. And if anybody feels like hanging out with me in Najena Saturday around 2 CDT, the company would be most welcome.  <br>

<br>
Well, I went back on Friday evening, and after killing many &quot;A Skeletons&quot;, another Paladin waltzed in and announced that he was willing to pay to loot the hilt... He then sent me a tell asking if I knew where the spawn area was. I replied saying I was looking for the hilt also, but did not know the exact drop location, only that it came from &quot;A Skeleton&quot;. He said that he would wait for me to find it first. After a bit, he went off to WK to talk to the guy and get the bag for the quest and told me that his roomate said the two skeletons by the water were the ones that dropped the hilt. After he left I went down to the water area, and after killing just 5 skeletons, there it was, the hilt! <br>
Sooooo, to make a very long winded and boring story just a tiny bit shorter, As most of you now know, I have my Ghoulbane.<br>
I would like to thank all in the guild who helped me with this, specifically those on the raid day itself, by providing transportation (Justims and Nevarmoor), the much appreciated heals (Ceelia and Pyranius), Awsome nukes (Sindiin and Noltrac), a goodly helping of the dark arts (Ischaade and Gwetto), Lovely music (Gwenne), our Najena guide, &quot;Pointer-out-of-traps&quot;, and holder of the &quot;Get out of jail free key&quot; (Sibian), and of course my fellow Paladin, the all around lovely and deadly tank (Branwen).<br>
That wraps up that. I had a blast and hope to be able to help other of our mid level guildmates with their respective quests. If no one posts anything soon however, I may be forced to come up with another one for Radnor, and subject you all to my stories again! <br>
