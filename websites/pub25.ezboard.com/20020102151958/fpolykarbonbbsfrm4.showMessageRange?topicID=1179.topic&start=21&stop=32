* for lack of a better word&quot;<br>
<br>
Seriously now... What is a *real* anime fan? How do you qualify that? And I'm not trying to be a smart so and so, I'm curious.<br>
<br>
I only own a few videos and a small stack of manga. I know a few artists names, couldn't tell you any voice actors names... seiyuus?... other than Oomori Kinuko, the original Priss in BGC. Haven't watched all of the episodes of some of my favorites yet, because I keep bouncing around between different series. But I love anime! I can never get enough. It seems like there's always something more to learn. When I think I've found a new favorite, I stumble onto something else that is totally cool. One of the things I want to do is collect a good library of anime. And I really did name my computer Ryoko. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have the McFarlane figure of her standing on top of it.<br>

Why?  Because its aimed for small children, the art quality is realisitc but not as good as most anime (colors are a little flatter, this is an opinion), its about superheroes with super powers in a world like our own while anime is about a wide variety of things, mostly humanlike people in a foreign world from our own<br>
<br>
with comics and manga, there is a much smaller difference.  I would have to say that american comics' art quality is in most cases surperior to many mangas.  However, the subject matter is a lot different, comics are mostly superheroes...<br>
<br>
i would say i am more interested in something with the anime name on it, but i think X-men is a pretty cool concept too, but i think that's more aimed for kids while a lot of anime is aimed for adults (cowboy bebop, kite...) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utheoriginalbaduqwa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>theoriginalbaduqwa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/5/01 5:38:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is manga and anime a fad in America?</span><hr size=1> DBZ is gonna remain a fad for a while.

Have you read any comics? X Men and those aren't targetted towards younger children, overall they should receive a teen rating (sometimes even R). The cartoon is directed towards kids obviously, but almost any animated series in the US is.<br>

Uh... WHAT!?! How is Samurai Jack even remotely like DBZ. I like them both, but they are NOTHING alike. <p><table width=100% border=0>

and samurai jack and DBZ...I can't see even small similarities...<br>
Samurai jack is one really cool samurai sent into the future...DBZ is a group of sayian's and other strange people<br>
Samurai Jack is trying to get back to his time to beat aku<br>
the DBZ gang is beating up cell for the entire series...(I know it's not the whole series but damn did that ever drag)<br>
I don't really like DBZ...it's fun to watch when I'm bored because it does have a couple fun episodes but not enough to make me go out of my way to watch it...samurai jack is usually fairly decent<br>
And I don't think puhfyn is referring to the x-men comic...I think she means the series<br>
And I agree the fact that it is a fad does increase the actual fan base a little...those people that watch DBZ may try staying up for cowboy bebop some night and realise there's more...<br>
I think the difference between a fad and a fan is the state of mind...<br>
people who are going with the fad are trying to fit in and go with what everyone else is doing...they're usually the popular people that do whatever the TV tells them is cool and don't think for themselves<br>
A fan is someone that doesn't care what other people think...like football fans in detroit...they still cheer for their team even if they haven't won a game...they don't care...<br>
If someone starts bugging you about watching anime and saying it sucks ect and you start to doubt yourself then you probably have a closet full of beanie babies and furbies and are just about ready to buy the newest boyband cd <p><pre>

I'm just cobbling those concepts that I think defines the anime fad mentality.  <br>
<br>
I thought this debate is about anime/manga being a fad in the US and the fad mentality behind it.  Not if you like anime/manga or not.  I think the US is pretty fickle and fasted paced about whats popular and whats not.  I was gonna use how Disco was a big thing and now its virtually gone (I consider this example a little too extreme).  And that the only ones that actually still do it are the &quot;fans&quot; that won't let go.  <br>
<br>
The longevity of a thing is determined by a majority of people's &quot;commitment&quot; (for lack of a better word) to it.  I figure that something like pogs is a fad and that something like classical music isn't (maybe a bit on the fringe... but a fad).  The difference between them is the level of interest.  While pogs had a about a year or two in popularity.  Classical music is still practiced, listened to, etc... (granted its almost fringe compared to other popular music but sitll heard in movies and whatnot)<br>
<br>
I figure that to actually know details, directors, why you even like an anime, helps keep up the interest level.<br>
<br>
Lets say you like the way Mamoru Oshii's style of directing (which I didn't) in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ghost in the Shell</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  You'd probably want to find out some of his other works (like the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Patlabor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> movies or the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Urusei Yatsura</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> series).  Thereby keeping the interest up with the different series.  Even for character designers (considering its the visual part that is the subject fan art).  To actually know them helps keep level of interest right.  Lets say you like Evnagelion's character designs and want to see more of that persons work.  It would help if you knew the name of the character designer... which is Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (who also did the character designs in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wings of Honneamise</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which is for the most part different from the EVA series).  Or for that matter, you like Evangelion and want to see more works from the people that made it.  It helps to know the company that made the anime.  I can go on and on about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gainax</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but I guess that I'd make you bored.  At least thats why I want to know a director, animation studio, etc...<br>
<br>
I also figure that if you at least know the storyline, you'd know if you liked or disliked that anime/manga.<br>
<br>
I also think the debating part also helps keep fanatacism up.  I see all these &quot;So and so anime is the greatest&quot; posts but 90% of the time they don't include the reason WHY its the greatest.  Something I encouraged awhile ago, but to no avail, so I gave up on the encouraging part.  But I think it is important to dissect or delve into the anime/manga to determine if it is good or not.  I mean, if you can't figure out if you like or dislike an anime, why even bother to watch?  It does help if you know what you are talking about.<br>
<br>
Casual fans no doubt like whatever they like, but I think they are not much help in keeping anything from being a fad.  To me a casual fan is someone who will not go out of their way to watch a particular anime.  (either my dictionary is on the fritz or that 'casual' is an occurance without regularity or feeling or showing little concern... I guessing you mean the first one)<br>
<br>
I'm tired now... its 3:30am here.  I can say more tomorrow, but i'm just tired of writing and thinking right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS:  Little known piece of trivia.  That personal pic I have might very well be the first breast <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> giggle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in anime.  Circa 1983...<br>

Nothing more.  Nothing less.  <br>
<br>
Some people aren't necessarily fans of anime, even though they watch anime.  If the only anime someone has seen is Akira, and they love it, are they fans of anime or are they fans of Akira?  Which is really what I was getting at.  There are many people who have only watched one or two anime series...and that's not really enough exposure to become a fan of an art form, instead they are fans of a specific series or movie.  <br>
<br>
I was just saying that some people who jump on a specific series, such as DBZ, may become fans of anime...not just fans of DBZ.  I want more people to become real fans, so that the companies that import it to the US will be around to import more titles for as long as I live. <p><a href="http://www.superrats.net"><img src="http://imagep.webphotos.iwon.com//1000014373/307048.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/6/01 6:51:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/anyte/photos/snap22.jpg width=120 length=195></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: N</span><hr size=1> I see what you mean.  Well I certainly couldn't hold decent conversation about directors and storylines, I do know enough to know what to look for when looking for something new.  I know enough to pick up the DVD and look on the back to see what the names are and see what else is available.  I'm just one of those people where that kind of information doesn't stick so well.  I can explain why I like that anime's I like on a non-technical level.  It's all visual entertainment (comics, games, tv, movies) and some of it is more entertaining and interesting than others ... I can explain what makes it entertaining for me ... but I don't think I could make a decent discussion out of it.<br>

my point could be that you dont have to know the logics and stuff to be a fan...and you dont really have to like what &quot;real&quot; anime fans like...to be considered one...well i think im done...<br>

I see what you're saying though.  The casual fan thing was just saying that you didn't have to be a fanatic to be a fan.  Seems like others were confused a bit too.<br>
<br>
When I think of a fad, I think of something that's going to go back into obscurity eventually.  Pogs and disco are good examples that you pointed out, but I have a hard time imagining anime disappearing as much, just by the nature of how it's distributed.  <br>
<br>
Since it's a visual medium that's distributed on dvd or video, I think it has a better chance of sticking around.  It may not be as popular or on tv as much as it is now in a few years, but I don't see it disappearing completely.  I think it will still have a much larger fanbase than some of the examples you mentioned. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/udynamiteneon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DynamiteNeon</A> at: 12/6/01 1:06:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/6/01 3:03:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: N</span><hr size=1> hehehe...this is a great discussion...retro torque deserves points for starting it :-)<br>
<br>
I guess you can be a fan of one anime...but we all had to start somewhere...how much do you have to see to become a fan of anime in general...<br>
I think it's a state of mind...it'll all of a sudden click and you'll appreciate it in a new way...<br>
it doesn't have anything to do with how much you've watched or how much you buy...or how much you talk about it...that's the outward expression of it...<br>
it's a state of mind...it's internal...the external side can be faked...I can pretend I love drew barrymore movies by buying all her stuff and talking about what a great actor she is...it doesn't mean anything (I loathe drew barrymore)<br>
a real fan the love comes from the inside and is expressed in our actions<br>
as opposed to those who are fad followers and the feeling is superficial...<br>
Pogs are a good example they left as fast as they came...<br>
Anime I think falls short of a fad...I don't see anyone feeling excluded by not being interested...most fads try and push the group thing...like if you don't do something you won't be part of this group...<br>
It also never really got the came from nowhere and was popular quickly deal...<br>
I think it just decided to get more popular...probably because people were sick of crappy formula movies that disney puts out...<br>
sure some people follow it like a fad because it is popular and will find something else when the popularity starts to wane...but there will be enough fans to keep things strong<br>
<br>
I know I just contradicted what I said before...that's ok...I decided to think differently today <p><pre>
