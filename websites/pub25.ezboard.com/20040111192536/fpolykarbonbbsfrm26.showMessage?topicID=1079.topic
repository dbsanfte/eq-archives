<br>
I'm going to follow the Matrix and Tarantino, and steal...I mean pay homage to...old stuff to make new stuff.<br>
<br>
Works for them, so why not me?<br>
<br>
The old stuff in question? The Visionaries.<br>
<br>
Never heard of them? Shame on you. This is my latest 80's throwback obsession, so I want to work on it. They only did 13 episodes and 5 or so comics, so it's not that developed, and the idea is great. (Got canned because Hasbro I think it was, weren't making enough money from the toys, so meh)<br>
<br>
The idea:<br>
The planet Prysmos orbits a triple star in another galaxy. When, 7000 years into a era of advanced technology, the Suns go into alignment every machine on Prysmos fails inexplicably and society is soon reduced to quasi-medieval conditions.<br>
<br>
The wizard Merklynn emerges from his Shrine on Iron Mountain to tell the knights of Prysmos that it is now the Age of Magic and he will grant magical powers to anyone who can conquer Iron Mountain.<br>
<br>
Sko a bunch of guys and girls wander up the Mountain, get through, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Most were given a staff, (or shield as the comic went with for some), while others were told they had other powers they would find out about later, which was that they could operate vehicles.<br>
<br>
They were also given magic weapons and an animal totem. A nice creature they could turn into (and be 'invulnerable' in that form. Any damage they recieved would revert them back to human form if it was severe enough, but it wouldn't damage thehuman form). The animals represented the human somewhat; the leader being a lion and the fast guy being a cheetah etc etc.<br>
<br>
But here's the thing. The wizard isn't a nice kind of guy, to be honest. He says so himself. &quot;Do you think I give you magic out of selflessness? No, I do it so you become instruments of my will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only does he give the 'good' guys magic, the bad guys get it too. They also have to do tasks for Merklynn to get magical recharges for the staffs, and to learn more magic powers later on.<br>
<br>
Merklynn also goes to the bother of helping free the evil group when the heroes capture them, just so he has more minions to do his work. He isn't evil, per se, he just wants his stuff done no matter what.<br>
<br>
So you basically get the idea. I don't want to basically retell it, I want to create a canon of its own. Like the new He-Man. Not a prequel or a sequel or a remak; just it's own storyline based on the other details.<br>
<br>
Although, I am keeping Witterquick because he was my favourite, and I used to have the toy before I lost him in a carpet shop. Woe is me. So yeah. The other characters I'd rather leave out, because I want something new, and most of them were developed a bit through the 13 episodes whereas Witter wasn't too much, so I can run with him a little. (Heh, run! He was the fast one with the cheetah. Get it, run....yes)<br>
<br>
That is the idea. New factions and all that, to make it deeper. Rival hero groups was my original idea, but we'll see.<br>
<br>
Want to take part or whatever, here's your chance.<br>
<br>
Character name<br>
Good or evil<br>
Animal Totem and why it represents him/her<br>
Staff power<br>
Description<br>
and all the rest<br>
<br>
One more thing, the power staffs can't be all superfied and evrything, because Merklynn liks to balance things out. The more powerful it is, the more drawbacks it has. Take the Destruction one. It's very powerful, but the creature that pops out to do the destroying, doesn't really like to listen to the staff holder and do what he's told, so lots get destroyed, more often than not. And they have 'poems'. Yep. To use the power you recite your magical spell, so you need one of those. Don't worry if you suck, because I have a few dozen staffs and powers for you to pick if you can't think of one. I suppose I'll put them down if people are interested. And we're talking medieval stuff here, so the poems have to sound poncey.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sheathe these feet in the driving gale<br>
Make swift these legs o'er land I sail&quot; for the God of Light speed<br>
<br>
By what creeps, what crawls, by what does not,<br>
Let all that grows recede and rot&quot; for the Decay spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think that'll do. Let me know if you want in and all that, so we can sort out more stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a time when magic is more powerful than science, and only those who control the magic control destiny. They are the Visionaries&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theinvisibleman@polykarbonbbs>The invisible man</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/20/03 10:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1079.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Collab/Interactive Story</span><hr size=1> What an interesting idea, OK here's a character, I know he sucks but hey ho.<br>
<br>
Name: Albion<br>
Alignment: Good<br>
Totem: Spider (because he has a tendency to stay out of sight and observe and think before acting)<br>
Staff: the ability to create illusions<br>
Spell: Shadows of light, spirits of night, do my will, bewitch their sight<br>
Desc: Average height and a light build Albion is one of life's quiet people.  Focusing much more on planning and creating solutions that he needs other people to help enact, many have the suspicion he is in the group simply because he finds it more useful than working by himself.  What they don't know is the reason he is there is simply because he likes solving problems and he can do that in abundance here.<br>

Finally, someone who knows what he's doing without having to ask half a dozen questions like 'why does it have to be an animal? Can it be a lion instead?!!'<br>
<br>
Anyway :P Yeah. What I was going with for the story idea was instead of us all having one character in the team, we instead have a team of our own?<br>
<br>
Maybe three or four characters for us to write with, to make it a little bit deeper, and so it doesn't really rely so much on deadlines and all that, especially if people are questing seperately and everything. Granted, it's a pain to think of more staffs (and those annoying poems!) which is why I have a list of about 26 (some new, some from the series) for you to pick out another three from.And to be honest, I didn't think of Illusion, so that's a good one.<br>
<br>
For now, the staffs are in sets, (to basically even them out so one guy doesn't come along and pick the powerful four for his team of knights) but a little bit of swapping amongst the same category of staffs is doable.<br>
<br>
Of course I've claimed mine :P But there are a good amount left over. This all depends on whether or not you want your own army of knights, or just want to stick as your one guy. Don't worry at all if you want to just write for him, because I'm sure I could fit him in my group, or maybe in someone elses group, if you want. You could even gosolo or anything. The world is vast and you're very free to do whatever you want. I know it's my thing, but I'm not going to be like the majority of people I've seen and basically command what you do.<br>
<br>
Enough rambling with that. So let me know what you think or want to do, or if you want more information on the staff powers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theinvisibleman@polykarbonbbs>The invisible man</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/21/03 9:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1079.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nie :)</span><hr size=1> Probably more convenient if he were to be slotted in to another group as my mind is a blank, I could do him because he sort of reminds me of myself (except without the shape shifting and magic et al.).

Well, the first task has appeared, and that is each grouping/writer has been sent to fetch a talisman of the elements. You and your knight(s) are set tofetch the air talisman, which is pretty much found in the mountains. How you get it, where you get, who you bump into and everything you do is all up to you, it's just that the talisman is in a mountain range somewhere. Be sure to check the thread bits, that say about the Dactyle and Barbairans that live in one mountain range, and the other things in the other, and all that. You can basically throw in whatever you want, too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=1079.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=1079.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1079.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=1079.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=1079.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1079.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1079.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
