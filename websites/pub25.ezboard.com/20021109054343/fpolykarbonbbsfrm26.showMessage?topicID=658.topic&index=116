All who try to vex me/<br>
Timtim tried to stress me/<br>
Steamed his ass like green tea/<br>
Cuz we went round for round/<br>
ANd pound for pound/<br>
I made sure to ground/<br>
His skull into into a  F*ckin' bloody mound/<br>
Of severed flesh /<br>
Givin you something fresh/<br>
Off the top of my head/<br>
JUst like everything I said/<br>
So now sin and me are neutral/<br>
But my ass will still get brutal/<br>
Cuz those weak Mc's attempts are futile/<br>
And all they get is pure refutal/<br>
To enter the lair of the shogun master/<br>
Better, meaner, and ten times faster/<br>
Cuz this is a new chapter/<br>
In the history of rappers/<br>
Say your last godbye/<br>
Cuz they're gonna find you in a pasture/<br>
With shurikens in your throat/<br>
In your owm blood you'll start to float/<br>
Down the river of sorrow/<br>
Won't see your ass tommorrow/<br>
Find someone else skills that you could borrow/<br>
Meet teh bloody shogun/<br>
Time for hatas to run/<br>
When It's time to have some fun/<br>
You know the war has just begun/<br>
Every line carries the message of being real/<br>
This rap is innnate and so I say just what I feel/<br>
And right now I just feel massive anger/<br>
At the haters who dissed me so I wrote this little banger/<br>
Like chemical brothers I got the shaolin buddha finger/<br>
I'm a hard rapper you're a p*ssy R&amp;B singer/<br>
Thsi rap is just started so I plan to linger/<br>
This one's gotta be jumpin like a phone off the ringer/<br>
I with my new badass crew/<br>
With three badass dudes/<br>
Cuz nobody knew/<br>
With good MC's ther's just a few/<br>
Now I see sin has got the fire/<br>
Let's keep it bouncin like a tire/<br>
Get rid of all the liars/<br>
Cuz infested's gonna take this sh*t 10 steps higher/<br>
Can't forget my man main devil/<br>
He shines like a diamond bezel/<br>
All you cats are gonna revel/<br>
At his skills that are on the next level/<br>
Now getting back to the war/<br>
weaklings hit the floor/<br>
We're blowing lyric bombs up/<br>
Cuz we're hard to the core/<br>
You want more and more/<br>
And supplies are infinite/<br>
So take a friggin hint/<br>
You don't amount to chicken sh*t/<br>
Not one f*ckin bit/<br>
The risk is trivial/<br>
Your skills are pitiful/<br>
But the mic is pivotal/<br>
For my existence to continue/<br>
So stand clear  cuz I'm loaing another clip/<br>
This sh*t's still going it ain't never gon' quit/<br>
Till you haters throw a fit/<br>
I'll slice you up until you split/<br>
HAlf and half/<br>
But still 1/4 an MC/<br>
I'm not very friendly/<br>
So don't ever f^ckin tempt me/<br>
I'm like ice cream so many damn flavors/<br>
I'm the rap savior/<br>
So I'll do you a little favor/<br>
Get out while you can/<br>
Run back to your fam/<br>
Cuz you can't understand/<br>
How much this means to us man/<br>
TO shine on the mic or type at PK/<br>
More than a hobby I do this sh*t all day/<br>
It takes more than just words/<br>
So what you got to say?/<br>
My new clan's called ISAI/<br>
Three verbally abusive incredible guys/<br>
WHose rhymes strike you hard in the face/<br>
Like bullet pies/<br>
The shogun assassin/<br>
My rhyme is everlastin/<br>
Suckas who try surpassin'/<br>
I'm gonna end up blastin'/<br>
Just a little warning/<br>
This is gonna go until the morning/<br>
Two hours in the making/<br>
And for me it's not boring/<br>
I'll show you the color of the energy like 311/<br>
I'm super twin turbocharged like an RX-7/<br>
Ready to blow/<br>
and go/<br>
And send your ass straight to heaven/<br>
Or maybe it was hell/<br>
Cuz that's where I'm from/<br>
The heat gets pretty bad but we have lots of fun/<br>
With amatuer MC's/<br>
We punch you hard like Dempsey/<br>
Cuz you're like a car runnin on empty/<br>
<br>
DAmn need sleep....<br>
<br>
<br>

Im not crazy at you/<br>
i jus f*ckin dont like sinfire/<br>
lyrical newbie/<br>
and a straight liar/<br>
his desire/<br>
to try to persecute me in his lyrics/<br>
he aint done sh*t outside of pk, so i dont wanna hear it/<br>
im near it/<br>
i can feel this act of victory/<br>
it seems to stick to me/<br>
like these invincible beats/<br>
u'll retreat/<br>
before ur able to take this heat,/<br>
flowin from me/<br>
but you see/<br>
its time i begin to complete/<br>
the meat of these words/<br>
unleash heards of strikes/<br>
cus the stripes/<br>
of the ISAI/<br>
fly/<br>
over our heads, like a bird in the sky/<br>
im starten to feel sorry for sin/<br>
i dont even know why/<br>
because, hes gettin shredded up/<br>
by everyone of us all/<br>
but its my call/<br>
he turned me away from his crew/<br>
little he knew/<br>
that i was already, formin a squad/<br>
all i could do, was look down at him and nod/<br>
cus hes gonna loose, unless he takes this serious/<br>
im jus curious/<br>
where is ur team now/<br>
when u need em/<br>
there not even around for u to feed em/<br>
the bullsh*t that u fed to me/<br>
i cant wait to see/<br>
ur so called new bbs/<br>
this is the test/<br>
of truth/<br>
get outta tha booth/<br>
and make way for 3 killas/<br>
ryhmes more complex and illa than sin, or timtim/<br>

this is a war, maybe even a second D-day/<br>
but they, push me, outta control/<br>
its the poll, of whose, the best rapper of all/<br>
my skills r too tall/<br>
to overpower/<br>
its now or never/<br>
ill pull the lever/<br>
and bam, ur not here/<br>
to rap, or try to snap me off tha stick/<br>
but the trick to winnin/<br>
is to scoop up every fighter u can/<br>
and then to blend, into the large crowd of people/<br>
then when ur ready, try to take down the steeple/<br>
and ull get the structure/<br>
ill f*ck ur/<br>
whole damn team up/<br>
if it takes my life/<br>
ill strike wit anthrax/<br>
or take martial arts to the max/<br>
whatever it takes/<br>
ISAI, will make it happin/<br>
