1) My hand doesn't look like the example.  My index finger extends to about 3/4 the distance of the final digit of my middle finger, whereas my ring finger extends only 1/2 way.  In other words, my index finger is longer, not my ring finger as in the example.  Doesn't really matter, just wanted to note that exceptions exist.<br>
2) The second toe extending longer than the big toe appears to occur (based on my experience) in people of Irish or British decent.  I call this 'The ET Toe'.  So what happens for Anime?  Well, none of them look Japenese anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter - artist's preference.<br>
3) I've been closely observing people's ears over the last few weeks, and I'd have to argue that most of them start beyond halfway back the head.  If you divide into fifths, they appear to be located in the 4th fifth from front to back.  That's my beginner's opinion.<br>
<br>
4)Along these lines, in How to Draw Anime and Game Characters Vol 1, I really have to disagree with the artist's sketches of views from below.  Why do these views convert the characters into Jay Leno?  The jaws look HUGELY misproportioned.  Just look in a mirror and tilt your head back - the distance from your lower lip to the tip of your chin DECREASES.  This make sense for any measure viewed at an angle.  Why does he expand it?  It looks REALLY, REALLY wrong!  And I've seen other artists copy this style...  Any thoughts? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=retrotorque>RetroTorque</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/15/04 2:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2661.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> 1. It's just Pat's idea of a hand. Not what everyones hand is. I've got a type of Autism and my finger lengths have some of the typical physical signs of it. And Pat's hand doesn't show that. My ring fingers are longer than my index fingers. But remember that Pat's tut is a general guide, not the only way of drawing something.<br>
<br>
2. Preference.<br>
<br>
3. Just Pat's idea. You should decide for yourself how you want to place ears.<br>
<br>
4. Probably because it's much easier to draw that way. Also manga styles seem to have little in the way of variation. There seems to be a few key styles and then everyone else draws the same way. Probably one artist through stylistic choice or lack of knowledge drew a low angle headshot &quot;Jay Leno&quot; like and others just copied. If you don't like it than simply don't draw it that way. I don't like it and I try to be more accurate with low angle shots. <br>
<br>
Just keep in mind that theres also a lot of variation in the human form. When you draw, draw to make it look right to the eye. Don't draw in such a way because so and so's tut did something that way. Find your way of doing things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crossknight>CrossKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/15/04 9:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2661.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://rpg-home.lunar-net.com/gs2-web/psynergy/catastrophe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> The rules of drawing anime and manga are more like guidelines.

there are a lot of professionals on that board and they are usually very helpful to artists who are just starting out with projects. they range from children's illustrators to American style comic artists to advertising illustrators to just about everything inbetween. (i mention the board as a source for feedback because they won't say &quot;that doesn't look anime/manga enough&quot; and they are smart enough to truly distinguish exaggerations due to style from genuine anatomy mistakes.) they aren't (as the people here are) devoted to the anime style. but again, they are very good artists and can give solid critique of artwork.<br>

I was interested in the board, but that kind of turned me off of it.

<br>
My impression of Shane's board is that it's more of a feel good board. You post, everyone says how good your drawing is, you reciprocate and repeat. I've lurked at Shane's board for several years (nearly as long as I've been a member here) at that's pretty much been the board the entire time I've known it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/16/04 7:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2661.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmmm</span><hr size=1> well, i wouldn't know about them criticizing anime. i avoid their discussion forums like the plague (too many idiots, kind of like here.) i've seen some people post anime in the art forums and it's been fairly well recieved. <br>
<br>
as far as the usefulness. never having posted my own art i can't say for certain that the feedback is (or is not) genuine. but i have seen some people post, get feedback, rework their stuff and get better. and they're trying to get that new forum going (Draw my Drawing Better). the little bit of use that it's seen seems to have been pretty helpful. <br>
<br>
anyway, i guess my point was that unfortunately PK is no longer a great board to post on if you really want to improve or want solid feedback. there are too many people who don't know what they're talking about when it comes to critiquing work. (and i'm not against people who themselves don't draw critting work. it's the pointless crit &quot;the arm is wonky&quot; or &quot;the eyes look funny&quot; that i'm talking about.) the Concept Art board (er...www.conceptart.org?) is also a good art board. i know Pencil_Soldier moved over there and has been making vast improvements in his work. <br>
<br>
personally, i like what i see on Shane's Board. but then, i also improve most when i'm being inspired by other artwork (which i don't get here very often, especially now that all the artists i really liked seem to have left). <br>
<br>

The cynicism of the boards focused on art and business of illustration has always turned my off from them. Sijun has gotten friendlier over the years, but I only post there in the discussion when someone brings up a topic of how art can only X (x= their ultra specific idea of it) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crossknight>CrossKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/16/04 11:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2661.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://rpg-home.lunar-net.com/gs2-web/psynergy/catastrophe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Whoa!

Ooh, I see Tony Moore and Robert Kirkman are moderators.

but an online forum can only do so much in an artists improvement...but i do agree that alot of the artists i really liked seemed to have moved on...i don't understand why? because an old veteran PK poster would be eben more helpful to a n00b...but as far as useful critiques ive gotten some very very useful ones at wizzart...im not sure if i should be posting the link so if i get clarification that it is ok with alucard ill give you a link...but alot of my favorites are still here! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/17/04 12:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2661.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Go ahead, but I think that's one of the problems.
