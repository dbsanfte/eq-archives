<br>
Perhaps imagination is something you are born with and then learn to develop!<br>
<br>
Maybe when you go to school you are learning ways to organise more complex uses of your own imagination ( - poor teachers being so wrapped up in getting grades and stuff don't recognise that what they are really doing is enabling others to develop tools - maths, english, etc to organise their imaginings more productively.)<br>
<br>
Consider at one time all the computers and programs we play with were just ideas in someone elses mind - they used maths and language to make them part of reality.<br>
<br>
We are continually provided with better computer systems and software - what about better ways to imagine and organise your own imagination - so that you get what you want?<br>
<br>
<br>
I just had the idea in my mind that you could develop the imagination you were born with to work the way you want it to. Aren't you?<br>

Next I read and critique the comic strips in the newspaper, simply by redrawing them and seeing how much better or worse i can draw them than the ones in the actual strip. I also play with Gi joes.

my drawings have improved a little...except for stuff that uses perspective...I used to be able to churn out cars in 3/4 perspective without worrying about proportion...<br>
I was never really interested in drawing people then but my architecture was good too...<br>
it is coming back slowly...I stopped drawing for a few years...<br>
there was a time before I stopped though that people would come to me and have them draw stuff...it was me and another kid...and you either went to me or him...<br>
But I needed to work on school more...and the getting up early and waiting in shitty weather for a bus that was usually late didn't work well for me...<br>
and having stupid teachers...a lack of friends...<br>
I stopped drawing from about gr.6 till just recently...that might be why I lost it...but even the art courses don't emphasise creativity...they want you to know art history...<br>
I won't get into my down with the current school system rant...but I think big improvements could be made....<br>
<br>
and a special shout-out for those in highschool in ontario...HAHAHAHAHA...SUCKS TO BE YOU!!!!!! ... I got out just in time <p><pre>

Some classes were helpful; English helped me develop my writing skills, and introduced me to some sweet concepts and stuff. But Art....ack. I got a B at GSCE (when I was 16), and an E at A Level (18). Then I went on to do an art foundation course, and barely passed. But I know I'm not bad at art. I'm just bad at doing academic art. Comics, for me, are the ideal medium, it involves artwork AND storytelling, which are two areas I feel I am good in. Then again, you can't really make a career of it (unless you're REALLY good), which is probably why academic art courses tend to ignore it. But hey, if my career as a Digital Artist fails (I'm doing &quot;Software Systems For The Arts &amp; Media&quot; (whoa! Mouthful!!) at university now) I guess I can always be a freelance illustrator. But school DID help me, if not artistically, I got a lot of good grades in other subjects, and I'm grateful for having got them, 'cos it makes getting a job that little bit easier. :)<br>
<br>
Sorry for the &quot;dogtopus' history&quot; lesson there kids..XD<br>
<br>
But back to inspiration....I also find that it hits you at the weirdest times...if you're feeling un-inspired, do something else, and don't think about it. It might just go *ping*!! <p><a href="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga">KINDAMANGA!</a> <BR>

I like a lot of the classical artists...I didn't pay attention enough to learn the periods they were in...but van gogh's work is beautiful...but I won't give you an art history lesson...<br>
I got stuck in a class with a lot of idiots that thought they were all hot @#%$ and got a rise out of making fun of me...In fact that happened both years...I hated it...by the end of that period I was drawing exclusively weird abstract and surreal stuff...the one and only person I got along with that didn't treat me like crap...was the teacher...and I just barely passed both times...it was also an expensive class...<br>
it's not really worth it...I'd stay away from art classes in high school...I didn't learn much...and I could just ask either art teacher and they would bend over backwards to help me...(They were very very nice)...I got more from the art club...that was where the real artists hung out...we painted murals all over the school...(Our school is painted everywhere...it's incredible...)<br>
<br>
Anyway...public education doesn't have the right enviroment for creativity...it's much to harsh...you're always having to cover your back or worry about grades and you cant just relax and expiriment...you have idiots that think it's their right to see your sketches...then judge you on your garbage expiriment drawings...<br>
<br>
If you're one of the smart bunch that is disciplined and can get A's and have free time and not have to worry about rumours and other parents threatening to call the cops on you then they can be as creative as they want...I've never hung around with those people much... <p><pre>
