<br>
It was another slow day. The Office of Internal Affairs didn't get a lot of action lately, what with the Chancellor's crackdown on immigration and push for isolationism. Not that Troveau was exactly complaining; even though the water cooler conversation had become markedly less interesting, it wasn't worth pulling another high-profile sting on some backalley punk with a switchblade and more octane than a supercharger.<br>
<br>
Trouveau patted his pockets, found his cigarettes. The flame from his lighter danced across the tip. He inhaled, felt his nerves instantly cool, and leaned back in his chair. He hit the No Smoking sign with a spot-on blast of smog.<br>
<br>
The office wasn't much, but neither was Trouveau. He was a low-level Runner for the OIA, a streetcorner sleuth with a terrible habit of being on the wrong end of a bullet. If weapons were firing, Trouveau was there. At least his body tended to keep the walls from being pummelled by additional bullets.<br>
<br>
The doctors in Intensive had a running joke for him now. &quot;Harry, my boy,&quot; the surgeon would say, through the haze of slowly-clearing anesthetic, &quot;We've put so many organs in you over the years that you could play for an entire church by passing gas.&quot; He'd break out into a guffaw. After what seemed like hours, he'd wipe a tear from the corner of his eye, and stride out into the hallway with that grin on his face.<br>
<br>
The sonofabitch never told Trouveau that joke when there wasn't enough dope in him to kill a small elephant, though. Then there'd at least be some excuse for breaking his jaw. As it stood, nailing the doctor at this point would just be bad form.<br>
<br>
The radiator vibrated and rattled as the heat kicked on downstairs. Trouveau crushed the butt of his cigarette in his ashtray and glanced at the pile of papers that were crumpling beneath his heels.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two weeks without a job, and already I'm a desk monkey,&quot; he explained to his ballpoint pen. &quot;If I wasn't layed up in a sling, I'd show those bastards upstairs that Harry Trouveau can handle High Clients just as well as the next guy. They don't know how easy it is to get stabbed by a goon with twelve ounces of Ultra coarsing through him. Those crackheads are really damn fast.&quot;<br>
<br>
The pen didn't seem to register a response. Troveau sighed, reached for another cigarette, and jumped a foot out of his chair when his office phone blazed to life.<br>
<br>
He fairly dove to the corner of his desk to get it, spraying documents across the room like a bear through a snowdrift. He snatched the headpiece off it's cradle, shoved it to his ear, and gave a very measured, casual greeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trouveau, Runner Third-Level. How can I help you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've got a Low-Op,&quot; said the indistinguishable voice on the other end. Those bastards in Dispatch all sounded alike, so cold and computerized. Even the women talked like machines. &quot;Thirty first and vine. ETA is twelve minutes. You will meet up with Third-Level Runners Jacobson and Weed, with late-entry by First-Level Runner Probst. Report immediately to Devices for equipment and transportation. You will recieve briefing upon arrival at the scene.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trouveau grinned form ear to ear. Here was a chance! &quot;Thanks. It's been a while si-&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Click!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> went the phoneline.<br>
<br>
Trouveau frowned and cursed under his breath. He placed the phone back on the cradle, grabbed an extra pack of cigarettes from his desk, and trotted down the hall.<br>
<br>
He'd be to Devices in a minute and a half, equipped with a high-caliber pistol, five magazines, and an armored behemoth of a car that was in no way inconspicuous.<br>
<br>
He'd be en route to the target in four minutes.<br>
<br>
He'd be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   at</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the target in five.<br>
<br>
He'd be different for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>

<br>
And yes, I am also aware of how lame that last line is. I think it's kind of cute, in it's wide-eyed innocence. Like a little deer looking on the world for the first time.
