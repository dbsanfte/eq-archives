I currently have every good tutorial etc. page I've found bookmarked, but a nice little page devoted to links etc. would be especially delightful, as well as easy to make and small size-wise.<br>
Personally, a more in-depth look at folds would be great for me if you're considering expanding your tutorials...I've found rather few on-line, and most of those are either very brief or, like yours, focus almost entirely or entirely of folds of clothing on the body. I'm rather curious to see how things fold up when, say, pooled on the floor or hanging off the back of a chair. Just a thought.<br>
Lastly (at least for now), I've noticed that many of the &quot;more advanced&quot; (which I feel is an opinion thing) artists on the bbs have been griping about having to deal with the presence of those of us who are either just starting or still trying to get a grasp on the finer details of arting. Instead of &quot;maturing&quot; the bbs, however, it might suffice to simply have seperate sections for newer artists and &quot;advanced&quot; artists to post, so that the &quot;advanced&quot; artists don't have to feel that they're wasting their precious time trying to help the rest of us without those of us who need help the most losing a -fabulous- environment for improving and learning. This for me has been a great place to come to learn...even when I'm not posting my work, just critiquing others and seeing both other artist's work and their critiques has taught me more than 500 anatomy and art books. It would be terribly sad to lose this venue just because some of those people who probably need the least support and assistance with their artwork want to be elitist about who's works they view.<br>
Anyway, just throwing in a vote for the underdogs. :)<br>
I hope this helps....at all. Hehe. Good hearing from you oh mighty Lord of the bbs, and thanks so much for having this here for us!<br>

I would like to see an overview of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>entire</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> creative process.  Showing everything from the scrap drawings that never make the cut all the way to the finished product.  Also it would help if it was backed by some of the logic behind each move.  Why did this piece not go into concept?  What made this one so special?  Was it more practical for design reasons?  Was this design too much alike or too dissimilar to the rest?<br>
<br>
I would also like to see some sort of featured artist section.  This could be a monthly section that could consists of artists from Microsoft, other sources, or even from this forum.<br>
<br>
Finally, I think that some sort of artist awareness section would be nice.  Something that brings people's attention to what they do here as actual art.  Also, it would offer a little bit of direction for those looking to maintain themselves as an artist.  It could be open forum, or it could be feature articles that could be submitted by various sources (much like the featured artist section).  I really like this idea, but I am being sort of vague.  I would be willing to elaborate on request. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thezerosamurai>The Zero Samurai</A> at: 9/27/03 7:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1monkeypunch1>1MonkeyPunch1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/27/03 8:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12816.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/pyapor/manga.txt height=117 width=125></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1>  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I've noticed that many of the &quot;more advanced&quot; (which I feel is an opinion thing) artists on the bbs have been griping about having to deal with the presence of those of us who are either just starting or still trying to get a grasp on the finer details of arting.

This would also welcome a more wide variety of artists to the BBS giving thaem the as to what artisitic enviroment they would actually want.

 Photoshop and art questions has quite a large thread with quite alot of links to various ENTIRE sites FULL of refrence photos. Plus there is google, so i  really think a ref page would be a waste of time. <br>

I didnt mean mature by artist skill level, but actual maturity level. People who will listen to others, and actuly take it to heart. For intance, i used to crit tellign people to learn anatomy and draw from refrence. Not once have i seen them post an anatomy study or show imporvment in that area. Im considering either giving up or cut and pasting the same crit over and over. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
First and foremost, thank you for setting up such a helpful site and putting so much time into teaching us (me at least) how to realise a dream.<br>
<br>
I'm new here, and have spent around 5 months learning from your tutorials. My opinion on content is that;<br>
<br>
As far as basics go, the site is ok. I think maybe some more tips and hints on perspective, like studies of a character in a movement, turning round real fast, crouching; you know? like how to portray a specific movement in a comic.<br>
<br>
Also, the fight segment should be really in depth. I constantly do studies of fight scenes just to get the perspective perfect, the expressions etc. What I would suggest is to get some life studies, like take a pic of an action movie, take a nice fight shot and show us how to stick figure characters in such a fight. I guess this is also perspective<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
I also agree that the site needs maturing, in the sense that the material needs to get more serious, more in depth. What needs to be done to make comic art and concept a profession. maybe a support group<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm 18 and nearing entrance to uni. I love comics and concept but I dropped art at gcse level<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so what to do....know what I mean?<br>
<br>
But one thing I would really like to see and I think most others do too, is the site being a fan site for the PK manga<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . and I know how busy your schedule is, but will that happen anytime soon?<br>
<br>
anyway, thanks again for your help.  <br>

Very good idea. I haven't seen very many marker tutorials on the net and i think it would probably help people who have no idea of how to use them, or why to use them. <br>
<br>
Personally, i'd like to see tuts on how to achieve certain effects with acrylics or watercolour.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mofo09@polykarbonbbs>mofo09</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 1:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12816.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The PolyKarbon re-org</span><hr size=1> how bout a chat room so that we can talk with the people on to talk about art and disgus stuff <p>hoi hoi!!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wsl101>wsl101</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 2:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12816.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://n-son.com/av/funk.php width=93 height=133></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  &gt; Re: The PolyKarbon re-org</span><hr size=1> ...there is a chat room, when you go to the forum index, theres a button up at the top that says poykarbon mIRC chat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mofo09@polykarbonbbs>mofo09</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 2:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12816.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The PolyKarbon re-org</span><hr size=1> but is that only for pk members??
