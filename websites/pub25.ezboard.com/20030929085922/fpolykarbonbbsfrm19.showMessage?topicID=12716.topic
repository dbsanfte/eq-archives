Let me just say that this has been said to be the best of the three, and after the first two breathtaking movies I find it hard to believe, but I know it's going to be awsome. The battle for middle earth, Frodo and Sam get lead into Shelob's web by Gollem, Pippin is thought to be the ring bearer and taken to sanctuary, and Merry apart of the army.I can't wait another 3 months for this to come out &gt;_&lt;<br>
I still haven't read the book yet, I think I'll wait until the next movie comes out, then I'll probably be inspired to read the book.<br>
And does anyone know about the extended version of The Two Towers?I can imagin it would come out in the box-set or something.<br>
Anyone else fallen for the Lord of the Rings movies and book? <p>&quot;Do you believe in love at first sight or do I have to walk past you again??&quot;<br>

<br>
and the books are so cool anyway. Tolkien was a superb writer who combined his love of history, language and mythology to form the beginnings of fantasy as we know it. <br>
<br>
i keep wishing that the days would fly by so i could go see the movie already. then i remember that i have an entire semesters worth of classes between now and then. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *sigh* so i just have to be patient. <br>

<br>
same with the 3rd book. they are absolutely wonderful.  but the movie makes them boring cuz you already know what is gonna happen.  I have since then read the books one more time, but even the first one was good the second time, because I had the picture in my head that the books had put there, and not the movies.  so I really recommend reading them before you finish seeing the movies... or at least try.  <br>
<br>
tolkien was a great writer, man.  he had wicked attention to detail, and everything was so thought out, and I swear he spent like a year planning those books out.  they're amazing tho.  I'm (kinda) reading the silmarrlion right now (I dunno if I spelled that right)  but it's a little dull at the beginning and I found Terry Goodkind so I've read like 4 of his books.  I'm rambling.. silly me, stay on topic!!<br>

Just pure white, now come to think of it i think this movie is probobly the biggest raceist movie ever he said he wont let any of the other races play that movie i dunno why, not even the dressed up people playing as monsters.....<br>
But than again Anime is the same way, if there is any black or other race cultures their potreyed as Bad guys, eh its Japan at least they made their way to draw European ANime looking characters as well as American......<br>

Well, could you quote him in context? The only reason I could think for him to say that is that the stories are set in a Medieval-ish, European-ish setting, so they wanted to make everyone look authentic. But I agree about all the monsters, it doesn't really matter. <p><html>

LoL. He obviously doesn't Cyrid.<br>
<br>
Just to fill you in DeadCell: From what I can tell Cruise is a genral of an AMERICAN army. Through some bizarre twist of events he finds himself in Japan. At first he rejects the culture, but obviously ends up as the Last Samurai. Thats more or less the story. He doesnt look Japanese either he just has long hair a squinty eyes ALL the time. It's part of his allure. <p>~Trunxx<br>

<br>
Why is it that in today's American society people are afraid to say anything slightly racial. As a white American male why am I afraid to say anything about black, asian, or any other race? It seems to me that white males always get the bad rap. &quot;We are trying to keep the black man down&quot; &quot;We are super racist&quot; &quot;If we say something like this we're racist because we think black people are trying to keep us down and it's obviously the opposite&quot;.<br>
<br>
I mean I have plenty of multi racial friends so I in no way frown on any race or creed. But also why is it that in Black comedians sketches its always &quot;Whitey trying to act black or white guys not being able to be cool or play sports or get girls?&quot; I dont get why everything has to be so racial. Everythings so generalized in society and no one ever seems to realise it. And this argument goes both ways, but why is it that things being racial have scared people so much in this day and age that every TV and magazine ad has to have one white, one black, and one asian person in the ad? I've seen this so much. I think race shouldnt be an issue in this day and age and yet it still seperates people a lot, even subconsciously. <p>~Trunxx<br>
