<br>
Her name is Janet Green, but before I can get into the actual story, I have to go into the history.<br>
<br>
The three great City States of the Republic, now a loose confederation(almost ironic right?), was once at war.  Great and bloody was the war, but it ended when a storm swept in from the North.  A great disease spread from the vast wasteland of the Great Northern Desert, it was a people from the desolate sea of rock.  The war ended with the Act of Union, joining the three war weary nations under one massive government.  The three cities fended off the assault, especially the war-like Gielfer who to this day make up the core of the titanic and unwieldy Republican military force.  <br>
<br>
Since then, half a century ago from present day, a raging Cold War has existed between the North and the Republic.  Since then, the omnipresent Hiro Energy Corporation has risen as the premiere energy monopoly, controlling the flow of Hydrogen, the primary fuel source, throughout the land.  The Corporation and the Republic at hard to separate from each other, increasingly difficult to discriminate between government and commerce.<br>
<br>
There was no one named Renee Smith that graduated at college at the age of 14.  <br>
<br>
Once upon a time, there was a 14 year old college graduate named Renee Smith, though she would one day became a nonperson, she became successful and came to be one of the up and coming reachers in the field of genetics.  She wanted to live happily ever after with a successful knight in shining armor and have a little boy and a little girl.  Though... in a twist of fate, she'd fall in love with a nondescript alcoholic janitor that saved her life, but that's a few paragraphs down from now.<br>
<br>
There was no one by the name of Ms. Smith that came to work at the Corporation.  <br>
<br>
One day, Ms. Smith was approached by agents of the Corporation.  She accepted the big fat paycheck and signed a big fat stack of mostly confidentiality related paper work.  Then she began her first day of working for the Corporation.  She was given her own research team and resources that she never could have dreamt of at the university she lived at previously.  It was a nerd's Garden of Eden and then some.<br>
<br>
Renee helped make giant leaps and strides relating to cloning and such in her Genetics Department at the Corporation, they were never reported in public because 'the people weren't ready for it.'  Innocently she thought that it was for the 'Betterment of humanity everywhere', which was what scrawled on the big sign that hung over the doorway of her office.<br>
<br>
One day, there was a little boy named Keith sitting the lobby of Renee's building by two security agents of the Corporation.  She thought it was odd but walked on.  When she got home at about 02:00 from overtime on tweaking the human Genome late, she found her door unlocked and before she could open it, a man opened it from the inside.  He had the strangest red eyes.  He told her that he had been waiting from her and told her to come in.  The little boy named Keith was there too.  The strange red eyed man told her that the boy was her responsibility now and that she would get a large bonus from the Corporation and that the confidentiality agreements she signed applied to the child as well.  He then promptly disappeared when she turned to look at little Keith sitting on a chair.<br>
<br>
Renee liked Keith and became like his mother.  Keith was quiet and never quite smiled right or laughed right or cried right.  She never did find out what became of Keith's parents, asking around the work place didn't result in anything.  Ever so often the Corporation would take Keith in for tests...<br>
<br>
One day, Renee was brought to a nondescript warehouse area and taken to a nondescript service elevator that went about a quarter of a mile straight down in two minutes during which she questioned the agents who denied knowledge of where and why.  It was a high security research facility filled with shiny white floors and too many people with high powered rifles.  She was told of the transfer of her people to a different facility.  They were to be folded into a larger group working on what her work had helped make possible.  Keith was ten now, six years older than when he had been put with Renee.  Renee had gotten use to his quirks.  She was about twenty five old now, having worked for the Corporation for slightly less than six years.  <br>
<br>
There is no Keith.<br>
<br>
One day, agents of the Corporation come right after Renee arrives home, just as she's putting little Keith to bed.  It's the red eyed man from six years before.  They are here to take Keith away.  Renee doesn't know why and tries to stop him but she can do nothing at all and Keith disappears from her life.  Renee inquires about Keith but is threatened by the Corporation and she stays quiet.<br>
<br>
Having been born during the time of the Act of Union, she had been brain washed, just like everyone even down to present day, to hate the Northerners by the Republic.  She thought she was doing a good thing, for the 'Betterment of mankind', all her genetic research had been funneled into this project being performed under a nondescript warehouse district.  What was it that she was doing?  Helping to research and develop an indestructible humanoid biological weapon of course, immune to the most lethal biological and chemical weapons, highly robust, and a most deadly predator.  <br>
<br>
Also at this time, the Republic began establishing relations in the Eastern half of the continent, the up to now unmolested city states of the East could be a great ally to the fight between the Northerners.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, Ms. Smith fell in love with the head researcher, a strange character name Munroe, and they together helped finalize the development phase.  The first step would be to modify the DNA of a desirable existing host.  That host would be Renee Smith who was reluctant at first but then convinced by  Monroe.  The second would be to use the modified DNA to create clones using donor eggs.  Those eggs would also be Renee Smith's.  And those donor eggs would be used to impregnate a host to create a prototype.  And because of the fact that this had never been done before, Renee volunteered herself at the urging of Munroe for the 'Betterment of humanity everywhere' and because he wanted to see their research to go to fruition.<br>
<br>
After three eggs, one finally takes and she becomes pregnant.  They never do decide on a name for her before Renee disappears and destroys all the research data by resetting the servers by hacking the maintenance program and altering it so that it formats the server and both the backup servers.  <br>
<br>
Why that happens is this.  One late night, she logs onto the system under Munroe's login, she knows his login because she's seen his log on so many times and has remembered the key strokes, almost subconsciously.  Knowing that it's a mistake, she tries to log out but some items catch her eyes.  She makes sure that no one was looking and browses through random reports to the higher ups in the Corporation.  Ms. Smith is alarmed at her discovery of what became of Keith and several other children. Frankenstein experiments to create a first generation super soldier using nanotechnology to alter the host's DNA one cell at a time, turned in weapons, like walking dead in a sense, they have no identity, they have no life, all they become are weapons and tools.  Tools to increase the power of the Corporation so that her beloved Republic will eventually turn into a puppet government controlled completely by the Corporation.<br>
<br>

I like how that corporation that controls the hydrogen their nickname's H.E.C.  .Kind of ironic since the guy with red eyes in a way portrays the devil. <br>
<br>
 So the corporation is using genetic enhancements in this case, nanotechnology to alter Keith's DNA structure to make him a &quot;living weapon&quot; .  What kind of weapons are we talking about here? Will Keith be infused with orgainic weapons that come out of his body or will he be some kind of cyborg bent on destroying anyone whom the corporations fear might stand in their way of achieving their ultimate goal?<br>
<br>
Now what is Keith? Was he a test tube baby genetically altered in a lab or was he a regular baby until the corporation took him away from his parents? Lol they are breaking some heavy duty  laws like inhuman acts.  So what does Renee  plan on doing? Your story is pretty detailed and interesting, keep up the good work.  Maybe Renee will try to help Keith find ehat ever is left of his humanity in attempt to bring his mind into reality freeing him from the chaotic control of his creators.<br>
