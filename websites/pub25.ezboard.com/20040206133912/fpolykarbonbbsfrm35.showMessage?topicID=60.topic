<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Introduction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Hello and welcome to my first tutorial. In this tutorial, I will try to give some insight in the way that I work. It's not carved in stone or anything, so If you do it diffently, that's totally cool, as long as it works for you. This tutorial isn't going to learn you how to draw either, there's enough of that out there already, and it basically comes down to practice. Some steps might also seem rather obvious to you, but if you're kinda new to the whole cartoon stuff, I suggest you read it all, since there are some tips and tricks encorporated, that just might come in handy. I'm also using Adobe Photoshop in this tutorial, so some basic knowledge of that program would come in very handy. I'm not going to explain all the tools, but I'll try to keep it all easy to follow. Any questions regarding photoshop can easily be solved by looking up some info on it through art sites or a basic search request at an internet search engine. That being said, all that's left is to wish you happy reading and cartooning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 1: Materials</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1. Paper</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Now as you might have guessed: paper is one of the most important things you need when you want to draw.  But there's more to it than meets the eye. First of all, get a pack of 500 sheets of printing paper, it's fine for sketching and doodling, it's cheap and holds pencil and ink well. Some artists, that use computers extensively, make their final works on plain printing paper too. I however prefer to make the final artwork on heavier paper, since it's more durable. Get something at your local artstore, that's between 160 and 200 grams per square meter (gr/m^2)., that's really smooth,  as if there's a coating on it (wich sometimes is the case). That way you have the best change of  having a nice smooth working area that holds ink well. It should cost you about $10 for 20 sheets. I suggest getting standard A4 sized paper, since that's the size of most scanners.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2. Pencils</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Pencils come in a wide variety. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, for just drawing and sketching comics anything from a local bookstore can do. Of course you could also get a nice (expensive) set of mechanical pencils, but it all comes down to shifting layers of carbon onto paper. Pencils do however come in different 'hardnesses'. The spectrum runs from about 6H through HB to 6B. 6H is very hard, and leaves a really light line, 6B is the exact opposite: very soft and gives an almost black line. HB is inbetween. It's all a matter of personal preferance, so I suggest you get yourself a 3H, an HB and a 3B pencil and see what you like best. B-pencils are really nice for doodling around. For reasons that will become clear in due course,  I recommend using  3H pencils for final sketches and final works.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3. Erasers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Shown are 2 types of erasers: the basic book store one (small white) and a kneadable eraser (gray). The kneadable eraser is what I would suggest. It can be purchased at artstores, but probably bookstores/office shops have them too. They can be stretched and compressed when needed, giving you more control over your erasing. Stamping it on a pencil line a few times can sometimes be enough! When erasing, always stroke AWAY from yourself, to prevent the paper from rippling!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4. Inking tools</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What type of tool you use for inking is down to personal preference as well. When you are a newbie,  just get some cheap fineliners and practice with them. When you're ready for it, it might be a good idea to purchase some tech pens. The two major brands in tech pens are Rotring and Staedtler. I personally prefer Staedtler, but differences are minimal. They usually are about $20-$30, but they'll last you a lifetime! (I've been using the same pen for over 10 years). A size 0.5 would be a good one to start with.<br>
Now if you are looking for a challenge, you can try brush inking. It's easier to apply line weight with brushes, it also takes years of practice. I won't go into detail here, but there's one rule of thumb for brush inking: NEVER safe money on brushes! Get high quality brushes, or don't do it at all and stick to your tech pens.<br>
You could additionally buy some markers, to fill in large black spaces.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5. Triangle Protractor</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Now this might strike you as odd. Most people will know this thing as a tool from math class. You could basically use a ruler, with or without inking ridge, but I usually find it very useful to be able to draw right angles and parallel lines straight away. very handy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6. Rubber Glove(s)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Now this is something I only tried out recently. It was really hot over here, and my hands were really sweaty when working. And since I'm left handed, I found myself smudging the ink all over the paper. That really sucks. Putting on rubber gloves reduces working comfort (it's a bit tight and your hands sweat like mad inside), but the change of ruining your work is reduced a good deal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>7. India Ink]</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
For those who want to try brush inking. If the ink is drying up to be greyish, leave the flask open for 2 or 3 days, so some water can evaporate from the ink. Should result in thicker, darker ink.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>8. Home Made Mold</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you want to make a small comic/cartoon strip, like in the newspaper, this might be a handy tool. Decide on what size you want it to be and scale that up so that you can work on a larger area than the final result. Make a mold out of thick paper or cardboard with the dimensions of one strip. This helps you lay out the outline of your strip very quickly without having to measure everything everytime and making sure all lines are at right angles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 2: Sketching/Storyboarding</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Now that we've got all our tools and materials sorted out, let's start this thing off. I'll illustrate this tutorial with one picture of a strip I made recently, using most of the materials listed above. A computer with Adobe Photoshop will also turn out to be a very handy tool later on, so try to get hold of something like that.<br>
I usually start with a really rough sketch, in wich I try to find out what camera angle(s) work best, and what should be where. This is also the moment to find out if you can actuall DRAW what's in your head. If you discover in this stage that there are some difficulties you can't overcome in a short period of time (because it takes more practice), this is the stage to think of alternative methods to achieve the same effect. If there's text involved, this also is the stage to find out how much space roughly is needed to fit it in later (wich we will do digitally). As you might have guessed, repeat this step until you're happy with the basic design. It doesn't have to be anything fancy yet, as long as you get the basic idea down. This also is a good way for storing strips you thought up if you're memory isn't that great and haven't got time to draw the whole thing right away. Just storyboard it, and get back to it later.<br>
<br>
I used printer paper and 3H pencils.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 3: Final Sketch</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
As you can see in the picture on the left, I've worked out the basic sketch on a new piece of (printing) paper. I just made it much more detailed, made some basic changes (look at the monitors in both pics),  and I clearly marked the definite lines. This stage can still be a bit sketchy, but the cleaner you get it, the better. And I'm still using my trusty 3H pencil.<br>
<br>
Note that I like to make my strips more interesting by adding little 'jokes' with the layout. You can see clearly, that a part of the bottom frameline is invisible. If applied in the right way, stuff like this can be a subtle way to make your strip more enjoyable to read.  Sometimes the boundary line is also removed where a textballoon intercepts with the frame. I applied this in other pictures of this strip (I put it in at the end of this tutorial).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 4: Tracing and Inking </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Now this is probably THE most crucial step in the whole process, and also the most annoying one if things go wrong. This is also the last step that takes place in the analogue world. At this moment, it's time to get that high quality specially purchased paper out. The idea is to lightly trace the final sketch, keeping all the lines you want to keep, and leaving out those sketchy strokes. If you've got loads of money, you could get a light box from an art shop or something. If you like building stuff, you can easily make one yourself, with a piece of glass, some wood, a lamp (TL-tube) and an adaptor. Be careful with electricity though kids! I'm not responsible for any injuries! Neh, me, I'm just lazy and I use mother nature. Just put your final sketch up against the window, press or tape (with easy removable tape!!!) your nice heavy paper onto it and trace. Now of course, this will only work during daytime...Wich can become a problem during the winters, if you're a really busy man. It's best to use a hard pencil for this, if you weren't doing that already. So 2, 3 or 4H should be fine. Don't press to hard, avoid making indents in the paper and just softly copy your sketch.<br>
<br>
When you traced your sketch and get back to your desk, refine the drawing a bit. Take out wobbly lines and maybe accentuate some lines, just so you are 100% sure what to ink, and what not. Ink carefully. If you got the paper I suggested, the risk of bleeding line should be minimal, as long as you don't work extremely slow, though drawing straight lines with a normal ruler can sometimes cause some bleeds, but those mostly happen at the frameborder, and can be removed digitally later. Decide wich line to trace with your inking pen, and after every finished line or curve, stop in order to look at your picture. This allows ink to dry while you decide on your next line. Be very careful not to smudge the ink with the palm of your hand! This can really ruin things and force you to trace the final sketch again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 5: Scanning</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial4.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
At this point, we leave the real  world, and enter the digital domain. Put your picture under the scanner when you finished inking and all ink dried up. Open up your scanner dialog screen, to scan the result into a program like Adobe Photoshop. Use the following settings:<br>
<br>
-Black and white (sometimes called line art)<br>
-300 DPI<br>
<br>
300 DPI is the standard for publication. Your monitor is 72 DPI, so the pic will be scaled down to fit on your screen. Some people will advice you to scan in Grayscale, and then use the levels dialog in Photoshop to fix the lines. I strongly recommend you not to do this! Scanning in B&amp;W will give you something like the picture you see at the left. As you can see, some lines come out really ugly, like the frameline I enclosed in red. Don't worry about this!<br>
Scanning in B&amp;W has the great advantage that, as long as you didn't make them too dark, you don't have to erase your pencil lines in the final drawing, reducing risk of smudging and destroying your paper!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 6: Cleaning Up</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial5.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, let's make our scanned image a little sexier. Using some handy photoshop tools. Completion of this step should result in something similar to the picture on the left. As you can see, that looks a lot better than the originally scanned B&amp;W version.<br>
First of all, get rid of unwanted anomalies. Little line bleeds can be removed with basic photoshop tools like the polygonal lasso tool and deleting the selection, or a brush with the color white. If you look at the picture that came with step 5, you'll notice the ugly frame outline. To fix this, just use the line tool with the appropriate width and make smoother outline.<br>
<br>
When you fixed all that could be fixed, go to to the photoshop menu: Image &gt; Mode, and select 'Grayscale'. This will enable use to use greys in our picture, instead of just black and white. Go to the filter menu: Filter &gt; Blur &gt; Gaussian Blur. A dialog box will pop up. For a picture with resolution 300 DPI, set the blur to about 1,0 pixels. Click okay, and be amazed. Your picture should now look incredibly smooth, while remaining sharp. If we had scanned in grayscale, and used the levels dialog, we would eventually get something similar, yet not as dark black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 7: Adding Text</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wanadoo.nl/jw.ockhorst/tutorial/tutorial6.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Almost finished now. It's time to put in the text. Just put it into your picture using the type tool, adjust font and size to your liking and position it. To make a fancy text balloon, you can do 2 things. You could've drawn it in on paper, when you were sketching and inking. A more flexible approach is to use photoshop. Create a new layer on top of you lineart. In that layer, make an oval selection (it's under the rectangular marque menu as 'oval marque tool'), large enough to fit in the text. Position the selection (pressing on the inside of the selection and dragging it around while keeping the mouse key pressed) and fill it with pure black. Now go to the selection menu: Select &gt; Modify &gt; Contract. Enter a numerical value somewhere between 4 and 8, depending on taste (I use 5). With white as your background color, now press the &lt;delete&gt; key. And presto, a nice speech bubble. Put a tail on it, and customize it a bit, and your all done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Step 8: The Finished Result</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you worked at a larger scale than it's going to be printed, you can now resize it again. Go to Image &gt; Image Size, and enter the new dimensions. I suggest you use percentages, not pixels, select constrain proportions and set resample image to bicubic. Click okay. Safe your picture as a PSD photoshop file (it's always wise to safe inbetween steps too of course). If you want to publish your picture on the net,  bring up the Image Size dialog again, and change the resolution from 300 to 72 (your monitors resolution). Safe this file to, but as a JPG or GIF file (do NOT delete or overwrite your original photoshop file, always keep that, no matter what!).<br>
Well, that wraps it all up, you are all done, and should now have something similar to this (sorry, I'm too lazy to translate it):<br>
