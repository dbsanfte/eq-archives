I'm gonna use it for a game i'm makin.<br>
<br>
318 BCU:<br>
Jump Drive, the same basic drive as is used present day, which creates a rift in space-time that nullifies known physics in which Standard Universe 'STUFF'(mass/energy) is exponentially increased is accidentally discovered by a German/Scotish team under European Union funding to create faster than light communications.  Immediately, Russia, European Space Agencies, Joint American Canada Air and Space Association, and Japan, pool their funds together for a prototype ship that could transport resources from The Moon and Mars to Earth faster.<br>
<br>
304 BCU:<br>
The prototype Jump Ship is completed and proves very remarkable.  The resources going into Earth increase exponentially as more Jump Ships are built, as a result off world colonies became popular with millions of job shortages.  Earth's superpowers became increasingly more powerful as their resources increased.  The Russians recovered from their economic depression very quickly.  The Expansionistic Russian Governement with a strong longing for their former glory began to mobilze to their military forces, increasing them greatly leading to tension with the West and China.  The West began to mobilize troops in Germany<br>
<br>
299 BCU:<br>
WAR!  Russia launched a surprise invasion by moving their troops through the civilian transit so no one was the wiser.  Russian forces arrived in coordinated mass along the Polish border startling the international community... a little.  Russian troops moved with total lack of resistance through Poland.  The West moved Naval forces to the North Sea and began to mass produce military Jump Ships.<br>
<br>
297 BCU:<br>
The war was at a stand still.  The first Jump Ship to Jump Ship battles occured with hundreds of lives lost on each ship lost.<br>
<br>
287 BCU:<br>
After the great war of attrition, Western Russia and most of Central Europe was smoldering in ruins.  Many of the great cities of America have beed flattened by many Jump Ships.  The West had the East remove their colonists from Mars deported and a embargo was declared which would stand for ten years.<br>
<br>
270 BCU:<br>
The Pacifos Unification Act is drafted and signed unifying North America, South America, and many parts of Africa.  The West was still greatly Xenophobic of the East which had joined their maverick neighbor.  Smuggling of PUA resources from Africa supplied China<br>
<br>
260 BCU:<br>
The PUA test the first long range Jump Ships in order to colonize out of system worlds.  The East despite hard times manage to produce a Intersystem Jump Ship whcih was more primitive(of course).<br>
<br>
258 BCU:<br>
Due to the sucessful Intersystem Jump Ships, prebuilt colony Jump Ships which had been rushed from a three year build time to a two year build time to defeat the East's program.  The word Starship is coined to describe Intersystem Jump Ships.<br>
<br>
257 BCU:<br>
A suitable planet(any planet with tolerable gravity) is discovered by a scout ship and the colonists begin their journey a one Universal Standard Month later.  The first colony ships created last year(Unificated StarShip) jumped but something went terrible wrong, the navigational system on two of the four ships fail due to improper installation, one of the malfunctioning ships crashes into the other malfunctioning ships causing explosive decompression.  moving off course they moved into the unknown, they were never found in known space to date.  <br>
<br>
PUA establish the first colony.<br>
<br>
Losses were morned and forgotten in the exictement of their victory over the East.<br>
<br>
245 BCU:<br>
The East sends their first colony ships which faired much better than PUA's first attempt.<br>
<br>
240 BCU:<br>
The first Jump Beacon is created.  Jump beacons linked colonies to fuel depots and onto other colonies allowing the civilian population to intersystems travel they also prevent ships from being lost, PUA scales back the amount of ships that carry Jump Drives.  The economic of civilization is increased greatly.<br>
<br>
237 BCU:<br>
The East establishes the twelveth and thirteenth human colonies.<br>
<br>
235 BCU:<br>
Pirates!  Pirate Cartels appear in the outtermost colonies, the resource rich Fringe Colonies, and raid the resource laden transports that travel to the, resource barren but industry heavy and consumer rich, Core Colonies to be processed.  Pirate Cartel raiders(Raths in slang) become near legendary.  The Pirates cartels are nomatic and nearly impossible to attack.  PUA begins to escort the merchant vessels heavily.  The East offers its services due to its lack of materiale` going into their pockets.  The PUA denouces it as a trick evil.  Xenophobia is still rampant even though the war has been over for many decades.  The East desperate for resources appeal to the pirates, the pirates accept to sell them resources as their previous markets were had been few and far between due to PUA propaganda and common sense.<br>
<br>
234 BCU:<br>
The Pirate resources begin to help the East do much research.  The East know that they cannot rival the shear amount of ships maintained by the PUA so their resources were put into their research program.  The East moves their capitol off world to prevent hostilities.  The PUA is relieved but keeps their intellegence program monitoring them.  <br>
<br>
233 BCU:<br>
The East sign a treaty with each other and form the Eastern Guild and begin withdrawing their population(6/10s of Earth's population(!)) from Earth.  Xenophobia begins to decrease in PUA.  The Guild research program begins to equalize with the PUA's.  PUA intellegence realises this and the government puts more funding into their intellegence program. <br>
<br>
229 BCU:<br>
The Guild removes all the population that wanted to leave, a small portion stayed in their homeland and became seperate from the Guild.  The Guild, knowing there were insurgents in their government, located a remote planet(TerraNova) that could be colonized and moved their whole government yet again to TerraNova cutting off communications with PUA and outside forces minus the Pirates.<br>
<br>
Xenophobia spikes.<br>
<br>
228 BCU:<br>
The PUA's industry collapses because of the dependency on Fringe Colony resources with a sudden spike of Pirate activity.  Without any new major sources of resources and a greater Pirate activity, industry grinded to a halt.  The PUA's economy drops sharply, PUA fleet scraps many ships reducing the number of to about two hundred which made the Pirate activity much more important to stop.<br>
<br>
227 BCU:<br>
PUA fleet scientists discover that the gravitational flow of star sytems is disrupted when rifts are opened for a ong period of time.  Jump Beacons were moved to the outer rim of systems, atleast one UAM(Universal Astronomical Measurement) from the farthest orbit.  The economy begins to stablize as pirate activity decreases with the lower amount of resources coming in.  PUA begins to colonize new worlds.  The Guild is effected by the resource shortage as well, jsut not as much as is able to carry their research to a farther level.<br>
<br>
220 BCU:<br>
The economy stablizes and begins to recover, PUA keeps a large amount of materials in stock.<br>
<br>
216 BCU: <br>
Pirate weaponry increases in refinement, PUA suspect that they have insurgents in the Guild or their own infrastructure or have stolen information and wreakage from military vessels or had bribed former PUA scientists.  More funding was put into PUA intellegence services which began to monitor government employes with knowledge into their weapon programs.<br>
<br>
The Guild is silent but is supplying the Pirate Cartels with weapons under the table.<br>
<br>
207 BCU:<br>
The Guild now spans three star systems.<br>
<br>
204 BCU:<br>
Unified Police Organisation is formed to police the small amount of Earth colonies due to pirate threats in PUA colonies because 'policing' is more accepted consumer wise than 'military action'.  It is given little to start off, it is allocated small and obsolete ships from the military fleet of the PUA because the PUA military fleet itself is rather thinly spread(537 ships spread along 7 star systems and numerous fuel depot).<br>
<br>
180 BCU:<br>
The fledgling organization known as the UPO is moved onto the Fringe Worlds to better control the Pirate activity.<br>
<br>
100 BCU:<br>
All's quiet, the Guild becomes more secretive as they begin rapid research into technology that rivals the PUA<br>
<br>
21 BCU:<br>
The first of many incursions hinting at civil war when Kytan, System Governer of the Wotan Fringe World and UPO President, attacked a PUA ship which was escorting his transports to a different Core Colony for the captain's own profit.<br>
<br>
20 BCU: <br>
WAR!  Uncompliant with the PUA forces, Kytan uses the Raths detained in his facilities, to equip his ships with the best Technologies of the Guild.  The PUA, learning of this, declares war on the Guild.  Kytan launches a attack on the neighboring Fringe Colony and takes it over.  PUA masses a large fleet near Wotan's nearest Jump Beacon and attacks, the Guild's fleet itnercepts the PUA and udderly destroyign the PUA fleet.<br>
<br>
0 ACC:<br>
After a long war of attrition, the Guild and Kytan is able to fight their way to Earth.  Kytan crowns himself as emperor and creates a Rome-like Republic government consisting of a Senate consiting of the governers of the Core Worlds(which obviously held more sway over the voters because they had the most money) and Fringe Worlds.  It is called the Earth Defence Alliance because the Core and Fringe Worlds had to sign a pact to join it.  Most of the Pirate Raths are hired as freighter escort captains.  The Guild(which is now known as theTechnocracy because of their total devotion to technology and production) manages to produce more powerful weapons than the EDA or PUA before it. <br>
<br>
EDA fleet is established.<br>
<br>
The EDA Legions is established.<br>
<br>
The Technocracy returns to it's secretcy.<br>
<br>
9 ACC:<br>
The Praetorian Guard is established by Kytan to protect the Earth and her government.  The guard is composed of the finest of Fleet and Legionaires.<br>
<br>
The Imperial Intellegence Service is established, mainly to watch over the Technocacy and their testing grounds know as: 'Wonderland'.<br>
<br>
200 ACC:<br>
200 years, the EDA has reigned supreme over most of the known Human race.  Corruption has cast a shadow onto the once grand EDA government.  The Core Worlds rules all, their will bends the human race to their ends.  <br>
<br>
Pirates still raid freighters and pirates are hired as freighter captains.<br>
<br>
The Technocracy still is secretive as it's ever been.  <br>
<br>
The Media is controlled by EDA.<br>
<br>
The Fringe Worlds are owned by the Core World elite now, conditions on them have deteriorated to the point of inhabitability... but people toil without hope, people suffer without voice.  They have grown restless and the whisper of revolution dwells in the partially recycled air. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uspyders17.showPublicProfile?language=EN>spyders17</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/18/02 3:13:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/spyder17/yaggi3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Game History TimeLine</span><hr size=1> whoa nelly.....long<br>

it's rather populous here and you get good serious reviews...<br>
grrrrr...silly people...I can see if you were naive and had no idea you were posting in the wrong forum and apologized for your newbieness...but being so bold as to do it on purpose and then unapologetically tell a mod not to do their job because YOU mistakenly believe the proper forum doesn't get enough traffic for you....on that logic I'll start urinating in a busy intersection...when an officer asks me to please go to a bathroom for that I'll say &quot;no that won't be acceptable I'd rather do it here because it suits me better&quot;....<br>
Grrrrrr....anyway I hope the next time you think about doing something like that the image of me and a couple other PKer's urinating at various intersections on your trip to work pops to mind<br>
<br>
as far as a crit goes...it's a good rough sheet to work from and keep as a reminder...but if you were to hand it to anyone else they wouldn't know what they were reading...you should expand on the more important parts a bit and make it more legible<br>
