<br>
Prologue<br>
<br>
The Sroni were a very peaceful race, but this peace came at a cost far greater than they would ever tell.  Two generations ago war ravaged every continent on the Sroni home world of Seronya.  When the dust had settled after the last battle, the surviving few realized that there was less than one third of the planets original population left to sort through the ashes and bury the dead that numbered in the billions.  After this war the Sroni knew that they would need to change their ways from war and destruction to ways of peace.  The few survivors knew that if they did not do this, they would not survive very much longer.  <br>
<br>
Five generations passed before the new government, The New Sronian Order, had restored the planet to economic well-being.  After this feat the governments’ next goal was to explore and colonize other planets in the solar system.  This was the most influential goal ever set on Seronya.  By the time the Sroni had started exploring other solar systems they found that they were far more advanced than any of their stellar neighbors.  They were also able to travel the stars twice as fast as any other race they had met.  This advanced technology would lead them to a rather damning salvation.<br>
<br>
The Sroni advanced rapidly because they did not fight with each other.  The most important technologies were medicine and space travel.  Through out their travels the Sroni formed many unwritten treaties with many of the species they met.  Most of these species thought the treaty would fall apart after a battle or two; but to their surprise the Sroni were present for every battle, even if they had a treaty with both sides.  Almost all of these treaties included an agreement that the Sroni would offer their medical services for safe passage through a species territory and protection while their medical services were being used.  The Sroni hoped that their presence in battles as universal medics would inspire these species to become more like them and stop fighting amongst each other.  Many of the species would have strived to be more like the Sroni if it were not for the politics of their territory.<br>
<br>
Then came the day that would change them forever, the day they discovered the Wroth.  The day they discovered the Wroth was the day they realized the Rengalii had been conquered and most of the survivors enslaved.  The Sroni learned this from a few Rengalii refugees that had crossed their borders in the past few hours.  The Sroni knew that the Rengalii home world had a population of thirteen billion.  Roughly 250,000 refugees had crossed their borders so far asking for whatever protection could be offered.  This terrified the Sroni, they knew that the Rengalii were of great military strength.  Every ship in the Rengalii military showed as much advancement in technology as the Sroni, and every crewmember was very well trained.  The Rengalii had been at war with the Wroth for only one day before the Sroni knew what was going on.<br>
<br>
The Sroni knew the Wroth would come.  It was inevitable.  Their worst fear was that they would not be able to form a treaty with the Wroth.  They knew it was almost impossible, but were compelled to try.  The Sroni sent two ships to on a diplomatic mission; since the odds were grim the crews were volunteers.  These ships were two of the smallest ships in the fleet, and had only a skeleton crew on each.  Their instructions were to travel to the Rengalii home world of Cyron and try to negotiate a treaty.  If they made contact with any Wroth ships on the way there, they were to state that they were on a diplomatic mission and ask for an escort to Cyron.  This is where the tale starts.<br>

The Sroni were a very peaceful race, and far more advanced than any of their stellar neighbors.  They were able to travel the stars twice as fast as any other race in their part of the galaxy.  This technology would lead them to a damning salvation.  Other than advancing their technology, the Sroni traded rare goods found only on their planet materials to advance their technology and medicine. They were never actively involved in any of the regions wars however; it was not uncommon for both sides of a battle to have a Sroni medical ship behind their front lines.  They would even send scouts to search for survivors among the drifting ships.  Despite all of their technology the Sroni were still in their infancy, less than three generations had passed from when they first flew among the clouds to when they were soaring through the stars.  Then came the day that would change them forever, the day they discovered the Wroth.<br>
<br>
The day they discovered the Wroth was the day they realized the Rengalii had been conquered and enslaved this made the Sroni uneasy because the Rengalii were of great military strength.  Every ship was almost as advanced as the Sroni and every crewmember was very well trained.  The Rengalii had been at war with the Wroth for nearly twenty days before the Sroni knew what was going on.  They learned of this as dozens of ships approached their boarders and asked for whatever protection could be offered.<br>
<br>
The Sroni knew the Wroth would come, they saw it as inevitable.  The question to them was if it would be in the spirit of peace or war.  The Sroni sent two ships to work for peace.  These ships were to travel to the Rengalii home world of Cyron and try to negotiate, if they made contact with a Wroth ship on the way there, they were to stop and request a diplomatic escort.  This is where the tail starts.<br>

<br>
&gt;The Sroni were a very peaceful race, and far more advanced than any of their stellar neighbors. They were able to travel the stars twice as fast as any other race in their part of the galaxy. -This is a neat fact and I like the way it's presented it also sets up the kind of atlantis type society<br>
<br>
&gt;This technology would lead them to a damning salvation. - This is totally oxymoronic...you can't be damned and acheive salvation at the same time..<br>
<br>
&gt;Other than advancing their technology, the Sroni traded rare goods found only on their planet materials to advance their technology and medicine. - I also love this it shows their connection with other races as well as where they aquired their technology...<br>
<br>
&gt;They were never actively involved in any of the regions wars however; it was not uncommon for both sides of a battle to have a Sroni medical ship behind their front lines. They would even send scouts to search for survivors among the drifting ships. - this emphasizes the peace loving nature ...and by the way...a semicolon is used in the place of a conjunction...not with one...you should get rid of &quot;however&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> espite all of their technology the Sroni were still in their infancy, less than three generations had passed from when they first flew among the clouds to when they were soaring through the stars. - is the race in it's infancy (that would mean a really low population) you should say the technology is in it's infancy...however for certain technology's three generations is a lot...(look at 3 generations in computers...) either way they aquired this knowledge quickly...which might mean they don't make the best use they could out of it...I like this it could just be refined a little<br>
<br>
&gt; Then came the day that would change them forever, the day they discovered the Wroth. - This is kind of ominous and has good foreshadowing...not bad I'm not totally sure if it fits in this part of the intro yet...<br>
<br>
&gt;The day they discovered the Wroth was the day they realized the Rengalii had been conquered and enslaved this made the Sroni uneasy because the Rengalii were of great military strength. - I think I already told you about this...first of all the first sentence is a bit repetitive (I know so is this one) ..It would be better as &quot;The day they discovered the wroth they realised the rengalii were defeated&quot; or something like that as well that should be one sentence (I just spotted a run on sentence)...small natural sentences are easier to read especially in action areas...if you want to emphasize a more relaxed scene us long sentences with lots of description...and as I said before...uneasy isn't used quite right...<br>
<br>
&gt; Every ship was almost as advanced as the Sroni and every crewmember was very well trained. -  This could be rearranged to make it easier to read as well...but the idea is that they are equal to the sroni but more aggressive<br>
<br>
&gt;The Rengalii had been at war with the Wroth for nearly twenty days before the Sroni knew what was going on. They learned of this as dozens of ships approached their boarders and asked for whatever protection could be offered. - I like the longer time period as opposed to one day...it emphasizes distance between the races...20 is probably a little long but 1 is a little short<br>
<br>
&gt; The Sroni knew the Wroth would come, they saw it as inevitable. The question to them was if it would be in the spirit of peace or war. - this is also nice it sets up the story very well<br>
<br>
&gt; The Sroni sent two ships to work for peace. These ships were to travel to the Rengalii home world of Cyron and try to negotiate, if they made contact with a Wroth ship on the way there, they were to stop and request a diplomatic escort. This is where the tail starts. - this is pretty much equal to the new version...except the new one is a bit more detailed...and you spelt tale properly :-)<br>

<br>
I doubt the damning salvation will work at all...it's too backwards...<br>
would it mean they are outcast due to being saved...or saved due to being outcast...<br>
if you add religion to that it gets even crazier...I'm not sure you can get it to work...it's too weird to try and think about...be sure that's what you want to say...maybe get a dictionary or thesaurus out to find a better way to word it...<br>

things like &quot;terribly good&quot; do work...because they can be justified logically if used in the proper context...<br>
