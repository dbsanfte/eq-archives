<br>
Introduction<br>
<br>
The year is 2073,<br>
Individual terrorist and rebel groups<br>
have joined forces against the higher-powers <br>
of this world...<br>
The two gaint groups have waged war for over 30<br>
long years and is a constant threat to human existance.<br>
As the losing group, the rebels decide to manipulate <br>
human genes, making them stronger, faster, <br>
deadlier killing machines.<br>
First they conducted experiments on thier own, who willingly gave to the cause, once they discovered<br>
the serum was not perfected yet they began experimenting<br>
on the people...<br>
<br>
Main char<br>
<br>
Hayate, codename: Ninja.<br>
<br>
Hayate is one of the most <br>
recent abducties to be injected<br>
with the serum, after being<br>
abducted he puts up a fight and<br>
so the mind control chip is<br>
implanted, erasing his previous <br>
life's memories. Not all of his<br>
memories are lost though he gains<br>
parts back through his dreams and<br>
nightmares. Once he has learnt<br>
enough to know he shouldn't<br>
be fighting for the rebels, he fights<br>
his way out of the rebel's underground<br>
compound in search of answers... <br>
<br>
I also thought of having Hayate's girlfriend turned, and since she is the daughter of a dojo master... she's gonna kiss A55!!!<br>
<br>
Things i need help with...<br>
Names of the rebels and the rebel group,<br>
Who the big bad badguy is and why he's doin it,<br>
among other stuff...<br>
any idea's will be greatly apretiated!  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phobos@polykarbonbbs>Phobos</A> at: 9/20/03 10:26 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pencilsoldier>Pencil Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 11:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freewebs.com/pencilsoldier/pencils.txt  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja comic</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Individual terrorist and rebel groups<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ya know its been done. But there is always a way to manipulate things so it is original. So, don't let people say you are copying. You're not. Just make sure you incorporate your own ideas in the story. Just a few suggestions.<br>
  Ok, about your story. Maybe have the bad guy a person who is keeping the war going for his own purposes. Or to really have a twist, maybe have the main character be a clone of the main bad guy, or a brother or something, give them some kinda connection. I know it sounds a little unoriginal, but like I said, incorporate some new ideas. Maybe, he was one of the rejected subjects, the ones you said were made when the serum was &quot;wrong&quot;, but maybe the serum was better than they thought and his skills increase rapidly.<br>
  About the names, get a thesaurus and look up cool words and then find a new, better word for them. Or use a foreign language dictionary and change the word.<br>
 Hope these help. I'll be chacking back here often, so post again if you have any more questions. <p>We are the knights who say NI!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phobos@polykarbonbbs>Phobos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/22/03 8:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja comic</span><hr size=1> I was thinking of having the opposite group,a higher powered group, who gave the serum's basic code to the rebels, but they think they have invented it. there's also a spy in there who's working for the higher powered people, and maybe he gets ratted out and &quot;chopped up!!&quot;<br>

   Alright, that would be cool, the transformation thing, that's what I'm talking about, change other ideas and mold them to become your own. Incorporate your own ideas. That is a great skill to have when writing stories and stuff like that.<br>
    I had an idea about the memory-loss. Maybe he was originally a top soldier or osmethin for the other side. And now he doesn't know where his loyalties are. Sound good? Maybe he has flash backs where his &quot;old self&quot; takes over and he wants to fight his own team. Like he goes into a pit of rage where the memories/nightmares take over. Reply and tell me what you think, I'll be checking back regularly.<br>

i feel i'm getting somewhere with this!<br>
here's a bio on Natsume...<br>
 <br>
 Natsume, codename: Shinobi.<br>
<br>
     Natsume is Hayate's girlfriend and<br>
was chosen to be the first female<br>
to be tested on when she attacked<br>
the troopers holding Hayate captive.<br>
     Natsume's father owns a dojo<br>
for ninjitsu training and so naturally<br>
she has been trained in ninjitsu. <br>
As she is one of the best of her style <br>
and has been injected with the serum <br>
her abilities can only grow.<br>
     She also is implanted with the mind <br>
control chip which has the same<br>
defectivity as Hayate's, she regains<br>
control faster because of her desire<br>
to be with Hayate.<br>
<br>
p.s. i like the flash backs and the opposite side thing,<br>
but the two fighting sides are both bad!<br>
one's govermental powers<br>
and the other's Rebels/terrorists (who wants to be ruled by that!)<br>
and then there's a hidden even bigger power, similar to the 12 people in MGS2:SOL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dakarot@polykarbonbbs>Dakarot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/23/03 8:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja comic</span><hr size=1>   Hey, no problem, I'm glad to help. That Bio was cool. But what about the main character, whats up with him? And the secret power, guys? Whats with them, that sounds cool. maybeyou could have later in the story have it revealed that his &quot;girlfriend&quot; is really a spy to keep track of him or somethin. Or, maybe, everything he has done, all the fighting that he was doing to get away, was really part of an ellaborate scheme to shift the balance of power towards the secret organization or somethin. (You mentioned MGS2:SOL, so ya know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) (Gave me a few new ideas)<br>
  Oh, and what kind of fighting is it? Is it like DBZ, super powered with magic, or realistic, or in between? And how many allies does he have? And who are his main enimies? Just a few things to think about. If you want to AOL IM me, its DakarotX. Or email me at DakarotX@AOL.com. Title the Email Ninja comic or somethin. (I get alot of junk mail, so I don't want to accidentally delete it) I'd be glad to talk to you about it.

but first...<br>
It's more realistic fighting, with sword's and guns<br>
like RPC90's and Uzi's.<br>
Not many allies, i should think, don't know really!<br>
He want to get back at the people who &quot;Changed Him&quot; so that would be kinda a plot.<br>
whats &quot;AOL IM&quot;? i know the AOL bit (America Online)<br>
And maybe when i e-mail you i could send you some of my Concept pics,<br>
Hayate looks similar to MGS1 Ninja (ever1 thinks he great him!<br>
Natsume looks like a BGC hardsuit.<br>
p.s. i would have put them up here it's just i haven't got a web-ste to host them on! lol.<br>

The next scene you should have him wake up screaming in a cold sweat or something. Then someone comes in and asks him what was wrong. And he says, oh nothing, just these damn nightmares again... or osmething like that. Then he just shakes it off and goes to a training mission. This is where you can have some more action and show off some of his skills. And then the scientists watching the training can talk about how he is doing remarkably well, the enhancments seem to be doing nicely. Then maybe something goes wrong, he has a flashback in the middle of the session and is considered a reject. However his skill are secretly growing, in his room training by himself he is attacked and to be disposed of, because he is a rejected experiment. They send three or four or some number assassins, that would normally have no troube with him.  However, he beats them and then escapes to find answers.<br>
