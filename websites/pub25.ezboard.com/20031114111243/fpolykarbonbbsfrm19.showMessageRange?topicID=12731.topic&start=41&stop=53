The faster a person or object moves the slower time goes. If you spend your whole life driving around your cells will be slightly younger than that of a person born on the same day as yourself who sat on their @ss all their life. <br>
<br>
Anyone can move forward in time, but its generally at a constant rate.<br>
<br>
There has been suggestions that with the creation of a worm hole we have two points in time which a person can move between but they can not travel through time prior to when the worm hole was created.<br>
<br>
If absolute zero was achieved then matter will collapse in on itself and a blackhole would be created, if the whole universe reached absolute zero then I guess time would stop, but so would the existance of life.<br>
<br>
Thats kind of fragmented but Im too tired to change any of that. I'll leave you all with a last question. If.. say... time travel was possible and I could travel back in time to when my grandfather was a kid (before he had kids) and I shot him dead, what would happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coldkodiak>ColdKodiak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/face.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/8/03 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/avatar.jpg height=130 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ouch!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> If.. say... time travel was possible and I could travel back in time to when my grandfather was a kid (before he had kids) and I shot him dead, what would happen. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I watched some show on some channel and it was steven hawking and a buncha other guys all talking about time travel.<br>
<br>
Apparently if you travel through time, you appear as yourself, if this is true then it explains spontaneous human combustion, because to travel through time you have to travel extremely fast, and your molecules colliding with your own molecules causes this combustion, of course that is only if you are travelling forward. Or that when you time travel, you enter another dimension(for the sake of simplicity) to the left of this one, so nothing may be different except for the placement of a strand of hair, or nuclear war has ensued killing all life.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, I guess according to theory there are atoms at the edge of the universe that pass through the whole timestream and back in constant loop faster than the atoms that make us up, kinda like a record spins faster on the edge than the center. SO if you took billions of these atoms and turned them into silverizer for a mirror. And created a mirror with them, then you set it in an arbitrary place and looked at it. Would you see everything that would happen ever?<br>
<br>
Now onto mirrors. If you make a one-way mirror sphere, what would you see in it(bieng that the mirror side is inside)?<br>
Now if you took a one-way mirror sphere and placed it inside a larger one-way mirror sphere then created a suit to somehow blend yourself seamlessly to mirror completely over your whole body and you got inside the large sphere, what would you see inside the  smaller sphere?<br>
<br>
Most of this stuff was thought up really late at night, so if it sounds bizzarre or inaccurate, maybe it is. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/NARUTOdraw.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agentcryrid>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/10/03 11:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://sc.groups.msn.com/tn/E6/91/SaiyajinsBloodRPG/1/1.jpg height=96 width=83></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ouch!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Apparently if you travel through time, you appear as yourself, if this is true then it explains spontaneous human combustion<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I just thought up something...Now again, I don't know what the big brains think about it...Maybe I'll look up if Feynmann ever had anything to say about it, but if there are an infinite number of dimensions, like some of you have proposed here...<br>
<br>
Wouldn't that contradict conservation of energy if you regard the universe as a whole? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theandroid@polykarbonbbs>the android</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/10/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my fav topic!</span><hr size=1> Some very good points made, <br>
<br>
I'm new, but I've done a lot of research in this field. <br>
<br>
Just a few considerations should be made;<br>
<br>
1)  Einstein realised that light travelling through a vacuum (space) is the highest velocity for anything in the universe<br>
<br>
Therefore the speed of light through space is the cosmic speedlimit<br>
<br>
2) Time is the fourth dimension through which every 3Dimensional mass is moving through, its course through time is via what is known as a world line, <br>
<br>
Think of it as a basic three axes diagram with x=width, y=height and z=depth, m is the fourth axes=time, this axes however does not have a direction as such. The three dimensional object moves through this axes always! Therefore it never remains on the same position on the passage of time. <br>
<br>
3)   Gravity is a phenomenom that can influence the world line, a blackhole is the result of atoms collapsing within each other creating a gravitational field so powerful that not even light can escape, therefore in simple terms, its sucks in everything at the speed of light.<br>
<br>
At the event horizon all matter is blue shifted; accelerated. Therefore if a human was to approach one his atomic structure would accelerate i.e. his/her atoms and therefore be moving towards the speed of light. The closer one gets to the event horizon however, lets say foot first, then the atoms at his feet will be moving slightly faster then that of his head, so he'd be stretched getting longer and narrower as he approached, if he reaches the event horizon he'll be ripped apart.<br>
<br>
however the effect of nearing the speed of light will cause time dialation, I won't try to explain the reason cause It'll take all night, but basically lets say there's a black hole and Person a is within the gravitational field, person b is just outside the influence of the black hole and is watching a enter the hole. <br>
<br>
to b, As a got sucked in he'll appear to slow down until he comes to a stop, however b would experience normal time.<br>
<br>
To a, b would appear to accelerate and age until he dies and rots all within a few seconds, however a would experience normal time and reach the event horizon in those few seconds.<br>
<br>
If a was able to travel outwards from the black hole and EXCEDE the speed of light then he would defy the influence of the gravity of the black hole because nothing in the universe (natural that is) can excede the speed of light, but if he could! and he travelled a distance away from the hole to escape the gravitational influence, then he would find himself in the future, hundreds, thousands maybe even millions of years in the future depending on the distance and size of black hole.  <br>
<br>
but of course, this isn't really travelling to the future because you never really left the 'present', time was simply condensed. <br>
<br>
But the possibility of this happening is very slight due to our inability to excede the speed of light. <br>
<br>
As far as I know, (if I know anything) travel to the past is impossible because at any point an 3D object has a time-like direction, this direction is only to the future. We can't physically manipulate that direction. <br>
<br>
On a psychological basis, time might just be a product of the experience of consciousness. Passing from one present to the future, but then one must consider that we never can actually say we're in the future, can we...we're always in the present.<br>
<br>
I'm actually writing a comic that explores some of this, If all goes well, It'll be ready next year. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaarasunakage>Gaara Sunakage</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/Orochimaru.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/10/03 1:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/Gaara1.jpg height=79 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ouch!</span><hr size=1> Agent Cryid, sure, that old lady in the dimension to the left of us, could have been i suppose a young man the first man to travel back through time in that dimension.<br>

another point that should be considered is that the law of conservation of energy is Newtonian physics, but when it comes to space time, the theories just don't hold. Thats when Quatum physics comes in.<br>

Newtonian physics is for small scale mass and forces, read up einstien, relativity and quantum physics.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shaolingundam01>Shaolin Gundam 01</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/millenia_optima/images/rbullet.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/11/03 1:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/millenia_optima/images/capavatar.txt width=130 height=129></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ouch!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On a psychological basis, time might just be a product of the experience of consciousness.

That seems to make sense. I've seen a few programs and read a few things about this, and some of them have mentioned that the passing (not flowing, i'm trying to use my words wisely) of time is merely a conscious perception; time is a singular position, and time travel would actually be a changing of &quot;coordinates&quot; on a plane; adhering to the 4th dimension concept, it would be much like X, Y, or Z.<br>
<br>
On parallel universes, I personally don't find it as convincing as an argument of 'condensing' time, but it also solves some uncertainties about time travel. My question concerns this:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thirdly...If it were possable to &quot;time travel&quot; one theory says that you would not be able to alter the past but rather participate in the past in the line that you were meant to be there, raising the question, &quot;what shape is time?&quot; another theory is that yes you would be able to sort of time travel by jumping from one dimension that is slightly slower progression than ours but you face the possability of never returning to this dimmension and really what would it matter?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Concerning the paradoxical argument of eliminating yourself through ancestry... If the universe actually does occassionally split in two separate directions that parallel each other but are never alike nor simultaneous, then would it supposedly be possible to travel back in time (hypothetically), kill your grandfather, and thus cause another time-space split (or place you in one that already existed) that would lead you into another universe that paralleled the one you originated from but was not actually the same one? To make it a little simpler, would you be able to travel back to another point in time (the past), eliminate yourself in that universe, thus placing you in an alternate one, making return to your point of origin impossible? Just... expanding on this idea and trying to rule out the paradox.<br>
<br>
In a way, it kind of runs together with what was said earlier; that traveling into the future was possible, but would not allow for a return to your time of origin. It's an intriguing idea, but I'm not sure if it would actually work out that way.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shaolingundam01>Shaolin Gundam 01</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/millenia_optima/images/rbullet.txt" BORDER=0> at: 9/11/03 2:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theandroid@polykarbonbbs>the android</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/12/03 12:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ouch!</span><hr size=1> Ah the paradoxes!!<br>
<br>
Time travel to the future is more plausible because it involves less paradoxes, travel into the past causes many.<br>
<br>
The grandfather paradox as it is refered to by authors can only be paradoctered if we consider that the universe constantly splits into parallel dimensions. But...consider this, there is a theory that states if a cat were put into a box with a bomb rigged to explode when opened, the event would only be determined if and when the box was opened, the possiblities are that the box explodes and the cat dies, or through some error the box does not explode and the cat lives. The universe will then split into two or more depending on the number of possible outcomes available to any given situation. therefore, parallel universes are actually lying at right angles from each other. this means there is a point at which the dimension began. <br>

Another theory states that skipping into another dimension would require a worm hole, as stated above (I forget by whom, apologies) thus our universe may just be a space-time bubble, the surface of which is a froth of quantum activity, from this froth sprout mini space-time bubbles and so on and so forth meaning that our universe is actually one of many space time bubbles of quantum processes. <br>

<br>
Does that mean there are millions of every person?<br>
<br>
Also, another question: about perception. When you start to cross a road, in 'this' dimension, you are you and you perceive the world from your point of view. now, when you stop crossing that road (i.e. reach other side), what determined that you, as you are perceiving the world now, be the one of you that is in the dimension whereby you survived? Also, when someone does die, what determines that they be the one that didn't survive? obviously that can't really be answered...I guess all I'm saying is that the number of times you crossed the road and made it to the other side, you must be really, really, really lucky to be the half of you that survived every time. Chance alone would have it the other way. <br>
<br>
One last question: If the dimension really does branch like that at every possible 'other' option, well, where does the matter come to form that whole other dimension? or is that one of those incomprehensible things where the matter in each dimension is the same but rearranged matter and that the any given atom is in more than one dimension at once? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theandroid@polykarbonbbs>the android</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/12/03 1:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12731.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> according to that particular theory, every choice in the universe sprouts a new universe based on a possible outcome of a situation, so yea there are millions of universes being created and millions of 'you's' in those universes, If i'm not mistaken, the theory is sometimes called the many-verse theory. <br>
<br>
Ever watched sliders? thats based on the manyverse concept, however it doesn't concern itself about time. In fact its completely irrelevant to the subject of time travel. I posted that because some (i'm not too good with your names yet, my sincere apologies) said something about the shape of time. But that is just one theory.<br>
<br>
About your last question, I can't really answer that because I've not researched that particular point enough, what I can explain is another theory, that the universe is actually just the expansion of a hydrogen atom. Which means our universe may be part of a rock on some planet which exist in an even bigger universe! Have you seen men in Black, the universes are these marbles, well thats another theory which I don't quite understand, but I would think that the matter is formed through external (to our universe) processes which cause our universe to gain energy, thus in its expansion, new atoms are created, but then this would mean that there is a tremendous deal of external processes!!!....I honestly don't know, the answers cause paradox which is why these are all just theories. <br>
<br>
As far as the time aspect goes, I can say that at the end of the day, it all depends on belief until we find a way to excede light and investigate time dialation properly. <br>
<br>
The perception aspect is very tricky, you've got to do a lot of intropection and thinking, if your really interested, read up psychology; the biological, cognitive and psychodynamic perspectives. I'd explain to you myself but nothing can outdo the knowledge you'll get from a book. I've done a lot of research to get my comic within scientific verification yet interesting! although I'm currently happy with my explanations, I might just uncover something I missed!<br>
<br>
By the end of next year, I'll unleash my answers. Gotto finish putting them on paper first<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

David Deutsch's theory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oop, you mean a different version of the multiverse theory. My mistake.<br>
<br>
Regarding opals question, Opal, decisions are NOT what split the universe. Quark positioning is. What does this mean?<br>
<br>
A quark is always in location A, or B, yet we have no way to determine where it is without measuring. There are no laws governing their position, that we know of at least. Some say quarks exist in both and neither until you measure, and force them into a position. Some simply say there are multiple universes for every quark location.<br>
<br>
This means there are infinite universes, some essentially identical, some radically different. We only exist in one of them however.<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe that's the flavour of the quantum multiverse that android was referring to <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
