The year 2000 AD had come upon the human race had stoped having wars all of the armies in the world had been dismissed all nucular weapons where sealed in a storage room no one had a way of getting in for it was a 10 foot thick titanium wall with no doors no entrances by the year of 2008 aliens had been getting sited all over the world by the year 2010 aliens had landed with them they brought great technology and other such devices they had only shown the human rcae the tip of the ise borge when a human not a special man just a average guy looked at it and inspected it he had leant everything the aliens could offer and more he had surpassed anything the scerficals had seen anywhere they where amazed by this man he then began to work in secret he was building a great ship that he had called Diagic this ship was the most advanced technology that the scerficals had seen they had been to over 30,000 planets and this was amazing to them on the day of the cermony for the take off of the diagic the scerficals had come to see it take off but instead the scerficals had shot the man and then there ships came in attacking the earth and killing countless amount of humans they had killed every gifted person they had only left a few million people live which had to hide so they did not get killed a few years passd and the scerficals came back to earth they noticed a colloney of about 10 million people they sent down a few ships and men by the end of the day the humans had numbers of 500,000 people besides the other that werent in the coloney after that day the scerficals recorded alot of the activity on the planet trying to keep them in control and learn about how the humans think so they could learn how the man was able to make the diagic just from a bit of advanced technology but they had not found out anything . in the year of  2150 a man found the diagic and had got into it the scerficals found this out in very lil time and the man was killed because the scerficals were afraid that if the diagic had began to fly something terible would happen they tried to use it but never got in the door then they tried to destroy it they couldnt so they hid it so no one could ever use it....<br>

<br>
Have you tried full stops before?<br>
<br>
I suggest you learn to use them before you post again.<br>
<br>
You managed to write 357 words without one. That for information is a run-on sentence. <br>
<br>
Being a good writer is 90% being able to manipulate the written word. The remaining 10% is characterisation, plot and theme.  <p><img src=http://www.kgmander.50megs.com/images/sig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/upokiloki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>poki loki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/22/02 3:14:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=801.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Diagic (Preface read b4 chapters )</span><hr size=1> hey ive done over 600 words for a english project with out anything and i got a 80 on it also why the hell would you go threw the trouble to count the words or even copy paste and see how many words by using a program i just think you take writing to serious if this was a serious project then i would add all that stuff i would have it like 99.4444 percent perfect but its for pleasure so y???<br>
<br>

And don't take all the punctuation out on purpose, it makes you look like a sulky child. <br>
<br>
Why did I go to the trouble of counting the words? Because it's the longest run-on sentence I've ever seen in my life. <br>
It's actually 356 - I didn't include your, equally bad, introduction. <br>
<br>
If it's for pleasure why not take the same pride in your work as would a real project? Skaters don't wipeout because it's for pleasure, painters don't just splash paint everywhere because it's for pleasure and musicians don't just hammer out atonal chords for pleasure.  You may as well have smacked your hands off the keyboard, like thus:<br>

And even I managed to squeeze a full stop in there. <br>
<br>
If you don't want crits then don't post.  <br>
