Let me tell you a story about Najena!  Seven of us journeyed past Nek Forest, through Lavastorm to confront Najena - Daggit, Fromunder, Loralana, Oakwyn, Opus, Timmaer, and Cashew.  We battled a few Terror Tentacles, some pesky ogres and skellies.  Then we ventured deeper into the dungeon.  We fought Bonecrusher (a.k.a. Ballbreaker, Ballbuster, etc.)   He's a froglok caster.  What spawns with him are necromancers and their pets.  We took the whole room down easily.  This broke the spawn, and it was child's play dispatching the necromancers quickly since they didn't have their pets.  We killed Bonecrusher twice.  Then a dwarf stumbled upon our party and told us we should take Najena herself.  Sure.  We waited outside her lair to get a certain key.  Magicians came out with their pets, and surprise, Najena showed up!  We did kill her, but a few deaths were had!  NNNOOO!  We went inside her room because we now had the key.  Now the thing is with this key it's NO RENT, so the person who has the key must not die or go LD!  If so, then you have to camp Najena until you get a key to get out!  Yikes!  While waiting for Najena to spawn, much fun was had.  We ran around the room, took pictures, told jokes, it so livened up the waiting.  Najena did spawn again finally, and we dispatched her nicely!!  Great job everyone!!  She drops the cool Flowing Black Robe that newbie casters yearn for.  Daggit and Fromunder were lucky to win the rolling.  We decided to call it a night since the spawn was too slow, but getting out was very troublesome!  More deaths were involved!  NNNOOOO!!  But I have to say overall, we had fun and we can now say we killed Najena - Carpet Cleaner!  AND get this, for quite a bit the zone was only filled by the Twilighters!  So we rocked the house!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not bound by odds, we defy them!!!&quot;<br>

You beat me to the punch in recounting this story, so I don't have much to add.  All in all, it was a great time, and I'm happy that it was my first outing since I've been officially with the Council.  Unfortunately I missed the initial bashing of Crackerhead (prays to the DSL gods some more), but got to take part in beating the heathen down a couple of times!  And then the trip to see the lady of the house herself!  It was very cool of Grumplet to show us the way, and to help us take her on!  The first time we took her, there were a couple of deaths, which was unfortunate.  Her AE fire spell packs quite the whallop!  Anything we could do to increase our fire resistance would seem to be helpful against her, whether it be jewelry (I can make a few fire resistance things trivially), spells or bard songs.<br>
<br>
Also now that we're a little more experienced in navigating through there, we could try some of the other hateful beings in the area.  There is the necromancer Rathyl (who's pet somehow found his way to kill me on our exit), who apparently has in his possession some weight reducing packs that I'm sure anyone would cherish.  To get to Rathyl, we would have to kill Bonecrackhead and the Ogre Captain for their keys.  Rathyl also has the key for a shadow knight named Drelzna's room.  Drelzna has the key for Najena's room, along with the Ashenwood Short Spear, which apparently has some haste charges to it.  After we secured a couple of keys to Najena's room, we could head there (while killing the pathetic froggie ghoul on the way).  At that point, we could take and hold the Najena room until we're done.  Or go back to Rathyl and get more packs.  Or whatever, we'd have plenty of options. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Okay, so I guess I added quite a bit, but got to doing a bit of researching, hehe.  I think that would make for a fun outing, and we could really own Najena's lair then.  It would also give us the invaluable experience of actually moving through a dungeon.  Well, that's just some thoughts, but since it was so fun last time, seeing more of the dungeon would probably be a hoot!  And coming out of there with some of those packs and FBRs and all the other good stuff would be quite nice.  Some food for thought anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

P.S. Fighting Tentacle Terrors are a blast!!!  That knock-back spell is too cool!!  I want it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cirroc>Cirroc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(11/7/00 1:41:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Carpet Cleaning Chaos</span><hr size=1> Daggit &lt;/em Cheers Heartly for fellow councellors&gt;  Hip hip hurray!  Just to let all of you know... I had a BLAST!  Yes even though some of us died a couple of times and yes I myself died twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not really that upset!  It was a blast hanging around Nejena's lair and whipping her gud!  It sounds like this weekend would be great to do that again.  Now we know what to expect and how to handle it. I think Grumplet was great in helping us out too.  Well I gotta go.  Once again Kudos to everyone for a smokin gud time!  Woot!<br>
