Even now, I feel sad, yet happy.  I have to be moving on, I need to quit Everquest.  Why oh why?  When just the other day I felt elated getting 32, and knowing 34 was in sight?  I spend too much time playing, I do.  Amdist my 6 characters, I've logged on around 54 days.  And when I see that, it's like...damn.  I need to spend more time writing and reading.  With being in Barrel of Monkeys, rehearsals are fun and grueling.  When I come home, the perfect way to unwind is to sleep, yet I find myself turning on the computer and playing until the wee hours of the morning.  I need to find time to write and read more.  That's my passion, although I have loved playing.  I can't even begin to tell you how much fun and giggles I've had playing and fighting with all of you.  I will miss you all, terribly. You know I will.  And part of me does feel bad quitting, but I know you all respect my decision.  <br>
<br>
Throughout the next week or so I'll distribute all my stuff to all of you.  With Eviloake's permission, I'd like to give what he gave Stabb, to the rogues - Klepta, Stryphe, Sediri, and Oakwyn's rogue (I can't remember his name).  With Cashew, the Oracle Robe has to go to Cirroc, that robe he has is just awful.  As with my INT gear...I'll have to decide on that, whoever is lacking in it should get my gear.  With Ribs, all you young budding necromancers, I'll create as many research spells I can, up to level 29 or so.  And with Feinrich and a certain new wizard whose name escapes me, I'll create as many research spells as I can as well.  As for my money, of course I'll give it to all of you, but I don't know the best way to do that.  Any suggestions from our fearless leader and you others would be appreciated.  I have about 1000p total, and of course I want it to help fund in any items you all need to get.  I'll need all of your help in distributing my stuff, and I'm grateful for that.  <br>
<br>
I'm grateful to have known all of you in the game, no matter what character you have played.  Again, I am sad, yet happy in knowing that I leave on a great note.  And who knows...I'm sure one day we'll all play again, on a different battlefield.  There's so many cool games on the horizon, I know I can't resist.  But for now...I just need to not only take a break, but make a final break.  I will not return, I just can't.  I need time for me.   For those of you in the Chicago area, I'll keep you posted on when I'm performing in the summer.  I'd be honored if you could come to a performance!  You haven't seen the last of me.  And you can always e-mail me, I'd love to hear from you.  MooseBoone@aol.com  So...I think that's it.  I know it's going to take awhile to send this....but I will.  I must.  <br>
<br>
Always Nutty,<br>

It's been my distinct honor and pleasure to get to know you!  I'm happy and sad at the same time.  I know that you will enjoy getting back to your reading and writing and SLEEP hehe.  I hope to keep in touch with you over email and keep tempting you with the new games that are coming up (Beta Test of &quot;Dawn&quot; is still open.. www.glitchless.com )  Yours will be a loss that is definitely felt throughout the entire Council.  It is a sad day in Norrath, but Chicago I'm sure will rejoice.<br>
<br>
You are more than free to distribute any of the stuff that I gave you, including the rogue twink stuff I loaned you.  I would like to ask for the mithril breastplate back if you don't mind though.  <br>

<br>
This is definitely a WOWer for me.  I knew this was something that you had been thinking about, and it really shouldn't be as big of a surprise as I'm taking it.  With Cashew being so close to 34 (and the coveted ports to Velious and Kunark), and Carabas being even closer to 16 (&quot;blessed breeze&quot;), I thought maybe we'd be able to keep you reeled in a little longer.  But you must pursue what your passions are, and if a game is getting in the way of that, then the game is expendable.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the day that Lora and Ribs first met while hunting bandits in WK.  It truly was a turning point in my EQ life, and the friendship that ensued has brought me to know all the other wonderful people in the Council.  I can't even begin to say how much more enjoyment you and the Council have brought to my gaming experience.  From hunting bugs in North Karana, to giants in Warslik's Woods, my first actual dungeon excursion (Najena!), picnic setting slaying in Lake of Ill Omen, cyclops and Tarnuts in Rathe Mountains, and of course our first hill giant hunts!  Sure there have been deaths, but it was always fun, always!  I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll be terribly missed in Norrath, but we wish you the best of luck on Earth, as that's the important world we all have to live in.<br>
<br>
I have thought on occassion on quitting the game myself, but there's so much more I know I want to see and do.  So if there's anything you want to do before you go, whether it's hunt in Mistmoore, or take a run down into Permafrost to see Vox, let us know, and I hope I speak for everyone, and we'll do our best to make it happen.  I know I want to see a damn dragon before I leave this game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Of course I suppose there's always that one in the Dreadlands, Gorenaire, and she won't rip our heads off automatically.  So what I propose is that you make a plan for whatever you want for sometime this final week.  Whether it's a raid on one of the dungeons we've always talked about (although maybe kind of silly since it mostly revolves around loot you wouldn't be using), or heading some place just to see it, or a big party where we see who can build up their Alcohol Tolerance the highest (I'll supply any booze, gotta work on that brewing skill anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  So you name it, and I'll be there.  I'll keep in touch by e-mail also, I've got Kinvarian@aol.com that I usually use for EQ stuff, so that should be easy to remember.  It has been an honor fighting and most importantly, laughing by your side on many many many occasions.  And when Barrel of Monkeys goes on it's world tour and hits the Los Angeles area, you can bet I'll be there. hehe  Well, what more is there to say, except bravo to you, I'm sure this was a tough, but easy decision.  EQ takes up a lot of time, but there's a reason for that also since it's fun.  But ultimately you are making the correct decision.  Now just think about all the sleep you'll be able to get, instead of having me prod you, &quot;Oh, you can make 32nd tonight, easily&quot;. hehe  Thank you for all the friendship and favors you have done for me.  You won't ever be forgotten.  So, take care, and we'll be in touch.<br>
<br>
Always Your Friend,<br>

I know this game is addicting, and I feel partially responsible for getting you involved in it, although I never intended it to become an addiction.  I remember a year ago around the time of your brother's wedding how Feldros and I kept going on and on about EQ (since at that time we were heavily into the game), and how your eyes lit up that day you came over and we were showing you our characters.  I am glad you started playing because it definitely gave me an opportunity to get to know you better.  That's the great thing about EQ... I have gotten to know so many people who I otherwise would not have ever met (Pristeene being one of them... yeah you should see the looks on people's faces when I tell them I met her in a video game of all places hehe).<br>
<br>
Well, in the back of my mind I am hoping that once you start doing all of those things you've forgotten about once again, you will find your way back to EQ, and perhaps just dedicate your time to one character, much like Feldros.  But I know from experience that it isn't good to neglect the RL things... because with all the stresses and hassles of it all, there are also the things that you love that really should come first.  EQ is a great escape from all those stresses and hassles, but if it takes you away from the things you were once passionate about then I can see how you would need to step back and put things back into perspective.  I'll admit that I had to do that at one point, and there are still many late nights when I have had to pry myself away from the computer.  Well... hehe... of course it's impossible to ignore a cute little munchkin... well, especially when that cute little munchkin can cry as loud as a banshee.<br>
<br>
But thank you so much for making the game fun!  I know it won't be the same without you.  Wow, I know I'll still see you in RL, but I am so sad that you are leaving!<br>

<br>
Dear Wizardress, Honored Officer &amp; Faithful Friend Cashew Nutty:<br>
  <br>
I am both proud of and sad about your decision to leave the land of EverQuest. I am reminded now of the time at the end of the epic tale, Lord of the Rings, when the sage and master wizard Gandalf, along with Bilbo and Half Elven Elrond, sailed away from Middle Earth to go the land beyond, where the High Elven and Lords of Light lived...<br>
<br>
The parting of friends, even in a virtual place is difficult, but not nearly as difficult as it would be if we were not friends in the land mundane. I feel fortunate that I do know you in RL  , and would enjoy seeing you and the rest of your damnable monkey friends, on any stage! In all seriousness, you will be greatly missed among the Council --your cheer and tactical skills were greatly valued among many within the guild. <br>
<br>
I have contemplated, even recently, about joining you in leaving the many colored land of EverQuest. My persona, in the land mundane also hungers for the time to spend enjoying the written word, and even conjuring up some tales... Fortunately, because of my numerous responsibilities, I have been forced to be more disciplined in spending my free time -- which ultimately means, that I play EverQuest less, but am able to justify it.<br>
<br>
As to the distribution of your bank account, I would suggest that the guild conduct an equipment assessment, and identify, any major weaknesses, and then try to purchase the equipment to address that. As a second option, I would suggest that you give the funds to Nine, who I am nominating as Guild Coin Keeper. At a latter date, we can collectively come up with a proper usage of said funds. <br>
<br>
There are countless realms that will be created in the future. Perhaps, in one of those realms, I will have the pleasure of meeting you again.<br>
<br>
Your Friend,<br>

<br>
I knew this was coming and I support your decision to leave.  But it really didn't hit me until Thursday night that you were really leaving.  I too have contemplated going away for a while but like Master Kinvarian I need to see things before my task on Norrath is accomplished.  Quellious go with you in your journeys outside the the Virtual realm, and know, just know we will all miss you here on Norrath.  We will miss your rapier wit and excellent skill with emotes.  We will miss your help as guildmate.  We will miss your goofy and sassy sayings.  We will miss you as a formidable presence in the guild.  But most of all we will miss you in EQ.  Good luck with everything, and do please keep in touch.  See you around in Chicago, geez you only live about half a mile away, maybe even less than that.<br>

I made research spells for Infekt, and have yet to make some for Spare.  I can't forget Tripod and Deadrina as well, and maybe Tolila?  I shall give most of Cashew's stuff to Cirroc, he's in need of INT gear badly.  Just look at him!  Hee hee!  Crabby's stuff should go to the fledgling wizards, Feinrich and that other one whose name escapes me again.  I want to finish up distributing things and money by April 2nd, on April 3rd I depart for Europe for a week.  Yes, much too short, but I'll take it.  Going to France and Spain.  And it'd be nice to have closure before then.  <br>
<br>
Once again, I can't tell you how much I'll miss you all.  If you think I've been nutty and witty and sassy, remember, you all helped me to be so.  So kudos to you!  I'll read posts of course now and then, I want to be updated on all your adventures!!<br>
<br>
Holding back the sniffles!!<br>

What can I say that hasn't already been said so eloquently by other Twilighters?  I will miss your sassiness, creative emoting and going on Maroon Patrol with you.<br>
However, I respect your decision and can understand your need to make a clean break.  If you ever decide at a later time to rejoin us, of course the guild will re-outfit you in style.<br>
The best of luck to you in pursuing your RL goals.<br>
And of course, I want you to bring photos from your trip to Europe to the next Guild Gathering (aren't we due for another one soon?).<br>
Well I hate Good Byes, so I'll just say See You Later instead.     /hug/dance/rude/giggle/cheer/salute<br>

Hee hee!  I guess...wait...I know I'm not done with EQ.  I will play less though.  Ribs and Stabb I will leave somewhat naked.  I was neglecting them anyway.  For now I'll concentrate on Crabs, maybe Connect, and Cashew.  The 3 C's!!  So, you'll see me around, just not as often.  I guess I would miss you all a bit too much.  Sigh.  A good sigh.  Thanks for putting up with my rants and raves, I got so much great advice on what to do, what to think.  I'm grateful for all of you!  Yes, even you Curly.  <br>

Well, wow!  This is great!  A cut-back Cashew and Co. is better than no Cashew and Co. in my eyes.  And I'm sure you can control it to what levels you need, you've shown a lot of constraint the past couple of weeks.  So what can I say except.....<br>

Please tell Stabb he is welcome to have all his rogue goodies back.  I always looked at it as a temporary loan until you were ready to come back and join us (even if on a limited basis).  So let me know when Stabb is ready to start sneaking and backstabbing his way across Norrath and I will have all his items returned Special Delivery.<br>
