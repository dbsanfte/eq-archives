With regards to the people that say &quot;well we didn't take out this dictator, so why should we take out that one?&quot;  That's some of the most bass ackwards logic I've ever heard (isn't it sad that it isn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> most bass ackwards<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).

War on Terrorism.  That's one of those oxymorons.  Here's the problem I see (I think someone else mentioned this too).  You can't &quot;wage war on terrorists&quot; they're not some landmass you can invade, some banner you can rally against.  They have no flag, no central government, and no one place they call home.  It IS like trying to remove cancer with a saw (which is why I thought an increase in the &quot;defence bugget&quot; was extremely stupid).  Increase the buggets you have for the various intelligence organizations you have or create a new one especially for terrorists.  That's the only real weapon we have.  Everything else is just a duck and cover drill for a nuke (cause we had bomb proof desks in the 50's<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Is it just me, or do Europeans seem to love genocide?  Happens all the time on or near their contininent and their default action seems to be to bury their heads in the sand and hope it'll take care of itself. I say Europe specifically because unlike Asia, South America, and Africa they have an entire first world <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>community</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that COULD do something about it. And then of course any time the U.S. tries to step in and take care of the mess the should have, they get all huffy and say we have a big brother complex or something of the like.

once a person from the Eisenhower administration asked him what he thought about Somoza and Pinochet, the dictator from nicaragua,and the other from chile, his answer was simple: &quot;they are sons of a bitch.&quot; the gentlemen was astounded to hear such a comment from a u.s. president and the former president then added: &quot;but they are OUR sons of a bitch&quot;. Alot of he dictators that are or were in power recieved that power most of the time thanks to american interests. of course if they were naughty the u.s. would give them a spanking but sometimes they would get away with their mischief. goes to show that everything that matters, when it comes to the relationship between the u.s.a. and the dictators they harvest is based on political interest. the excuse of attacking hussein because he's a dictator is very stupid, it's all about political intersts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Monkey: If I may point out something, no offense meant, but editorial articles are not proof. I hope you can find something better.&quot;<br>

its not proof unless you read them...hehehe, they are very good articles. like i said to Kijo150 i would like to invite you to search for &quot;War and Petroleum&quot; on a search engine aswell. the informaition, the articles, essays and books written on the subject is so vast it's impossible to know completely about the subject because of all it's variables. but the articles can start you off on the right track since it reffers to a current internaional conflict.<br>

Just because Iraq is an oil rich country and Bush was involved in oil means nothing.  Bush’s father was involved in oil as well, but did he take over Iraq’s oil during the Gulf War?  No, even though he should have.  Iraq set oil wells on fire and poured millions of gallons into the ocean to create the biggest environmental disaster ever, even larger than the Exxon Valdez.<br>
<br>
But oil prices are going up!  That shows that Iraq effects the US’s oil supply!<br>
Uh huh… in case you haven’t heard there’s this country called Venezuela that we get 25% of our oil from and they haven’t been supplying us with oil for the past two months because of a strike.<br>
<br>
Scorp:  We pick and choose who we help and who not to help, but there’s always different criteria.  Whichever we choose, we’re damned if we do, damned if we don’t.  If we had stayed in Vietnam maybe those 2 million Cambodians wouldn’t have been slaughtered.  We’ve tried to solve problems in almost every continent in the world, sometimes they were successes, sometimes they weren’t.  Bush Sr. tried to overthrow governments that had nothing to do with oil.  Human rights violations is one of many reasons to remove Saddam.  Weapons, we have proof that he’s trying to hide them, with the radio intercepts from Powell’s presentation, and just no evidence that he got rid of all the chemicals that he had prior to kicking the inspectors out.  The inspectors even found chemical warheads in Iraq that Iraq “forgot to disclose in the UN report”.  But they didn’t have chemicals in them!  You don’t arm a weapon to have it laying around, you only arm the weapon before firing it.  Why does Iraq need chemical warheads anyways?  If they don’t have any chemical weapons then they shouldn’t need them.  Also, the Al Samoud 2 missiles which were found by the inspectors have a larger range than the UN allowed Iraq to have.  Those are just two of the obvious violations of resolution 1441.  We can’t trust someone who hates us to have these weapons.  We can’t allow a madman to have them.  We can’t allow anyone with known terrorist ties to have them.<br>
<br>
Please, I really want to know why it was ok for Clinton to bomb Iraq and later free the people of Yugoslavia.  Here are quotes, some directly from Clinton, some from newspaper articles during his presidency:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> &quot;The international community gave Saddam one last chance to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Saddam has failed to seize the chance. So we had to act and act now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Less than an hour after American and British forces launched Operation Desert Fox, the president addressed the nation to explain his decision. He said the attack was designed to protect the national interests of the United States and the interests of people throughout the Middle East and around the world.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons,&quot; Clinton said. The Iraqi dictator has used these weapons against his neighbors and his own people, he said, and &quot;left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these terrible weapons again.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> &quot;Our objectives are limited, but clear,&quot; the president said. &quot;To make Saddam pay a price for the latest act of brutality, and to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors and America's interests.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Our missiles sent the following message to Saddam Hussein: When you abuse your own people or threaten your neighbors, you must pay a price,&quot; Clinton said.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I could cite many more but I don’t feel like it.  Notice that the strikes were the US with Britain.  I guess because Clinton was in office it wasn’t considered unilateral..<br>

Well, this came up in our history discussion the other day. We settle upon two reasons. <br>
   The first and most promintent is that we do not have the resources to take on every country at one time. We are going to have to do this one step at a time especially since we don't have the support of our perfectly moral brethren in Europe.<br>
<br>
  The second one, there is no urgent reason for us to go and stop a bunch of tribes with machine guns before we stop a nation capble of sending chemical weapon birthdy gifts. Even North Korea, this is not the first time they have started with the Nuclear bullsh!t, not only that but we are perfectly capable of detecting and stoping a nuclear attack.<br>

Detecting, I can understand, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>stopping</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a nuclear attack?  <br>
<br>
Sorry to disillusion you, but there is no way to stop a nuclear strike at this time.  The current &quot;missile defense&quot; system Bush proposes has had 8 tests so far, of which 3 were dismal failures.<br>
<br>
Think about that statistic for a moment.  Even if this system was deployed tomorrow, for every 8 missiles an enemy lobs at the US, 3 will get through the &quot;missile shield&quot;.  That means 3 cities die.  <br>
<br>
While that is admittedly better than 8 cities dying, it is a whole new level of russian roulette I'd rather not play, thank you.  And even if the system is improved upon, there will always be SOME level of risk that a missile will get through the &quot;shield&quot; and destroy a city in a nuclear fireball.  And a smaller - but not negligable - risk that the system would fail on a much grander scale.  <br>
<br>
The only sure defense against a nuclear attack is to prevent it.

Just because Iraq is an oil rich country and Bush was involved in oil means nothing.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Did you read them? Well I invited you to search on the topic on a search engine. the articles are only an examples. I supposed you would satisfy your curiosity by yourself. by the way, proof is very hypothetical. We only see, hear, taste and touch 5% of what we think we know, the rest is, you guessed it, speculation my friend. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bush’s father was involved in oil as well, but did he take over Iraq’s oil during the Gulf War? No, even though he should have. Iraq set oil wells on fire and poured millions of gallons into the ocean to create the biggest environmental disaster ever, even larger than the Exxon Valdez.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bush Sr. didn't &quot;take over&quot; Iraq’s oil because the political environment was different. Now since bush's goal is to overthrow and destroy the Hussein government deal with Hussein personally then that means bush jr. has the chance to take a bite of some of Iraq’s oil. Other than the fact that you don't &quot;take control&quot; of it directly, what happens is simply shifts in political tensions that favor the oil itself to the U.S., if the U.S. does win the war and overthrow Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;I realize that many dictators came in to power, stayed in power, or whatever because the U.S. was behind them. But what I'm saying is that if we suddenly decide to do the right thing (even if we're doing it for the wrong reasons) should we suddenly not, simply because we've done bad things in the past.&quot;<br>
<br>
your very right but we're not asking the u.s. not to because they didn't in the past. they have taken down dictators in the past the same way they want to do now with hussien but it's obious that the u.s. meticulously overthrows the dictators that go against there interests. i'd be real happy to see hussein on trial for his crimes, what i don't want is for the u.s. goverment to use the fact that he's a criminal just as an excuse to go and invade iraq for certain political interests and not with a true will of saving iraq from this dictator.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noahthebanned>Noah the Banned</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/22/03 9:59:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Incredible</span><hr size=1> Monkey, look I am not trying to jump you I am sure the editorial articles you have are based on some good facts but editorials are nothing but opinions.

We can steal it if we want to have it and the political climate is no different than when Bush Sr. could have taken it. For gods' sakes France makes illegal deals on it which fund saddam hussein. If there should be any debate about oils role in this action it should be the fact that France is getting cheap easy oil from Iraq and probably don't want to lose that. And, like someone else said. Wether we take the damn oil or not Saddam Hussein is commiting atrocities of war on his own people he HAS chemical weapons (I don't give a damn what those idiot inspectors say) and he has stalled and failed to comply with UN demands for over a decade. He is dangerous and he needs to be dealt with. Now if you or anyone else feel like walking up to his doorstep and asking him nicely to stop, feel free but the pope already tried that and the only reason he isn't dead is because he is the pope. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=koji150>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/22/03 11:01:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Incredible</span><hr size=1> Monkey, I did read and research their articles.

the differance would be the nature of the attack. Although I'm sure a good amount of people are against the war just because it's Bush heading the action, I see a good amount of people complaining general that there are better things to do now than to deal with Iraq (economy, N. Korea, Al queda, ect.), or they say that we should look for peaceful resolutions to remove Saddam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
But either way, to strictly base your idea that it's just partisan politics would be wrong, as I'm sure other countries don't really care who is heading this action, they're mainly against the action for their own reasons, rather than against Bush himself. <br>
<br>
But as you say, I'm sure partisan politics has a role, but mainly in the U.S. itself.  <p>Sorry, try again...<br>

Still, nobody on here has said why it was ok for Clinton to bomb Iraq and now not ok for Bush.<br>
<br>
Other countries have many different reasons.  Anti-Americanism, politics, economics, and more.<br>
<br>
Also, there were problems with North Korea and Al Qaeda during the Clinton years too.  North Korea we blindly trusted to stop attempting to procure nuclear weapons and Al Qaeda was running the globe blowing up embassies.

It was more of an aggression. It didn't have all of the characteristics of being total war, because it was &quot;dehumanized&quot; by cruise missiles. It was less personal because Clinton was never interested in attacking Hussein personally and threatens his political power; he attacked him because of international pressure due to the weapons inspections. Clinton played it very smart indeed, not to mention what you said about the terrorist’s attacks of 9/11 which did change political tensions.<br>

“Monkey, look I am not trying to jump you I am sure the editorial articles you have are based on some good facts but editorials are nothing but opinions.”<br>
<br>
“Monkey, I did read and research their articles. They were full of speculation and no facts.”<br>
<br>
      Kijo, I fear you don’t seem to quite distinguish the clear facts stated in the articles, especially since Noah the Banned did see these facts. I linked the second article, “In Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is Key Issue, U.S. Drillers Eye Huge Petroleum Pool” from the Washington post, so you could read it again since you probably didn’t notice the facts augmented on the article. I also added more articles on this topic chalk full of the so many facts you’re just urging to know.<br>
       Noah, if news articles with “good facts”, as you just stated, are just mere opinions what is the point of the discussion on this thread? Aren’t we doing the same? Aren’t we posting opinions based on “good facts” as well? If you don’t validate opinions based on “good facts” then I doubt you would value any of the posts on this thread, posting would be pretty meaningless. I do share with you the worry of being objective and impartial and I strongly value that from your part therefore understanding your uneasiness towards this.<br>

    Also the comment on how cruise missiles in Clintons campaign made it seem less personal, that is true but Clinton should have caught more flak for that because in a war where you are trying to replace the government of a people you have to show those people that you are trying to work in their best interest you can't do that when you are off shore pushing buttons.

On Sunday Clinton said that while the United States will continue its policy of containing Saddam by working to eliminate his weapons ofmass destruction, &quot;over the long-term the best way to address that threat is through a government in Baghdad -- a new government -- that is committed to represent and respect its people, not repress them; that is committed to peace in the region.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
