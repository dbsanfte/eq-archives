Our first stop was in Highkeep, just like was planned. It was a bit of a tight fit with 11 Lords, I think I go to hit a mob maybe 3 times... lol (Special thanks to Branwen and Sindiin for grabbing the camp early!) In fact, I spent most of my time staring at the spawn point for my Crazed Goblin, listening to the sounds of death and destruction in the background... lol. Well, he did eventually spawn, and after little more than 15 minutes with the whole crew in the mines, I had my Scroll.<br>
<br>
So, off to Najena.<br>
<br>
This was not as successful as High Keep, in that we never did see the Hilt drop. We had 12 Guildies in zone, and 5 others who probably wondered what was going on... lol. I broke the groups into upper level, and lower level, and after several people *found* the traps in the floor (names withheld to protect the innocent), and got out of jail thanks to Sibian, we were on our way to clearing out the zone. Killing every Darkbone, Large, Greater, and just plain &quot;A Skeleton&quot;s, but no luck. This went on for a couple of hours. Finally, people who have normal jobs had to log and I stuck around to see if I could get lucky and find it on my own. Branwen logged back on to let me know that she had found the quest online, and that my targets were the plain &quot;A Skeleton&quot;... D'oh! if we had known that, we would not have had to be in the lower part of the dungeon at all, they were as green as could be. The regular Skeletons were light blue to dark blue to Radnor, who is 34. <br>
<br>
So, armed with Branwen's updated info, I scoped out the 3 places they popped and just killed them one after another. Still no luck. I may need to actually kill the Large and Greater Skeles at the spawn points also, which I were ignoring, they may be place holders or something. /shrug<br>
<br>
I will not be online this evening, I will be visiting my Brother, but I will see all you crazy wonderful people Saturday. And if anybody feels like hanging out with me in Najena Saturday around 2 CDT, the company would be most welcome.  <br>

Well, I went back on Friday evening, and after killing many &quot;A Skeletons&quot;, another Paladin waltzed in and announced that he was willing to pay to loot the hilt... He then sent me a tell asking if I knew where the spawn area was. I replied saying I was looking for the hilt also, but did not know the exact drop location, only that it came from &quot;A Skeleton&quot;. He said that he would wait for me to find it first. After a bit, he went off to WK to talk to the guy and get the bag for the quest and told me that his roomate said the two skeletons by the water were the ones that dropped the hilt. After he left I went down to the water area, and after killing just 5 skeletons, there it was, the hilt! <br>
Sooooo, to make a very long winded and boring story just a tiny bit shorter, As most of you now know, I have my Ghoulbane.<br>
I would like to thank all in the guild who helped me with this, specifically those on the raid day itself, by providing transportation (Justims and Nevarmoor), the much appreciated heals (Ceelia and Pyranius), Awsome nukes (Sindiin and Noltrac), a goodly helping of the dark arts (Ischaade and Gwetto), Lovely music (Gwenne), our Najena guide, &quot;Pointer-out-of-traps&quot;, and holder of the &quot;Get out of jail free key&quot; (Sibian), and of course my fellow Paladin, the all around lovely and deadly tank (Branwen).<br>
That wraps up that. I had a blast and hope to be able to help other of our mid level guildmates with their respective quests. If no one posts anything soon however, I may be forced to come up with another one for Radnor, and subject you all to my stories again! <br>
