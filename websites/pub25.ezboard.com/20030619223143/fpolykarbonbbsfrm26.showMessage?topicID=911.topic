<br>
Hatred<br>
<br>
The office door slowly opened as the light from the corridor pierced the dark that lay within the room.  A figure moved slowly towards a lone worker.  From the sleeve of the killer a knife slid into the cold hand, with the thumb resting on the top of the handle and the fingers wrapped around.  The knife rose into the air and struck down, into the top of the head of the victim.  Blood stained the walls as the body fell to the ground under the desk, the body lay in its coffin.<br>
<br>
The killer smiled as the blood dripped from the hand that gripped the knife so tightly.  As the killer moved towards the door the light from the corridor caught the knife and the ring which was on the killer’s finger.<br>
<br>
Three days earlier<br>
<br>
Andrew Freeman a young scruffy office worker stared into the blue sky which lived outside the window.  Outside the window the place that Andrew hated but longed for.  He sat there thinking to himself.  ‘Why am I alone in this World?’  ‘Is it because I never stepped into the real World?’ <br>
‘Freeman!’  Andrew jumped, ‘Stop day dreaming, as team manger you should be the hard worker.’ Spoke a tall male, as he combed his blonde hair behind his ears.  ‘I am a hard worker Ryan, apart from you.  I know you’re a freelancer but we have not seen you once this week.’  ‘Chill, I talked to the boss and I have been working from home.  Here!’  Ryan threw a black leather case of drawings onto the desk, all the work, papers and pens which laid there privacy flew into the air and down to the floor.  Andrew gritted his teeth as he stared at Ryan, but Ryan just laughed and walked off.  Andrew slowly suppressed the angry and pushed it deep inside, to the same place he had done all his working life.  He had hated Ryan from the first day.  Andrew was a shy person so Ryan took advantage and controlled him for the first five years.  When Andrew was promoted Ryan could no longer control him, but still disrespected him.  He took a freelancer job to enable himself to have a distance from Andrew.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day Andrew retreated to his small apartment, as he sat in his room he began to feel alone.  He looked at the ring that rested around his finger.  Then he stares at the picture that rested on top of his T.V. slowly reading out the written text which was in the picture ‘To my son. Your loving mother.’  As Andrew started to fall asleep he thought of the days when he was young and happy.  He would not have a care in the world.  (More description)  As his mind drifted he began to remember the funeral of his mother.  It was raining as the coffin was lower to the button of the hole.  A hole was left inside Andrew he had always had his mother, now he was alone. (Image back in apartment)<br>
<br>
Andrew woke as the light from the windows filled his apartment.  Slowly picked himself up off his sofa and with his back hunched walked hesitant over to his bathroom.  He opened his eyes and stared at his reflection in the mirror, a face filled with sorrow looked back at him disappointed. (More) <br>
<br>
As he walked to work began to feel enthusiastic about himself, he decided to do something bold and act out of character, it would show everyone that he was a person, and an interesting one at that.  But as he strolled into the office and sat down his back hunched and his mouth dropped as he notice that Ryan had turn up to work.<br>
‘Hello Andrew.’  I hope your happy to see that I’ve turn up for walked towards Andrew’s desk.<br>
‘Why have you turned up today Ryan, we have little work for you.  Your case of art yesterday was the complete assignment that we set you.’<br>
‘I know but today a new member of staff arrives, and the boss asked me personally to show her around.’<br>
‘Her?’ Andrew said quietly.<br>
‘Yes her name is Miss Konoha Wright Japanese.  She is joining the art team for the game cover project that will start next week.’<br>
‘I didn’t get a note!’  Replied Andrew in a frustrated voice.<br>
‘I’m team manger!!’<br>
‘Huh team manger’ spurted Ryan under his breath.  ‘What!’ shouted Andrew as he held his pencil in a knife like manner.<br>
‘Nothing. It must have fallen when I handed in my work yesterday.’  said Ryan as he walked off back to his desk.<br>
<br>
Andrew stared at Ryan, he could feel the anger boiling inside, <br>
‘I’ll burst that big head of yours, Ryan!’  Andrew said to himself thru gritted teeth.  Andrew sank his head back to his work like he had always done, and noticed the note that laid in-between some folders.  It read: Andrew, sorry about the late notice, but we needed to employ this talent before someone else did.  Her name is Miss Konoha Wright, half Japanese I think.  She will be working on the cover project for the new Xtence game.  I am sure that she will enjoy working under you as team manger.  Make her feel welcome.’  He screws the note up and threw it into the bin.<br>
<br>
Around two o’clock Ryan burst into the room shouting ‘The newbie is here!’ soon after a shy oriental looking young women stepped into the room.  ‘And this is where you will be working.’  The lady looked around starting from the far corner and across the room to Andrew’s desk.  She turned her head quickly as Andrew pulled his head out of his paper work and glanced at her.<br>
‘O.K. I think your sitting next to me, right over there.’  Ryan pointed to an empty desk next to his untidy table.  Konoha slowly walked towards the desk unsure, but Ryan moved her along with his hand press against her back.  Andrew was staring, looking at Ryan’s face as Ryan glanced at Andrew smiling.  Ryan carted Konaha around the office meeting the team leaving Andrew to last.<br>
‘Lastly Andrew….’<br>
‘Hello I’m Andrew team manger, I’ve heard good things about your work.  I’m sure you will settle in well here.’<br>
Konoha blushed as Andrew looked into her eyes, ‘ Thank you.’  Konaha’s voice was quiet but clear, Andrew was in a trance as he looked at her face.  ‘Get back to work Andrew,’ growled Ryan as he pulled Konaha away and back to the other side of the room.<br>
<br>
As Andrew sat in the train on the way home he thought about Konaha’s face when she first saw him.  ‘She was embarrassed.’  ‘What,’ replied an old man sitting next to him. ‘Nothing sir,’ Andrew returned to his thoughts, but all he could think of now was Ryan’s face, that smile.  <br>
He could not think of anything else the whole journey back to his small, dirty apartment.  Once again he found himself thinking about his hate for Ryan.<br>
 ‘I must do something, I have to get rid of him!!’ <br>
‘Yes that’s it I’ll get rid of him.  That will solve everything!’ Andrew grimed to himself. <br>
Andrew fell asleep late that night, he was kept awake by his excitement.  He would finally be rid of Ryan and hopefully get the girl, Konoha.  <br>
<br>
The next morning Andrew strolled to work with a smile beaming from his face.  As he got into the office he greeted everyone, people were shock as he had never done this before.  Konoha was already in the office when Andrew burst into the room thinking that he would be alone.<br>
‘Oops sorry,’ Andrew’s face lit up in a different way, his face had turned completely red.  <br>
‘Don’t worry, you didn’t disturb me!’ ‘That’s good.’  Andrew sat down in his chair and store out the window like he would, but this time he felt different.  He could see the outcome of what he was about to do, and could only see a brighter future.<br>
‘Day dreaming again is we Andrew!’ said Ryan as he knocked in the desk like it was a door.  ‘No! Just thinking.’ Andrew replied in a cheerful voice.  Ryan looked at Andrew in amazements he could sense a change and he didn’t like it. <br>
‘Nice ring’ Ryan said as he pointed to the ring in Andrew’s middle finger.  ‘It was my mothers’ replied Andrew.  As Ryan turned to walk to his desk Andrew stopped him,<br>
‘Ryan’ Ryan turned unsure as Andrews voice was assertive and Ryan had never heard this voice before coming from Andrew especially to him. <br>
‘What?!’  <br>
‘I want to see you tomorrow after work.’  A grim slivered across Andrews face.  Ryan was stunned by the different person that sat before him.  <br>
‘Sure, what is it about?’<br>
‘Don’t worry’ replied Andrew in a short blast.<br>
‘You will have to wait to tomorrow.’  Ryan returned to his desk uneasy, he could sense something strange but could not figure out what.<br>
<br>
The day flu by for Andrew he could feel the weight lifting from his shoulders already and could not wait to the next day.  When Andrew got home he began tiding his apartment, vacuuming, dusting for the first time in years.  When he was done, he sat down to dinner, pleased.  Looking at the reflection in the knife he held in his right hand he smiled.<br>
The next day he walked to work as he did in the past, <br>
‘I must not bring atension to myself today, he can not find out until the last moment or it will not be prefect.’  <br>
When he entered the office Konoha was there early again.<br>
‘How comes you are always here early?’ ask Andrew softly.<br>
‘I like to start early, it allows me to work better.’  Konoha smiled at Andrew, Andrew could not think of a reply as he stared at Konoha. <br>
‘G..g..good, nice to see a hard worker.’<br>
Andrew was as normal that day trying his best to try and stay composed.  <br>
‘Er, Hello Andrew…’  Andrew looked up, Konoha stood in front of his desk.  <br>
‘Y..yes’<br>
‘I was thinking, I was wondering if you would like to go out for a drink with me tonight.’<br>
‘Andrew was stunned, he had never been asked out, he could not believe his fortune.<br>
‘Y..no sorry’  Andrew remembered his appointment with Ryan.  <br>
‘I have an appointment with Ryan, maybe some other day.’  Konoha’s face sunk, <br>
‘Sorry to have bothered you.’<br>
‘No worries,’ replied Andrew.  He watched as Konoha walked back to her desk.<br>
<br>
‘See you to night’ said Ryan as he walked past smirking.  Andrew’s mind was made he was going to get rid of him tonight.  Andrew sat at his desk watching the seconds past as he waited for Ryan.  He was late, Andrew decided to go look for him.  As he entered the office light cut through the darkness.  Andrew made his way to Ryan’s desks, bumping into chairs and files on the way.<br>
As Andrew came to the desk he was surprised that all Ryan’s files had been cleared.  Andrew flicked the desk lamp on.<br>
He froze with fear as he sat down on the desk chair.  The desk was covered with photos of him, his mother and his apartment.  Andrew could not believe what he was seeing he sank into his cupped hands and stared at the photos of him at his mother’s funeral.<br>
‘Andrew’<br>
Andrew looked up to be met by a knife to the head,<br>
‘No one fires me!’<br>
Ryan’s face was fall of hatred as he pulled the knife out slowly, blood stained his hands.  He lifted Andrews’s dead body, holding his hand he pulled the ring from the middle finger and placed in around his.<br>
<br>
As Ryan walked slowly to the door he turned and looked back at the desk that Andrew laid under and smiled.  <br>

<br>
Secondly, is English your native language? Either way, work on your grammer and spelling. <br>
<br>
Third,learn proper story spacing. An example:<br>
Incorrect:&quot;blah blah blah....&quot;He said. The other guy said&quot;Blah blah bloop.&quot;<br>
<br>
Correct:&quot;blah blah blah....&quot;He said.<br>
<br>
 The other guy said&quot;Blah blah bloop.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, nice ending. The twist was a bit surprising. Aside from the errors, this story was pretty good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darksketcher821>Dark Sketcher 821 </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/2/03 10:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=911.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hatred.
