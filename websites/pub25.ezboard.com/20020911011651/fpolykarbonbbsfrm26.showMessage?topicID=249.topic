This is called &quot;Roleplaying&quot; and involves basically the same idea as behind the Impromangas.  I will start off the story with myself, using my handle as my character's name.  The rules are easy to follow:<br><br>Write only your character and try to keep the storyline open for others to join.<br>Don't write other people's characters without their permission, that includes characters they created as secondary characters.<br><br>Well, let's give it a go.  This is quite addictive, and you will find yourself writing as much as 20 pages of story a month, last time I did this I clocked about 250 written pages, 500 if in paper-back format <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br><br><br>The cool, clean breeze of the ocean swept through the long, brown hair of Winlabik.  Looking out across the vast amount of water, he saw small spots of fishing trawlers, trying to get to port before the storm.  Down closer to the horizon, Win could make out the dark silhouette of the clouds, making their way closer to the coast.<br>His Brown-Green eyes focused in on another small spec, what looked like a child in the water!  Holding up his binoculars, he zoomed in on the object.<br>&quot;Just another piece of driftwood.&quot;  He said to himself, putting his glasses back down.<br>Shifting slightly in his seat, he picked up his receiver.  &quot;Control, this is nine-zero-five-alpha.&quot;  He checked his code book for a few words, &quot;No visual on Frisbees, looks like a clean slate.&quot;<br>He stood up and started to collect his belongings into a small bag, his fisherman's chair still planted into the sand.<br>&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Roger, nine-zero-five-alpha,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; the radio reported back, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Clear the area and head for hangover.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>Win knew the command the second he heard it, the storm was going to be rough, and he needed to head for shelter.<br>Pulling a small map out of his pocket, he started to finger a route to the town hall.  After a few minutes of looking at the map, he placed it back into his pocket and picked up his chair.<br>'<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Good thing I didn't drive here,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->' he thought, '<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   my car would have been left out for the storm...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'<br>Walking up the sandy beach, he checked back over his shoulder, the storm was getting closer and the waters were becoming clear of traffic.

She hated being dragged outside of her natural enviroment,and the beach was certainly not natural to her. In the water,splashing around were 6 people she called her 'friends.' Though the word meaned nothing to her than just someone to talk to besides her parents. Liz went back to her book that was titled &quot;Myths of the Norsemen&quot;. She had gotten a few odd looks when she had brought the book to school. No one her age read that sort of thing.<br>'None but Odin and has wife and queen Frigga were priviliged to use this seat-'. She sensed the twister befor she saw it. Her head snapped up from the pages of her book straight to the funnel.<br>&quot;uh guys,&quot;She shouted to her friends who splashed merrily in the water unaware of the uncoming twister.<br>&quot;yeah?what is it liz?&quot;one of them shouted back. Liz pointed in the direction of the twister.<br>&quot;we had best go before-&quot;<br>&quot;hey!thats pretty cool!we can watch it as we swim!&quot; The youngest of them all,Carrie was her name,shouted.<br>&quot;that wouldn't be safe!Its coming right for us,if we don't hurry,well...&quot;Liz trailed off. She'd rather not go into detail for fear that her gory explaination would disturb them.Five of her friends trudged out of the water,but Carrie,being as stupid as she was,floated there gazing at the twister.Her other five friends picked up their things and hedded towards the nearest building. Carrie started to move towards the shore,and Liz stood up,sure that the danger had been averted. After a moment of walking her body went stiff. She looked back,but Carrie wasn't there as she had suspected. Floating in the water was a pale blue body,face down bobbing slowly in the water. Liz blinked. The body was gone,and in its place was Carrie,still staring at the twister. <br>&quot;Carrie,move it or-&quot; <br>     Carrie went under. Her head bobbed back up,gasping for air. Liz's nerve snapped. Her mind darted back to that horrible instant in the lake when she had been 9. She could feel the ice cold water stabbing like a thousand neddles on her flesh. The sour taste of the water as she gulped-. Carrie screamed. Liz looked around her. The other had gone in. She couldn't go in the water!Carrie was to far out and liz would surely drown if she entered the water. She did the only thing she could think of.<br>&quot;somebody help!Theres someone in the water!Somebody!We need help!!&quot; She continued shouting,shivering with fear.<br>'oh god..please let someone come..'<br>&quot;HELP!&quot;<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/20/01 3:07:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> Winlabik put his chair up against the side of the town hall; he looked to the sky for a moment.

He had chased storms before joining the &quot;Corps&quot;, so he knew his weather when he heard it.<br>&quot;Sounds like a funnel over the water,&quot; he said to himself, as he checked his equipment once more.<br>Pulling out the radio microphone he tapped down on the button, &quot;Nine-zero-five-alpha, I've hit hangover.&quot;<br>&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Rodger, five-alpha.

Ed had the same appearance. With a perpetual rough salt-and-pepper five o'clock shadow and stringy, shoulder-length silver hair with some strands of black, he looked like he'd been through hell and had given more than he'd got. In addition to this, he was over six feet tall, and his limbs were so thin and bony that he seemed a giant when seen without other objects to put scale to him.<br><br>He'd lived in the same house in the town since anyone could remember, only emerging once a week to buy groceries and every day in the morning to tend his small garden. He had no friends, no-one he played cards with; no-one even knew whether or not he had a phone, and if he did, his number was unlisted.<br><br>But, whatever his background, whatever his worldview, he sat on his porch and watched the twister approach; then, the desperate shouts of Liz drifted up from down the beach and he turned his head in a birdlike motion and listened.<br><br>He stayed in his seat for another moment or so after he understood the meaning of the cries for help, then made a silent decision and rose from his seat, his spidery limbs unfolding as he ran down the beach to where Carrie was drowning, kicking up sand...<br><br>As he drew up to Liz, he stopped, breathing slightly hard. &quot;What happened? She a friend of yours?&quot; he asked in a gruff voice, then saw how close the twister was coming and saw that there was no time left to assess the situation...and, that unless he acted right then, Carrie had no time left to her either.<br><br>The recluse ran into the surf, not bothering to take off his shirt; he was barefoot, a good thing since shoes make swimming twice as hard. Swimming with powerful strokes, showing more strength than would have been expected from his thin frame, he quickly caught up to Carrie, and grabbed her around the neck, fighting the undertow.<br><br>Holding her with one arm, he frantically strove to make it back to shore, to water that he could stand in...with the strokes of an expert swimmer, albeit one that was somewhat rusty, he strained back to shore, fighting the current that would drag him and the girl into the twister and leave nothing more than their bloated and blackened bodies, no souls, no lives...<br><br>With a final heroic effort, he gained the shore, standing unsteadily and staggering out of reach of the waves, supporting Carrie before falling to one knee, coughing from the water that he had accidentally swallowed in the rough surf.<br><br>((Hope this is OK....^_^ I like spectacular character entrances!)) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uravenofmemory.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenofmemory</A> at: 7/20/01 6:28:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uravenofmemory.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravenofmemory</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/20/01 6:27:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> ((Eep, forgot to disable the photo thingy...it's disabled now tho ^_^)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/21/01 2:55:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;&quot;Welcome, Sir.&quot;  A smiling face greeted Winlabik as he hit the bottom of the stairs.  &quot;Coffee and blankets are over there, please help yourself.&quot;<br>Smiling back, Win nodded his head slightly and found a spot to drop his stuff.

Control had him up late last night, as with just about every other night.<br>What had started as another sighting just turned into nothing but simple light flashes from a storm cloud just over the horizon.  Almost as much of a failure as the one mission where a guy claimed to have bodies.<br>Winlabik grinned when he started to remember tapping on those hard bodies, made from paper-mache.  After he left Duke University with his Psychology degree and Minor in Parapsychology, Win joined up with the &quot;Corps'.  A group devoted to the scientific study of the Paranormal.  In the course of his, so far, three-year professional career, he had seen just about everything.  Although it seems easier to trace down Ghosts and Psychics than what he was in Waatch for, UFOs.<br>Control was the central office, they tried to keep themselves moving fast, very similar to his earlier job of storm tracking.  If there is a report of anything, usually a Corps member is no more than 2 hours away from the sighting.<br>Fixing up his coffee, Win noticed that the others were looking pretty upset.  Understandable since they have homes and possessions out in that storm.  Lucky for him, he was just visiting.<br>Win licked his small plastic stirrer and then sat back down on the floor next to his things.  Pulling out his journal, he started to record the day's failure.<br>'Welcome to Waatch, Washington.&quot; He said to himself. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A> at: 7/21/01 2:56:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/21/01 1:47:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> A look of relief spread over Liz's face.

Well, I can tell you plenty.&quot;  Win took a sip of the coffee and gave a grimace, &quot;Wow, I didn't think it was that bad yesterday, all well, as long as it's warm.&quot;<br>He gave a big yawn from the lack of sleep, and pulled out his map of the United States.

The east coast gets hammered all the time, but that's because most wind and the jet stream flow east to west.&quot;  He pointed back at Waatch, Washington, &quot;So now it's not only a freak of nature that we have a full hurricane this far north, but also on the west coast!&quot;  He put the map back into his bag.<br>&quot;The winds may reach up to one-hundred-twenty miles per hour, and maybe even more than that,&quot; their faces didn't look too happy.

This shelter was built during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and should be more than strong enough to handle the storm.&quot;<br>Win took another casual sip of the &quot;coffee&quot; before he checked the bandaged girl once again.  Something sparked in his head.  That girl, she wasn't having an episode, she was seeing something.  Yes, he had seen that before.  A girl in Minnesota had the same problem, claimed to see everyone dead in &quot;visions&quot;.  Although He tried, Win couldn't keep her from killing herself.  He was sent there to verify if she had psychic ability, in the end she was nothing more than a paranoid schizophrenic.<br>&quot;How often do you have those visions of yours?&quot; He looked into the eyes of the young girl and took a sip of coffee. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A> at: 7/23/01 2:55:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/23/01 9:54:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;Well I..I really don't like to talk about that but...&quot; A feeling of unease took over Liz.

Mabey she was just nervouse.<br>&quot;when i was younger,about six or so,i had a few &quot;visions' as you call them,but they were unimportant. For instance,at times,if I were in a rather large building,i would see people there not from our time. Basically,i was seeing ghosts. But they didn't look like everyone says,they weren't misty,or horrible looking. They were just people,dressed in the fasions of their time. I never thought much of it,&quot; She took a small sip of her coffee,horrible stuff,but it was all she had keepign her warm.<br>&quot;things really started to get intense when puperty came along. At first i only had premonitions in my dreams,and after awhile i occasinaly had them while awake. At times,i'll have them one after the other. For instance,i once got in a fight with some others,the thing was though,i could see what they would do befor it happened. I could see every punch they threw,every kick. So,if there is appending danger,i see what happens so as to avoid it. Other times,i'll have out of body experiences. Sometimes i'll see myself,mabey walking,or taking a test,whatever,its like if my mind looses connection with my body,&quot; Liz looked around,to see if anyone else had heard. When she had tried to tell other people about these things,they either were terrified of her,or laughed,calling Liz a liar. <br>&quot;I told my parents what were happening. They started to get worried. See,we moved here from Chicago about 6 months ago. They thought i was having halluncinations,that the city was just so overwhelming. But since we moved here,things have become worse. I have more premonitions than befor,and i hear the voices more often. When everything is quite,sometimes i'll hear the voices,screaming in my ear,asking for help. At first,i thought i was imaginging things,but i knew they were real!I could hear them shouting out my name,asking for help,but no one belived me!They thought i was crazy!They couldn't see what i could,they couldn't hear what i could,and they just couldn't get it,just because a persons put down in the ground doesn't mean their gone!Their spirits still roam the earth,and no one belives me!&quot; Liz slammed her fist on the floor. She was more suprised that any else at her outburst. Her gaze fell to the floor.<br>&quot;I'm sorry,i should have just given you a straigh answer.
