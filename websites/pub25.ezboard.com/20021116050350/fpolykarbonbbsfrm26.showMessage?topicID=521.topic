In this plotline Canada, Japan, Germany, Spain, France, and the UK were the only countries who had the funds to fully convert from Petrolium to alternetive fuels(mainly electric, vegetable oil, and alcohal).  All the Western Allies and the Eastern World have converted their armies to mainly Alcohal and Hydrogen Fuel Cell in the 20's.<br>

It doesn't mean that people gave up their petrolium based autos, about 49% of the former EU's population still use petrolium based cars.<br>

obviously mining rock and dust and sendig them back to earth has become profitable....especially mars...when mars is at it's closest point to earth it'd take over 3 years to get there....at light speed it would take 10 minutes....<br>
France would not be a nation to do this....it's out of character...as was mentioned germany or china or russia would be more likely candidates...<br>
<br>
Solar activity isn't a natural disaster....it causes the northern lights and some weird electronic failures but nothing special....it happens all the time...<br>
<br>
France collapsing into anarchy would be a rather lame excuse for a global economy problem....especially with the euro....NATO and the UN are pretty much innefectual in the current day in age anyway...the only thing they're useful for is providing catalyst for another world war (hmm axis and aliance)....the EU as far as I can tell is mostly to help trade and economy...like NAFTA in north america...they probably wouldn't disolve....especially not in a crisis...that's when they'd actually be useful<br>
<br>
By bipartisan do you mean two party system like in the US????<br>
making france like ireland is a curious idea....<br>
<br>
I wouldn't consider england a super power...being an island nation and relying on everyone else for resources....and if a country discovered a jump drive...they'd likely keep it secret...especially during poor economic times<br>
<br>
Having something work the first time is lame....it's unrealistic....glitches always happen....even when things go good<br>
<br>
Oil running out in the middle east is something they keep claiming....&quot;Who runs barter town....EMBARGO ON&quot;  OPEC would probably be long gone by then anyway...everyone is sick of them already<br>
<br>
Ummm....Canada has piles of oil....everyone knows that....alberta is supposed to rival the middle east...and drilling in the NWT and the maritimes is being done as well....where there's dinosaurs there's oil....<br>
By the time any of this happens oil will be useless anyway....we could honestly have the whole planet be converted to alternative fuels in under a year if there was pressure to do so....consumers haven't welcomed any new ideas very enthusiastically....<br>
<br>
Ummm Canada is the envy of the west...none of the western countries will admit it though...we aren't the richest but there's much more to envy than that....We have MOOSE!!!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you refering to the russian dancing bear at the circus *scratches head*....<br>
there are countries that crank out more oil than iraq...and I thought the oil was gone anyway...why attack a country with no resources....I guess they could export sand....<br>
<br>
Is &quot;scaring the hell out of the neighbors&quot; a technical term<br>
<br>
If russia and china militarize after attacking everybody (including iraq's mecha army) what did they attack with....WITS??? &quot;Hey Iraq....I'll ro sham bo you for the country...&quot;<br>
<br>
Countries getting jumpy sounds strange....especially since nobody got jumpy when hitler started bulking up the german army after WWI...even after he annexed a few countries nobody was particularly jumpy<br>
<br>
And Ummm...R/C buying oil and selling it to the us for less just to look pretty would be really dumb and terribly cost inneficient....<br>
<br>
If russia and canada were trading how likely is an invasion???? Why would the americans care if russia invaded their rich neighbor...<br>
<br>
There is troops in alaska already....by the time any of this happens there will be a bridge from alaska to russia anyway....(trust me)<br>
<br>
Russia ends up invading a wasteland that they owned originally anyway....(why wouldn't rich canada have bought it already....it would make trade much easier)<br>
Invading canada via the north pole would be stupid....for many reasons...(AAYESEBAARG DEEEAAAD AHEAD) and even if they did canada wouldn't notice for several years anyway....they all live in south canada...the polar bears would be the only sad ones....hudsons bay is no prise either....it's usually moslty frozen anyway<br>
<br>
<br>
A war between US and canada is unlikely....they all start in the south europe middle east area...<br>
<br>
<br>
You mention Japan....japan isn't terribly rich...they have to import everything but rice....what good is a volcanic island with no resources<br>
<br>
And by the time any of this happens....as I've said a lot...oil will be obsolete...it'll be pretty much obsolete in about ten years...garunteed<br>

Anyways, all that could happen 50 years in the future, it could happen a 100 years in the future if you think about it. You have to pick apart the story to fully understand it, not to ruin it. He said that France is (attempting) mining operations on Mars, and you said how long it takes to get there, so France must have something really good going for them  -so if France collapsed, then it would be a big deal. (cause as I've said, France would prob. be some super power)<br>
England not a super power? I think if they made a jump drive, they'd thell people about it-especially if France is mining on Mars.<br>
He said the solar activity is affecting trade lines, if England has a jump drive and France can go to Mars, my guess is that there are space ships that can do deleveries pretty fast via space, and I think solar activity could affect things in space.(might be hard to see, different equip could be affected,etc.)<br>
<br>
He also said the first jump ship is launched, so prototypes would have came before.Plus he had 5 super powers working on it.<br>
Why attack a country with no resources? Perhaps the other country attack first to steal resources, or perhaps it's sheltering terrorists.<br>
Also, oil might be usefull in the future,(could run the mining operations) and there is no reason why it wouldn't be needed later on.<br>
Countries might not have gotten jumpy in WWII, but in the future, maybe they have a REASON  to be jumpy, technology has advanced since then, and prob will in the future.(N/B/C warfare)<br>
<br>
I think if Russia invaded Canada, America would care. NATO would prob be against that sort of thing, and that would be a little too close to home for America to just stand by.He also mentioned that America and Russia tension was building, America would deff. care then.<br>
There would prob also be stronger weapons, so ice burgs wouldn't be a threat.And he said the NWT are filled with oil, a good target for enemies, it would be way too stupid to go all the way through Canada just to get to the NWT when you could go there first.<br>
And if rocks from space are worth something, maybe new minerals are found, maybe Japan is sitting on the biggest deposit of that mineral.Or maybe the world is filled with anime fans.<br>
(Still calm) thats how you have to look at a story, I'd hate to see critics like that watching movies like StarWars of Lord of the Rings.<br>

fine... good suggestions.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I have a time line of this, jsut not finished, It's better than that piece.<br>
<br>
The economic collapse is mainly cause by the mass selling of stock of the mining companies and the industries taht are fueld by it.  The massive industrial base on earth that is dependent on off world mining is stopped.  Stock prices crash as fuel, steel, mineral, manufactures, computer companies, software, and shipping industries are hit hard, they lose millions which causes a ripple effect.  When france collapses, everyone sells, everything then falls apart.<br>
<br>
The Jump drive is a device which allows something to cruise FTL.<br>
<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
        September of 2030 AD(OC), France suffers a massive economic loss because of the failure of the French Aerospace Administration to launch a successful colonization mission to Mars or the Moon due to a already critical recession.  Lagging behind the rest of the modern day super powers, French economic and political sway is greatly diminish as they have no claim a off Earth colony, the abundant resources of the Moon and Mars are being exploited mainly by German, the Joint Anglo-American, Japanese, Russo-China, and Spanish super powers.  The French economic situation suffers ever more as new resource deposits are found on the moon.<br>
<br>
        October, Solar activity unexpectedly spikes sending out large amounts of solar matter temporarily suspending the Trans-World trade lines due to extreme radiation, the Van Allen Belts of Earth and Mars are severely eradiated and Lunar radiation is in the danger zone, hundreds of miners die on the Moon from radiation exposure. Suddenly the French situation is now a matter of economic existence, if no resources are found to support the massive industrial base that developed because of off world resources.  Suddenly a twenty-nine year old act of unification seems like a black hole, aid is sent to France. Solar activity effects telecommunications and cause a massive orbital cascade of old communication satellites further knocking out communications all over the world.<br>
<br>
        December, Solar activity is still spiking thus shutting down the Trans-World trade and telecommunications is crippled, billions lose their jobs, the super powers are in recession, Europe and their trade partners suffer also.  The French situation deteriorates even more, the government is continuously trying to control civil unrest foreign peace keeping troops are deployed by Germany and Spain.  Million of miners die on Mars of starvation.<br>
<br>
        January of  2031 AD(OC),  The French situation collapses.  All hell breaks lose, the Euro plummets, civil unrest turns to civil war as peace keeping forces are overwhelmed by civilian militants influenced by  anarchist and the federal reserve is ransacked.  France is now considered a hot zone, foreign personelle` are extracted.  British Prime Minister William Watson resigns from office simply stating that 'personal, political, and economic matters force to resign the Office of  Prime Minister of this great country Great Britain'. Thousands die.  Refugees pour into surrounding countries.  Media hype and mouth to ear makes the world economy deteriorate even more out of fear.<br>
<br>
        March, Solar activity stabilizes, Chinese scientists conclude this was a billion year solar cycle, this is the first time this has been observed.  Other physicists have different ideas.  It is still unknown to date and is still debated.  Trans-World trade is restored but the damage is done, thousands of miners and workers are dead, the value of the Euro has hit rock bottom, trillions are estimated lost.  Mainland Europe is shattered as a ripple effect spreads from France.  The world economy is in ruins with the loss of the EU's trade.  Britain, America, Russia, China, Germany, Japan  and other numerous self contained nations without the industrial base needing off world resources survive the economic collapse of the world but in tatters of their former selves.  The European Union and NATO are temporarily dissolved due to economic affairs of each respective country.<br>
        <br>
                19 of March of 2031,  Patrick Conner becomes the successor to the Office of Prime Minister of Great Britain.<br>
        <br>
        May, global media and telecommunications begin the slow process of restoration, Japan gets a sudden boom as they were at the forefront of satellite technology from before the collapse.  The former NATO pact nations send peace keeping forces to France to stabilize the situation.  America sends millions of aid dollars that they can't afford to France to increase America's prestige in the post collapse world.  Russia and China do the same.<br>
<br>
        June, America is the first nation to restore a large fraction of it's Trans-World trade lines sending it even deeper into debt.  Germany eager to be the center of economic trade of Europe, even though they are already the only Western European state that's economically stable at the point, follow America in the re-establishing Trans-World trade.  America in a effort to earn some political power, and some probably long range profit, loans Britain a parcel of resources, knowing their value will increase as many former superpowers would start asking for resources after a while to jump start their Trans-World trade lines sooner or not-so later.<br>
<br>
        September, The international community holds a large meeting, the Moscow Convention, located in Moscow, Russia, to help stabilize the world economy and keep a situation like this from happening again.  After three weeks of quarreling and protests by some of the greater nations of this post depression period, namely Russia, America, and China, the Moscow Convention is postponed indefinitely.  The nations are divided, American and German aid are channeled to European, African, Pacific, and South American countries while the Russo-China aid is channeled into the Middle East, Asia, and Eastern European areas.<br>
<br>
        26 of September of 2031AD(OC),  Isaac Lee Lowe, vice president of the United States of America, is sworn into the President's seat after the assassination of former President James Gregory Hanson.  Conspiracy theories abound, mainly of a foreign hand in this play.<br>
        <br>
        October, The Middle Eastern nations rise to power leeching more than a fair share of resources from the Russians.  Tensions rise again in the volatile area.  Finally learning from history, the major super powers withdraw from the situation for the most part, besides, they need to fix their own countries.  Until the silos doors begin to open or foreign interests are gravely threatened, the West is just about silent.<br>
<br>
-Russia purposesly gives more supplies to Iraq-<br>
<br>
                10 of February of 2032,  Saudi Arabian oil wells begin to show signs of running dry.  OPEC order extremely detailed and optimistic surveys the oil fields of the  OPEC countries.  Unexpected and troubling results plague the survey, the major oil fields of the OPEC countries are projected to only have five to seven and a half years before the wells begin to run dry.  OPEC keeps the information tightly secured in order to not frighten the consumers.<br>
<br>
        March, Oil prices begin to increase from one(19.6 Euro) to two(39.2 Euro) American dollars per litter.  Pressure is put on OPEC to lower their price, they hold a international conference and set the price to about one and a half American dollars(29.25 Euro).<br>
<br>
        May, France begin to stabilize along with the world economy.  A bipartisan government is established in the North, the South is still in anarchy, not recognizing the post collapse government based in Northern France.<br>
<br>
        June, Iraqi, Kuwaiti, and Saudi tensions increase dramatically when Iraq begins to mass their troops along the borders.  The West attends to their own matters of inflation, capitalism, and taxation, politics as usual in the Middle East is very much not a high priority.  The few NATO satellites that have been launched casually monitors the situation from afar.  Southern France organizes it's own government shifting the delicate economical and political scales of the European continent,<br>
<br>
        July, Missiles begin to fly in the Middle East as Iraqi forces enter Kuwait and begin to funnel concern to the Middle East.  International response is more drastic than the usual missile barrage into the thick of it.  Russia lands troops in Iraq to quell the fighting.<br>
<br>
        August, the Middle East is stabilized as Russia seizes Iraq's reigns of power and now have sway in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and the fourth largest reserve of oil in the region.  Middle Eastern response is less than grateful seeing Russia's intervention as a invasion on the independence of the Middle Eastern states.  Many westerners wonder why this didn't happen twenty years ago. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prismrefraction>PrismRefraction</A> at: 2/28/02 4:30:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/2/02 2:25:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plot line</span><hr size=1> I'm thinking politics....<br>
sure some of the facts could work...<br>
The french could go to mars....I guess.....but wouldn't it be more likely for someone else to do it first??? Like say somone who's been sending probes for 50 years..instead of someone who's been stomping on grapes<br>
England is an influential country...no doubt...but in war they have to be very defensive....they live on an island...using the american style of war it's an easy target....they can't even escape....<br>
and given the relationship between france and england I doubt england would be too helpful to france....especially considering the goverment in the UK is more big brotherish and secretive than most...it's also almost an anarchy already anyway it just needs a little push.....<br>
why would you share goverment secrets with your oldest rival who is in economic trouble....they couldn't pay for them......why when you can use it for your own gain....<br>
as well....have you ever done group work with 5 friends....one does all the work...the others sit and argue...if it does finally get done it's slightly inferior and everybody wants it for themselves....<br>
Oil will never be more important than it is now....there are much better solutions...petro chemicals are relatively innefficient...there's even better lubricants...mining operations use more electricity and water than anything else<br>
<br>
Attacking a country to gain resources is futile when they have no resources either...attacking a country that could stomp you in a night would be pointless too...and attacking countries that shelter terrorists isn't a reason....it's a ruse....<br>
Ireland would be flat now if it was ever a reason....same with israel....they're still there because they're allies....why the americans are flatening afghanistan is to get rid of WWII artillery that was taking space and to impose american values and to put the country so far in ruin but remain friendly with them so that when the job is done they'll buy american products to help them....Oh...and OIL....<br>
terrorism was an excuse...sure it was a good one and you can't let terrorists fly into a building withought justice....but getting rid of terrorists is silly and futile....<br>
can we say witch hunt...<br>
of course that's more TODAY politics...<br>
<br>
In WWII there was all of that N/B/C....and all of it was used....WWIII I doubt would be much different...most counrtries would practice restraint...especially the powerful countries....the little looser countries with nothing too loose but a few nuke and some sarin....they'd use it left and right....<br>
<br>
And yes america would care because most american resources come from canada....Electricity...Oil...Doctors and any other professional work....<br>
Russia and the US aren't enemies per se....they have the same relationship as eng and france.....<br>
Nato would be against it....nato is against change...which drives me crazy...anytime a country wants to expand it's borders a little nato dives on it....then rather than 2 countries duking it out for borders you bring alliances into it then you have trouble....all you do is blow a lot up make a lot of noise and in the end accomplish nothing....it's like fighting with women....<br>
<br>
getting to the NWT from russia is quicker via alaska than NWT....<br>
if the troops are water borne...than ice bergs will always be a problem<br>
I guess you could go by air I guess...<br>
Canada would likely let them have it...they'd love it...it's just like siberia except withought russian women<br>
and Japan has very few resources...wood....fish....rice...rent-a-zilla and Engrish<br>
I know...there's more...but they're one of the few rich countries that would be totally crippled by an embargo of any kind....they almost totally depend on everyone else....<br>
Yes I do like to argue....and yes I have a lot of fun watching starwars and LOTR....<br>
