I really want to badly.  I'm only in my 2nd year in high school, and my mother says she not going to let me go anywhere until she can't legal keep me here, that means until i'm 18, so college is my only choice.  What can i do.  Should i look for a college that has an Exchange student program, or should i look for a separate porgram, and hold off college for a year?  I need input people, please, also can someone give me an estimate of the cost of my dream, i know it can't be cheap.  Thanks!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufalcondelta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FalconDelta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/16/01 6:37:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hipolymer.virtualave.net/images/Delta.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> Well... you sound like you really want to go to Japan. I, myself, have at heart an interest along the same lines. I am also a High School student and I am 90% sure that I am going to Japan next year over the summer. My  High School runs a plan called ICE ( Inter-Cultural Exchange) which sets a student up with a host family in Japan for around 3 to 4 weeks during the summer. Once there you get a look at the school system and daily life in Japan. My friend took the program last year and he loved it. However, my school runs a program that is virtually one of the best and safest programs in the country, so his parents hardly had to ask when he was leaving. You should inquire in your school administration office as to whether they are aware of a program like this in your area. Since I plan to study japanese language in college and take a semester abroad there. I will be taking the ICE sponsored trip to Japan next summer. Now that you know I'm along the same line of thinking, I will briefly out line a way in which you can hopefully convince your parents. <br>First make it clear that you really, really, really want to go and its going to be very hard on you if you can't go. You should start out by being nice, doing things the first time your asked, doing things without being asked, cleaning the house often, whatever it takes. If it comes to whining and pleading you may still have a chance, but it is less likely. Secondly, do some research on different areas in japan and look at travel magazines and pictures to find out if you really want to go there. Even if you do this I'll bet you it will be a bit different when you get there. If you haven't been away from home for very long, there is a real possiblity you could feel homesick, so make sure you won't be depressed being away from home. Also, drop occasionally the comment that Japan is a relatively safe place, but then it all depends where you are etc. Your mom sounds like she is kinda over protective, which you can't really blame parents for being in cases. Just explain its only for 3 weeks and that you'll write her and call her every single day if that is what it takes. If you want my further opinion etc. You can drop me an e-mail: falcon2145@home.com<br><br>-Falcon <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/16/01 6:54:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> Hey falcon...I've been seeing a lot of you...<br>I just got done an exchange like that...my school and a school in japan have kind of a deal going...It's a really relaxed exchange and it's only for a month (in the summer)...so it's not quite the commitment it takes for a full year...the only catch was you had to pay for the plane ticket which was $1500...The student came back here and we had a great time...I had ridiculously good time there...words can't describe it...If you do go...don't say no to anything...sure you'll eventually hit some things you don't like but you don't want to miss out on something you may love...If you look around there are some adult exchanges...the same teacher that does the exchange at our school does an adult exchange...it's about $5000 but that's all inclusive...you should be able to find something...as well you could make friends with someone there and stay there and go on vacation...or do what I plan on doing after post secondary...Teach english...it's a good way to see Japan for a few years and get payed to do it... <p>--Power corrupts but absolute power is kinda neat ---               Single Handedly saving the porn industry--</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufalcondelta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FalconDelta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 4:22:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hipolymer.virtualave.net/images/Delta.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> WOW... so cool you've been there, that's awesome. You have to tell me more about it. I am so excited about going there this summer. I went down to the local university in my area and checked out some books on japanese language just to get a jump start. It's a tough language to learn, but i figure once i am in college i can get help there. What sort of places did you go to while you were there? I hear karaoke is a big thing there. My grandparents went there a few years back and they said that they had a grand time. Are there any places that are really worth making the effort to see while there?<br><br>-Falcon<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 9:22:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> Well...this is really changing the subject.....<br>I was in the tottori prefecture (about the same as a state or province)...<br>it's on the korean side about 3hours west of osaka...<br>what you should do is go to the old area and see the stuff in Kyoto and Nara...especially this massive buddah...ask any japanese they'll no what you mean...it's a buddah that's about 6 storeys tall and you might see pictures but nothing makes sense untill you're there....there's also a big building made of gold<br>also go up the mountains...there's roads up most of them but they're hard to find...Try going up the mountains at night so you can see the lights...bring a flashlight though...I didn't and had to climb down without one<br>and if you're in the tottori prefecture...try and go to the daisen fire festival...I didn't get to go but it's supposed to be sweet...<br>If you like cars and know what you're looking for in the stats go to a car dealership and get some brochures...they're free and you can learn katakana and some kanji...as well autotrader style magazines help too... <p>--Power corrupts but absolute power is kinda neat ---               Single Handedly saving the porn industry--</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufalcondelta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FalconDelta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/18/01 5:29:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hipolymer.virtualave.net/images/Delta.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> Sounds like there is a whole bunch to do there. Hopefully the exchange program wont restric my movements too much. My friend went to this one Zen temple place on a mountain or hill or something and they said it was really cool. I forget the name so I have to talk in generalities. (zen temple on mountain top = very vague) but oh well... I was trying to do some research and get a collection of places that I wanted to go. I wanted to pick up some swords over there too and a couple of other martial arts things. I just hope with all the crazy terrorism stuff I'll be able to ship them back through customs. Now that hell registration week is over at my school, I will actually have time to go in and talk to the people that run the exchange program and find out more about it.<br><br>-Falcon <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/18/01 7:49:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> Hmmm...bringing swords across the border...I think if it can be considered a weapon you're @#%$ out of luck...maybe a practice sword made from bamboo...or possibly a decorative sword...doubtfull...you'd have to pay duty too because it'd be well over $500 there's no way around that...you'd be better off to mail it and get it when you get home...I think if you can hijack a plane with boxcutters a samurai sword and some nunchucks would draw attention...<br>you can get nice stuff over here...but I know it's not the same...I'm sure you can do it but it likely won't be easy...or cheap...and you can't hide it in an x-ray machine either <p>--Power corrupts but absolute power is kinda neat ---               Single Handedly saving the porn industry--</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utairomu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tairomu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/24/01 7:05:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High school student needing help with future here....</span><hr size=1> I think the swords are going to be a negative since in japan they dont have guns they are banned so it will be even harder for you to get them and even more to get them through customs.  You can get them imported would probably be a better idea and it will save you less hassle during your trip too.  You can find good programs through various schools but right now I would take the one that would be the most inexpensive as well as being able to see all things you want to see in japan.  Where do you want to go? Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa......  You should think about that too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=463.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=463.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=463.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=463.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=463.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=463.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5>Japanese Language Help</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
