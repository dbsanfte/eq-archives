is a stupid reason for hating anything.  I will admit that the popularity of anime HAS risen over the past few years and has become another bandwagon that people need to jump on or in front of.<br>
<br>
Now that anime is no longer an &quot;underground&quot; phenomena(using underground cuz I can't think of a better word.) like it was when I started watching it.  For younger people it's the same reason they have to get the 120 dollar shoes or whatever.  Because now its &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;in.&quot;  I don't have a problem with the fact that anime is more popular, that means more for us.  I don't like the people who get into something without really understanding what's BEHIND it.<br>
<br>
And then since it's popular you are going to have groups of people speaking out AGAINST it.  Which ticks off those of us who love Anime... but at the same time since the &quot;grown-up&quot; don't like it, more people have to get it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uanarchyao2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AnarchyAo2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/19/02 5:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   a</span><hr size=1> Yeah, alot of stupid people are out there.

She was extremely open-minded and allowed almost anything someone put effort in for extra-credit. If a student handed a piece that she thought was &quot;cartoony&quot; she simply give them less points for the assignment. I do remember a picure of Vash the Stampede ending up on the &quot;good peices by students&quot; board in the classroom. There is a difference between something that is art and something that is merely a illustration. I do not want to get into athestics but just remember that it is going to play a big role in the difference between art and illustration. <br>
<br>
I applied an Anime-like style to my APart portfolio. I kept it very suddle and kept is far away from being trite as I could. I also didn't make any fan pieces for an &quot;art&quot; class. I ending up getting a &quot;3&quot; and passing. <br>
<br>
A friend of mine did a similar thing but his work was more like character design illustration. His work was excellent and I knew the teacher liked his portfolio. She wasn't all that confident about it though. Unfortunantly he did not pass. <br>
<br>
I'll agree that people are arrogant to new concepts like Anime. I feel  as though I'm being driven underground because of my hobby. But I will go on knowing that arrogant people are only blissfully held up by their facade of &quot;real life&quot;. I look at these disgusting &quot;normal&quot; people seeing how ignorant and boring they are.<br>
<br>
As for Oprah, I didn't know she said such things. I'd be obliged to put into a coma just because of the kind of person she is. I bet she'd be alot of fun to beat up. <br>

in our high school art classes (like 4-5 years ago), there was a guy who brought in anime and we watched it while we worked on our projects. I'm not sure if our art teacher really liked it or not, but she was always very supportive. We usually watched Ranma or street fighter. THere were a few people in school who thought anime was just &quot;cartoon porn&quot;, but i never really felt like convincing them otherwise. They were just dumb, and I didn't care what they thought.<br>
<br>
In my college art classes there wasn't really any opposition to anime. Our professor hadn't really seen much of it, but by constantly showing him cool sites and artists who were very talented, he started to appreciate it, and he even went out and rented some anime to watch. I think he saw ghost in the shell and a few others.<br>
<br>
i guess my point is that not everyone is against us, and as time passes, anime will be more accepted by people. my senior year of art school there was a freshman who had just moved from korea who was awesome amazing and drew in an anime style, and by then, all of the students were drooling over her portfolio.<br>
<br>
it just takes a few people to show anime without shoving it down people's throats to get people interested. I think people are more likely to be interested in something if they &quot;find&quot; it themselves, so trying to show everyone how great anime is might have the opposite of the intended effect. <br>
<br>
maybe it's just me. <br>
damn, this thing got long. sorry ^__^;;<br>

&quot;When people attack anime, they mostly think that it's too foriegn... which may have been said. I also believe that most of it is just identified as 'cartoon-porn' as I have read from preceding posts. There are many ways to diffuse these statements:<br>
1) Tell them that if it's sooooo foriegn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  then why is Pokemon and Yugi-oh soooo popular? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
2) Explain to them the existence of 'hentai' <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Some anime is good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and some anime is bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Use simple words so they can understand... no fancy Japanese... (damn)<br>
3) Or if you don't think these will work, just say, 'You'll ne'er understand,' and include your fav anime quote afterwards... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .&quot;<br>
I've never had much of a problem with my high school art teacher. If anything, I don't think he cares whether it's anime or not. As long as it fills up the page and is pretty good, he's happy.

So next time somebody says anything about anime is for kids, you guys are urged to pat him on the head and say &quot;poor thing.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wyers>Wyers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/8/02 12:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do most people attack Anime???</span><hr size=1> what i dont get is why so many people care...<br>
let them think what they want...<br>
why do you care...<br>
who cares if they look down on you...<br>
if they accept everything they hear and easily look down on you because of one rumor they heard...why do you want to be associated with them anyway...<br>
<br>
<br>
the fact of the matter is...<br>
if they werent looking for a way to not like you...<br>
they would discard the &quot;anime is porn&quot; statement <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tehpinguan1>Teh PINGUAN1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/15/02 6:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do most people attack Anime???</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>just because our country is too immature to see a naked woman without sceaming &quot;PORNO!&quot; doesn't mean that Japan is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Oh, come on. You know as well as I do that it's in there to appease horny males.<br>
<br>
That said, it's ridiculous to attack anime just for being anime (just like it's ridiculous to praise anime just for being anime). I think that people do see the crappy stuff that's on children's TV and judge the entire medium by that. Also many people do not consider cartoons of any form to be art, because it generally doesn't follow classical rules. Whatever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adozeneggsmcgee>ADozenEggsMcGee</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/bird29/avatar_copy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/17/02 9:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do most people attack Anime???</span><hr size=1> im so glad that im not the only one with this problem :P<br>

almost every post on this thread has the same story to share, but every one is interesting because it seems every art teacher hates cartoons :P<br>
<br>
Well, im only in seventh grade and my art teacher only draws fish and cats and whatnot...so when he saw everyone in the class drawing anime, he let people go onto computers to look up tutorials and stuff..within ten minutes the vp and principle were in the room shutting down the computers and blocking the sites..even when it wasnt hentai<br>

and everyone has the problem with the jerk  that calls it child pornography,ya just gotta ignore those <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neoangel@polykarbonbbs>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/17/02 12:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1988.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do most people attack Anime???</span><hr size=1> Well, I told a coupla friends about Akira, and they wanted to try watching it.

And everyone knows that the story only becomes apparant after 30...<br>

Let me say... They are just jalous by the fact that big eyes are cute.<br>
<br>
American movies are making the boobies of their feminin caracters so big that I swear they look like watermelon! Damn. (Well japanese anime too though)<br>
Anyway, just to say that, when I say that I draw anime some ask:<br>
- You like girls with big eyes? <br>
or<br>
- Can you draw hentai?<br>
<br>
Prejugies...<br>
