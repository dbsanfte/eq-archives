It's about a 14 year old kid named Riven(maybe, not sure) who has a crush on the Princess of Denalla.  Her name is Nallya and she's a tomboy-type girl, likes archery and running around.  Every day he watches her when he can from the small farm where he and his mother live.  One night some strange half-snake people come and kidnap her.  Riven, of course, goes after her, but before he leaves, a girl (name?) who has a crush on him gives him a mysterious sword with a dark blue stone in the pommel.  When Riven gets to a town on the north coast of Denalla he learns who the snake-people are (Nagas or Naugas, I'm not sure which), why they took the Princess, and, most importantly, the secret of his sword.  Maybe I'll tell you guys more, but I'll leave there for now and let you crit me to death,yo. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emmapeel1601>emmapeel1601</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/emma2.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/29/03 7:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/garaigh/buddy2.txt height=127 width=107></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: me first fantasy story-crits!</span><hr size=1> looks fairly interesting so far. <br>
here's a few things that occurred to me as i read it. (due to the vagueness of the outline i may say things that you've already considered but you can feel free to say &quot;oh, i thought of that already.&quot;) <br>
<br>
first off, who is this second girl and is she like a best friend? you know, the one the guy is always telling all his problems to? the one who is secretly in love with Riven and can't tell him because she knows his heart lies elsewhere? does she come back into the story or is she there just to give him this mysterious sword?<br>
<br>
second, is the princess an annoying character? that's always cool when the object of the hero's affection turns out to be not as perfect as he thought. not that she has to be snotty or mean, just it makes things more interesting for the heroine to be strong-willed and hard to get along with. <br>
<br>
three, it kind of sounds like the people who kidnap the princess aren't necessarily evil (although i could have misread your intention there. that bit's pretty vague.) but let me tell you that there needs to be an obvious villain in the story somewhere. you can foil expectations by making the reader assume that the snake-people are evil and then bringing out another true villain. or you can let the readers know that they aren't evil and create tension because you (the reader) know that something big and tragic will happen if the confusion isn't cleared up. (Timothy Zahn wrote a great trilogy where he used that method. the humans and the aliens had inadvertantly misunderstood each other and were preparing to engage in a galactic war. the reader begins to guess what's really going on and is left in suspense waiting to see if the characters will figure it out in time.) <br>
<br>
btw, i don't know how old you are, but if you're sixteen or over i would suggest reading the first Song of Fire and Ice book by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones. he does a good job of writing about multiple young characters ranging in age from about six or seven to fourteen/fifteen. his writing is rather &quot;adult&quot; though (some graphic nudity, violence) so if you are still young then you might want to wait. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
anyway, this looks interesting. keep fleshing out the idea and see what happens. <br>

Since you're intrested, I'll tell you more.  <br>
There was a big war like 14-15 years before between the Nagas and the humans.  The humans wanted the island that the Nagas lived on.  Of course, the Nagas didn't want them to so they started the war.  Riven's father died in that war.  The Nagas ended up keeping their land but they never forgave the humans.  They have been plotting revenge ever since.  It so happens that a powerful spirit, imprisoned within a stone statue, hears of this.  It tells the Nagas that if they free it, it will help them get their revenge.  The only thing that can free it is blood from a dying human.  The sacrifice must be of great importance to the humans or otherwise it won't work.  The Nagas have only one chance to awaken the evil spirit, so they take the princess.<br>
<br>
I think that the princess will have to be gullible.  She will believe that the Nagas are friends until Riven tells her otherwise.  The girl who gives him the sword is just a girl who lives in his village.  The blue stone in the sword contains an ancient spirit called a Seraph.  It's sorta like the spirit that the Nagas are trying to free, but weaker.  There are other Seraph Stones scattered throughout the world, each serving a different purpose.  This particular one can cast a death-spell, which will bring an instant peaceful death to its target.  It is used to kill the princess in the end, so the Nagas can't use her anymore.  You see, the spirit requires blood from a dying body, not blood from an already dead one.  So Riven is sad that she died until he sees the girl again.  Then he realizes how beautiful she is.       <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theangrymob>TheAngryMob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/29/03 8:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold (but Fresh)</span><hr size=1> A decade and a half is a long time to hold a grudge, you may want to give the Nagas a longer lasting reason for attacking 15 years after the war.

Revenge doesn't age well, especially to American audiences. The rest of the story shows promise, stick with it and flesh out your synopsis.<br>

I think that the humans want the Nagas' island because there's a Seraph Stone hidden there.  They steal the stone but don't get the land.... The Stone contains a guardian Seraph and is currently held by Princess Nallya.  The Nagas plan to take the stone and then sacrifice her, because the Seraph prevents her from dying.  In the moment that the Stone looses its hold, tho, Riven uses the death Seraph in his sword. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blackrain704>blackrain704</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/1/03 9:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.endoropolis.org/sampizzacat/teyandee/fa17.jgp height=150 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: me first fantasy story-crits!</span><hr size=1> I'm really liking this story.

(That's something I struggle with too) The plot itself sounds great but if the settings are vague or generic it could ruin that. <br>
And I really like the idea of the stones and such. It always makes a story that much interesting if the character must find something. Will there be other characters traveling with Riven?
