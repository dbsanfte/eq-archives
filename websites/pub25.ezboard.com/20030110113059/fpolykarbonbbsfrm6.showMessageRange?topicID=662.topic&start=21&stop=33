If you want a sweet engine go for the merlin 632...that is SUCH A BEAST...hell of an expensive one too...especially the aluminum block...it would never fit in a civic though...you might wedge it into a pinto though...<br>
and the top speed on a drag stip I think is held by shirley muldowney at 312MPH...last I checked...<br>
If you want a nice car don't make it look like a beater...go for polished aluminum...paint ads weight...and aluminum doesn't corrode to bad...it worked for delorean....<br>
and stay far away from nitrous or nitro based fuels...or even alchol...you have to screw with timing to get it all right...as well dragsters use it because they don't expect the parts to last more than a few races...in a street car that's not a good idea...stick to turbo's and timing mods...and playing with the gear ratios...<br>
the first thing you should always get is new tires and brakes...<br>
and 70 isn't fast...I hit 100 in my minivan ...actually I did it in my moms beetle as well (it took a while)...she has the diesel one too 98hp<br>
And the little K-cars they have there have a place...driving 2 blocks to work in a lincoln navigator isn't efficient...driving 2 blocks in a scooter with a roof might be embarassing but it is cheap and efficient<br>
and comparing the unimog and excursion is a sin...the excursion is an ugly luxury car stuck inside a truck...the unimog is an ugly truck but there's no question what it's for...it's for work...offroad...onroad...doesn't matter...so it doesn't have a dvd player...you could back over an excursion by accident and not know it...and still get better gas milage<br>
And kia makes good cheap cars...dawoo is still crap...but kia makes the warrenties so they outlast the vehicle....so you keep it till the end of the warrantee then unload it...like a lease but better <p><pre>

I used to agree that the Unimog was for heavy work, but a) it only has a 2.3 liter engine, and even though it is more efficient, it is on the underpowered side, and b) My parents' neighbor has one with a cherry bomb (as if it needs one) and uses it for driving to his school.  Scary.<br>
The drag record for speed is either 318 or 324, because when I went to the track, some guy got within 6 mph (do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tell me that is trivial) of the record.<br>
I was joking about a civic only doing 71 mph.  They get up around 110-120 stock.<br>
Merlin 632 in a Pinto... that would be the ultimate shock car, bring in some car that looks like ass and sweep everyone.  Until someone rears ends you above 35 mph and you go ka-boom.  Put it in an AMC Gremlin, romove the back seats and put it there.  Yuck.  But it would be funny.<br>
I will not go for polished aluminum, mainly because if the body gets dented, the whole thing has to be replaced.  For 1/4 of the price, I can get a carbon fiber body, which looks sweetand is a lot lighter.  It isn't exactly street legal, but the cops will never know.  I'm not gutsy enough to move up to 12 pound carbon fiber doors though.  Too weak for any collision.<br>
If I get nitro, I am going to be damn sure to get it professionally tuned and installed.  A blown engine is the last thing I need, especially when I can just pay 500 more so I don't need to worry too much about that.  Still, the Jackson supercharger is pretty damn nice, and coupled with cold air induction, it would be well worth the investment.<br>
Get this, for a good laugh if this guy fails and shock and amazement if it works: Saw in a magazine that some guy is trying to create a freon cooled engine.  That would be cool, but there are way too many things that could go wrong.  Fridge engine.<br>
Here is proof that a Kia is absolute crap:  At high school once, a friend of mine stupidly left his lights on, draining the battery.  He goes to a guy with a Kia to jump it.  The Kia has such a small battery that it can't even jump a Subaru Outback.  Ouch.  Also, if you realistically look at it, the Kia warrenty is only for 100,000 miles or five years for the average driver.  Even so, the depreciation of the thing is so high that it almost would be better to sell it as scrap metal.  I would rather take a slightly more expensive car that I can sell for a higher percentage of the original value after 5 years.<br>

I haven't checked the records in a while...I figured it'd be around there...and I know that's nothing trivial anything in the low 3 second range is incredible...to break 3 seconds is crazy...<br>
When I had my van up to 100 on the highway I broke the belts in my one tire (Yes the steel belts on the inside)...I'm guessing they weren't rated for that...it was old anyway...that was very bad...It added an hour to my trip because I couldn't go over 50 with them after that<br>
I actually considered how much work it would be to turn my van into a mid engine car...because there is a ton of room back there...I could put a few engines back there...I don't have that much money though...that'd be a lot of fun...I also wanted to make it a convertible...<br>
it's a good idea to stay away from those light doors...the doors are the weakest part of a car...(race cars have itty bitty doors)...I'd get a roll cage first before you start doing things that may weaken the structure...then again...they don't actually support anything...I'm sure there's doors with plenty of safety built in...<br>
and if you're getting a street car...go for turbo's...they're more versatile and make more horsepower...and you can have a boost controller in your car... so you can run low grade gas if you want...with a super charger you have to actually change cams...it's a pain...<br>
the outback probably needs more amps to start than the kia....<br>
and kia's don't sell for anything because the cost a little more than a good used car when you first buy them...they depreciate like any normal car...cars don't appreciate...except classics...<br>

With parents paying for college room and board, giving me the occasional sum of cash, and my job, I am able to accrue enoguh money to buy what I want over a moderately slow amount of time.  I had a tech job and 25k in the company's stock, I sold it on the downturn and it only yielded about 32k.  That money is in a bank account that I am keeping static for now.<br>
Yeah, changing the cams on the engine will be a pain, but that is just an excuse to get it bored and stroked if possible, or just stroked.  Which would be nice.  I understand what you are saying about turbos though, although I have had bad experiences with them.  I was in an S3 with a friend, and it had the stock turbo, we are doing wbout ninety, and suddenly smoke starts pouring out from under the hood.  We open up the hood expecting it to be the radiator, but no, at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ninety</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> miles per hour, we overloaded the turbo and the thing turned red hot and essentially reverted to a lump of metal and carbon.  It was under warrenty, and the dealer even put in a bigger turbo, but still.  They still produce a good deal of power.  When I was in high school, my mom had an SLK 230.  Damn fun car.  The first time I got to drive it alone, I took it out to a long straightaway and got it up to 155 before the computer response kicked in and pulled it back down to 140 or something.  That was pretty damn fast.  You could feel the turbo kick in, not just hear it.<br>
If I ever get turbo, I am going balls out and getting twin T-66s.  Or I will save myself a few and get T-4s.  Which would be nice.  T-66s though, Mmmm.  That would cost a pretty penny though, and here I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> am</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dreaming.<br>
That would be damn cool to have a mid engined van, but synchronizing multiple engines would be a pain in the ass.  I saw the coolest van though, it had pneumatic airshocks so that when you park the thing and turn it off, the shocks deflate, lowering it to the ground.  The doors were opened by the remote and it had no handles.  In the back was a waterbed.  It was pretty cool and I wouldn't mind owning that thing. <br>

turbo's spin at high speeds and get exposed to hot temperatures (Unlike superchargers)...having one melt down is pretty common...it could be worse...they also have the tendancy to fly apart...<br>
I wouldn't spring for the biggest turbo's you can get...the best setup is to get 4 medium to small turbo's...they have lighter turbines and spool up a lot faster..and with 4 you'd have more than enough boost...maybe 2 small and 2 large<br>
and getting 2 engines in sync wouldn't be that hard...theoretically you just use a differential...I should check some super modified tractor sites to see how they do it...<br>

I have heard of cycling the turbos so that you go small, medium, large, then REALLY large.  So the small kicks in first, then the medium warms up while the small is boosting and then it kicks in, and so on for the large and monster turbos.  Just would have to get an engine that can handle that many PSIs...<br>
The thing about getting tandem engines is that if they ever get out of synch, then you are screwed.  I had a go-kart with two engines when I was little, and one day they got out of sync and tore the axle in half.  Those were itty bitty 8 horsepower engines and then there was the problem that the engine internals had been bent from the torsional forces, the engines were goners and my go-kart was no more, and just think about what a full size engine would do...<br>

the other one was obscure enough to be believable<br>
with your go cart did you do the usual go cart thing...1 solid axle and a big sproket on it with a chain drive between it and the engine...with two engines it'd be a terrible idea...if you had a differential though...<br>
I'm not certain but if you tweaked a transfer case from a 4wd...you could get it to accept two inputs and make one output...theoretically it would work...<br>
<br>
when I was in japan there was this little ugly shoebox car...it was fairly plain other than a huge ralli-art decal that covered the whole side of it :-)<br>
but the best thing was this car had to be running some crazy boost...because we were in a line and he was in a line beside us...he'd let the cars get a little ahead then he'd hit the gas and you could hear the turbo's wind up...and every time he let off you'd here that Pshhht sound...it was hillarious...because it was such a small crappy car... <p><pre>

Yeah, I have seen some absolutely amazing turbo systems.  I saw a Subaru justy that had been heavily modified so that the engine was behind the driver, and it had tri turbo and a supercharger.  You couldn't classify it as a car so much as a rocket.  The thing was fast.  The owner said that it had over 1400 horsepower.  Damn, a car that gets propelled at 60+ miles per hour on a 3 cylinder engine with over 1400.  He had custom everything in the car.  Get this, there was a 1470 supercharger coming out of the roof.  Some people are completely insane.<br>
I came across a Ralli Art team jacket and bought it.  It is awsome, and it is perfect for driving around in my car once it is race worthy.  Except that I should get a Galant if I am going to be sporting Ralli Art.  Get some Ralli Art decals, drive up in a Ralli Art Team Jacket and scare everyone else sh!tless.<br>

And the guy saying it has 1400 hp is a little unrealistic....for a three cylinder car...I don't car how much boost the rpm's neccesary wouldn't really be practical...even in a boxer engine...and I've never really understood hooking a suppercharger up with turbos...I guess if they all went to one main manifold (sucks to the designer of it)...but some idiots run a supercharger hooking turbos to the intake...that seems so useless...maybe it works...ot maybe the guy who put it in was dumb...<br>
and even with all that team gear there would always be one stupid hotshot that would have to try...If you're going to have a fast looking car...you'd better be damn sure it actually is fast...<br>
you're always better off to get an unassuming minivan with no visible mods...rusty caravans with faux wood paneling are more than perfect for that...they are the worlds best sleepers...sure they are slow...and they are embarassing to be seen in...but I'd rather be in the ugly caravan that downed a viper than the viper that got owned by an ugly sleeper caravan... <p><pre>

The stock engine would pop if put to that strain.  I think he had a V8 in there, it was a monster.  Yeah, the turbo and supercharger combo was a bit dicey, but it just looked mean.  Damn.<br>
Yeah, if I was sporting team gear, I would make damn sure that I had the fastest car in a twenty mile radius.  And then kick that little punk around.<br>
Yeah, the idea of the crappy car with no mods kind of gets back to my idea of getting a funnycar chassis and engine and running with that.  Nobody would suspect a thing.<br>
Futura <p>2000, Detroit:  A woman stopped at a light noticed that the car in front of her had a "honk if you love Jesus" bumper sticker on it, she proceeded to honk her horn with gusto.  The man in front of her got out and proceeded to in turn bash the windshield and hood of her car to smithereens.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ujefm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jefm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/01 1:14:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=662.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: R</span><hr size=1> Have you ever seen the munsters...<br>
they had some cool cars...like the dragula...and another one that had a stack of supercharger bolted end to end...it looked cool...I doubt it made much horsepower difference though <p><pre>
