&quot;Just one more thing... name's Deuce.&quot;<br>

He looked at her quizzically. She grinned and replied, &quot;Liz.&quot;<br>
<br>
He tucked his chin to his chest as they headed back through the doorway to join the others.<br>
<br>
He squinted into the dark room, and found the hippie leaning against the far wall, his hand unconsciously guarding the radio. The two newcomers were huddled up, whispering... or arguing, Deuce couldn't tell. They looked like hell.<br>
<br>
They all stood staring at him and Liz. The tension grew thick.<br>

Been looking for... supplies, and stuff - thought we could find something here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross nodded. &quot;Just call me Ross. The bridge broke down about ten, fifteen miles from here.&quot; He sneezed violently. &quot;Had a load of fun walking through the storm, let me tell ya.&quot; He took a tissue from his field pack and blew his nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, Vick and I were trying to find a woman named Elizabeth Warchol... was a witness to a criminal investigation. Unfortunately, we don't have a picture...&quot; He sneezed again. &quot;Anyway, any help you could give us would be, you know, helpful.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man looked a little surprised. &quot;Um, sorry, I'm not a resident of the area.&quot; His eyes darted from side to side. &quot;There are aliens coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, shucks, that's all right...&quot; Ross did a double take. &quot;What did you just say?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Dr. Meier could respond, Vick stomped back into the room with a sour look on his face. &quot;This's the worst coffee I've ever had in my life.&quot; He paused and proceeded to drink the whole cup. He sighed contentedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um... isn't that hot?&quot; Dr. Meier said cautiously.<br>
<br>
Vick clutched his throat all of a sudden and began to make strange noises.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm guessing yes.&quot; Ross said, amused. Vick gave him a dirty look.<br>
<br>
Just then, three more people entered the room. Vick, Ross, and Dr. Meier stared.<br>
<br>
A scruffy-looking man stepped up and announced, &quot;Hello, gentlemen. I am the alien prince, and I've come for your women!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Another nut job...&quot; Ross muttered. Vick blinked. All he saw was a man with a concealed weapon, who had been on their hunting list for years. Rogue agent - his partner must not have noticed. Fat ignorant newbie. <br>
<br>
Vick mulled over that as the others introduced themselves. Fortunately, the gun-toting one... what did he say his name was? Dune, or Droosh, or something. Anyway, he probably didn't know they were Feds. They certainly didn't look like your typical G-men at the moment. He vaguely noticed his partner introducing himself. &quot;Yeah, I'm Ross Powell, and this is Vick. We're with...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;..CorTechs Communications.&quot; Vick interrupted quickly, smiling, willing Dr. Meier and Ross not to say a @#%$ word. &quot;One of our clients lives out in the area, and we were hoping to persuade him to subscribe to our unlimited monthly plan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ross appeared clueless and confused. Good. Dr. Meier was staring at all the new people in the room. So much the better. This investigation had taken a whole new turn.<br>
<br>
Vick eyed the gun-toting one warily. He was friendly. A bit too friendly. A chill went up his spine as he looked at Vick.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a quiet one.&quot; He smirked again. &quot;I'm Deuce... with the FBI.&quot; He flashed an FBI ID, and smirked once more. Vick barely noticed the smirk - he was in adrenaline mode.<br>
<br>
Did the rogue still have an ID? Oh, crap. Oh, CRAP.<br>
<br>

A loud rumble passed over the police station and the ground began to tremble beneath the inhabitants' feet. From outside the group could hear the sound of some machine and an old light penetrated the dimness of the building.

He lanced into the hall and grabbed the doctor's arm. Pulling him back against the wall, Deuce snatched his Browning.<br>
<br>
On the doctor's protest, Deuce grumbled, &quot;You lunatic. You don't know what's out there, yet!&quot;<br>
<br>
The salesmen flooded into the hallway behind Deuce. He looked back to make sure they wouldn't get in the way. <br>
<br>
Not in the way... they were just fine... with their pieces out, grabbing wall in standard two by two cover formation.<br>
<br>
Deuce fought back a smirk. Cops or feds. Jesus kissing Mary!<br>
<br>
He gave them a nod, and they crossed the hall in spurts. Deuce took his leg, and rushed the corner of the hall. He didn't have to play by the rules.<br>
<br>
The windows to the front of the police station were lit with fluttering light. Deuce squinted through the dark room. The misting rain outside was aglow with bright light... kind of like a spotlight pointed straight at the window.<br>

<br>
Liz couldn't belive what she saw in front of her. In front of the police building sat a large round ship. From the ship human-like creatures had started to emerge. For a moment she had just standed there staring blankly at the sight in front of her. She had no clue what had made her move outside,in fact,she didn't even remeber the trip from within the building to this point. A moment after though she had regained control of her sense and had ducked behind the cornor of the building. The light the ship was giving off was cold and unatural. Liz squinted,trying to make out the figures,but all she could see was the shadowy image of some creature. She could hear some strange noise in the back of her head. It sounded familer to the noises she had heard befor,but the latter has been of a buzzing quiality and this noise seemed more talking sound. It reminded her of that incoharent mumbling one hears when listning to someone far away.Liz looked around for some sort of escape path. Unable to find one,she made herself as small as possible and hugged the wall. <br>

<br>
He didn't seem to hear. All he did was jam the device into his rucksack and bolted back down the hallway. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce kept his position, and let him retreat. The man very well may be certifiable.<br>
<br>
And the Mod Squad were still staring at Deuce.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;Fight or flight. Flip a coin?&quot;<br>
<br>
The fat one looked on after the doctor, then scrambled along his knees back down the hallway. His partner called out, &quot;Vick!&quot;, then shrugged.<br>
<br>
Deuce leveled a keen stare. &quot;Go.&quot;<br>
<br>
He got to his feet, but stayed low, keeping his gun forward by his chin. He definitely had training, but he wasn't military... nor was he used to drawing on someone. But Deuce gave him credit... he was keeping cool, even if his gun seemed uncomfortable in his hand.<br>
<br>
As he disappeared past the corner of the hallway, Deuce got to his feet. He stole one more peek at the front doors. <br>
<br>
He froze as a silhouette squared off directly in front of the doors. There was too much light pouring past it through the glass to make out details. It was human-like. Perhaps a bit more willowy. It was tall, and bald... with a child's proportions.<br>
<br>
Deuce was transfixed. He inched out away from his cover, and stood in the middle of the hallway, just staring. It seemed to be staring back.<br>
<br>
Deuce's mind was halted. He felt like everything was slow-motion. It was... euphoric.<br>
<br>
It lifted a hand. Long, spidery fingers extended seemed to wave hello. Deuce felt a compulsion to return the gesture, but something began to eat away at his stomach. He could sense something... wrong. Electricity stabbed up at his feet. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up.<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head, and dove sideways into the wall as a clap of energy barrelled past his head. His ears were ringing. He kept moving when he hit the floor, and scrambled through a swing gate into a reception desk.<br>
<br>
Alien crapsucker had a weapon!<br>
<br>
His hands trembling with anger, Deuce checked his chamber. Ok, this was war!<br>
<br>
Steadying his feet against the cabinet, he shoved himself upright, and trained his Browning through a glowing hole in the door glass.<br>
<br>
One shot.<br>
<br>
The silhouette fell backwards slowly, almost wilting.<br>
<br>
The hairs on his neck stood up again.<br>
<br>
Swearing sharply, he dove back into the hallway as the reception desk erupted in a tooth rattling fury. Deuce found his feet again, and sprinted down the lineoleum, his gun at arm's length ahead of him. A shadow stepped out from a doorway. <br>
<br>
One of them.<br>
<br>
One more shot.<br>
<br>
He didn't pause to check his mark. <br>
<br>
The suspended ceiling above him blistered, and a bolt of energy pounded down through the floor, missing him by two feet. The heat of the blast soaked through his shoes, and he wondered if he was going deaf.<br>
<br>
As he rounded the last corner of the hallway, he saw the back door, still open.<br>
<br>
And two more aliens.<br>
<br>
He only had time to squeeze of two more shots before he had to duck back. He was pretty sure he missed on both shots. He was getting disoriented.<br>
<br>
Another energy blast perforated the wall beside him.<br>
<br>
Releasing a string of profanities, Deuce tucked and rolled into the open, hosing down the aliens with the last of his clip.<br>
One of them dropped, but the second remained.<br>
<br>
It lifted it hand. Its palm began to glow yellow.<br>
<br>
Electricity lanced across the floor, over Deuce's legs. His nerves were lit up.<br>
<br>
&quot;No. Not now. Not by you!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uzendragonknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZenDragonKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/11/01 11:51:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> ((sorry if this REALLY sucks, I just skimmed through this, looking for the drift of the plot))<br>

They were getting to close. WAY to close. She had to think of a way to get out of here,but she couldn't just run. They would almost certainly catch her. The hsip had landed in front of the police station, possibly the back was still unoccupied? <br>
Befor Liz had time to think about what she was doing,she had darted down the side of the building, trying her best to blend in with the shadow the light created. With every step it seemed as if her heart beat faster and her breath became more and more shallow. She had to get away quickly. There wasn't much time left,sooner or later these alien creatures would come searching for life. If they found her...Liz shuddered. That wasn't something to be thinking about at the moment.  She sped around the corner of the building only to see one of the creatures fall the the ground. There was another one,raising its hand towards the back door,an strange yellow light glowing from the creatures hand...   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/14/01 7:06:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 1</span><hr size=1> Winlabik jumped out from the shadows and grabbed Liz, making sure to cover her mouth to keep her from screaming.<br>

His ears began to ring, and his head pounded.<br>
<br>
The beast was ready to let it fly.<br>
<br>
Deuce's head went light. Time felt like it was slowing down. His body got light. Light tunneled around his face. He released a drunken snicker.<br>
<br>
So this was death?<br>
<br>
The light dimmed, and he felt space beneath his back. Then the floor.<br>
<br>
His breath pushed out of his mouth with a grunt, and he looked up at the creature.<br>
<br>
Through the noise and confusion, he heard Liz's voice... &quot;What are those things?&quot;<br>
<br>
The creature's head was turned to the back door. It twisted on a high axis in its trunk, and its long, jaundiced arm swiveled.<br>
<br>
Deuce's hand went to his side instinctively. Empty holster.<br>
<br>
He jammed his feet into the floor and tried to push himself back around the corner. The water on the linoleum squeaked loudly, and he didn't get far.<br>
<br>
The creature swiveled back around to face Deuce with an empty, expressionless face.<br>
<br>
It lifted it hand again.<br>
<br>
A dull shot barked from behind Deuce.<br>
<br>
The creature slumped to its knees, black fluid oozing from an entry wound in its head.<br>
<br>
Deuce stretched his neck up.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll give them one thing... they're easy to kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce let out a breath and chuckled. &quot;Nice shot for a salesman.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know I'm no salesman. Come on, let's get out of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
He held out a hand, but Deuce pushed up against his knees and steadied himself. &quot;I heard Liz out there.&quot;<br>
<br>
He bolted for the door, peered out into the rain... and paused.<br>
<br>
Deuce glanced back at the alien corpse. He knelt down and turned up its hand. Dead center of the palm was a clear red device... some kind of glass or gem.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce spat over his shoulder, &quot;Hold it!&quot;<br>
<br>
He fished in his pocket for his pocketknife, triggered the small blade, and dug at the rim of the red glass.  Black ooze spread from the lifting edge, and Deuce gave it a tug.  Long conduits pulled from the forearm of the creature, about two feet.<br>
<br>
When Deuce cleared it, he held it out in the rain to get the black blood off. <br>
<br>
&quot;You done?&quot;<br>
<br>
He bundled the conduit and stuffed the mechanism into his coat pocket.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's find Liz.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessageRange?topicID=249.topic&start=81&stop=92>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=249.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=249.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=249.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
