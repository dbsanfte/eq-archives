&quot;It is always a pleasure to be in the presence of such creatures of high esteem. Throughout my young life I have heard many tales concerning elves and are greatly in awe of them,&quot; She turned to the other travelers.<br>
&quot;Now, for the introductions. This man you see in the silver armor,&quot;She motioned to Timothy,&quot;goes by the name of Timothy,an ex-gladiator. The fellow standing beside him,&quot;she pointed to Cryrid,&quot; is know as Cryrid, and has the best aim with a knife I have seen, though is a bit quick to throw. Next to him is Cameron, though silent is quite a fighter. The elf you see goes by the name of Elil, and is exelent at catching thieves. The man you see carriying the pole-arm is Van Eyck, and might I say, he can wield his weapon with ease,&quot; She turned back to the trio of elves.<br>
&quot;I am Caprice Maltempo, mistress of illusions-&quot;<br>
Anlore's father waved his hand, stopping Caprice in mid-sentence.&quot;Please, if you will. Tell us the details of you adventure so far. Though we know of the quest, the smaller items have escaped our knowledge,&quot; Caprice nodded and began to relate the tail with help from others.<br>
&quot;Now, you seem rather worried about the king's son getting the throne. He may be mean and all, but he's just a normal being,right?&quot;Caprice asked.<br>
Anlore's father thought for a moment. &quot;Well....&quot;he began. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uakumatavlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akuma Tavlore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/19/01 2:02:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Council</span><hr size=1> &quot;I would like to say that the relationship between Men and Elves is very Important, and the Current king has maintained this relationship&quot; Galad, Anlore's father exclaimed,&quot; With the premmison from the king I have placed spies in the Castle of King Winablik, and have learned of his sons intentions to destroy the elves which is of  course immposible, But will disrupt the worlds balance, which could give rise to the Great Shadow.....    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unitetimehero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nitetimehero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/19/01 6:50:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.org/nitetimehero/pic.jpg height=73 width=106></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Council</span><hr size=1> &quot;There is a dark sorcerer which rules a kingdom to the north.

<br>
&quot;Now I understand why the orcs of your woods are acting so strange.

&quot;I agree with Elil. Though not a fighter myself, I do know how such creatures act. When they can, orcs will attack in the night, almost never in the day unless urged on, and it is quite unusual for them to attack mounted travelers. I must ask you though, this dark sorcerer, does he keep himself covered most if not all times?&quot;<br>
They nodded, and Caprice's face fell.<br>
&quot;It is as I feared! We shall not live through this!&quot; She held onto the back of chair to steady herself.<br>
&quot;This sorcerer is known as Validus by wizards and the like. He is feared by all who know his name and has killed many. It seems we would need help from heaven to be able to survive,&quot; Caprice took a few deep breathes then stood up straight.<br>

&quot;Yes, I have traveled north, and I beleive I heard about this, Validus, though never called by his name.  The people in the taverns and in the alleys they speak of him as they might death himself.  I didn't stay long, for I was on a mission, but I do know he is mortal.&quot;<br>

<br>
Monsters of terror and shadows creep like wraiths shrilling about and creating confusion.  In their wake where their feet stepped the ground turns and the life dies.  Leading the horde floats a thin figure dressed in a long dark green cloak.<br>
<br>
The man is young, no more then twenty years of age.  His blonde hair is kept with it being combed back, save, for his bains that hang in front of his forehead.  He has a small goatee that emphasizes the contours of his chin.  A thick black belt rests on his hips contrasting against his robe.  Be all appearances this man does not belong here.<br>
<br>
“Open your doors Elves!”<br>
<br>
The man waits but a few seconds.<br>
<br>
“Ha!  Have it your way!”<br>
<br>
From the raised hands comes a soft glow.  The contours of the young mans hands light up and the air is pierced with the sound of shrills.  Then, with a ground-shaking boom, that much like of thunder, the Elven city fades into view.  As the city comes into sights the hordes with gleaming eyes flaring like fire spill down.<br>
<br>
The man floats down into the chaos, fire quickly filling the air, the smell of burning flesh lingers across the nose.  In minutes the city has fallen.  However, one building stands.  Bright white and stalwart the shadows ravaging the city seem to being ignoring this structure.<br>
<br>
The man descends to the bridge below him that leads to the defiant structure.  He comes to a rest to where just his toes barely skim the ground.  He glides to the door and places his right hand on it.<br>
<br>
“Come out!”<br>
<br>
Then promptly the door caves in.  The man floats in and before him a crowd of cowering elves and around them a ring of guards.  As the man approaches the King of the Elves speaks.<br>
<br>
“Sonto . . . Validus’s brightness pupil.  You are truly your mentor’s prodigy.  Why do you come and disturb my city?”<br>
<br>
In a flash Sonto glides through the crowd of the last of the city.  In his wake a distorted wave of air passes over the crowd.  As the wave washes over the crowd they are torn apart.  As Sonto sets down to ground to meet the King on equal grounds the bodies fall in pieces.  Sonto stands looking up to the King, the elf is much taller then him.  Oddly, Sonto’s breaths are labored and sweat trickles down his brows.<br>
<br>
Gallad speaks holding back tears; “You over exert yourself in this senseless act.  I knew you when you were young, you could break free any time you want.”<br>
<br>
Sonto reacts violently grabbing a hold of Gallad’s neck and rising into the air bringing Galad with him by the neck.<br>
<br>
“Shut up!  Tell me where they are!”<br>
<br>
Through a tight throat, “Whom do you speak of?”<br>
<br>
“I am giving you one chance to save your own life.  Tell me where they are.  I know they were here.”<br>
<br>
“You know I can’t tell you that.  Tell Validus for me that he needs to learn how to control his anger.”<br>
<br>
Sonto floats in the air with Gallad beneath him dangling by the neck.  His hands tighten, though his fingers shake.  With a tear rolling down his cheek Gallad’s neck snaps.<br>
<br>
“You should have told me.”<br>
<br>
Sonto drops the body of the king and promptly exits the room with haste.  A large orc who is dressed in dark serrated armor comes to greet Sonto.<br>
<br>
“Agaolite take your men and go through the valley, kill any humans and elves you see along the way.  Order the wraiths to go through the river pass and remove it of any human and elf life.  I’ll go forward alone.” <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugrandxduke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GrandxDuke</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/3/02 1:34:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/1/02 11:35:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flight</span><hr size=1> As the company rode onwards without delay, Caprice's horse reared up and flung her to the ground.

Caprice stood up, dusting off the dirt and took her horse by the bridal.<br>

His black charred shroud masked and warped his already immense stature, furthering his intimidating figure.  All that could be seen was the one good eye, crimson in color, left to him by his father.

<br>
“Your vocabulary is improving.”<br>
<br>
Sonto looks about for a few seconds as he takes in the land.  There are caves up ahead and further from there are dwarvern catacombs.  Then something catches Sonto’s sense, something magical, that gleams with an explosive radiance.  Most likely a trap –<br>
<br>
“Go through the forest and don’t look back.  They are up ahead and you will have to hurry if you want to catch them and become Validus’s most prized.”<br>
<br>
Turning and charging Agaolite does not take a second to think about the proposed prospect.  Becoming Validus’s most liked is an urge that it cannot refuse.  Sonto falls back down to the ground a few inches before his toes touch.  He then zooms to the east and begins making a huge circle at great speed around where he sent Agaolite.<br>
<br>
“Dumb orc won’t survive this one.  If he does make it through the traps he can kill who ever set those.  The caves are where they are.  Validus over stated their potential, a little obvious of them.”<br>

&quot;I supose we'll soon find out how far we can trust Elil&quot; said Caprice, walking up behind him.  <br>

Suddenly an explosion could be heard somewhere to the north.  The energy from the blast flowed through the woods.  There was an enmistakeable elven air it.<br>

<br>
Those traps were for real, but no matter.  As long as Agaolite had men to dispose of, this would be a minor detour.<br>
<br>
With a defining roar of might from Agaolite all the orc that were about, sixty in all <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (you must understand sixty orc's is a very big number when it comes to matters related to orc's)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> took to their fastest of feet and leapt forward.<br>
<br>
Agaolite stood proud and not the least effected as one by one his orc comrades fell to sounders.  Yes, this truly was a skilled opponent, Agaolite knew he'd find himself having the pleasure of devouring this morsel of an opponent soon.<br>
<br>
Now taking a slow march Agaolite kept his eye at the best of a scan it could muster.  Who ever had wiped out his entire army could not be far away.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (As a note: amongst orc kind it does no matter the circumstances (such as ordering all orc dead) who ever actually did the killing was required to pay for the act)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
An odd clearing began to show itself.  Agaolite froze when he came to this strange marvel, up to this point the entire forest had been thick and rich with growth.  For it to drop like this did not make sense.  There was a point, there was a point, there had to be.<br>
<br>
Now pondering, Agaolite looked about with his one good eye.  As good as the eye could it saw nothing of vague importance.  Of course though, not all dangers can be seen with a eye.  There was more a foot here.<br>
<br>
Being a Orc of action, Agaolite entered the clearing step by step, listening, waiting, stepping again then waiting again.  Agaolite kept with the careful approach until the center of the clearing came to rest under his feet.  The bristles of hair on the nape of the back side of his head stood as straight as lumber.<br>
<br>
He felt this before... something approaching... trying to out wit him. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (Much like his father did when he took his right eye)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Reaching for his zambato Agaolite looked about, the feeling of a sneaking presence started it's approach now... now... now at his back, whirling about... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/8/02 3:21:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> The company entered the caves, leading their horses behind them. The farther they went, the darker it became. Luckily though, they were able to rig up a torch easily providing them with enough light to see a few feet ahead. <br>
<br>
The group continued easily through the caves without trouble, all except Caprice who walked at the end of the line, her horse's reins gripped tightly in one hand, the other pulling the brim of her hat down below her eyes.<br>
<br>
They reached a small tunnel and stopped for their were two diffrent passages, one heading downwards, the other sloping up. Two members of the party were sent off to explore the passages while the remaining party rested. Caprice plopped on the floor trembling, clutching the brim of her hat.<br>
<br>
Cryrid shot her a dark look. &quot;Whats wrong with you now?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm..&quot; she let out a little whimper,&quot;I'm claustriphobic!&quot;<br>
Cryrid let out a loud laugh.<br>
&quot;What do you find so funny?&quot;Caprice asked, pulling the birm of hat up enough to reveal one eye. She stared at him coldly, waiting for an answer.<br>
&quot;Someone as tiny as you has no reason to be afraid of small spaces!&quot;<br>
Caprice pouted.<br>
&quot;In, fact, I suppose a small sapling would be like a great oak to you,&quot;<br>
The two began to argue, the others jumping in trying to stop them.<br>
They stopped in mid-argument. A low rumbling had started up, and now grew even louder. Small stones and dust began to fall from the ceiling. The rumbling grew into an earsplitting roar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukaminosenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kami no Senshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/8/02 4:31:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> &quot;Quickly!

Agaolite stood almost directly below him.  He had been found out, and know if he didn't kill the orc, he would die.<br>
<br>
Elil sprung off the branch, drawing his longsword in the same movement.  Before the orc saw him the sword was buried into his right shoulder.  Searing pain shot through his body.  He ignored it and swung his body around, bringing up his fist.  <br>
<br>
It pounded into Elils head, sending him flying into a nearbye tree.  Dazed he tryed to get up, but the ork was already apon him.<br>

<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HA, HA, HA!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Funny little elf, you scratch me,&quot; his voice sounded as if made of charcoal and broken glass.  Everything about this monster was a horrible nightmare.<br>
<br>
Elil did all he could to stand but he'd been struck straight on left temple.  Blood seeped from his wound, no elven body was meant to take a beating like this from a creature like Agaolite.<br>
<br>
Clasping the buckle of his shroud above his left breast, Agaolite unfastened the buckle and drew his shroud off.  Holding it for a moment he murmured another soul draining laugh.<br>
<br>
Having tossed his shroud away, Agaolite drew his posture up into a fighter stance, &quot;Little elf think that his knife scratch will stop me?! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HA, HA, HA,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> meat tastes better once it's been beat to death.
