Unfortunately there was a reason this paint was being thrown away. (Panel shows Bob holding up a paintball with a huge dimple in it saying: &quot;I don't know why they throw these paintballs away just because of a dimple!&quot;)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Soon trouble struck when, right before Team Bean's first tournament at Toledo, Freddy had to have surgery done on his nostril after a bean got shoved permanently up his nose when he tripped, so in desperation, Bob enrolled his then eight-year-old son onto the team.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Luckily Billy turned out to be a natural and scored the day's only elimination for Team Bean when, in desperation, he took a paintball out of his hopper and threw it at the other guy. (The stuff was breaking in the barrel all the time.)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As an added bonus, the field also had a Paintball Eating contest, they entered Little Billy, who, being eight, won easily.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After that, Billy always played on Team Bean,  two year's passed . . .<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was this year that the Black Ryders (Every member of the Black Ryders looks like an evil guy wearing complete black and evil-looking elaborate masks) convinced Billy to join their team (for Billy was now one of the best players there was) and entered their first tournament with him, convinced they would win . . .<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In that same tournament another well-known team entered under the leadership of the one known as &quot;Sit &amp; Be Hit Ski!&quot; Team Short but Slow.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ski witnessed Billy single-handedly wipe his entire team out and win the tournament.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ski knew a good player when he saw one, so he talked with Billy and offered him much more than the Black Ryder's ever could, Billy, of course, accepted and joined Short but Slow. That is where we join them now . . .<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Billy: &quot;I can't wait too tell my mom &amp; dad about this! Ski: We'll drive home togethor and tell them! (Wordbox): Unfortunately, not joy, but tears is what they found when they arrived. The Bean factory had blown up with both of Billy's parents in it, leaving him an orphan.&quot; Ski: (To a police officer) &quot;What caused the explosion?&quot; Policeman: &quot;We don't know yet, but terrorism hasn't been ruled out.&quot;<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Wordbox): &quot;Six hours ago. . .&quot; Bob's boss (His boss looks like your typical vacuam salesman.): Congratulations on your promotion, Bob! Bob: &quot;Thank's! Bob's Boss: &quot;Let's celebrate with one of my Cubans!&quot; (He holds up a Cigar and lighter.) Bob: &quot;That sounds great!&quot; Janitor: (who's been moping there the entire time) &quot;Don't light that here, you fools! We're in a BEAN FACTORY!!!&quot; (&quot;Click!&quot;) (BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Wordbox): &quot;Having no living relatives, Ski decided to become Billy's legal guardian. (Ski's looking at Billy's birth cirtefacet and quotes from it: &quot;Billy Bob Fourton.&quot;) They got to Ski's home in Minnesota without incident save a setback at the airport.&quot; Airport security checkpoint guy (Who's pretty fat has a donut sticking out of his upper pocket and a bottle of alchohol sticking out of his pants pocket): (holding a gun on Ski and the gang, who are on the ground with there hands behind their heads, and talking into a walkie-talkie) &quot;You danged terrorists are getting cocky! Strolling in here with weapons in your bags and masks on, your lucky I don't shoot you right here!&quot; Ski: &quot;But sir, there paintball markers!&quot; Security guy: &quot;You shut your mouth before I put my foot in it!&quot;<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Wordbox): &quot;But they arrived safely and Billy was able to practice his paintball skills with them, but he had questions!&quot; Billy: &quot;Ski, how did you get so rich to afford this place and never have to work?&quot; Ski: &quot;Well, Billy, My dad was a member of the Minnesota Mafia, which really wasn't that big, which meant no competition, so he started selling &quot;protection&quot; money to various restaurants. One guy wouldn't pay so dad convinced him to leave town, selling the building to him for a very good price.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So dad reopened the place as an Italian restaurant and called it &quot;Olive Garden,&quot; he made so much off of it that he soon had Olive Garden restaurants everywhere in the US.&quot; Billy: So the Olive Garden's are Mafia? Ski: Why else would we have a slogan like &quot;When you're here, you're family.&quot; Billy:  Yeah, so what happened to your dad and mom? Ski: My mom died giving birth too me and my dad died of clogged arteries. Billy: &quot;Clogged Arteries?&quot; Ski: Do you know how fattening Italian food is? Billy: So what do we do now? Ski: We wait untill another Tourney comes along, untill then we play video games! Billy: Sweet!
