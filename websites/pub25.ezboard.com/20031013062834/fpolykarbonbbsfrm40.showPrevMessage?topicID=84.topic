I've already begun and finished the first chapter, and I have already put it up on Fanfiction.net. Anyways, the thing I'm coming on here for was to get some assistance with it, mainly coming up with names of dragons. If you've played the games before, then you know that the staple of the main character, Ryu, is his ability to transform into different types of dragons. Before I get further into it, let me also get a crit on my storyline. I will give an event line of what will basically happen in the story, and I want to see if it works out all right.<br>
<br>
- In the beginning, the Mother created six children of her own, and was called the Originals, as they were the first of dragons (Ryu and the main villain, Asedo, are Originals). Minor dragons came afterwards (I'm debating if they should be children of the Mother or the Originals).<br>
-A religion is formed, worshipping the Mother and her children, and those who are opposed to the religion, which is the majority of the world, dub it the Dragon Cult.<br>
-A war forms between the nonbelievers and the Dragon Cult, mainly because of the hostility of the dragons, but also of the nonbeliever's secular nature and the belief in no religion and no true God.<br>
-Asedo, one of the Originals, rebels against the Mother and the Cult, fatally wounding the Mother. The Mother creates three items (sword, jewel, mirror) and pins Asedo to church doors with the Dragon Slayer (the sword that is commonly a critical weapon in the game, and also one of the items the Mother created). She releases the jewel and seals away the Originals, who are fighting all over the world in the war between the Cult and the unbelievers. She then seals herself away with the mirror before she was able to die.<br>
-Very many years pass, and Asedo breaks his seal (the Dragon Slayer which did not kill him, but sealed him to the church door) and that awakens the other Originals.<br>
- Ryu's Kaiser core (dragon cores are the essence of the dragon form of the Originals) is sealed away from him (by the jewel created to contain the dragon powers of the Mother's children, which was placed in a wand and handed down through generation to generation of Wyndian royals. Wyndia is a very predominant Kingdom in the world. He met Nina, the princess of Wyndia, who had the wand, and it was then that his Kaiser core was sealed, after he attacked her), meaning that he cannot transform into Kaiser (the ultimate dragon form of Ryu throughout many of the games). He has no memory left however, as he was a berserk Kaiser for so many hundreds of years (it is also usual in the games that Kaiser is uncontrollable until you find a way to make him controllable. Kaiser is Berserk in this story because Ryu is an innocent person, and can't control the awesome power of the Kaiser form).<br>
-Ryu eventually learns his past and who he is by encountering all of the Originals and defeating them as they attack him, (they do this to kill him and steal his Kaiser core, also because the Original's brotherhood was destroyed with Asedo's rebellion, so they are hardly like brother's anymore) and then Ryu absorbs their Dragon Cores (this is how he is able to transform into different dragons).<br>
-Ryu meets the sealed away Mother, who explains everything to him. Ryu then breaks the mirror that she used to seal herself away, and that releases the Mother. The wound she received from Asedo hundreds of years ago viciously sprays out blood, and she unseals the Kaiser core in order to defeat Asedo just before she dies.<br>
-Ryu faces off against Asedo, who steals all of the Dragon Cores from Ryu. He fails to steal the Kaiser core, since he has to kill Ryu in order to. He then transforms into an incomplete Infinity dragon (Asedo's entire intention was to kill his brethren to steal their Dragon Cores, so when he gets them all, he could use them to become the ultimate dragon, Infinity. In the fourth game, Infinity was the ultimate dragon as well, and in the third game, Infinity was the name of the Dragon gene that granted the Kaiser form), and Ryu transforms into a berserk Kaiser. The Kaiser dragon defeats Infinity (because it is incomplete), and Asedo transforms back to his normal human form, deathly wounded. He stabs the Kaiser dragon with the Dragon Slayer, and Ryu transforms back. Asedo dies, and Ryu is teetering between life and death (the ending has not been planned out yet, but I intend for Ryu to recover from the wound and everyone goes their separate ways, Ryu and Nina may get together, I still am considering whether or not to forge a relationship with them).<br>
<br>
So, what do you think of it? Needs more explanation? If you are confused, then ask away and I'll explain things to you, and you can check out the webpage that I made for the fanfiction at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/pkmamoru/BOFCult.html">www.geocities.com/pkmamoru/BOFCult.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> (drag and drop the link into the address bar). Now, the main thing I wanted was for ideas for the Original's dragon forms and their names. Ryu's dragon form's name is Kaiser (German word for Caesar, and German &quot;emperors&quot;), and Asedo's is Apollyon (Greek for &quot;the destroyer&quot;, and believed to be Satan), but I am having difficulty coming up with names for the other Original's dragon forms. They have corresponding elements as well, and they are Fire, Frost, Wind, and Sea. Now, can anyone think of ideas for names of their dragon forms, like famous dragons of mythology, history, or just things that make sense and sound cool. Oh yeah, I guess if you want to check the link out to my fanfiction (chapter I), you can visit the link I gave a while ago and either visit the fanfiction.com site for my fanfic, or the link I have to my fanfic on the site in html format. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 9/28/03 7:14 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showPrevMessage?topicID=116.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showNextMessage?topicID=116.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.emailToFriend?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.threadControl?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40>Story Ideas</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
