“My LOVE!” <br>
- Alzuun spins around to see the person who joined him and Chiffea.<br>
- A wide grin spreads across his face and he instantly rises and kneels down beside Tsvetok.<br>
- He takes her hand and kisses it tenderly, and then gives her another kiss right below her right ear.<br>
- Then his head pans over to look at Chiffea. With his eyes and Tsvetok’s all looking at Chiffea.<br>
“Milady, Chiffea, this is my beloved wife, Tsvetok.”<br>
- He turns his face toward Tsvetok who looks into his eyes too. <br>
“She had an extra day’s journey to get to this tavern than I did. Ye tracked me, didn’t ye my little wood sprite?”<br>
- A corner of Alzuun’s mouth turns upward in a slight sneer.<br>
“It must have been that cologne ye bought me many moons ago… Another round please!”<br>
…<br>
- A time later, Alzuun’s face grows somber.<br>
“I must say a hearty Bravo to thee, Chiffea… To face and kill a giant is much more than I can boast.”<br>
“My tale of travel is much, much more sinister in nature.”<br>
- It appears that his face even settles into a scowl…<br>
“Murder. It was murder that they called it at the eulogy at that villa in the Commonlands. My robes were still crimson from the order in Freeport when I happened upon that funeral scene. I remember looking across the crowd and seeing…”<br>
- Alzuun’s eyes soften.<br>
“Yes, that was the first time I had met Savior. He was a ruddy, black-bearded dwarf with eyes of steel. After the small service, I went to find out the entire story of which he was speaking. He said that some of the shadowy undead had crawled up from their hold in Befallen and killed the young girl who now lay in a small casket. His left cheek twitched with thinly concealed rage. I remembering him asking me to come and avenge her death, and I remember my all-too-quick reply. <br>
When we journeyed there that eve, I was so obnoxiously sure of myself that I honestly thought we would clear out the entire dungeon ourselves. The others were goodly men. All warriors from the nearby lands, and with Savior’s sheer resolve and holy words, our full band set out to right what had been done.”<br>
- Several lines appear across Alzuun’s forehead in pre-set creases as his brow furrows.<br>
“ We did enter the dungeon. We did see the young girl’s cape that had been left near the entrance. And we did…. meet with utter defeat.<br>
One by one, the good men fell before my eyes. My hands were numb and still glowing from the constant attack spells I threw from the mana power that seemed constantly too low…then there was just the two of us. Savior and I. We were alone with the dead enemies and friends at our feet. Savior was bleeding and had a deep paleness in his cheeks (no doubt from the foul creatures’ diseases.) He looked at me and said, ‘I will run to the surface and bring help, lad. Take my symbol, and fear not, I will return.’ <br>
‘Your holy symbol?!’<br>
- I stared down at the image of Brell that had a warmth all to its own and then back up to find Savior already hefting his shield and “opening” the door with this mace.<br>
‘It will tell ye my life force…’<br>
- And with that, he ran, full speed down the hall next door.<br>
- I sat down and began my meditation with his symbol in my hand. Then, as I began to feel the mana power waxing in my veins once more, I felt a coolness in my hand. I looked down at the symbol of Brell and I could feel its warmth begin to ebb away, so I jumped to my feet, grabbed my staff and ran down the hall where Savior had run. I opened another door to find Savior’s back to me and he swinging his mace at a small horde of undead in front of him. I fixed my eyes on the biggest zombie of the bunch and began chanting… Then I noticed the door. The door behind Savior began to close! I frantically began chanting as fast as I could and was recoiled slightly as flame leaped from my fingers and slammed into the beast….followed by the slamming of the door. Almost annoyed, I reached forth to yank the door open and resume my fighting but it did not BUDGE! The doorway framing Savior’s once-fighting form was etched with unholy runes! <br>
‘The door! I shrieked. The door is locked! Savior, quick your key!’<br>
- I stood back, and began running my next spell through my mind to aid my friend with my magic once more when I heard a death scream…..and the holy symbol in my hand turned cold.<br>
‘NO!’ I screamed, ‘I’ll hang ye all by yer rotting necks!’<br>
- But icy realization began to overtake me. I was utterly alone.<br>
*Pound!*<br>
- The door behind me began to give. Then I noticed the magically locked door in front begin to vibrate. (The beasties were beginning their unholy chant to open their door, no doubt.)<br>
*Pound, POUND!*<br>
- T’would not be long until both doors would be opened and I would be faced with all of the monsters alone. I gathered my robes tightly about me and backed against the side wall. I steadied my staff in my left hand and pointed the shaky fingers of my right hand at the door behind me…<br>
‘Ye shall not take Alzuun without feeling my flame…’ I muttered.<br>
- Then it hit me! <br>
‘ My gate!’ I said.<br>
- The magical gate that I had practised only a few times. Did I have it in my memory?! I closed my eyes and the words of the one-way teleportation slowly began to reform in my mind…<br>
‘But the last times that I have practiced it have ended it utter failure!’ I thought despairingly, remembering the shaky, unstable gates that only had left me powerless…<br>
‘I have got to try!’<br>
- I began to whisper the words to the spell…<br>
*Pound**Pound**Pound* - A door hinge broke off and I remember hearing it fly by my head. I saw nothing, however, as I was entranced in the ancient words of gate…<br>
- I raised my voice and began to speak the words faster as the memory of the spell recalled to mind with more clarity.<br>
*Smash!* *Creak* both doors opened and the undead began to pour into the hall and descend upon me.<br>
- I was screaming the last remaining words to my spell over the hoarse moans of the retched deadites when I felt a searing claw on my outstretched arm. I regained my concentration and the last word leapt from my lips and I felt my body being yanked away……………”<br>
- Alzuun sits back in his chair once again and rubs his forearm slightly. (four, long scars marks)<br>
“I re-appeared back in Freeport’s western gate. Without any hesitation at all, I began to plan my return to Befallen. But that….is another story….”<br>
