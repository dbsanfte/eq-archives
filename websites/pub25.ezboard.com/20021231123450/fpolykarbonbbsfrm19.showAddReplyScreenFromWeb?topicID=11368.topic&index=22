I don't know you as a person, and I don't even know you on this board as I have been away for a while.  So, if you decide to take my words to be something that you should take too seriously and get in a huff about, go for it.  Just remember that I am only basing my opinion off what I have seen here.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;For one of only 18 years I find myself becoming disturbingly oppressive in my views.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is not only your first problem, it is also your main one.  You are 18.  You are talking about things that you cannot possibly have a full understanding of.  Personally, I am 22 and a US citizen.  I will be the first to admit; I don't have all of the answers, not even most of them.  But I don't make grandiose claims about knowing what others do and do not know.  Being nearly graduated from a university myself, I can give you one claim though.  I would bet that those who live in your country and are going to universities, are probably just as smart if not smarter than you.  You say that:<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone once told me that when stupid people are misinformed, idiotic hijinx follow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, if you ask me, people that are feeling an opression from their government, whether rightfully so or not, have to stand up against it.  They have to do what they believe in.  To not, now that would be idiotic hijinx.  Luckily for you, believe it or not, you live in a country where the common citizen can stand up for the rest; voice his/her opinion.<br>
<br>
You say that you are against people standing against democracy and in the name of communism:<br>
<br>
&quot;By protestors I am focusing on those preaching against democratic government and trying to return &quot;humanity&quot; to the people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry to tell it to you bud, but Communism isn't what you see in the movies.  Popular media would have you believe that to be Communist and to be Democratic are two opposite things.  Communism is an economic system and Democracy is a political system.  It just happens that most examples of Communism are of countries that have taken the vote away from the people.<br>
<br>
What you are saying goes against your entire dogma here.  You want both Democracy and you want to shut up those who do not agree with you.  Do you NOT see a problem with that thinking?<br>
<br>
&quot;What can I say about uni-students. I can say that when I become one I am going to be thoroughly ashamed of my peers&quot;<br>
<br>
I am sure that if you express your views to them, they will feel the same about you.  Its a good thing that wouldn't happen thought, right?  If you expressed your views to them, against their system of thinking, wouldn't that make you the protestor?<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't at all be sad or disheartened if the government announced a ban on student rallies&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe not to you, but it would to all of the true patriots in your nation that do truely want a Democracy.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't silence those that are offended, no matter how small you think their opinion is, AND have a system where everyone is suppose to get fair treatment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Constitutional rights? If someone is a suspected terrorist their rights should be temporarily forefeit until the investigation is over.&quot;<br>
<br>
First off, how sad for you.  Sad that you would ever think that search and seizure should ever be taken lightly.  Even in the time of global upheaval about public saftey.  ESPECIALLY in this sort of time.  Don't you get it?  Terrorists may kill hundreds of people and commit profound acts of terror agains the general public.  But if you allow a government to turn its policy from democratic to a system that is so clearly NOT democratic, they already win.  Their main purpose is to get stable countries to be less stable; to turn valor against valor.<br>
<br>
When you allow unwarrented search and seizure, you open Pandora's Box.  There is a slippery slope to political and racial witch hunts just waiting for your country, and any country that allows such acts.<br>
<br>
Innocent until proven guilty is the one thing that I have never questioned of my government.  It doesn't work 100% of the time, nothing does.  But it is the only true ethical system in my opinion.  Do you have so little confidence in your counties law enforcers ability to gather the proper amount of data before making a strategic strike on a terrorist cell?<br>
<br>
What is next?  Curfews for all?  Racial confinement camps?  Arrests made purely on profile and race?  Where will you take part in something like that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my problem with flag burning is a big one. People argue that it is just representative of something therefore it has no real effect. Well I believe it to be a personal attack on the nation involved. If I went around wearing a t-shirt that said &quot;I hate black people&quot; I am sure you would be the first ones to beat the @#%$ out of me. Why? Because I am discriminating against a people for no good reason. Well I believe people that burn flags are discriminating against those who belong to that nation. They are declaring a hatred for that nation. What I find hard to believe is that while it is perfectly acceptable to a hate a nation....it is unacceptable to hate a colour, creed or religion. Now, I certaining don't agree with the latter at all...I just think it is pathetic double-standards.&quot;<br>
<br>
I both agree and disagree with you on this.  I agree with some of the meaning behind a flag-burning, but I believe that it should be perfectly legal.  It is representative of something, and by that quality alone it does have a real effect.  There IS a personal attack on a nation.  It is the most that many people can do.  They don't have tanks and numbers of soldiers, or else they would probably make a government and a people understand the way other nations try to get other nations to understand, by force.<br>
<br>
Again, luckily for you, you live in a nation where people can cry to the roof-tops that they hate everything that you would possibly give your life to defend.  And you, in turn, can cry back into them and tell them how much you hate them for it, and how much you want to shut them up.  Without that, what would democracy be for?  There is no unifying view in your country or in mine.  Everything is a compromise.  Everything.  Common view comes from that middle ground between shouting.  What the people want as a whole, that is democracy.  Not what a few people want for the rest.<br>
<br>
As for your hypothetical [racist] shirt, well that is actually practically the same thing.  Before everyone decides to turn agains me on this one, just think about it.  Again, I state that I live in the US, maybe it is different where you live.  But I can put a sign in my lawn that says I hate green people from Madeupland.  I have that right.  I can where it on a shirt, I can inscribe it into a nationally cyndicated book.  What I can't do is go into a public place and use that imagery to make people feel threatened or slandered.  If I am stating my opinion, I can say anything I want no matter who may hate it.<br>
<br>
And while on the one hand I say that, on the other I tell you right now, that just the thought of taking that side of advocacy turns my stomache.  I can't stand people that are outwardly racist toward others.  The reason I word it that way is that despite my not being racist, I can't change the dogmatic views of others.  I can try and I'll be d@mned if won't, but the world is what the world is.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for you Simon, I said it before.  You can get pissed at me for my views on your situation, or you can think about it a bit.  Either way, I've said what I needed to say. <p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<B>You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one</B></br>
