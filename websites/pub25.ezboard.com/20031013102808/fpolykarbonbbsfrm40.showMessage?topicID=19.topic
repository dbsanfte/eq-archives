Title: Assassin for hire (if you have another title I can use tell me, it'd be very much appreciated)<br>
<br>
Story: (Year is 2034, takes place in the planet Mars) This story is about a girl named Saphire who's father was a scientist. Her father and his staff of other scientists were assigned to work on an experiment for the military to use once it was proven to work. Militaries around Mars that colonized there wanted a sort of technology that can somehow make their soldiers stronger, faster, etc.  This certain experiment was known as &quot;HAE&quot; (Human Abilitiy Enhancement) <br>
<br>
After 2 years or so, they had made the machine, they just needed someone to test it out. Saphire volunteered to test it out, for her father, and also because she was in Mar's military so she thought it'd be better to be the first.<br>
<br>
After quite sometime in the machine, Saphire's strength, agility, fighting skills, stealth skills, etc. increased. Whilst in the HAE machine, she was in a deep sleep and was stuck in a tube, frozen, which was inside the machine.<br>
Sometime while Saphire was in the machine, her father was dieing of a deadly virus and so he knew his end would come, he assigned a scientist that was not yet infected with the virus, to help his daughter once she was out.<br>
<br>
A few months later after her father's death, it had been one year and a couple of months in the HAE machine. Finally, she was taken out. She had no memory of what happened in her life before she went into the HAE machine. Therefore, she knew nothing of the world and everything around her. The only thing she knew was how to fight and everything else the machine enhanced her abilities on. The scientist that her father assigned to help her when she was ready to come out, was known as Dr. Adachi. Adachi was infected during the same virus that her father had died of, but he didn't let that get in the way with helping Saphire. He put her in a chair, which was hooked up to a computer covered with wires. With that one computer, in under 2 hours, she knew what she knew before, maybe even a bit more than before. <br>
<br>
After a week Adachi dies at a hospital in a city  in Mars called Zelos. Right before his death, he told Saphire to look for his daughter, Noa Adachi, who will help her when she needs the help. <br>
Saphire looked for Noa, and also a job and a place to live. She found an apartment in Zelos, yet still no job, and no Noa. Saphire couldn't find a regular job, so she took a job that she knew she could do best because of all the skill that is required to do this certain type of job was skill she was exceptional at, and this job was being an assassin (oh yeah and sometimes she does merchant type jobs). She was great with guns, going stealth, exceptional at fighting, she was perfect for the job. She became an assassin for hire. One day Noa finds out where Saphire lives and contacts her and meets with her. Since Noa is a computer hacker, Saphire had only one need for her and that was to hack when she needed it.<br>
<br>
Together, they worked as a team. Somewhere along the story they meet a cop who has jobs for Saphire, and she must do them or she'll end up in jail because she's been doing jobs for the wrong kind of people all a long, but she already knew that they were bad people, as long as she got the money, she whad no problem working with them. Then, Saphire meets a guy whom she may fall in love with. This certain guy (before she even knows him) is a target and some bad guys want killed but instead she tells the bad guys that's he's dead, then hides the guy and gets help from him in some of her jobs/missions, however you wish to call it.<br>
<br>
<br>
*PHEW* (my hands hurt) i typed a lot..<br>
anyways...<br>
so there you have it, a sexy bad ass chick that has a lost past and kicks ass with help from another sexy chick that  lost her father and kicks ass on comps, also from a hot dude that she falls in love with, and from a cop guy who's a cop...lol.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
please c+c, tell me what you think arent good and what you do, and/or tell me how i can fix the mistakes or if I can add anything and take something out.<br>
<br>
takes for your time -- cya!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

It's very hard on the eyes of the reader if there are not breaks to pause and take a virtual breath. That said, onto the story comments…<br>
<br>
The first thing I thought of after reading it was, wow, this is busy with a capital B. There's so much going on that you could be in danger of short changing part of the story. The second thing was, why should I care about this character? <br>
<br>
One of the things that’s so refreshing about manga (and sometimes comic super-hero style) is that the characters are often ordinary individuals placed into extra-ordinary situations OR they are sometimes super powerful beings put into ordinary situations in which they have a difficult time coping.<br>
<br>
Just because she was in the Mars military doesn't tell me enough about why she would become an assassin. That's a pretty huge leap. Maybe the machine did something to her. Maybe it deadened her morality so that she doesn’t know right from wrong and she has to learn that part of being human again. Maybe that was the one thing that Dr. Adachi couldn’t give back to her. He could give her knowledge but he couldn’t re-bond her with humanity. It would make her half way to being a psychopath. This is the fight for her soul and therefore it gives tension to the story. It gives the audience something to hope for her.<br>
<br>
One hole I see in this brief write-up is why Sapphire would be have to try for a regular-person job or even freelance as an assassin. She was a military project. The military tends not to just let that kind of money walk away, but IF before his death her father was able to realize the outcome (a super armed force that could infiltrate society and not feel any remorse over wrong doing) and he and Dr. Adachi came up with a plan to rescue Sapphire from such a fate then it would make more sense. It would also give Dr. Adachi more of a reason to intersect his own daughter’s life with that of Sapphire's, otherwise, as a parent I wouldn’t want her anywhere near my kid.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Before dying Dr. Adachi could help her escape the military compound, and then she’s suddenly on her own. The crooked cop could come across her defending herself against multiple attackers and decide to use her. He would give it a good spin – bad guys going free because the cops didn’t have enough evidence to convict, etc., but she really wouldn’t care. Since she hasn’t learned right from wrong she gets sucked into his machinations and some dirty politics before Noa can help her.<br>
<br>
Once they meet up Noa would in effect become Sapphire’s keeper and morality guide on a ordinary daily basis until Sapphire could learn to do that for herself. This could be a mix of heavy lessons and lighthearted humor breaks. A good place for Sapphire to start learning would be on the job…service industry; maybe as a barista at an upscale coffee shop (just because I’m tired of fast food joints<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Both Noa and Sapphire could work together. This would give Noa a much stronger reason to remain Sapphire’s sidekick, and more chance for buddy style interaction, and of course “lessons in humanity” on a daily basis. Noa may or may not believe the cops story and that could play out rather interestingly.<br>
<br>
It also gives you a way for Sapphire and the “hot guy” to meet and get to know one another long before he becomes her target. The contract on him could be the critical mass that makes the click with humanity, starts her thinking on repaired synapses. <br>
<br>
If you don’t go that route, and the Military really did train her as an assassin, then there must be something that makes her predisposed to killing others. Something like bad guys who got away with the murder of her mother - that's pretty cliché too but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
If she’s just going to be bad-ass and kill people for money and not care then the readers won’t care about her either. Even in the movie &quot;Leon, The Professional&quot;, the director/writer has the pro-killer taking in an abused little girl. It’s how we as an audience connect with him, otherwise we wouldn’t care. Sapphire has to have something we care about.<br>
<br>
You’ve obviously given this a lot of thought. Good luck!<br>

There seems to be a lot of loose ends. What ever happened to the HAE research? Surely there must have been continued monitoring of this seemingly expensive project.<br>
<br>
The idea of &quot;emotional amnesia&quot; as well as total amnesia is really good! Maybe Saphire's dad knew there was a potential for memory loss/block but didn't realize the sociopathic results of the HAE project as well. So while all the facts could be poured back into Saphire's head, the emotions and morality couldn't.<br>
<br>
Like amnesia, Saphire would get &quot;emotional flashbacks&quot; at certain poignant moments. Noa may try to help her get back to emotional high ground.<br>
<br>
I would have the cop take advantage of her stone-cold nature. Maybe he's bitter about the legal system on Mars and wants to take advantage of Saphire's abilities and stone-cold nature. Make him connected to a large, private, ultra-conservative syndicate that wants to get rid of crime as they see it on Mars. They fund scum to get rid of scum.<br>
