<br>
Hello, my names Larry, basically i want to creat a manga about boxing. I am a boxer myself and I also consider myself to be quite an artist. Im just not so good at creating in depth stories. Im pretty much looking for a friend and writer, because im seeing this book moving for some years like 2 or 3 probably. <br>
<br>
Basically it starts off here, a young boy who is living on the street faces all kinds of problems like how he is going to eat, stuff like that, just dirt poor. He pickpockets this guy who happens to run a boxing arena. walking away he runs right into the guy (the boxer guy is Roc Occoner ). <br>
<br>
The boy tries to fight but Roc just kinda laughs it off and offers to buy him food if he gives the wallet back. So they share stories and stuff over warm soup and bread. The guy said hey you must have quick hands if you snatched my @#%$ without me noticing, every think of boxing. So he gives the boxer guy a call some weeks later, and the boxer guy offers him a place to stay if he promises to clean up the arena every so often. <br>
<br>
Between going to school and boxing the boy lost his life of street crime and he trains every so often. One day he runs into one of the local street thugs who is like the king of the homeless boys gang or whatever lets call him zack. Zac goes to him and says yeah i found you where u been yada yada lets go we need u for a pull (a robbery). The kid says he's not like that anymore yada yada they end up fighting, Zack pretty much whoops him for a while untill the kid gets up the urge to fight back, he kicked the guy in the stomach harrrrrrd and then goes to town on his face. <br>
<br>
The kid runs back to the arena to find the boxer guy and tell him what happened. He cleans the kid up and asks him what he did to defend himself. Thats where the boxer kid's career starts. He then goes training every day. <br>
<br>
After 2 years or so and 1 or 2 amature fights later, the boxer guy goes off to fight in a semifinal match and looses baddd, and starts to think about quiting boxing. The guy he ended up loosing too became the champ for the next 3 years. Totally erasing boxers from the ring, just destroying them he becomes &quot;the most dangerous man in gloves&quot;<br>
<br>
The kid (we'll call him eric) decides he wants to go full and enter Knuckle Champs 10 and try to win the title from the champ in honor of his mentor. He ends up loosing before in the semifinals by decision. Then he goes to his dressing room to go home, he see's the champ. The champ talks to him and says. I was hoping you would have won your match so we could fight. This made eric smile and he started walking away. But then the champ turns around and says &quot;but then.. you were trained by that no good son of a bitch Roc Oconner&quot; and walks out to the ring. Leaving eric alone in the dressing room hallway. <br>
<br>
And thats what i got sofar for the begining. Im looking for somone to help me write out some plot twists and other ideas for where we can take this manga.<br>
<br>
Also, if there is a web designer who would like to get some credits with this i would appreciate the help. Im not really trying to do much with this, maybe if it gets big we can sell some mouse pads or coffee mugs or something but nothing real big. Its just a hobby.<br>
<br>
Any takers? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=macman9184>macman9184</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/20/02 10:27:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WOW</span><hr size=1> ooooooo k, i guess no one is interested in even looking at a boxing manga idea. this is crazy.

At first glance some peeps may think it's a rags to riches tale but so far I don't see much riches involved which is cool<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I have a few questions tho. You say &quot;Eric&quot; calls Roc up a few weeks later? I was gonna ask where he get's the money to call him but since you're looking for ideas I thought well, he could phone Roc up and Roc'll be like &quot;Thought you were dirt poor kid? How'd you find the money to make a call&quot;. Eric would reply sarcastically &quot;Just cuz I gave you back your wallet, don't mean I gave you all the money in it. A guy's gotta make a living right?&quot;. I was wondering if all these events would take place in like a single issue seeing as quite alot is going on there. I assume Eric starts attending school after he starts living with Roc? You'll probably need to give Eric a lil more background cos I'm wondering where his family is, parents, cousins, grandparents? etc. Of course the simple answer would be orphaned but that's been done and dusted over and over so maybe he needs a new edge. Abusive parents? Family problems? Wanting to get out on his own? Heck, maybe he could have a fine family and all that and is just pulling the wool over Roc's blinkers. Could be a scam he's run on peeps several times to get a bit of dough in his pocket but then realizes there's something different with Roc and he's being offered all sorts of new opportunities he never saw before in his life. So therefore, he'd have the added pressure of trying to hide this fact from Roc. Question is how do you hide the fact that you have a family looking for you? Placing them in a different city would be one idea. But again, this is just an idea for his background. Also, how old is he when the story begins? I dunno much about the US education system but I assume being at highschool he's between 15 and 17 right? <br>
<br>
Also, the guy needs some life away from boxing seeing as that seems to be what's mostly mentioned. Is he gonna make any friends at highschool, maybe meet a girl? And I'm sure they'd be repurcussions from his fight with Zack. (Sorry all my ideas are a little all over place but I'm kinda freestyling it as I go along). By the way, what's Eric's ethic origin? Heck, what's all the characters ethic origin? Whilst it may not matter too much, it would make for some interesting developments. <br>
<br>
I'll leave it at that for awhile but hope that's helped you out some. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=psoj>psoj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/20/02 3:58:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://menotu.homestead.com/files/goku.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any writers interested in co conspiring a boxing manga?</span><hr size=1> yup yup not many reply here...either that or people just hate me...anyways..from the short little peice i read looks intrestin...i woldn't mind writting for ya, but i wrkin on my own thing and lookin for artsts and comin up with ideas...maybe a duel collaboration?<br>

After reading the first reply my creative juices started flowing like blood in a rocky movie. (or something that flows alot) Anyway, The main character Eric is Latin, I think that would let me be able to play with the whole outsider thing. He wont be so adept in English, which will lead to a lot of people picking on him in highschool. Which I can then develope into a type of loose controll temper style of fighting. (Gohan dbz? anyone remember? yeah something like that)<br>
<br>
Roc is White, european or whatev i can say to not offend anyone if they take offene to being called white, (dont ask why, long story, so ill just be pollite). He's about 5'11 180lbs. A very cocky and proud fighter. His attitudes rub off on Eric, and Eric becomes kind of cocky which also gets him into trouble with some gangs. <br>
<br>
Thats going to be Eric's background. He had a family and a brother 20 who joined a local gang. One night Felix, went out and didnt come back. Felix went out and shot some rival gang members while they were all attending a party on some rival turf. Being that most of the gang members are around 18 or so, they went to highschool with Felix and some still attend with Eric. <br>
<br>
After Eric's family found out about the tension, they were protective of eric. Eric wanted to attend a party  one night that was notorious for fights and shootings, but it was supposed to be &quot;party of a lifetime&quot;. His parents forbid him to go, but he went anyway. While he was there he was pointed out by some members of LX and he was jumped. He eventually got a hold of a stick or something and swung for his life, then he ran off towards home. The whole way home he was thinking i should have never went to that party. At the top of his street he notices 2 cars at his house and its very late so he is cautious. He hears shots firing in the distance, (not one or 2 but 40 or so shots). <br>
<br>
He is paralyzed with fear and only watches as 4 men run off of his porch and hop in a red mustang convertable with a blacklight under car neon kit (that is important to the plot, im thinking of using this as something to run his temper throughout the series of comics. Like when he see's the car he looses all his thought and only acts on instinct, because he is looking for the killers).<br>
<br>
He finally makes his way home face full of tear tracks to see his entire family killed and lost of all valuable possessions (rings, chains, neclaces and watches) (he lives with his mon and stepdad in Baltimore, Far from any of his family in South California. For the next week he stayed at friends houses till he felt uncomfortable living there anymore (you know that feeling you get when you know your not wanted). So he moved to the streets, the Govt took over his house and have been tracking Eric for some time to place him in child services. <br>
<br>
Not wanting to become lost in the endless system of child life recovery and foster care he becomes determined to live on his own. (Eric is 16 so he's got a nice frame able to stand up for himself not totally helpless, but kind of scrawny). He runs into many characters on the street, in and out of jail for steeling and loitering charges little petty @#%$ like that, untill he has his ordeal with Roc Oconnor. (As explained by me above) Thats where it all starts. <br>
<br>
Some info on Roc i guess, How about he went to the army to pay for education, got the money, spent most of it on girls and booze, and took the rest to buy his small appartment. In the army he boxed for 4 years straight and is quite a fighter so he decided it wouldnt be a bad way to make a living (Sometimes entering in MMA (mixed martial arts) tournaments.)(UFC for example). He gets some cash from a local mob to help start the gym that is in the basement of Don. Chinelli's Bar basement. And as you know no money from the mob is free. Often Don. Chinelli is in and out of Roc's life making decisions for him and puppeting him in the illegal boxing ring. Roc realizes he should have never went to Don Chinelli and tries to break his ties with him. So that is Roc's conflict throughout the book, being morally straight, keeping his dignity and living to the next day. It's not good having the 8th strongest family in america after you.<br>
<br>
Im sure we can throw some love in the story, and I would love so get a good twist like some conflict between Roc and Eric that would really make the story good. But sofar thats what i got now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=865.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=865.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=865.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=865.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=865.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=865.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=865.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
