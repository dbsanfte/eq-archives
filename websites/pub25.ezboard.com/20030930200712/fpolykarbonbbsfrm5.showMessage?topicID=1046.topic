I am certain it will be a wonderful experience which you will enjoy immensely.<br>
<br>
The issue of discrimination is a touchy one when it comes to Japan, for while there is discrimination in all countries (well, at least in all the ones I've been too), the strain that is prevalent in Japan is, like most things Japanese, unique in its &quot;japaneseness&quot;.<br>
<br>
First of, I don't think you have to fear physical discrimination (as in people attacking you for your skin color, and so on) in Japan.  Discrimination in Japan is more subtle - it can sometimes be difficult to pick up on it unless you are handy with the language or familiar with the culture.<br>
<br>
The concept of &quot;gaijin&quot; (i.e. 'foreigner') is a strong one in Japan, and is reinforced by the ethnic homogeneity of the country - i forget the exact statistics, but the first thing that should strike you when you arrive is how *Japanese* everyone is! (i.e. here in america, i can walk out on the street and see whites, blacks, hispanics, indians (from india as well as native americans), chinese, japanese and so on.... in japan .... only... japanese, or so it would seem!)<br>
<br>
as a result of this homegeneity, everyone who is not &quot;japanese&quot; is referred to as a foreigner (gaijin)... a linguistic representation of the clear divisions between &quot;you&quot; and &quot;them&quot;.  (or &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; from the japanese perspective).  In the previous decades there were countless books written on the subject of &quot;nihonjinroh&quot; or 'theories of japaneseness', many of which were nothing more than narcisistic (spelling?) ramblings designed to convince the japanese of their own superiority.  this is a complex subject and I'm afraid I can't really give it a good treatment in this small post!  But if you're really interested in some of the academic theories regarding the Japanese psyche, I would recommend you take some time to search out some books on the subject.  Some good ones I've read recently include &quot;The Enigma of Japanese Power&quot; (which is fairly recent and caused a great deal of controversy when it first came out), &quot;Office Ladies and Salaried Men&quot; (a fascinating look at gender politics in a japanese company, though perhaps only of interest if you're into that sort of thing), &quot;Learning to Bow&quot; (a narrative about the experiences of a young JET teacher in japan for the first time) and others (i'll have to look it up when i get home.  At any rate, the first book will provide you with an excellent insight into some mysteries of &quot;Japaneseness&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, getting back to what i was babbling about previously, no matter what you do, you will always remain a gaijin, in the &quot;outside&quot; group (as opposed to the &quot;in&quot; group- 'out' and 'in' groups are an important concept in japanese society).  This sort of inherent resistance to outside influences is present in all aspects of japanese life, from getting visas, to conducting business, to getting jobs and so forth.  You will encounter it, and you will have to learn to deal with it - it doesnt' matter how well you speak japanese, how much you know about the culture, no matter if you're married to a japanese citizen, or graduate from Todai.... you will never be allowed to forget that you're a foreigner in a country that doesn't really welcome foreigners.<br>
<br>
In your case, things are a little bit worse. While I don't know that much about Filipinos persay, I will tell you that on the average, white, western english-speaking foreigners get treated a hell of a lot better than asian/hispanic-looking foreigners.  The former get their own little cult of celebrity, and for some, the thrill of being constantly surrounded by english bandits (girls that only hang around white guys for play time or to have an &quot;accessory&quot; (read: boy toy) and to pick up a little english here and there), being complimented every time they pick up a pair of chopsticks or the ever present &quot;nihongo jyoozu desu ne!!!&quot; (your japanese is so good!) everytime they utter the simplest of japanese words never grows old.  For them, it's like being a little mini celebrity and they're happy slogging out their lives in generic cookie-cutter eikaiwa schools, screwing happy-go-lucky superficial spoiled girls out looking for a good time and getting drunk at the local gaijin bar with other foreigners and complaining about all that they hate about japan.<br>
<br>
For other foreigners, especially asian/hispanic foreigners, it's not so pleasant.  While the Japanese (in my impression) have a love/hate relationship with the west mixed with liberal amounts of an insecurity complex, when it comes to other asians, they most definitely have a superiority complex.  They generally treat them as inferior to themselves, sometimes even dirty, or at best a neccessary nusiance left over from the bubble days (when cheap foreign labor was imported from neighboring asian countries to do the menial labor regular japanese thought was below them, then left to poverty when the bubble collapsed and the japanese took those jobs back).   For such foreigners, even if they speak perfect english, often even eikaiwa (english conversation teaching) is not a viable option (they want somebody who 'looks' like their image of what an english-speaker should look like -i.e. blond hair blue eyes).  You may experience blatant discrimination in some mid-to-high range establishments (like restauraunts and such), probably have a hard time finding japanese girls/guys to date (while many want to have a white western partner, not so many are into other asians, which is the saddest and most blatant expression of their intrepretation of the relative social standing of the japanese and other asians), might hear some things on the street if you do manage to find such a person to date, have a hard time finding an apartment to rent (this is a major problem, actually!), and so on.... and while most forms of discrimination is technically outlawed in japan, because the police tend to have extremely ignorant and biased viewpoints, you can't expect to be treated fairly by them, let alone find some sort of solution if you are discriminated against (this is a problem for white foreigners as well).<br>
<br>
this is not to discourage you from visiting japan!  This sort of discrimination, for better or for worse, is part of what makes japan &quot;japanese&quot;, and it too, is slowly changing.  Most young people will tend to be more open minded than their parents, and in the big cities (tokyo/yokohama, osaka, kyoto (lots of foreigners in kyoto), nagoya and the like) there are so many foreigners that people tend to be a lot more open minded when dealing with them..... out in the countryside... well, that's a different story. <br>
<br>
If you take the time to surround yourself with open minded individuals (and there are many young japanese who actively seek out foreigners to associate with for reasons other than just having an &quot;accessory&quot; or to live the myth of &quot;internationalness&quot;), take your time and familiarize yourself with the language and the culture, and most of all, be patient with yourself, japan and the entire culture shock experience, you will find that discrimination, no matter what form it takes, will not hinder you from having a truely precious and wonderful experience in japan.<br>
<br>
i hope this helps.  please ask if you have more questions i can answer!<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~mamiller2/panda/panda3.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
[EDIT]: The most helpful piece of advice i can think of to give you when in japan is this: whatever happens, don't fight it.  no matter how alien or backwards something seems to you, how primitive in thought or discriminatory in attitude, learn to accept it, bending with the flow, doing things 'the way it must be done', and learn from it, watch it, observe it, and always keep your true self inside, until you feel you truely know enough about the situation to decide exactly which way you should respond.  Often times, things that seem to have one specific cause will turn out to have a very different, much more subtle reason that you can easily miss unless you take your time and are very careful in your interpretations.  in this way, i think, you can perhaps truely begin to 'understand' some of the japanese ways. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu.  <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

this is true, but generally these jobs are eikaiwa (english conversation teaching) or otherwise english related.  The few that don't fall into this category are usually unsatisfying for the average westerner as you are little more than the &quot;token gaijin&quot;.  for most other jobs, gaijin have to fight tooth-and-nail to get a position, not only against other gajin but against a system that would much rather not have them there.  this situation changes somewhat if you have highly specialized/sought after skills (lawyer/accountant/engineer/comp.sci/multiple languages beyond japanese and english), are white/black (sadly, most other foreigners are not as heavily &quot;sought after&quot; if that's the appropriate term...) and of course, are fluent in japanese... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu.  <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
