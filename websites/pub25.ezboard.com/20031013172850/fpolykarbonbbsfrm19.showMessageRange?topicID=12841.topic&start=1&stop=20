Is getting 5.25 (or whatever minimum wage happens to be) for an hour of hard work fair when people doing much less make an insane amount more? Is it fair to heavily tax people with little income who need that money to SURVIVE when that same amount would barely put a dent in another's savings?

You should probably know what it is he's talking about before you assume. There are other ways to take action against racism.<br>
<br>
And I think some people are misunderstanding what people are trying to do when they introduce some socialist policies. They're not trying to turn our government INTO a socialist one (which hikagun keeps saying). Pure anything isn't going to work 100% effectively, so what's wrong with taking an idea from one system that works and integrating it with the current system you have? You take the bits and pieces that work, and leave the things that don't. <p><html>

As for the taxes, well it's supply and demand.  If someone who spends all day on his butt working with web graphics makes 5 times as much money as a steel worker, it's because there is more demand for his profession.<br>
Unfortunately I was assuming that the racism issue was a far left wing issue, because these points come from a Socialistic party. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.futures-end.com" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/snowthefox/roshis.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 7:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hawaii-nation.org/flag-ani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Is getting 5.25 (or whatever minimum wage happens to be) for an hour of hard work fair when people doing much less make an insane amount more?

yes its fair. because the people making less money in a hard working environment have the chances to become more but have not aspired to do more. i have seen many men and women really work hard and do nothing but complain about their jobs rather than go to college. then again i have seen people take their jobs seriously and get promoted. as well as do their jobs, go to school, raise a family all on a minimum wage job to get a college degree. a friend of mine named Al has three children a wife and bills up the wazoo. he went through college on what little extra they could afford. it was a long and arguous task. but then he graduated. now the man makes over 75000 a year as a starting level worker. should he, the man who worked so hard against all odds get the same treatment as some bum that won't work even to support his family and then demand the government give him more money? work is work. what you make of it is what counts. i for one am working in a call center. its pretty tough. there is never a day when i dont think, &quot;why not quit?&quot; the pay is good and it will get me through college.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deadcell4>DeadCell 4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 8:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> 5.25 bucks per hour? in the USA, Minimum Wage is 5.75 Call Human rights, he cant pay u that low, or can he? eh.<br>

Not everyone is smart enough to go to college, not everyone has the ability. Some people are dumb, and that's all there is to it. Aside from that...<br>
<br>
People are products of nature vs. nurture. Their DNA and their surroundings, if someone is brought up in abject poverty, I can guarantee 99% of the time they will have children in abject poverty. The gap between rich and poor continually widens, the poor stay poor, the rich get richer.<br>
<br>
All I can say is some jerk off rich kid, who get's to go to ivy league or close to, just because his family has been rich since they took advantage of poor villagers in the 1700's, and get's an exorbitant amount of money for doing a jack squat amount of work, then goes and blows it on porches and lamborghini's should damn well have to pay more taxes, but it should go straight to low income, or better yet, to homeless/shelters.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying some people don't work their asses off to get to a successful life, what I am saying is, alot of people are born into riches. People build custom houses costing millions of dollars. A million dollars could feed ,clothe, house, and educate tens of families per year. It could provide for a single persons entire life. Yet they buy their expensive art and cars and homes, and at the same time people die without a penny to their name.<br>
<br>
The richest one percent, one, one percent, the smallest whole number above zero, controls 90% of the wealth in america. 90%, 90, 10% under 100. That means 99% control 10% of the wealth. That isn't right.<br>
<br>
Everyone wants to be against Socialism and all those other isms because america says democracy is the only way, and americans fought and died for it. I say they died in vain. Don't fall into a bad trend, don't become afraid to abandon a sinking ship.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is, make the rich pay more, the homeless deserve it. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/NARUTOdraw.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaarasunakage>Gaara Sunakage</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/Orochimaru.txt" BORDER=0> at: 9/28/03 8:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deadcell4>DeadCell 4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 10:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> Ummmm, you make no point in ur argument in one place,  Rich get richer and poor get poorer? Well that dosent have to be true, I was born into a middle life class family, and trust me Life sucked so bad for me I wanted to go and die, but after a few years everything changed and finally my family can afford all these nice things, It depends on the people, If a person dreams about being rich well than he isint taking any steps towards a better life...<br>
<br>
And no one in this world is dumb.... Every freaking Single person is born very intellegent, it depends on that person to develope and train his brain to keep it smart, like teachers say..<br>
<br>
&quot;FEED THE BRAIN, OR FEED YOUR BODY&quot;  or something like that.<br>
<br>
But truely would money bring you happiness? NO!! it would just make you crazy... I know people that have so much cash he could go out and buy him self a 250,000 dollar house like nothing but money took him over so fast hes afraid to spend it..<br>
<br>
For me its this theory, Make some cash to live easy life and still support a family..<br>
<br>
And if your jelouse of others peoples wealth than ur going straight to hell as i say... Never be jelouse of others, things get better as time goes by..<br>
<br>
And your also wrong, the richer you are the more taxes you have to pay, at least thats how it is in United States so dont worry, if you got a bundle of cash trust me your paying lots of taxes..<br>
<br>
And Also I feel sorry for homeless people but for those who have disabilities, other than the drunk type I hate because they claim to be poor well, its their fault they'll live and die without a penny because they chose that path..<br>
<br>
And Heck I never complained about poverty because I know theres always someone more poor than youll ever be, some kids dont even know how chocolate tastes because they cant afford it, or have to work on the fields day and night..<br>
<br>
So who are we to speak with our fency dsls and over priced computers saying were poor...  If your family owns 1 car, rents or owns 1 house, a tv a phone than ur considered middle class, or something like that i forgot the stats.. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~deathpool/Luke/DeadCellMatrix_Signature.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deadcell4>DeadCell 4</A> at: 9/28/03 10:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/28/03 11:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>yes its fair. because the people making less money in a hard working environment have the chances to become more but have not aspired to do more.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So, it's fair because you can get a different job? That isn't answering my question. I said is the wage they get fair compared to the wage of someone else doing less work? Besides, you REALLY believe that everyone has equal oppurtunity? I'm not saying that just because you have less oppurtunity that this is an excuse to give up, but you've got some unrealistic expectations about what people can do. Rags to riches isn't exactly the norm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>should he, the man who worked so hard against all odds get the same treatment as some bum that won't work even to support his family and then demand the government give him more money?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Absolutely not, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about those that can't get ahead, despite their best efforst, not some lazy bastard who's in a bad situation and isn't trying to do anything about it. I realize that for a lot of people, they don't succeed because they don't try, but that isn't the case for EVERYONE.<br>
<br>
You seem to be doing what people do in all arguments; comparing the best example to the worst. Comparing the hard working success story to the lazy bum. Same thing with the other side of the argument, comparing the person born with a silver spoon in their mouth to the destitute person without an oppurtunity in the world. Sure, all those cases are valid, but there are people between those extremes, and the issue is a lot more complicated than black and white.<br>
<br>
Same thing with the homeless. Sure, some people are there because they messed up due to their own wrongs, but come on &quot;chose&quot; that path? I don't think anyone sets out to be homeless. And I'm sure once you are, it's not exactly a breeze to get back on your feet. What's he going to do? Go apply for a job dirty as hell and smelling of garbage? Okay, MAYBE you could get a job, but I doubt it'd be a good one. And minimum wage isn't exactly going to get you anywhere. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree that people need to work hard if they ever want to achieve success, but some people have to face extra hardships to get there. I don't think people should just be handed anything to make up for that, but they should be given a fair shot.<br>

After my grandfather died, my dad got a better job in the city and we took over the nice house that my carpenter of a grandfather built himself..  So yeah it's very possible for hardworkers to get ahead.<br>
Another thing though, is that half the problem I have with higher taxes for higher wages is that the middleclass are getting canned with the richer.. I'm a proud middle class person and I'm very happy there, but when hard working middle class people pay taxes, they pay for more than the lazy bums.. and even worse, is that their money go TO the lazy bums.  <br>
Socialistic ideas like that are trying to bridge the gap between rich and poor, however all it ends up doing is repeating a cycle of lazyness in the lower class.  Why work when you can get welfare from the people who do?<br>
According to the poorer get poorer idea, people in the lower class would rather not work to improve themselves.. so then what else is there for them to work for? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.futures-end.com" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/snowthefox/roshis.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wizzart>wizzart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/29/03 3:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> I really shouldn't respond to this, but i can't stop myself. I am very much a supporter of (most of) socialism. Basically I think it's the fairest system you can think of, though every republican will counter that by saying the rich have to pay more than the poor, so that it isn't fair. The key here is that people with more money can do with a lot more less than someone who's for instance dependant of any social security or a not so good paying job.<br>
<br>
&quot;but every one has the ability to get a better job, as long as they want too&quot;.<br>
<br>
No, that's not true. For instance, it sometimes happens that teenagers are forced to get a job, for whatever reason, wich interferes with getting more education. Money can be a problem too. Going to college generally costs a lot of money (except in Sweden, where it's paid collectively out of taxes...).<br>
<br>
And besides that, you still want someone to pick up your trash right? Someone has to have that job...Think about it, i don't have time to tell you more now...maybe later.<br>

<br>
here's my perspective on the whole thing. <br>
<br>
something that seems to have slipped through the cracks in the discussion so far is the United States' obsession with college degrees. people who have degrees nearly automatically make more money than those who are just ordinary smart people. <br>
<br>
take my dad for instance. he used to work for a company that did programming and design for NASA (among other things). my dad was their computer support tech. he fixed their printers, replaced monitors, etc. but he was also capable of figuring out how to solve hardware/software conflicts that the PhD's in his office couldn't fix. and they were programmers and engineers. however, they made three times as much because my dad has no college degree. his boss said they couldn't pay him any more unless he got a BA. <br>
<br>
a lot of people can't afford college and even if they are smart, even if they have a decent job they will not be able to make as much money without a degree. maybe this happens in other places in the world too (having only lived in the U.S. i wouldn't know) but it happens a lot here. <br>
<br>
so, back to taxes. part of the problem with the rich is that whole 'charitable contribution' thing. it's a nice idea but in reality it doesn't work very well. rich people can donate money to charities and then they don't have to pay taxes. (i think you have to donate amounts that are equal to the amount you would normally pay in taxes, but i'm not one hundred percent certain.) then the government has to raise taxes on the rest of the population to continue to meet it's budget. <br>
<br>
what we need to do is cut the Federal government down to about 1/20 its current size, resume letting states govern themselves (which is Constitutionally legal) and stop making people pay taxes to Washington D.C. where it will just be mismanaged and lost anyway. <br>
<br>
and we should stop making people pay taxes to go to school too. i was homeschooled but that didn't prevent my parents from having to pay property taxes every year to support the local (lousy) public schools. not paying property taxes would leave everyone with more money and they could afford to go to school wherever they wanted. (well, maybe not everyone but things could be worked out without the government being heavily involved.) <br>
<br>
and i do think the rich should be taxed more than the poor. it should be a sliding scale percentage. and Bill Gates can just give a few billion dollars each year to feed Africa and then everyone will be happy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

at the moment, as the SSP manifesto puts it:<br>

in other words, those who can easily pay, don't have to. the current system, therefore, is unfair, and the proposed system is much fairer.<br>
<br>

<br>
Can you clarify on how their current rights are sub par please?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
certainly. <br>
women, despite legislation on the subject, still recieve, on average, 25% less per annum than their male counterparts. it is estimated that between one in five and one in seven women has been subject to rape, and one in five women have been subject to violence from a male partner.<br>
<br>
a homosexual couple cannot be married. nor can they adopt children. and if one partner dies, the other does not have the same rights a heterosexual partner would have, partaining to wills, etc.<br>
<br>
under 18s do not qualify for minimum wage. the average student who qualifies from a scottish university has debts of up to £11,000 - the ssp will abolish tutition fees and re-introduce student grants. the ssp will fund 5000 new aprenticeships. they will also lower the minimum age that a person is eligible to vote from 18 to 16.<br>
<br>
the elderly are often trated without the respect they deserve. the ssp will increase state pensions, and provide free heating during the winter, plus abolish rents for all pensioners.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sixty eight per cent of households with a disabled person have an income of less than £10,000 per year (£200 a week).

the ssp will <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Replace the Disability Discrimination Act with fully comprehensive, enforceable civil rights legislation as demanded by the disabled peoples' movement.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Action against crime.<br>
<br>
I'm not seeing a contrast beeween this point via Democracy/Republic/Capitalism vs. Socialism.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
well, apart from the fact that it would still <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>be</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a democracy, just a socialist one, there is far too much crime in Scotland, and not enough is being done to prevent it. five people were killed last year due to guns. compared to the us, that may not seem like much, but its five people too much.<br>
a lot of crime, especially violent crime, is caused by alcohol or substance abuse. the ssp will do more to help addicts, and cut down Scotland's binge-drinking culture. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Vast resources are deployed to counter legitimate political protests, including anti-nuclear demos at Faslane and community protests such as the campaign to save Govanhill Swimming Pool in Glasgow.<br>
<br>
Huge policing operations have been mounted at these events, mass arrests have taken place and protracted expensive trails have resulted in scores of criminal convictions.<br>
<br>
In contrast, the family of Surjit Chhokar Singh are still seeking justice for his murder following a series of blunders by the Crown Office. The family of murdered Glasgow barman, Chris McGreal have faced a similar predicament. While known murderers walk the streets, innocent people spend decades in jail for crimes they did not commit. The Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (MOJO) has exposed a number of such cases, yet invariably runs into a brick wall erected by the Scottish legal establishment.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>- Action against racism.<br>
<br>
Again I'm not sure what Scotland's government's stance on such a topic is. However I'm assuming since this is a high left area we're in, it'll parallel &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;, which is a horribly flawed and hypocritical ideal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
there is too much racial intolerance in Scotland, and not enough is being done to prevent it. ethnic minorities often live in fear of attack, just because they are judged by the colour of their skin, or their cultural background.<br>

Money is a double edged sword, the more you have the worse you are, the less you have the worse you are, and vice-versa.<br>

I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but I think that's a terrible idea.

Likewise. I can't complain either, my dad's a doctor in the U.S. (nuff said). Comming from this status I realize things most don't when it comes to poor people, specially because I come from a 3rd world country (Dominican Republic), I know what real poverty is. Hell, my origins come from poverty as well, my dad being the doctor he is today was living in misery when he was young back in the D.R. He didn't see a refrigerater in his home till he was like 17 and his house didn't have a floor till he was like 10 (try to imagine what his house used to look like). I've seen poverty and trust me it's not a pretty sight, the bad thing about all of this is that the only people that can really make a difference are those that have status quo. These people have the resources to make things different and truely revolutionize society. <br>
Poverty is strictly related to education. In practically all, cases specially in Dominican Republic, those who don't have an education are living in poverty. So the first step to eliminating poverty in the Dominican Republic and other 3rd world countries is the reorganization and reelaboration of the public educational system. Parallel to that process would be the purging of corruption blocks that exist in the governments of the typical Latinamerican poor country. This would make the State economically secure and organized for foreign investors aswell as bilateral and unilateral <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>prestamos</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (english¿?). As for the U.S. I really have to admit that education in a university or college for a BA, masters or PHD is ridiculously expensive. That is a huge problem in the american society which affects employment and hence poverty percentage in the national population. So if colleges and and universities weren't so expensive (or better yet why not make them free, like in Germany and other European countries?) more people in the U.S. would be much better employed, specially immigrants which are those who make up in general the grand mass of U.S. poverty. In reality if the employment percentage is high it doesn't matter if taxes are high or if life is expensive. A lot of other developed countries like Japan have a very high percentage of employment among their citizens (not to mention one the the best public education systems of the world) yet have a very expensive lifestyle and very high taxes for all social statuses, the food in Japan is extremely expensive. Alot of travellers joke around saying that technology in Japan is much more cheaper than everyday food (even hard drives are sold out in the street as if it were a in a fruit stand).<br>

I completely agree with you. This is why socialism proposes that the State be the owner of all property. In a socialist country it doesn't matter if the corperation is too powerfull because the only benefactor would be the State itself and the People are suported by the State because the second provides the first all basic biologiacl and social needs. At least htat is what the general concept of socialism dictates.<br>

I agree with you again, but why don't you tell that to Donald Trump or Bill Gates to see what they will tell you? Or better yet why don't you propose that to the U.S. goverment and see how they will call you a &quot;comunist&quot; or a &quot;threat to democracy&quot; bable, bable, yadda, yadda, yadda. The system works and on top of that it benifits those in social and politcal power the most. They won't change things. Why would they change things if they obviously get the BBD (Bigger Better Deal) out of this system? Not to mention the fact that the &quot;system&quot; needs to some extent the existence of poor people. I know it sucks and that it could be WAY better, but really can't do much, maybe a gain of sand here and there but in the long run those in power will get away with all their mischeif, its been like that ever since the begining of human society. Maybe its even part of human nature. Rousseau clearly points out that society is strickly the origin of our misery. Of course thats Rousseau, others may have valid opinions as to an answer to a better society for all humans. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/29/03 5:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Or better yet why don't you propose that to the U.S. goverment and see how they will call you a &quot;comunist&quot; or a &quot;threat to democracy&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I don't know about anyone else, but I wasn't talking about making poor people rich. It's about making life liveable and giving those people the OPPURTUNITY to become more than they are. <p><html>

Managing their finances under the protection of family corporations for example allows them to pay a lot less tax than what they should pay in proportion to the middle class.   <br>
<br>
Unfortunately things aren't going to change, this nation was built by the rich and has mainly the interests of the rich protected, and its always going to be like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1monkeypunch1>1MonkeyPunch1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/29/03 6:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/pyapor/manga.txt height=117 width=125></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know what many people would think, but from the way you originally worded it it sounded as if you were defending the way things are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yeah I know, it did sound like I was defending it, to be honest I was aiming for a more &quot;realist&quot; tone of voice rather than a &quot;defender of the capitalistic reign&quot; tone of voice.<br>

I understood you very well, I realise that making &quot;poor&quot; people &quot;rich&quot; isn't what we are looking for. Now that you speak of oportunity, if my dad could become a doctor in the U.S. coming from an old shack in the DR why can't anybody else do the same? I know you already exposed hoe there can exists exceptions and that this is an extreme example but as my grandfather laways used to say, &quot;If you don't work, you won't eat either&quot;. I can acknowledge that that doesn't really mean everybody's having the same oportunity, most have to work much more than others to get to places. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaarasunakage>Gaara Sunakage</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/Orochimaru.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/29/03 8:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://godkodiak.homestead.com/files/Gaara1.jpg height=79 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> First this is a really great thread, no one is out of control, everyone is thinking logically and reasonably(except me maybe), haha.<br>
<br>
Me and my dad, have been talking some about the origins of the U.S. and such things. Here is an interesting thing.<br>
<br>
Taxes were voluntary until about the 1950's and late 40's, they became manditory to fund the cold war. Yet, we are no longer in a cold war, and our military strength, is exceeding by far the largest amount the U.S. had during the height of the cold war. And they were, even before 9/11, Iraq, and the name Osama Bin Laden was used at dinner.<br>
<br>
I think that if the united states survived from 1776 to 194* without manditory tax, it could do it now. You were really only taxed if you were a corporation or if you worked for one.<br>
People try to say that that would never work now, because it would kill the corporations, better the corporations than the people in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Can you imagine taking your whole paycheck, and putting it in your pocket, all your money? Man, that would be a good feeling.<br>
<br>
Alot of people like to argue with me, that the United States government is the good guys, that the governments of China, Korea, Iraq, and other enemies of the U.S. are alot worse. Here's the thing, I don't live there, I live here. Also, the U.S. wants to destroy all these governments, and when they do, who will be the worst then. I guess it's a matter of relativity if you look at it like that.<br>
<br>
The dictators, they have power in their countries. The U.S. has power everywhere. UN? What are they to the United States. U.S. gets mad at the french for not helping them, the French are just trying to get some cash in their pockets, just like the U.S. They have their little franchises like the U.S. has it's, Israel, formerly Iraq, formerly Afghanistan. Two of those, have now been invaded and their leaders dethroned, because they broke away. Israel steals palestinian land, and we do nothing. They force the palestinians to live in poverty, we say let us help you work it out. Haha, that is BS.<br>
<br>
If any of this sounds dumb, it just kinda flowed out of me, if any of sounds right, it probably is, hahaha. I'll get back to this thread later. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/gaara_sunakage/NARUTOdraw.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sevenwingangel>Seven Wing Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/29/03 9:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12841.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun with Socialism</span><hr size=1> Well I think the problem with cutting taxes right now and pretty much completely eliminating our military budget and our foreign influence would be that we would not be able to handle all the enemies we have made since the Cold War.
