<br>
Anyway:<br>
<br>
Few great powers are left on Earth:  The various Mining Consortions and Corporations of Africa and the Moon(due to the under exploited resources in Africa andh te moon, corporations too hold and basically now control everyhting).  The Pan-Pacific Trade Union of America, China, and the assorted independent South American coutries, along with Annexed Mexico, China, Caribean, Canada which controls most of World Trade.  The Eurasian Common Wealth of Russia and the fractured infighting states of the former EU.  <br>
<br>
Lets go over it the easy way: <br>
Eurasians, poor<br>
Trade Union, decatent<br>
Corporations, behind everything<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a massive arms build up between the rag-tag Eurasians and Trade Union which the Mining Consortions could stop but dont because they are making so much money selling the raw resources to both factions.<br>
<br>
In 2050 with the advent of severe cold warish tensions and threat of nuclear holocaust of the world, ecological collapse, and human preservation at only iffy.  The UN(I haven't thought of the witty abbrev of the replacement) basically assembles a commitee to review the issue human survivability.  Results are bad, very bad.  The UN creates a office directly responsible for the preservation of mankind.<br>
<br>
After five years their only solution(using massive super computers and human calculations) for survival on Earth(space not feasible due to political tensions and just the sheer cost of them which only the Mining Consortions can afford) is that there isn't one, nto a lasting one with human psychology in mind.<br>
<br>
Basically what that commision comes up with is to alter the human genome and preserve them through iminent destruction so that if mankind itself is wiped they will be the legacy for a peace(of course it isn't announced, imagine the mass riots and the eventual realization that the true enemy are the corporations).<br>
<br>
So they do, they start with a underground facility in the outback.  Then they realise that they need a existant biome to house these pseudo humans(NO ONE EVER THINKS OF THE BIOME!!!) so they have to expand massively, they basically begin creating 18 massive underground biospheres to house 3 different versions of 6 biomes each(they try to cutback by no including oceanic and icecaps, you know nuclear winter and the abundance of oceanic life arguements) usign the mining corporations for the actual construction fo the facility.<br>
<br>
They have the best and brightest of the world in the field of genetics concentrated into altering the human DNA so that man is inclined to peace adn not war, it failed so they changed to plan B.  Alter the human DNA for intellegence intellgence=realization of futility of war.  8 years later it is sucessful but life span of the procducts of this experiment have a dramatically reduced lifespan.<br>
<br>
2064<br>
<br>
These creatures are therefore not viable.  They decide to put hte products of plan B in a desperate push for plan A resulting in a plan C.  Over the next 5 years these creatures are taught all of the existing on Genetics.<br>
<br>
2069<br>
<br>
The creatures are simple ordered to work with the regular humans which turns out bad because the yare so muc hmore intellegent so they break off leaving the humans in the dust in their alterations in the genetic coding.  They soon notice divisions they cause and the prejudice facing them...  Their designated leader makes them think about one question one day &quot;Is this the legacy that these people want to leave behidn to should it be better?&quot; (you find the guy's diary in the game) So they alter the DNA much more than needed for a simple inclination for peace, they alter the genetic coding so much that the senses are expanded to a point where it isn't over loading the brain but more enhanced.  They also expand the mind for the manipulation of their personal magnetic field for other uses(protection mainly) and the ability to use more than 10% of the brain but they only double it to 20% instead of the cruder attempt by making the brain generate new synapses infinitely.  Also they improve these creature's immune system and regnerative potentials greatly.  And their greatest achivement, with the simple tweaking of one the many genetic keys, the process of aging beyond maturity was neutralized, though kept secret to their superiors.  They alter their psychology as well, along with the peace inclined, they are less wreckless in expansion and mroe one with nature, the only live to enjoy life.  In the end those creatures weren't really human anymore, only in their curious nature do they resemble man kind.<br>
<br>
2072<br>
<br>
The first 'batch' of 6 these things is created as test tube babies in artificial wombs.  The result is above all expectation.<br>
The three males and three females seem to be born well but one female and two males died shortly after downing hte hopes of their makers and the humans.  They rename the sole surviving male Adam as a joke, the humans aren't amused.  The females are named Chyss and Sydney in honor of the capitol of Australia.<br>
<br>
In 2072 the 18 biospheres are finally completed and what was dubbed 'Operation: Noah's Ark' commenced, gathering a breeding populations of all major species of animal that would make up a rahter simple biosphere, this would continue with complexities of the biospheres slowly being built up.<br>
<br>
The development of both the biospheres and the new creatures, again jokingly dubbing the them the 'elves' due to a seemingly over looked ear mutation which makes the ears extremely long, the name again sticks.  They urgently begin teaching these elves english which was quite quck followed by science and math, they learn very quickly, fearing that the little children were beign pushed too hard these lessons stop and they begin being kid like, playing, building things, beign curious.<br>
<br>
They begin making larger 'batches' of these elves and broaden the gene pool.  One of the guy's sees one of the surviving females, Sydney, the most curious one,(also mentioned the guy's diary) looking at him play a game of chess with a collegue, she looks interested(they do have breaks).  She they teach her quickly and lets her play.  Thinking this would be a quick series of games, he beats her once and then twice, but he loses the third time before she had to be taken back to the lab for a hourly checkup.  Soon enough there's a tournement with everyoen working in that part of hte facility and soon after Sydney beats everyone a small betting pool starts to see who could beat her.<br>
<br>
(also in diary)Adam and Chryss on the other hand begin developping their potentials in the field manipulation and routinely shock the doctors until they tire themselves out who perform the checkups until they began wearing thicker rubber gloves.  Adam and Chryss routinely play fight with each other over things like little balls that they have.  Chryss begins to excel at art drawing on the walls of their room.<br>
<br>
Adam is relitively open and likes to develop his field skills especially to show off infront of people he doesn't know, one day a Chinese General.  He begins to talke about a military application and then what would happen if humans survive and these elves once on their own decided to wipe out humanity...  A few weeks later, the 'Gurus' as the altered humans are called are ordered to make a 'Fail Safe' that could blend in with these elves.  They try to sway hte opinion of the humans but fail.  They alter the DNA of the normal elf for a greater field manipulation potential and a hidden quality of uncontrolable rage that could be triggered easily to destroy everything...  They were under close monitoring so they had a hard time doing anythign secret, but they did do one thing, they increased the field potential so greatly so that everythign would be left to be ruined and they also altered the coding so that he had a freedom of choice to perform this act, though weak, it was left there.<br>
<br>
2074<br>
It was submitted and the male was grown, he lived, he was named Locke.  The humans never thought this creation would create offspring and didn't bother making any calculations about it.  But the Gurus did, and found out that if procreation wiht a normal elf, the offspring's field manipulating potential would increase 10 fold but the inherent rage would be decreased greatly.<br>
<br>
Also in 2074, the first of hte Guru's died after collapsing in a corridor due to a heart attack... their mortality was begining to show itself in a ominous way.  They kept the little elves(there were about sixty kept throughout the compound in different areas now in small groups with their repective 'batches').<br>
<br>
While Adam worked on his field potential, Chryss drew on the walls and whatever she could find, and Sydney fed an obsesion with learning and playing with Chryss when she was bored.  Locke was introduced to the first three to see how he interacted, a close eye was kept on himby everyone monitoring hte situation.  He was a normal child, he acted in everyway much to the chagrin of the military observers.  He got along fairly well.  Until Adam began an arguement with him.  Then Locke revealed his true power, not even the two years of training Adam had could counter the brute power of Locke until he became extremely tired and collapsed.  Locke was put into isolation.  The military observers were happy except for the fact that he tired out so easily.  <br>
<br>
2080<br>
Operation Noah's Ark has nearly ended, the biospheres created had been self sustaining for 6 years.<br>
<br>
The 'Gurus' now began dying quite fast now.  The elves however weren't actually exposed to this, whenever one working with them died, the responce they got from the humans incharge was 'they had to leave'.  With fewer of hte Gurus around the understanding of the elves dwindled.<br>
<br>
The world goes to war after a race for the first permenant settlement on Mars disaster occurs, the Eurasians lose one of their escort vessels, an unbiased investigation from both faction and the corporations go two to one against the Trade Union.  Then two Trade Union vessels somehow collide into each other, it is blamed on sabotage and the world ends in nuclear holocaust and nuclear winter.  Preparations are made for the final result of the Genesis program as the radiation begins to settle.<br>
<br>
In short:<br>
Nuclear winter is less severe than first thought<br>
The continient of Australia is spared from large amount of radiation except on the North East tip<br>
Genesis is sabatoged by fanatic infilitrators that learn of it through the corporations 11 years after the nuclear war.<br>
The elves and biospheres are automatically raised to the surface and released to flourish<br>
The biosphere structures are deconstructed by hundreds of years of neglect and scavenging from surviving humans<br>
After 100 years the survivors establish the first real large scale government the Republic which has rulled since for 600 years.<br>
<br>
Enter Locke and Matthew:<br>
<br>
The elves live in utopia and set up somethings like advisors to the people, the elders, they don't actually rule but only advise people on matters like what to do about this, what to do about that.  They also appoint guardians, people to protect the people of the main elven settlement that they named Dochro, one of the names that the head 'Guru' called himself.  They can only be a few of these Guardians three or four, usually only three are needed.<br>
<br>
After the system was set up, Locke became a Guardian alogn with Chryss and Adam, they were the strongest.  After about 500 years, the Guardians remained largely the same, except Locke had fallen in love with a woman named Fiona.  One day when Locked was training in the woods, Chryss tries to get his attention by tapping Locke on the shoulder.  He goes all out because he's that way and ends up nearly killing Fiona with his big ass sword, he had already accidentally killed a man and injured a few little boys when they surprised him.  He is shocked by himself and runs off somehwere to think about it, it's a high cliff, he looks down and contemplates jumping and decides against it when Fiona comes by.  He still hates himself.  He decides to leave that night, he leaves all his armor and equipment with a goodbye letteron her door step.  He then notices almost no  one knows who he is without his equipment.  He decides to shave his facial hair off and try his luck.  Locke hates himself and wants to get away from himself  because no one thinks he's Locke, he decides to reinvent his life as a normal person by the name of Matthew who lives in the woods.  He supresses his rage with all the strength he has.  He ends up Marrying Fiona, he can't stay away from her, and living with his wife and a daughter they have Named Lilly in a isolated forest cottage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=762.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=762.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=762.topic><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=762.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=762.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=762.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=762.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
