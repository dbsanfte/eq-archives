Based on whose statistic? Anyways, if that were true (I suppose it could be), then perhaps their police should wear guns, I havn't ruled that out. I merely said that if they can get along w/o guns, so can we. <br>

Statistically more people have cars than guns, so we have to make the ratios similar first. I'm not sure what the result would be, but it'd make more sense than to jump to conclusion there about what is worse. <br>

You're right I probably am jumping to conclusions. As for the crime rate study Im assuming that the British govt. did a study. I actually read an artical on the study in a gun magazine so obviously they are going to have a biased opinion on the matter. The point I was trying to make though is that Europe isnt getting along without guns, but that is just my opinion.<br>
<br>
As for the drinking and driving comment I still believe that it is a bigger problem. Even if the ratio of car owners to gun owners is bigger. There still remains the fact the more people are killed by drunk drivers <p><br>

obviously that purpose has grown to have little meaning these days... perhaps it is time we change that? So the hypothertical choices would be to give people bigger weapons so they can balance the government, or take guns out of civilian hands altogether and try something new to keep power in civilian hands, or keep it the same.<br>
<br>
Whatever the choice, the amendment to bear arms has long past it's practical purpose... imo, change is a good thing and this is one of those things that could be made better. But how? I'm not quite sure, it'd require some time and thought, but i'm sure there's something better than the current situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Repeal one of the amendments in the Bill of Rights?  No longer needed.  Here’s some quotes about the Bill of Rights:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
The Bill of Rights is &quot;true for all men and all times&quot; -- meaning that it's as valid and necessary today as when it was written.<br>
<br>
The Bill of Rights is our property, collectively and individually, not the government's. It may not be interpreted away, amended, or repealed, wholly or in part, without negating the entire Constitution from which government derives its authority. In short, if the heirs of the Federalists renege (as they have with increasing frequency and brutality) on any part of their bargain with us, the heirs of the Anti-Federalists, then the whole deal is off. <br>
        <br>
No Bill of Rights, no Constitution. <br>
<br>
No Constitution, no government. <br>
        <br>
 As the highest law of the land, the Bill of Rights must be enforced. Any official, appointed or elected at any level of government and guilty of any violation of an individual's rights under the first ten Amendments, must be arrested, tried, and punished. The highest -- the only -- priority of public officials must be to enforce the Bill of Rights, and that's the only criterion by which they should be judged. The same &quot;Bill of Rights Enforcement&quot; policy would shut down all government activity, and nullify all laws and regulations, not specifically authorized under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.lneilsmith.com/bor_enforcement.html">www.lneilsmith.com/bor_enforcement.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So obviously you can’t repeal any of the first ten amendments.  Also, on England’s crime rate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> “In general,” asserts the Times, “crime rates in Britain are much lower than they are in the United States, a phenomenon largely attributed to the strict laws that ban handguns ... and strictly regulate who can have a gun and under what circumstances.” The statement is simply incorrect. A recent joint study by America’s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and Britain’s Cambridge University shows that crime rates are higher in Britain than the United States for robbery, assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft – in other words, all the major crimes apart from rape (where the figures on both sides of the Atlantic are notoriously unreliable) and murder. Crime rates in Britain have also grown since the study’s time period, while they have declined over here. Gun control in Britain has also become much stricter.<br>
Linking low crime rates to strict gun control therefore seems like a non-starter. The only area in which the cause and effect relationship of guns and crime seems to hold true is in the realm of murder, but even America’s non-gun murder rate is much higher than Britain’s, indicating that something else may be afoot. <br>
The BJS/Cambridge study suggests that the reason for the disparities lies in the fact that a criminal’s risk of being punished has been falling in Britain while rising in the USA. Britain is no longer the idyllically peaceful place Americans think it is. That’s one aspect of British culture that doesn’t make it onto PBS.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So you can’t make the argument that gun less England is safer than America.<br>
<br>
But what about Japan?  You think they’re safer because they don’t have guns?  No school shootings over there?<br>
<br>

Besides Columbine, how many school shootings can you think of where 8 or more people were killed?  This just goes to show you that people will kill no matter what if they’re that screwed up.  And just as easily I might add.<br>
<br>
Also I talked to my dad this evening.  He said that when you’re in the reserves you have non-military status but once you’re active duty you’re non-civilian.  He also said that the National Guard is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>subordinate to the government</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.

And as far as that stabbing thing goes...I remember that.  Not really sure how he was able to get through eight kids before they got away, but I'd imagine he was acting like he was holding them hostage (telling them that they'd live if they cooperated, then making up things and killing em).

So the constitution isn't timeless?  If we didn't have the constitution we wouldn't be America.  Basically what you're saying is that if public opinion changed tomorrow, we could alter the constitution to form a dictatorship or any other kind of government.  We wouldn't be America without the constitution and the Bill of Rights.  The constitution would have never been ratified without them.  Some people wanted more clarification of what the government could do before they signed on.  I quote<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>During the debates on the adoption of the Constitution, its opponents repeatedly charged that the Constitution as drafted would open the way to tyranny by the central government. Fresh in their minds was the memory of the British violation of civil rights before and during the Revolution. They demanded a &quot;bill of rights&quot; that would spell out the immunities of individual citizens. Several state conventions in their formal ratification of the Constitution asked for such amendments; others ratified the Constitution with the understanding that the amendments would be offered. <br>
<br>
On September 25, 1789, the First Congress of the United States therefore proposed to the state legislatures 12 amendments to the Constitution that met arguments most frequently advanced against it. The first two proposed amendments, which concerned the number of constituents for each Representative and the compensation of Congressmen, were not ratified. Articles 3 to 12, however, ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures, constitute the first 10 amendments of the Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
They aren't amendments to change the constitution like the amendment to prohibition and to end slavery.  They're a specification of the inalienable rights that all Americans have.<br>

Good point, we are the government, but we're a republic.  We elect people to represent ourselves but they can change.  Obviously it's not likely that the government is going to overpower us and take away our freedoms.  But Hitler was elected in Germany and grave injustices were done, by his soldiers, which had families as you say.<br>

I'll give you two answers because you said this after a quote I posted saying that the Bill of Rights was for all men at all times.  Of course they'd support the Bill of Rights today.  It gives the specifics of the constitution, which, as I said before, was necessary to get the constitution ratified.<br>
<br>
Now for the second one.  Do I think that they'd support the second amendment today?  Again, of course!  It's part of the Bill of Rights, the foundation of our government.  Also, people still need to protect themselves and should the government get too powerful, the people have the duty to rise up and take back their government.  Here's two quotes from the Declaration of Independence:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Something I think most people that stand behind the second amendment fail to think about is the intention behind it.  Instead they get stuck on the wording, and act like it's set in stone.  In the 1700's &amp; 1800's it was possible for groups of people with rifles to hold their own against army regulars.  The idea behind having a militia/firearms was that it could overthrow (or at least have a decent chance of doing so) an &quot;evil&quot; government.  With the technology that the government has at it's disposal, we might as well try to overthrow them with sticks and rocks. So either we should allow the average citizen access to deadlier weapons (ie armor, aircraft, nbc weapons, etc.), or we should get rid of guns since they are doing more harm than good.  And I'm sure as you've figured out, my vote goes to the second one.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So the constitution isn't timeless?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Exactly. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If we didn't have the constitution we wouldn't be America. Basically what you're saying is that if public opinion changed tomorrow, we could alter the constitution to form a dictatorship or any other kind of government. We wouldn't be America without the constitution and the Bill of Rights. The constitution would have never been ratified without them. Some people wanted more clarification of what the government could do before they signed on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't believe the point of an ammendment is clarification. I believe it to be change.  The founding fathers were not perfect, and they knew this.  They did however have the foresight to allow future generations to mold their U.S.A.  Maybe I'm going out on a limb, but I'm pretty sure that they knew that times would change (often in ways they could not foresee), and/or future generations would find ways to make things work &quot;better&quot;.<br>
<br>
Most of those points I cannot see as ever getting dated. Not that it's not possible, only that I cannot see it happening.  However this one seems very easily outdated to me.  Think if the constitution had been written a thousand years ago.  Let's say that every man had the right to a sword, a horse, and full armor.  Would you need it in this day and age?  Wouldn't you and all your buddies simply get mowed down by the first guy to step on the scene with an M-16?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But Hitler was elected in Germany and grave injustices were done, by his soldiers, which had families as you say.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
True.  However, the circumstances surrounding the creation of the Nazi party, and Hitler's rise to power were much different.  Remember that Hitler didn't suddenly manifest out of a prosperous country.  Because of WW I and the oppression being layed down by the other European nations, Germany was a wreck.  It took wheelbarrows full of marks (or whatever the currency was back then) to get a loaf of bread.  Years before Hitler invaded Poland, he was doing great things for Germany.  He completely turned the economy around and rebuilt the literal ruins that used to be cities.  Many people still left from that time say that it really was the grandest Germany had ever been.  To be quite frank, if Hitler hadn't done the whole WWII/holocaust thing everybody would likely be singing his praises to the high heavens. So there were lot's of outragous circmustances that helped him become the Hitler everyone always talks about. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bad spellers of the world, untie!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismrx>PrismRX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/19/03 4:47:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12023.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I guess I win five bucks, these thigns always degenerate into something relating to WWII. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tehpinguan1>Teh PINGUAN1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/19/03 6:00:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12023.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess I win five bucks, these thigns always degenerate into something relating to WWII.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
