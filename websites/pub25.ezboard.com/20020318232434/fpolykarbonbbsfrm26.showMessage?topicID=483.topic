It always seemed fake that way. Clean and unreal making your eyes well with tears. A sickness buried in the pit of your stomach eating its way through. Not like that. It was pure this time. I've never seen it this real. He laid there with his eyes open. Blood dripping from his half open mouth. Lifeless and stiff.<br>
     No smell to speak of yet. Perhaps the cold kept the rot from consuming his body. No flies around to perpetuate their species with maggots born from small white eggs and eating all they touch. No. That wouldn't do at all.<br>
     I wonder who he was. With his face clean shaven and his hands not soiled by the hardness of a day's work. His blonde hair falling in locks to the mud-packed earth where he lay with his silent blue eyes burning through the world. He has no cares now. Save for what awaits us all in the afterlife. Maybe its nothing. <br>
     Will his family, if he had any to speak of, be looking for him? Will they miss him? Was he a father? A husband? A brother? Was he a good one, if any of those? <br>
     I am here with him now. The last person to see him before nature takes its course. No religion there. Just decomposition. And peace. The small things we've forgotten to take notice of will come and go takeing peices of him with them. To their homes. To their children. To make use of this shell. Empty without the thoughts we all have that make us different from the animals who come by to carry off all they can.<br>

it's sounds great with an interesting balance betwen beauty and vulgarity...very strange...<br>
I actually like it quite a bit...the only problem is it sounds way to much like an interesting thought than an organised piece....<br>
it's not a bad thing to write as you think like that...but it doesn't make for a very coherent work...and thus it's awesome for rough...but is worthless for a good copy<br>

You're right this was just a think-and-type thing. When I have something thats actually going to paper I pick my words carefully. I am still working on this, making it longer and finding better words to use.<br>
<br>
By the way I think the way you critique everyone is cool. Its always helpful. Keep it up man. <p>It takes a big man to cry.

Okay, now lets get to the c&amp;c. I really liked your work overall, but like jefm said before me, it sounds like an interesting thought rather than a longer peice, not that thats a bad thing. In the short time that I was exposed to your &quot;world,&quot; I learned much about your character, and I even felt some sympathy to him after reading it. To me this peice really captures the attention of the reader once they get involved. <br>
I've read two of your works today, and i have to say, I like your style. keep it up.<br>

I was away for a while and I try and get to what I can...I didn't have time to comment but I saw this and had a quick read a while ago...then I came back and it had no comments...very strange<br>
and the length isn't really a problem....it's how it moves...if you rearange some things...maybe cut out redundancies...and fix some wordings...<br>
you can have a good piece...if you like you can lengthen it...but length makes no difference...if you have things to add go ahead...but don't do it just as filler...that detracts from the story...some pro writers need to learn that...<br>
the small problems with the story aren't really with the story...it's more in how you wrote it...the brain does silly things like that when writing...and it looks good but if you put it away and come back to it a couple days later you'll spot the little errors...that's what proofreading is....<br>

You dont know how many times I have experienced the situation of the guy in the poem in my dreams.  In one of my dreams, i remember, I stabbed someone dead, and started dragging him outside when I stopped, and the hate in my brain faded away.  Then I realized what I had done. I wondered if he could maybe wake up again, if he had family that would miss him, why i stabbed him.  Then I woke up to my relief. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=483.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=483.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=483.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=483.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm30">News, Reviews and Rumours<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
