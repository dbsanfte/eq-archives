Thanks for inviting me and making me feel welcome.  Some of you I hope to still chat with - All those that went to Kaesora that night to get keys, you guys were so much fun! Deannu, Lauralynn.Adolaf and Tettsuo and Sinya and Cheiron of course (old friends from before CDO)  <br>
Lozer, never talked to you so Amy was leader to me.  Amy, you were sweet, you did your best.<br>
<br>
CDO seemed to have a good foundation (that fell apart), even better was the people who made up the guild.  Sometimes it's best to have awesome people go separate ways with little ties here and there, rather than stick it together in a sinking ship.  <br>
<br>
Some of you will forget my name, some of you will *wave* in passing and some of you will bug the hell out of me with /tells asking for rezzes (makes an effort not to point out loveable, Rcher).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But hey, what are friends for?  <br>
<br>
If you do see me in passing, I make it a policy to always flash old guildies *wink*  Lucky you!<br>
<br>
*hugs*<br>

I am a little upset to suddenly find myself deguilded, but I respect the egotism of the creator who would rather see his work destroyed (at its height?) than to see it fall into the hands of others.  Although none of it was publicized (aside from vague innuendo), apparently there have been some serious internal problems in the guild, and perhaps, abrupt as it is, this may turn out to be the humane solution - put the guild out of its misery.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, to people who have been with CDO for years, this must have been very disheartening.<br>
<br>
Whatever the behind-the-scenes interpersonal drama that led to this pass, I will always be a /tell away - we were guildmates before, and though we will most likely go our separate ways, it is not for any love lost between us.<br>
<br>
If we were willing to help each other in the past, we will in the future, guild tag or no.  That is the best we can probably offer ourselves.<br>
<br>
I will be in channel excdo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualcinamoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alcina Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#000000>(9/3/02 10:10:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fcrimsonbrothersofeverquestfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=311.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: no surprise</span><hr size=1> I really have no idea what is going on, considering the fact that I've been on EQ and off again for almost a year now. I do know that I joined CDO about a year ago, and it had became my family and my love in the game (along with you hun). It was my family when DoD died and everyone there went their own ways. Lozer, Amy, Mackeral, Valk and serveral others were always there when I needed something, and no one will know how much it hurts to know that when I do come back again, I won't have a family to go to anymore. It hurts a lot to know that my family will no longer be there to welcome me back with open arms, but as always, I will get over this point and move on. <br>
<br>
For Amy and Lozer, if you two don't stay together, know that Alci will always be there for the both of you, and that I hope greatly that I find warm and loving welcomes and amusing fights when I get back. You two will always be on my friends list, and I hope to see you around a lot. Also, please send me an e-mail. Amy, I'd send you one, but I don't know what your address is, I'll post it once again at the end of this.<br>
<br>
For the rest of my friends in CDO, you should all know that if you ever need anything of Alci as she's wondering the world, all it takes is for you to ask. I don't know where I plan to go from here, and what steps I plan on taking, but every one of you will be in my heart as I go, and I hope you will keep me in yours as well. <br>
<br>
Good luck to everyone on their adventures.<br>

I was gone for a few days and had hoped that the guild would be &quot;back to normal&quot; when I returned, as I was eager to see where we would be headed in the coming month.  Needless to say, I'm greatly disappointed to come back and find no more CDO -- probably a good thing that I came to the boards BEFORE I logged in after getting home -- but I knew that the guild was sort of walking a fine line.<br>
<br>
Hopefully most of us can end up in another guild together, but I guess that &quot;what will be, will be&quot; and I'll just see what happens.  I figure that I still have quite a bit of EQing left in me, and want to continue seeing more of Norrath.  So if you are off adventuring and need someone of my particular talents, don't be shy.  <br>

I'm sorry to see CDO go, but if you are interested in staying together..I am starting a new guild and would love to have most of you as members..the people who are experienced and want to have fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  send me a tell in game if you interested/want more details.

Again..I am very sorry to see CDO go..it was the first guild I have been in that I really enjoyed..and I had to leave for personal reasons that are now straightened out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uamyqueenofhearts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmY queen of hearts</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#000000>(9/5/02 8:49:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fcrimsonbrothersofeverquestfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=311.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: no surprise</span><hr size=1> Hi guys.  I still cant stand to come to the boards.  Every new post makes me cry a bit more.  I loved you guys so much and you were all my family.  It really breaks my heart that we are no longer together.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know, for those of you who havent noticed, Sparr's guild chat is unlocked.  PLEASE stop by and talk to me.  This here is all so public and I know there are some of us who would prefer to talk to FAMILY and not the gerneral population.  LOL CDO is even more popular now that we are gone.  <br>
<br>
Anyway.  I am keeping in touch with all of you as much as I can.  So please dont forget me, I wont you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
