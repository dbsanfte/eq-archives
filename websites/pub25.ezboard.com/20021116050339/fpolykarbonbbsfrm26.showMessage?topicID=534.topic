<br>
Chapter 0<br>
<br>
Evan Teadows sat in Willie's Bar and Grill and sulked. Another bad day, so he decided to get wasted. Evan was a young man, in his prime, as some would say if they looked at him. He looked fine and satisfied with his life. Of course, it was exactly the opposite inside, if it wasn't there wouldn't be much conflict inside himself. He had dark brown hair that was pushed back, mostly because he was stressed. He was skinny, stood at about 5,7, and had pale skin. His gray eyes scanned the bar and all the patrons, dark shadows were under them. He hadn't slept more than four hours in the last two days. <br>
<br>
Evan worked at a hotel for room service. Casta Del Whe' was the name, Evan had no idea what in the world it meant. They were pushing him, he had no days off that week, but thank heaven it was Monday and his first day off. He hadn't been there long, a month and a half, but he hated it. This day was especially horrible; some tubby guest spat in his face for getting the wrong wine, then left a horribly small tip. He could remember it clearly, the chubby mans' fat face in his, &quot;You better get the right champagne! I asked for Zinfandel stupid! Not Chardinay (sorry for the mispelling).&quot; Evan wanted to correct his confusion with champagne and wine but didn't.<br>
<br>
John Cook sat in the cold and dark alleyway of Earl Street. His back propped up against a dumpster. He wasn't having the best of days. He had just got pick-pocketed by a sneaky thief. It was rather ironic, a thief stealing from a homeless man. Pathetic. Anyone could tell John wasn't the richest guy in town. He wore raggedy clothes he found over time. The shirt and pants were his of course. But he found boots that were a few sizes to big for him and a trench coat left on a park bench. He also owned a aviation hat and pilot goggles from one of his grandfathers. He wasn't sure which. <br>
<br>
&quot;What to do? What to do?&quot; John tiredly asked himself in a whispering voice. He soon was lulled to sleep by his boredom. <br>
<br>
The back of Evans' head made a loud noise as hit hit the tiles on the bathroom floor. His attacker was in very strange clothing. A cloak and a hood to cover his face. <br>
That's all he noticed before he hit him. Evan was too smashed to even have a chance. The attacker bent over Evans dazed body and uttered a small sentence in his ear, &quot;Where's the disk?&quot; <br>
<br>
Several weeks before this happened to the man named Evan Teadows, Nathan Freeman sat in his car, which was parked right across the street from Willies' Bar and Grill. Never been caught, not even close. He flicked his ciggarette out the window onto the cold sidewalk and sighed. It was a full moon, about time too, Nathan liked full moons. They were one of the beautiful things in the world. Nathan was a rather small man, 5,5 and very skinny. He had dark tanned skin that was mostly covered by his dark blond hair. His hair reached down to his chin and covered most of his face just so he could see. A freak, some could say when they looked at him, but he was also a 'master' thief.  It was a cold night and he sat in his warm car with a leather trenchcoat in the passenger seat. An old fashioned cloak and hood was in the back seat. His car was an old fashioned one, black. He'd grown attached to it. Then he saw it, something he knew would get him a fortune. An armored truck rolled by across the street from him, pretty slowly. Nathan Freeman smiled and stepped out of his car.<br>
<br>
Norman Peterman couldn't move. They were treating him like a cannibal, it was insane. A police officer rolled the hand truck he was strapped to down the hallway. If it was just the straps, he could escape. But They also put him in an ugly strait jacket. Five straps that were built onto the handtruck were fastened three spots on his legs, and two on his upper body. Jeez, it wasn't like he was a disgusting cannibal, They even put a hockey mask on his face. Now he was really Jason. At least he could move his eyes, he was surprised They didn't put eye restraints since they thought he was so dangerous. Norman looked around in the holes of the hockey mask and saw more police officers and the Warden. Professor Goeman is what he wanted the prisoners to call him. Norman knew his rather embarrasing first name; Skye. It sounded rather feminine. But it wasn't time to mock him, he decided it was time to get out. &quot;Peterman, you're gettin' yer' own special room with a single cell just for you.&quot; The Warden said, as if this was exciting news.<br>
&quot;I'm jumping for joy, Skye.&quot; Goeman glared at him and Norman smiled. The cell was bigger, Norman was impressed he got a table and some pens and paper to write with. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> These people aren't too smart now, are they?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Back at Willie's Evan was confused, &quot;Disk?&quot; He could see more clearly, the man was normal size and weight. he wore all black and talked in a hoarse voice, &quot;You know what I'm talking about. Now give it to me!&quot; Evan sat up and pressed his back against the wall, &quot;What?&quot; <br>

it's hard to make the transition between events. A prologue isn't supposed to have so many different events, maybe you should keep some for chapter one, like the attack on Evan. it would be better to know what happened a few minutes before he gets hit. <br>

Chapter One<br>
<br>
<br>
Evan felt the rumbling in his stomach, it felt awkward in his throat. He and everyone who’s ever had one too many drinks knows the feeling. He got off his barstool and dashed for the bathroom, hands over his closed mouth. The vomit was slowly coming up. He pushed the Mens’ door open and frantically looked around. He knew where the stalls were, but looking around gave the moment something, a dramatic touch. He stepped in the middle stall and closed the door and locked it behind him. Then he got on his knees, bent his head over the toilet bowl and closed his eyes. The vomit forcefully came out, Evan didn’t make much noise but the puke splashing everywhere in the bowl did. It stopped, a string of gooey saliva hung from his mouth, he could smell the mix of puke and beer. Evan heard the bathroom door open and close and footsteps. He quickly wiped his mouth as the footsteps stopped and unlocked the stall door. The person who just walked in was the attacker. Evan now sat against the wall of the bathroom, a slight patch of blood on the back of his head, and bad breath. The man didn’t take money or anything, he just wanted a disk… Whatever, Evan decided he should leave after absolutely no reconsidering.<br>
<br>
Nathan Freeman was happy with what he did, he was satisfied. To him, satisfaction was the treasure in life. Theivery was his key to the treasure. Whatever was in the armored car ahead of Nathans’ a few weeks before now was sure to be satisfying. The armored car turned left a block ahead of where Nathan was first parked. Nathan followed suit. He didn’t want the people in the car to be too suspicious so when they took a right he went straight. He would meet up with the car up the road, if they didn’t turn before that. Nathan took the next right and waited at the end of the street, he saw the car coming his way, excellent. So good so far. Nathan played this little game until the armored car slowed in front of a rather big building. Cashman Bank, Nathan had only been here once before. It was one of his bank robbery jobs, since he was a novice he was nervous and only got a few hundreds. He parked his car a little ways down the street and grabbed his cloak and hood from the backseat. He also grabbed a combat knife in a holder and clipped it on his belt.<br>
<br>
John Cook was awakened by something that landed in his lap. His neck was sore, as usual, his eyes slowly and heavily opened. He glanced around the alley dazed, and looked into his lap. “Woah!” This really put the term, ‘lap of luxury’ into good use. In Johns’ lap was a bundle of money, strapped together with a rubber band. He gawked at the prize, it must has been half a foot thick. Someone had to have dropped it from the roof, he looked up but saw nobody. Then he shakily picked the bundle up and fingered through it, They were all tens. But at the end was a small piece of paper that read, ‘For more, come to the library steps, now.’<br>
<br>
The delicate hand that held the pen lazily drifted across the big pad of paper. Norman Peterman kept his face to the drawing, but his eyes darted everywhere. To the cot, which had thick and hot gray blankets, then to the camera, which was out of the cell, watching him. &lt;i&gt;Thank heavens for long sleeves.&lt;/i&gt; He finished up the drawing, it was a mountain, and lifted his arm to put the pen in the holder. His hand bumped the holder making it fall off the desk. Norman quickly got up and walked around the desk to the opposite side, then bent down, back facing the cameras’ steady gaze, to pick them up. Norman put all of the pens but one back in the holder, with this one he pushed it up his sleeve far enough so it was out of sight. Norman looked at the clock on the wall opposite of the cell and saw it was late. He set the penholder upon the desk and got under the covers of his cot.<br>
<br>
At the same time Nathan was planning this armored car robbery, Sam Biggins sat in the passenger seat of the family car. A white jeep, several years old, Sam felt most comfortable in the passenger seat in the front. His parents were inside the hotel, checking out. Sam was eleven, turning twelve tomorrow, he was rather small for his age. He weighed sixty-five pounds, he didn’t know how short he was, shorter than everyone in his class was, he knew. It was the second week of summer vacation. Sam drew a picture of a mountain, or at least tried, you couldn’t blame him for giving it the old college try. <br>
<br>
John walked along Crescent Road with a slight charming look on his face. He couldn’t wait to get more, that was how Greed did its job, but he had to wonder if it was some sort of trick. He turned left and saw the library steps ahead. This was twenty minutes after Evan was attacked. John cautiously stepped down the street and was aghast to find nobody around. “I knew it. I shouldn’t have come here.” But something interrupted his next sentence, “You want the money?” It was a man, John turned around and saw clothes as strange as his own, a cloak with a hood that covered the persons’ face. John stepped back and slowly nodded, “Y…Yes.” The man held up a bundle of bills, one hundreds this time, “I have more in my car, now give me the disk. It’s rightfully mine.” John was confused, “What disk? A computer disk?” The man nodded and almost yelled, “You know what I’m talking about.” When John shook his head the cloaked man put the money back in his pocket and snickered, “You have it…” With those words the man sprung forward and grabbed the collar of Johns’ trenchcoat. “I don’t… Let me go you crazy-“ John couldn’t finish his sentence, for he was pushed on the ground. Before he could get up he felt a hard boot in his side; it hit inbetween his middle ribs. That was all that was needed to weaken John, he was very weak already, and he needn’t get too roughed up. The man felt in Johns’ pockets and pantlegs, everything and cursed when he didn’t find what he wanted.<br>
<br>
Evan took off his coat when he got home to his apartment. He was tired and achy, the vomiting and the hit on his head actually sobered him up a little. He took a shower and fell right asleep. He would never go to Willies’ bathroom again. <br>
<br>
Still several weeks before all of this. Nathan had the cloak and hood over his face as he walked slowly up the street to the bank. He snapped black gloves on as he walked. He stepped rather quickly; windows on an armored car don’t break easily. The passenger door opened and an officer stepped out and looked around. The driver door opened and another officer stepped out. The passenger officer called, “I’m going to go on ahead, Jim. I got some of the money, you gonna be okay checking out here?” The officer named Jim answered, “Yeah, I got it. Go on ahead. I figured we should go to take the armored car to Green Wing.” Green Wing was another bank nearby. The passenger officer went towards the bank with a large bag of money. Jim kept the door open and went back inside the armored car. Nathan stepped quietly towards the car, but stopped when Jim closed the door. The passenger officer just stepped into the bank. Nathan took a deep breath, took off his cloak and tossed it on the ground, and stepped past the armored car. He looked at his wristwatch, good, it wasn’t closing time yet. The cop and Nathan were roughly the same size, they had the same type of hair also. Nathan walked through the big double doors, and started to go into the second set of smaller doors but stopped. The space between the lobby of the bank and outside was dark, if someone crouched up against the wall it would be hard to see them, unless you were really looking. Nathan looked through the small doors window and saw the police officer talking to what Nathan guessed was the manager of the bank. The manager smiled and shook the police officers hand, the officer turned and started toward the entrance door. Nathan held his breath and crouched against the sidewall, just as the door opened. The officer closed the door behind him , he held the empty money bag, Nathan took his chance. He covered the officers’ mouth with one of his hands and grabbed the combat knife out of the holster with the other.<br>
<br>
John woke up a few hours later, on the sidewalk in front of the library, a few moments after his attacker left he passed out. He sat up slowly and groggily and looked around, he saw the bundle of money, the man didn’t take it. John stuffed it into his coat pocket. There were a few things he had to buy to stash somewhere, then he’d go to his favorite place. John went the EZ Mart closeby and bought the bare essentials, lunch meat, a bottle of water, some bread, a deli sandwich. He stuffed them in his pocket. Then he stopped at the alley he was sleeping in before, there was a small grate in the wall near the floor with a cardboard box in it. John pulled the grate off and opened the box. Inside was a cigar, a pickle jar with a few quarters in it, and a photograph. The photograph showed a small boy, about eight years old, smiling at the camera. Behind the boy was a building. John smiled at the picture before putting the other things in the box. He put the lid on the box and set the grate over the hole. John then went to his ‘favorite’ place; Willies’ Bar and Grill. It was his favorite mostly because of the friendly bartender, Mack. <br>
<br>
Evan opened his eyes, he sighed when he saw it was still night. He was already sobered up, he didn’t seem to have a hangover either, how lucky.  He sat up in his bed and looked at the alarm clock. 1:20 AM. That’s it, he kept waking up like this, he decided to take a walk. As soon as he sat up the phone rang. He cursed under his breath and answered it, “H…Hello?” The voice was very familiar, cheery, something Evan rarely experienced. <br>
“Hi! Is this Evan?” Ira Emitenicham, a happy woman, two years younger than Evan, she looked and acted like she was even younger. Very long last name…<br>
“Oh, hi Ira. What’s up?” Evan rubbed the sleep from his eyes and got up from bed.<br>
“Nothing, I was just wonderin’, you wanna go out somewhere?” They never went ‘out’, as in a date, they were strictly friends. Evan joked about it though.<br>
“Are you asking me on a date?”<br>
“Noooo! Well, do you?”<br>
“Isn’t it pretty late? Or do you never sleep?”<br>
“Wha!? The night is young, friend. C’mon.” Evan smiled and turned the light on in his bedroom.<br>
“Sure, where should we meet?” Evan walked into the kitchen, he had a cordless phone.<br>
“Well duh! The Hole in the Wall.” Evan opened the refrigerator.<br>
“Willies? I just came from there, I got jumped.”<br>
“What? Really? Are you joking?”<br>
“Nope, it was some guy in a cloak, he was looking for a disk.”<br>
“How much did he take?”<br>
“None at all, it was weird.”<br>
“Oh… Well, I’ll protect you from dark strangers. Wussy boy.”<br>
“I was drunk, I would have roughed him up if I wasn’t.”<br>
“Yeah, yeah. Well, meet me there.”<br>
“ Wait, do you want me to take my car?”<br>
“No, walkings better for drunk people. It reduces the risk of an accident.” She snickered and they said goodbye.<br>
<br>
The security watched the monitors that showed the most dangerous criminals. There were two guards to watch the monitors. Each worked for about 12 hours each, at 12 midnight they switched, both waited in the lounge to drink their’ coffee for about seven minutes. Nobody would escape in seven minutes, or so it was suspected. Norman knew all of this from overhearing the new security guard and a police officer outside the door. Norman had excellent hearing. In the middle of the night as he lay in his cot, he held the pen under the blanket and thought with his eyes closed. The officer that walked in every now and then to give him food counted the pens in the hold each time he came in, just in case Norman decided to take one. Norman slowly unscrewed the pen from the middle, so slowly that you wouldn’t be able to tell that he was fidgeting at all. He found the inside of the pen, which was a thin tube with the ball tip at the end, inside the transparent tube was a coil which made the tip go up and down when you pressed the button at the end. Norman took the inside part of the pen and stuck it up his orange prison sleeve, then screwed the outside back together. He stretched and opened his eyes, just to look at the clock. 12:00 midnight, right on the dot. Norman waited until 12:01 and quickly got out of bed. He walked to the desk and put the outside of the pen in the holder, tip down so the guard wouldn’t see that it had no point. Norman didn’t want to take the risk to try escaping now, he would do it tomorrow. Norman sat up in his bed for a few minutes and went to sleep at 12: 06 midnight.<br>
<br>
Sam was getting worried, his parents had been in the hotel for ten minutes now. <br>
“I’ll wait a while longer, they’re probably signing up for some sweepstakes or something.” Sam spoke out in the car then tossed his drawing of the mountain in the backseat. He waited for several more minutes and opened the jeep door. Then he heard it, a rapid noise, like a very loud drum being repeadedly beat on. His heart beat wildly with the noise. It paused, and started up again. What was happening?<br>
<br>
Nathan thought as quickly as possible, if he slashed the officer, it would get blood all over the outfit. He had an idea, it would be rather crazy, but it would work. Nathan undid the officers’ shirt in a quick manner, like a bird pecking at worms. He took the shirt off, under it was a white tank top with his knife hand. The officer reached for his gun but Nathan kicked him in the back of the knee, making him crouch. He tightened his grip on the officers mouth then pulled his head so he looked at the ceiling. Then, in a very clean manner, he drove the blade into the mans’ neck and across it. He had to be quick, Nathan layed the dead officer down near the corner of the sidewall and undid the mans’ pants. “This is making me sick…” He whispered as he saw striped boxer shorts when he pulled the pants off. Nathan then proceeded to take the mans’ shoes, then the belt with the gun holster. Nathan took his trenchcoat off and stuffed it in the moneybag, he buttoned the cops shirt over his, then polished the badge. He pulled the officers’ pants over his own, they fit almost perfect, and then he took his belt off and put it in the bag along with the knife and holster. Blood was forming on the floor. He took his boots off and tossed them in the bag. Then put the officers shoes on, a little big, but not too bad. He took a few breaths, grabbed the moneybag, and stepped out into the night air.<br>

And in that sleep of death what dreams may come. When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us a pause.<br>

John Cook ordered a drink from Mack, the place was dead, and nobody was there. The only lights were above the bar, they were like spotlights, it made the rest of the place dark. <br>
“Mack, you don’t know what it’s like.” Mack was cleaning a glass behind the bar.<br>
“What what’s like?”<br>
“Making a few mistakes, and living in regret.” John shook his head and gulped down some of the vodka.<br>
“Where’d you get the money?” Mack asked curiously, maybe trying to change Johns mind.<br>
“It’s a long story.” The bar door opened, and in stepped two younger people. A man and a woman. Maybe ten years younger than himself. The girl talked loudly and cheerfully, while the man was slightly quieter. John smiled; it was tender age in bloom was what it was. Thinking about just made him sadder, so he ordered a refill. <br>
<br>
Ira Emitenicham was young and fair looking. It was hard to say if she was pretty, she wasn’t close to ugly. It was confusing. She had blond straight hair that went down about half a foot below her shoulders. She wore braces that were visible, a slight green color is what she had on them. She had blue eyes that were very light but very… Strange. She didn’t have much opinion about herself. She was happy that Evan decided to go to Willies with her this late. She was getting lonely living alone in that god-forsaken house of hers.<br>
“So, a guy beat you up in a bathroom and he said he was looking for a disk?” Ira asked. Evan nodded and shrugged.<br>
“A computer disk?” <br>
“I don’t know.”<br>
“Hey Mack. We’d like… Um… Just a few beers, whatever you got.”<br>
Mack remembered Evan, <br>
“Back already?”<br>
Evan smiled.<br>
“I’m back for the hair of the dog that bit me.” <br>
Mack laughed and gave them the drinks. Ira sighed happily, Evan obviously heard it because he commented.<br>
“Are you a bimbo?” He asked.<br>
“What!? Who said that?”<br>
“Nobody, you are just so happy all the time.”<br>
Ira rolled her eyes, he didn’t know a thing.<br>
“I’m just grateful.”<br>
“Well, I’m envious.”<br>
They drank their drinks as Mack read the week befores’ newspaper. Ira noticed a rough looking guy on the other side of the bar. He wore very strange clothing, she giggled to Evan,<br>
“Look at that guy.” Evan saw him and replied,<br>
“He must be a hobo.”<br>
Mack called out from behind the newspaper, <br>
“Oh my god! That armored car that was missing was found next to an abandon highway. The money was missing, so was a computer disk-“ He was cut off by Evan and the scraggly man.<br>
“Disk?” <br>
Ira looked at the hobo and back to Evan, then back to the hobo. <br>
“Did you get attacked by a cloaked guy?” She asked.<br>
“Yeah, he wanted a disk, and I said I didn’t know what he was talking about. So he roughed me up, didn’t take nothin’.”<br>
Mack read out loud again.<br>
“What’s inside the disk is confidential, there was 100,000 dollars worth of money stolen. At the scene was one dead police officer, he was shot. In the passenger seat were police clothes. The dead police corpse at Cashman Bank is the one who was supposed to be with the dead officer in the car. Both death causes are expected to be done by the same person; there were absolutely no clues to who the killer and thief might be. Officials say that if this person gets access to what is on the disk, havoc will wreak.” There was a bated silence for a few moments. The scraggly man at the bar said out loud,<br>
“Someone else wants that disk, and it aint no cop. Cops don’t do that.” <br>
Evan nodded,<br>
“That’s for sure.”<br>
“Let’s get out of here.” Ira suggested, they went outside, it was getting chilly.<br>
“Where do you want to go?” Evan asked. Ira thought for a few moments and shrugged,<br>
“I don’t care, let’s go back to your place.” They did, and though they didn’t show it before, they were exhausted. Ira slept in Evans’ bed and Evan on the couch in the living room.<br>
<br>
A few moments after the two younger kids left, John went back the alleyway. He opened the grate and fit his body inside it. It wasn’t that dirty under the building, John had spread some blankets all over. He had a candle on a paint can with a single match next to it. John was grateful he was so skinny so he could fit in the hole. He put the grate back where it was, lit the match and the candle. He opened the ‘storage box’ and grabbed a few pieces of bread and put the rest of his money in the box, he still had quite a lot more bills. He ate the pieces of bread slowly and savored them each. When he was done he put out the candle, put the lid on the box and layed down in the shadows, on a dirty blanket, he was lulled to sleep by a bird chirping far off.<br>
<br>
About a week after his heist on the armored car, which went great, Nathan Freeman sat on his couch in his apartment. He put out his cigarette butte and sighed happily. He was still very happy about the huge success of the robbery. His prize was the best anyone could wish for. 100,000 dollars, and a floppy disk. The disk was the best part, when he first got home he immediately popped it in his computer. What came up on the screen made his eyes light up with excitement. But before he put it in he had to get it out of a steel box that was sealed shut. He cut it open with several seconds with his chainsaw on it. But what was on the disk amazed him. Codes, thousands, no, millions of them. At first he didn’t know what they were, but he figured it out. Government codes, top secret information about military weapons, status on most wanted people, and the best part, codes for the programming of those weapons. There was more, much more. He could do things you couldn’t imagine with this, he could almost control the USA, maybe the world! Some people wouldn’t see how, but a clever person like Nathan could see the possibilities, he didn’t know where to start. But when he came home from a ride around town, the disk was gone. It wasn’t in his computer, it wasn’t anywhere. He didn’t know who to look for, or where. But somehow, the disk installed information on his computer, it had several peoples’ names on it. It showed that they were looking for the disk with that information for years, it ranged from the age of 11 to 60 years old. Nathan smiled and decided to start with the first on the list, a young man by the name of Evan Teadows.<br>
<br>
Sam cried out in fright when he saw the glass in the hotel lobbys’ window shatter. He ducked down and could clearly hear what the drumming noise was: Gunfire. Sam locked the car doors and crawled into the backseat. He layed on the floor in the back and covered himself with a sheet that he used when taking a nap on the way to the hotel. He breathed heavily and winced when gunshots fired. He stayed in that position for hours, but when the gunshots stopped, he was asleep from sheer exhaustion, it was late, and his parents hadn’t come yet.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Norman awoke early and did his morning exercises. He sat at the desk, doing nothing until it was breakfast. He made sure that the tube was slid far up his sleeve. Harris, a security guard, came in with a tray of bacon and eggs and orange juice. He set it on the desk outside of the cell and said, “Good morning Norman. You’re up early, as usual. Regular procedure.” Norman nodded and smiled charmingly, he went up to the cell bars and turned his back to them. He sat down and slid his arms between the bars so they were behind him. Norman breathed normally as the handcuffs snapped around his wrists. Harris checked Normans’ hands to see if he had anything. “Here comes the food. Hungry, Norman?” Harris asked, Norman smiled, “Yes, quite hungry.” Harris laughed and grabbed his key ring from his belt, picked a key out, and unlocked the cell. He then put the ring on his belt and brought the tray in and set it on the drawing desk. Harris counted the pens, “One, two, three, four. Good. Well, See you at lunch, Norman.” Harris said as he locked the cell door. He unlocked Normans’ handcuffs and took them away.<br>
<br>
Evan woke up at eleven o’ clock the next morning. He rubbed his eyes and stretched, sat up, and went to the bathroom. He went to see if Ira was awake, she wasn’t. Evan crouched and dived up on the bed, making it bounce, Ira sat up with a snap, <br>
“I’m up!” Evan sat on the bed next to her,<br>
“Good morning.”<br>
“No.”<br>
“What?”<br>
“There were twelve marhsmellows. Then the carrot came.”<br>
“Wake up!” Evan yelled and Ira rubbed her eyes. <br>
“What time is it?” She asked.<br>
“About eleven.”<br>
<br>
Sams’ eyes opened with a snap, he smelt leather, and he heard people talking. He saw a brown leathery cushion a few inches in front of his face; it was a couch. The voices were clearer, <br>
“So, do you know the kids’ name yet?” The first voice asked.<br>
“No.” A second voice answered.<br>
“Should we wake him up and ask?”<br>
“Let’s let him sleep for a few more minutes.”<br>
He had a blanket over him. Sam tried to remember what happened, then a sinking feeling in his stomach came, and he sat up and looked around, two men in police outfits were at the door. One had a clipboard. The room looked like a waiting room. There was a water fountain on one side, a cofee table with magazines on it near the couch and the door. The men looked over and saw him up. One of them said in a cheerful tone, <br>
“Hey, sport! You’re up!” Sport? Sam didn’t like this guy too much already. The other officer rolled his eyes and walked out. Sam looked down at his clothes; they were the same as when he heard the noises. He blinked and asked, <br>
“Where are my parents?” The officer seemed to ignore him.<br>
“We’re going to need you to answer some questions for us.”<br>
“Where are my parents?”<br>
“Please answer honestly.” (is this a trial?)<br>
“Sir,”<br>
“Okay, now what is your full name.”<br>
“Sam John Biggins, now where is my mom and dad?” The officer flipped through some papers on his clipboard and looked up.<br>
“Now how old are you?” (interrogation? what happened?)<br>
“Eleven… Or twelve, what day is it?” The officer told him, it was the day after the noises, and he was twelve.<br>
“I’m twelve, where are my parents? Are they okay?”<br>
“Were you at the Gosfard Hotel &amp; Suites last night?”<br>
“Yes.” (might as well cooperate, darn idiot.)<br>
“Did you have parents with you?” (no, I’m just asking about parents I don’t have, moron.)<br>
“Yeah.” Sam sighed impatiently, “Can you tell me where they are?”<br>
“Did you witness anything?”<br>
“I heard gunshots, then the front window broke, then I ducked down under some covers in the jeep.”<br>
“What jeep?”<br>
“The family jeep.” (duh)<br>
“Now can you tell me your name again?”<br>
“Sam John Biggins.”<br>
The officer glanced through the clipboard and frowned.<br>
“Are your’ parents named Natalie Biggins and Forrest Biggins?”<br>
Oh no, Sam frowned also, he prayed nothing bad happened.<br>
“Yes.”<br>
The officer looked down at the ground and sighed (oh my god) and put his free hand over his face.<br>
“Sam… Your mother and father (please no no no!) were in the hotel when an armed madman shot in the lobby. Only a few people got out, the man didn’t do it for a reason (who cares why he did it! please oh please don’t let it be what I think.), but out of the bodies we found (……..).” The officer paused and closed his eyes, “Your’ parents were two of them (nononononoNONONONONONO! never never!).” Sam stared blankly ahead,<br>
“What?” (lying he’s lying is what it is, a lie a lie a lie! a joke!)<br>
“Your parents’ were murdered.” (YOU LIE YOU SCUM! YOU HORRIBLE, NASTY INSIFNIFIGANT PIECE OF MUD!)<br>
“No… You are lying…” Sam grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and opened it.<br>
“Sam, I’m sorry.”<br>
“You are a liar!” Sam closed the magazine and threw it across the room. “Where are they?”<br>
“In the… Morgue.”<br>
“QUIT LYING (ITS YOUR FAULT ALL YOUR FAULT)! JUST STOP IT! (I’M NOT COMIN’ BACK COMING BACK COMIN’ BACK!)”<br>
Sam threw the covers off of him and stood up, his shoes were gone. He ran around the coffee table and saw his shoes, he picked them up and ran out of the room. A few dozen people in doctor clothes rushed around, some had people following them, some were pushing a stretcher. Sam heard the door open behind him and the cheery bastards’ voice, <br>
“Sam, get back in here.”<br>
Sam broke into a dash, he dodged around the doctors and saw a desk with a black woman behind it, <br>
“Can I help you, son?” She asked in a calm voice.<br>
“Where’s the mourge?” Sam answered, Cheerful was coming his way.<br>
“Why?”<br>
“I have a friend seeing someone there.”<br>
“Down this hall,” She pointed to her left, “The third door on the right.”<br>
Cheerful was coming up, Sam went down the hallway and counted doors on the right side. He pushed the third door open and slammed it behind him, the glass on the window of it shook. Sam turned and locked it and looked around, it was a very dark room, Cheerful banged on the door,<br>
“Come on Sam! Just come out!”<br>
The only light came from spotlights that flashed on the ‘slabs’ as some people call it. Bodies were covered with blankets. (i’m not gonna find them here, just strangers.) Sam turned and closed the blinds on the window of the door that Cheerful and some doctors banged on. He turned around and lowered the blinds on the door. Then he walked around the dark room, examining the names near the covered corpses (covered corpses corpses covered hee heee hee.) and took a shaky breath when he saw Forrest Biggins near a covered body. The banging was becoming harder. Sam walked closer to (it’s not him, a mix up. A mistake.) to the body and raised his hand above the head. He saw some blood marks on the chest area, his eyes were watering. He lightly grabbed hold of the covers on the face and brought it down to about the collar bone area. <br>
“Dad… I’m sorry… I’m sorry we could never talk… I mean, talk the way I do with my mom. I love you.” Sam bent down and hugged his father, then put the covers over his face. The racket was hurting Sam’s ears, “Quit banging!” He said it so loud that it actually did stop. Cheerfuls voice came,<br>
“Sam, unlock the door Sam, we want to help.” Sam looked at the body next to Dads’ and read the name, Natalie Biggins. He saw blood marks around the same area as his dads’. Sam stared blankly at the sheet for several moments before he pulled the cover down to moms’ collarbone also. Her face was beautiful, Sam wiped his wet eyes. <br>
“Mom, I am so sorry. We could have been more of a real family, but I ruined it. You know, you like the Sleeping Beauty; do you remember that movie? I always wanted to watch it again and again.” He laughed a little and wiped his eyes. “Well, I wish that if I kissed you, you would wake up, but that won’t happen. Listen to me talking to a lifeless abode of organs and stuff. I know you’re not here, and I know that you are probably happy, up there in Summerland, or Heaven, or whatever it is. Do you guys promise to give me a tour when I get up there? O… Okay.” His tears were flowing a little more, he bent down and kissed his mom, on the cheek. The banging had started again, Sam heard a cop say,<br>
“The door is very tight, were gonna need to break it down.” A few moments later the glass shattered and the blinds swayed, the top part of a fire axe was sticking out of the window. The blinds went up, revealing Cheerfuls’ face, <br>
“Come on, Sam, this is crazy. Climb out this window and we’ll figure something out.”<br>
Sam absentmindedly reached into his pocket and pulled something out, it was a hat, it went over Sams’ head, with a patch on the front saying CABIN, and on the bottom was fluffy white stuff. Sam put it on and said to Cheerful in a demanding tone, “I want both of my parents cremated so they won’t keep going back to the body to see it, I want it within three days from now, Understand?” Cheerfuls’ expression was blank,<br>
“O…Okay, whatever you want, just unlock the door. I can’t reach it.” Sam looked around the room and smiled through his blotchy face at a window with shades over it. He opened the shades, light poured into the room, but before he left, he had one more thing to do.<br>
<br>
About two weeks after this, some trashcans tipping over awakened John. He opened his eyes quickly. He peeked through the grate and saw a pear of small sneakers poking from the mess of trashcans. He also saw someone running around the corner. The sneakers moved, John opened the grate and climbed out,<br>
“Is someone there?” He asked with caution, his heart was beating. A young voice answered,<br>
“Yeah…” There was some shuffling, the sneakers disappeared and the trashcans moved. To Johns’ tired surprise, and half expectation, the person who wore the sneakers was a young boy, about ten or eleven,<br>
“Hi.” The boy said shyly, he wore a dirty, ocean blue T-shirt with a big brown jacket over it. His pants were black and dirty also. He also had a strange hat, it looked somewhat Russian. The hat had a patch on the front that read CABIN. John was curious,<br>
“What happened?” The boy looked behind him and back to John,<br>
“Some guy with a black cape and hood stopped me some ways down the street. He asked about some sort of disk. I said I didn’t-“<br>
John interrupted him,<br>
“Wait! He asked for a disk?” The boy nodded. “And he was dressed like some kind of Batman?” The boy nodded again. “Well I’ll be damned. What’s yer’ name?”<br>
The kid answered, “Sam… Why?” John said to himself,<br>
“Let’s see here. Last night a bundle of money literally fell on my lap, I went to the location a piece of paper told me to to get more. Then a man in a dark cloak and hood attacked me because I didn’t have a certain ‘disk’ he wanted. I went to a bar that night and the bartender read a news article.” John told what the article said and continued, <br>
“Another man in that bar was attacked for a disk he didn’t have the same night. Now, the next morning, you get attacked for the same reason.” Sam stopped him,<br>
“Who said I was attacked?”<br>
“You were, weren’t you?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“This guy must really want that disk.”<br>
“Well duh!”<br>
“Wha?” Did this kid know something?<br>
“It has government codes on it.”<br>
“How ya’ figure?”<br>
“Why else would a guy look for it so desperately? There are even people who dedicate their’ lives to search for it. Now that this cloaked guy heard that it’s not under security, it would be easier to get. You think they’re gonna ship a video game in an armored car?”<br>
This kid wasn’t stupid; that was for sure.<br>
“How old are you anyways?”<br>
“Twelve.”<br>
“Where are your’ parents?”<br>
“In Summerland.”<br>
“Summerland?”<br>
“They’re dead. Summerland is another name for Heaven.”<br>
“Oh… Sorry.”<br>
“What’s your’ name?<br>
“John.”<br>
<br>
“Dammit! The kid didn’t have it either. Who’s next? Norman Peterman, status? Currently jailed? What’s this? How can he possibly have it? Next, Mack Gar. Good, I know exactly where he should be.”<br>
<br>
“Okay, it says here, attach Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair Roller Coaster Car on the tracks, but where on the tracks?” Evan asked as he looked at the picture on the instruction manual. Ira set the Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair Ferris Wheel to the side and tried attaching the Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair Roller Coaster Car to the tracks, which she finished earlier, <br>
“How the heck do you do this?” Evan shook his head<br>
“Disgusting, how is a 6 to 9 year old going to do this if we can’t? Ooh, look, they have a phone number.”<br>
“A phone number for a toy?” Ira replied, Evan laughed as he picked up the work phone. Ira worked for a small toy store in town, since the place wasn’t too famous, Evan and her played with most of the new ones they got. Someone answered, a lady.<br>
“Gracias, et tu at Fun Filly Fubste’ Family Fair play set.” The lady greeted.<br>
“Um… Hi, I wanted to ask about a part on the Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair.”<br>
“Juavos?”<br>
“What? No, it’s the Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair Roller Coaster Car, I can’t get it on the tracks.”<br>
“Oooooh, Kenikwa?”<br>
“Uh… You no hablo… Um….English?” <br>
“Abikawata! Konichiwa!” <br>
“Are you speaking a real language?”<br>
“Kapa!” <br>
“Poopie head.”<br>
“Kaa?”<br>
“Ka ka! Dookie.”<br>
The lady answered, her tone was different.<br>
“Hey man, have some respect.”<br>
“So you speak English?”<br>
Nobody answered, it was silence. “Hello?”<br>
Evan heard a snap and looked over to Ira, the Fun Filly Fubster Family Fair Roller Coaster Car (phew.) had broken. Ira threw it up in the air,<br>
“Ahh, screw it, nobody likes that stuff anyways.”<br>
“The phone’s dead… That or that lady hung up on me.”<br>
“Oh well, it’s my lunch break, let’s go see Mack.”<br>
Willies’ was only a few buildings away. Evan took a deep breath when he got inside, following Ira. It was dead, just like last night, but where was Mack? Ira called out,<br>
“Mack?” Mack answered from somewhere,<br>
“H…Hey, Ira… I’m behind the bar.”<br>
“Where?”<br>
“Down… Down here.” Ira bent over the bar and gasped, <br>
“Omigosh! What happened!?”<br>
Evan looked over the bar also, Mack was sitting on the ground, in his work clothes, he had bruises on his face, a cut on his eyebrow dripped blood.<br>
“Oh man.”<br>
<br>
“Dammit…” Norman whispered to himself, his plan with the pen wouldn’t work. His plan had been that when 12 midnight came, he would scream for help, when a guard came in, he would stab him with the tube, the ink would surely leak in and kill him. Then take the keys to the cell, but then he would have to get passed some of the hall guards, which would be easy, but that left the guard at the front desk. He would see him through one of the monitor and call the alarm. Police from other squadrons would be on him in no time. His other plan was to try and unlock the cell with a part from the pen; the lock was too big. Norman tapped his fingers on the drawing desk. Suddenly, he smiled, a plan. He could still use the pen tube. <br>
<br>
Nathan sighed, why didn’t any of these people have it? Then it hit him, Nathan hadn’t checked inside the houses of these people. Luckily, the disk loaded the address of the home and workplace of these people. With the exception of the bum, of course, and probably the prisoner. He looked at Evans’ address and closed the window. <br>
“It has to be in one of these peoples’ houses.” He said to himself as he walked downt he street. The sky was overcast, cloudy in most areas, but small patches of clear blue sky dotted the area. Nathan had written Evan’s address on a napkin.<br>
<br>
I don't know, I think the morgue scene needs more work, not sure if Sam acted the 'right' way.<br>
