<br>
by &quot;english student&quot; do you mean you're from the UK?  Or that you're studying english?  I was just wondering because my answer would be slightly different depending...  also, where in japan are you thinking of going?  And what will you be doing once you're there?  Let me know so I can be more specific with my reply.<br>

1) what are you planning on doing (i.e. what's your purpose- studying? sightseeing? etc.)<br>
2) where in japan do you want to go?<br>
3) just how ghetto do you want to live? (i.e. do you mind sharing a dirt cheap hostel room with 3 or 4 other foreigners who may or may not filch your stuff?  do you want to stay in one place for the vast majority of the time (as in renting a room in a gaijin house for a month and basing yourself there) or do you want to constantly keep moving and seeing lots of different places in japan? (in which case you might want to consider a rail pass), etc.)  Let me know just what your limits are and what sort of living conditions you would prefer, and I can give you a much better answer. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu.  <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I think ill spent three weeks in tokyo,then half a week in hakone or the fuji five lakes region,then half a week in nikko.im hoping my budget will stretch to allow me to stay in ryoken's rather than hostels.id rather experience more traditional japanese ways where i can.i think ill be able to spend up 2 £3500-£4000.i know its not alot but i think its the most i could possibly get by then(and thats with working hard and cutting right back on spending). <p>&quot;Tell me.

(for those american on the board, that's around $6000 US or around 75,5000 yen.) <br>
<br>
that having been said, it's amazing how fast you can burn through $6000 bucks, especially in Tokyo and *especially* if you stay in ryokan...!  those can easily start at $200/night (and that's a cheaper one...!) and stretch far far far beyond to... well, &quot;if you have to ask, you can afford it&quot; kind of territory.<br>
<br>
sightseeing is fun, and there's tons of stuff to do in Tokyo.  Assuming airfare from the UK will set you back around $900~$1000 (i would recommend flying ANA or JAL (i like ANA) just to experience the joy of the Japanese airline industry, which is superb) (sorry, we'll have to do this in US dollars since I don't generally think in pounds LOL!), you're left with around $5000 to enjoy in Japan.<br>
<br>
If you're going to do a lot of traveling (via shinkansen or other), I'd recommend a railpass, which can be bought only outside of Japan.  I forget the exact price (i'll look it up later, but you can just search for a JR Japan Rail Pass if you want), but they're akin to the Eurorail passes you can get for the EU.  However, since it sounds like you're kind of planning on staying in tokyo for most the time, if you do get one, i'd only get one for about a week or so (~$300 i think?).<br>
I should mention right off the bat that Hakkone can be reached easily via normal trains from Tokyo - in fact, when i lived in tokyo i used to take trips out there all the time.  It's pretty cheap if you just take a regular express, and it only takes around 1.5 hrs.  So I don't know if there's a need to &quot;stay&quot; in hakkone persay - there's a lot of nice stuff to see, but i dunno if it warrants your staying there - better just to visit it from Tokyo.<br>
<br>
As for nikko, i've never been there, so sorry i can't help ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I presume you have a guide book (i talked about guidebooks in one of the other posts near the top of the forum if you're interested) so it can give you some idea of what's up with nikko.<br>
<br>
If i may be so bold as to suggest something:<br>
$5000 is a lot of money if you spend it the right way.  I think it would be fantastic to stay in a ryokan, but they're generally not something that are practically or economically feasable as far as long term living arrangements (i.e. more than couple of days).  For one, they're super expensive, and for two, they're pretty damn strict.  I.e. you'll be told *when* to eat, *when* to bathe, and so on.  And heaven help you if you violate any of the dozens of rules, because they'll definitely let you know about it.  It's &quot;traditional&quot; japanese culture, but in the same way as ikebana or shodo (flower arranging or calligraphy).  Kind of cool and beautiful, but wholly impractical and not at all representative of the modern reality of japan.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that at least in Tokyo, you look into living in a gaijin house.  Basically these are like apartments for foreigners (regular apartments are prohibitively expensive to rent unlike in paris where you can rent a flat for a week or something, as in japan they require key money, etc. etc. plus they generally don't like foreigners anyway, those landlords).  They range in price and quality from the above mentioned hostel-like conditions to decent mid-range accomodations on par with what you'd expect in the UK.  If you'd like a private room in a somewhat clean apartment (generally the kitchen/living room are shared), you can expect to pay at least $800 for anywhere close to the center of tokyo.  <br>
<br>
When I lived in Tokyo I stayed in &quot;Aki House&quot; which actually, i grew to love dearly, (so much of it is dependent on the other foreigners staying there - when i revisited it last year, i found several unpleasant types living there (i.e. drunk ozzies), so it comes and goes....).  Aki house is located in Iidabashi, which is super convinient, as it's only 5 stations away from Shinjuku, 2 away from Akihabara (which I assume you'll wanna visit all the time LOL) and is basically right smack-dab in the middle of the yamanote sen (the main line that forms a circle around downtown tokyo and hits all the major stations) (actually iidabashi is on the chuo line, which connnects to the Yamanote sen in shinjuku and akihabara - it's quite convinient!).  This is a quiet little neighborhood, which is nice when you want to escape the crowds (somewhat).  If you're interested in Aki house, i can give you phone numbers/other information.... <br>
<br>
there are tons of other gaijin houses besides the aki house i mentioned.  Simply doing a google search for &quot;tokyo gaijin house&quot; will return dozens of results.  if you have a friend in japan who can check them out ahead of time for you, that would be great, otherwise if you find some, you could post their webpage and i could give you my opinion (my favorite pastime lol!)<br>
<br>
anyway, assuming you stay in a gaijin house for about a 3 weeks, this will cost you around another $800 (plus the $900 for airfare = $1700)  i assume when you visit nikko you'll either do a hotel (around $100/day though your book can tell you more specifically) and assuming you want to experience a ryokan for 2 days or so, this is another $400, plus the $300 for three days in a hotel in nikko = $2400 for lodging and airfare!<br>
<br>
Told you japan was expensive!<br>
<br>
But anyway, i assume you'll wanna eat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Here you can either skimp, go all out or do something in between.  Assuming you just want the bare minimums (i.e. onigiri from the convinience store for breakfast, yoshinoyas for lunch (cheap but tasty beef bowl) and a moderate dinner, you're looking at something like $15/day.  If you stay in the gaijin house, you can go shopping at the market and cut down on costs.  I figure that if you combine shopping for yourself/cooking plus eating out at least once per day (so easy to do when you're sightseeing) you're probably looking at around $300 for food for the month.  This figure varies depending on your diet and more importantly on how often (*and what kind of resteraunts*) you go out.  Food can be mad expensive in japan, but you have lots of control over this area.  yen 240 for a mid size bowl of gyudon (nami chu, around $2.10 US) or easily $300 for a single dinner in a ginza sushi bar (per person!).  So as you see, it's hard to say.  Let's go with $350, which should let you eat out comfortably plus have normal food for everyday.<br>
<br>
I can let you know more about specific/cheap resteraunts if you would like.<br>
<br>
Transportations a biggie.  The 210 yen to shinjuku everyday might not seem like a lot (around $2 US) but figure that you're not just going to shinjuku, but elsewhere also (harajuku is like another $1 or so...) plus you have to come back and you can easily spend $10 in a day just in train fare.  Actually, that sounds like a nice amount, so let's say $10/day transit, and you'll get around $300/month transit costs (though that varies).  going to hakkone/fuji etc. will be a bit more (around $10 each way, i think) plus long distance transit (i assume you'll wanna ride the shinkansen or something) can easily be $120 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>each way</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (for example from tokyo to osaka).  So maybe $450 transit costs?<br>
<br>
umm, so $2400 + $350 food + $450 transit (both of which you have lots of control over, so keep that in mind!) = $3200.<br>
<br>
Hmm, so far so good! you still have around $3000 to spend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !!!<br>
I don't know if you drink or not, but you probably will, especially if you run into some ozzies (yeah, they love their drink they do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) (ahhh, stereotypes!), and that can easily blow hundreds.  Ditto especially if you have your eye set on finding some j-cutie (just stay away from roppongi...! LOL) in the bars.  They have quite expensive tastes! (funny how one Hermes bag can set you back in excess of $1000 US... ahhhh love hurts...)  (more stereotypes LOL!)<br>
<br>
Throw in about another $500 for buffer (you'll use it up, belive me, especially in Tokyo) and you'll still have around $2300 to blow on whatever your heart desires, this is with living comfortably as well!<br>
<br>
Actually, I want to add some more stuff to this budget and refine a few things (keep in mind that a lot of stuff like food/transit is dependent on your preferences/tastes), but i have to go work now.  I hope this has provided you with a good start to go on though!<br>
<br>
I'll add more later, or else feel free to post any specific questions you might have!<br>

There are many throughout Japan and staying costs 50~60 dollars/night with supper and breakfast included (almost a quarter of a normal cheap hotel).<br>
You could enjoy more of Japanese atmosphere with a &quot;minshuku&quot;. You could sometimes enjoy the Japanese private family life. You may come across language difficulty if none of the family members speaks English.<br>
But that could be a challenging opportunity to practising your daily conversation ability in Japanese language.<br>
<br>
Just vivist the link below for example (Most links are in Japanese, though).<br>
