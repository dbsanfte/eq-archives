For C&amp;C, right? right!<br>
<br>
But when it comes down to the 20th post you have looked at and only 3 pictures were actually made with effort. Makes me think if they are actually trying to improve...<br>
I can't be ARSED to look at 5 minutes doodles when obviously it's the same problemm with them all: NOT studying proberly, what they want to draw(human body for example).<br>
And when you do give the commend &quot;study the anatomy of the human body more&quot;, they post something like...<br>
&quot;it doesn'y help much if people just say study the anatomy, rather look at the pictue and tell me exactly what to change&quot;<br>
<br>
...first I thought should I post: &quot;Everthing!&quot; but I didn't.<br>
Anyhow, if I'd mention everthing that had to be changed I might aswell correct it myself or draw it myself.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The way to learn is not to be told how to draw something.<br>
It's to be told how to learn something, to draw it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think it should be undermind to post in effortless work(5 min doodles) with the intention of no improvement. <br>
It's an insult to most artists to give an C&amp;C to something to that some who that isn't taking it serious in first place.<br>
<br>
Anyone CAN tell the difference from effort and effortless work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulinabo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LinaBo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PK Angel</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 10:43:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10201.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.marua.com/ifk/avatars/Linapic.jpg width=100 height=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't think it's right!</span><hr size=1> Some people do not understand the effort involved in making a solid crit.

If you are really serious about your art, go to the library and pick up some books on your subject. Medieval art... check out a medieval book w/ armour and weapons... anatomy... find a good anatomy book.. etc. I draw a lot every day, look at art everyday, etc. <br>
<br>
People shouldn't get upset if what they think is great anatomy and are then told they need to work on it. If they are told that then they should be greatful. In a year, or maybe a few months, they could look back on the drawing and think the anatomy was aweful. If Cold were to be harsh and direct, and if that person was serious about their art, then they would find the correct way to fix their drawing.<br>
<br>
Although you do have to consider poeple's abilities... some not up to par with others.. but what Cold is getting at is somebody posting stuff when they could be capable of something MUCH better, if they put some effort into it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utraia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Traia</A> at: 6/7/02 12:51:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umisterkyo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mister Kyo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 4:11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10201.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://misterk.8m.net/avatar.jpg height=130 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't think it's right!</span><hr size=1> Though i don't post often, i think that it's important to crit other people's if you want feedback. A lot of people, particularly in the art in progress section are giving what i'd call harsh critics. If you want to point out something negative about their work, don't say something along the lines of &quot;That's ugly&quot; (i've had that one a few times. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )-because it isn't particularly helpful.

Eva, i totally agree with you, It is becoming a popularity contest.

My last thread had one really good insightful crit from KilluaX and that's all I really needed.<br>
We don't ask for so many replies, we don't aim for a set amount, we just post our art up, take down notes for what we need to improve on and move to the next picture.<br>

If people want high reply counts then just take longer time on your works, take more effort and actually bother to draw something that doesn't look like you did on the back of your maths exam paper.<br>
At my university we have a drawing society dealing mainly with comic/manga art and none of them do 5 minute doodles then show them to people.<br>
Dansama and many otehrs go through maybe about 10 doodles before they stop at one and turn that one into a finished product.<br>
<br>
If it was something like playing an instrument then these people wouldn't be playing tunes like Mary had a little lamb and then showing it off, hoping to gain popularity.<br>
People need to see that drawing is the same as playing music. It needs to be mastered and that mastering anything takes time and patience.<br>
<br>
If people post for the sole reason of popularity then ignore them, make them digruntled and they will leave, leaving only those who wish to improve and share their art with everyone.<br>

Not all artists here are great artists, but barely any of the artists here who get loads of replies are in it for the popularity, unless they tell someone to shut up and that their opinions don't count or something of that matter.<br>
Those are in it for popularity.<br>
<br>
The rest are in it for improvement, I know I am. <p>::HAPPY GO LUCKY!!!::</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 7:13:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10201.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't think it's right!</span><hr size=1> Whoah now neon, that's not really fair. No one is blaming you or anyone else who gets a large post count for the people's replies to you, but you can't blame people for the quality of their artwork either. True, some people (a lot of people) don't spend enough time on their work and they just show off the first thing they finish. But this board is mainly targetted at beginners, and that means they aren't going to be doing top quality stuff in the beginning. There are a few people here that can do some really great stuff, and since most people are just starting out, they stand out even more. Don't put down people just because they CAN'T do a picture that impresses everyone into leaving them tons of replies complimenting them, because not all of them are just rushing out and posting every scrap of paper they draw on. Most of them genuinely need help. <p><table width=100% border=0>

<br>
The few posts I have looked at, its usually:<br>
&quot;I did this in so and so class&quot; or &quot;this is a 5 minute rush job&quot;<br>
The point is that if someone actually sat down and took an hour or so to focus everything they had on the piece then they'd notice their level was better.<br>
<br>
I'm just emphasizing that people should take their time and not rush things.<br>
People just need to learn that patience and hardwork is the key to success. <p>::HAPPY GO LUCKY!!!::</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ualucard1515.showPublicProfile?language=EN>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 8:02:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10201.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't think it's right!</span><hr size=1> Yes, but to assume that everyone who isn't getting so many replies isn't trying is insulting. Some of them ARE trying their best.<br>
<br>
But this board isn't for getting as many replies as you can anyway, so that shouldn't even be an issue. <p><table width=100% border=0>
