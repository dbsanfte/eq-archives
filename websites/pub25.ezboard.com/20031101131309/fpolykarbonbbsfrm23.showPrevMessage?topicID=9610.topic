A corollary</span><hr size=1> I like your style alot, but I think the real problem you're having in this picture is the boy's feet. Starting from them, there is a strange and very sublime change in perspective that makes him seem like he is leaning. I would suggest lining the feet up and trying to lean him back a bit (If you tilt his upper body from the hips, it will make it a much more relaxed pose altogether, no matter what you do to the legs) and see how that works out. Also, it's a strange angle you have him in between his face and his body. I really like your style, but the angle is lost in his face. Does that make sense? His face seems to be at 3/4 angle from directly next to him, like you would have if his head was level with the bottom of the page. But because you have his body at an angle, this angle of his face contrasts.<br>
That's the only thing I can really see wrong with this. Like I said, I think your style is really great and I like it a lot. Hope I helped a bit. ^_~; <p>&quot;Oh I'm a jolly spud, and people call me bud, I live down in the mud- with all the other tubers!&quot;<br>

I look at it now and it seems as if the upper half is sliding off of the bottom half.  Leaning him back a bit does seem like the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Your advice on the face has thrown me through a loop though.  It doesn't make sense to me though I have read through it now, carefully, four times.  I can't visualize the point you are trying to make.  Three-quarters is not really an angle.  The only thing I can think of is that you were saying that I had the face in a position where you could only see three-quarters of it.  Which, admittedly, I did.  However I had the body in the same position and I am unable to grasp where the conflict is.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the comment though.  For some reason people don't like to give me crits.  Maybe I'm at the point where I am good enough that most people can't find anything wrong with my crap and not good enough that a bunch of bozos clutter the board up with effusive crap.  Ah well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kempokatt>kempokatt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/21/03 6:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9590.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stopped boy.

<br>
There's nothing wrong with it, it's just &quot;Your Style&quot;, kind of &quot;cartoonish&quot;.<br>
<br>
In other words, there is nothing anyone can say to you that would make you draw differently....Hands, faces, feet have no detail.....because that's the way you WANT it to look.<br>
<br>
BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A CRIT!<br>
<br>
As stated earlier he does appear to be leaning almost as if he were standing on a hill and trying not to fall over. Have you ever taken any classes on drafting or perspective? Maybe find a tutorial online, it can't hurt! Maybe if we could see the whole pic it would help too....might be a crooked scan!<br>
<br>
<br>
I like your style! do ya have your comic done yet? I'd like to check it out.<br>
(I look at a lot of stuff on here but only comment when I think it's worth it.)<br>

You fell into the drafting pit also? I took many years of it. It DOES help with &quot;Drawing&quot;. But, it made me fall into the &quot;PERFECTIONIST&quot; mindset. I over analyze everything and change it endlessly (That's why you don't see them up here!)<br>
<br>
I don't think you would really have to work up a complete skeleton. Sometimes it helps to do some simple wire frames (Stickmen/buildings etc.) to make sure all of the aspects of your drawing are following the laws of (nature/physics/gravity) before you commit.<br>

<br>
I enjoyed drafting very much.  It does kind of make you think more like a perfectionist, but, as you can probably see from my sketchy lines (lightning bolt lines, Mr. Moran would call them) and rather liberal use of perspective, I try not to let it bother me too much.<br>
<br>
I wasn't actually talking about making all of the bones of the chap before I started adding flesh and then skin.  I just meant some construction lines which would help me make sure everything lined up.  Too often I just build the drawing from the top down, filling in as I go and when I finish it looks ... tweaked.  Mostly that happens when I make a head that I like so much I have to draw a body.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Thanks again for ... stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=9590.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=9590.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9590.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=9590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.threadControl?topicID=9590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm23>art in progress</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
