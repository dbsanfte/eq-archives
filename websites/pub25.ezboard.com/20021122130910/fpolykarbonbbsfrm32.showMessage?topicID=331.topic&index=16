I will admit that in T4 once you launched by a good player you know your in for some damage. Most of the juggles are hard on tekken bedside's Jin's launcher, 1,2,3 d+4. That thing is too easy and takes a lot. But it's no cheaper than Lau's launcher, p,p,p, d+k. I juggle in all games and in VF4 the few juggles that work hit too much. Like you can hit someone 4 times in the air with kage and still pull off on last summersault kick when they are 1in for hitting the ground. And getting juggled against the wall (Really on that caged ring stage) You can't tech until to just go owned on the wall. In rare cases I can pull of a 60% or high combo (not juggle)with Kazuya. It's his last combo in the Demon darkness vid.<br>
<br>
Another thing I like about the tekken series it the special lighting effects each character has when they do a special move. Like the lighting effect Kazuya gives off when he hits someone. Sure it's not realistic but if want real fighting sim then buy a boxing game. <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>

Let's not assume things we don't know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've played a lot of hours on tekken3. I know i have seen around the 50-60% life take by juggle combos on that game. In fact, one of my friends does it every time we have a  tournament at his house. It's also highly likely to do that amount of damage in Tekken Tag.<br>
<br>
If you don't believe me, here's a link. Certainly shows i have played enough tekken to know what i am talking about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is a link to a gamefaqs tekken4 juggle FAQ. Check characters such as Kazuya, Brian, and Christie. Most of the juggles range from 30 to 50 something, so 60% wasn't such a bad guess for tekken 4, considering i have only played it for a total of about 8 hours.<br>
<br>

<br>
As for tekken 3, here's a few examples of large % combos i checked in some faqs i downloaded eons ago.<br>
<br>
Paul:<br>
<br>
{ch} d,d/f,f+1, u/f+3, 1, d,d/f,f+1 ,f, d+4,2 *note only works on big characters big time juggle 75% energy<br>
<br>
Lei:<br>
<br>
 The easiest juggle combo is uf+4,UF+4. This causes a ton of damage and all you hard to do is hold upforward and rapidly press 4. I've done over 1500 damage and over 40 hits. Others work in the same way but are much harder to do. One work of advise, these won't work in battle, so done't try it (except one).<br>

Another thing i noticed while going through the FAQs was the large number of infinite combo (particularly for Hwoarang), a good cheap way of winning. I really don't like infinites because as soon as one starts you might as well walk away from the machine. Almost zero chance of escaping unless the person doing it goofs up. Anyone know if there are infinites in any VF games? (i don't know any and i'm not saying it to annoy the people that like tekken). If you do know of any, please post a link to a combo movie/faq. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I remember the original two tekkens also had fairly unrealistic jumps as well. Not as extreme, but they were there. They are both unrealistic to an extent (after all, games are an escape from reality), but i'd still say that VF is more realistic than tekken.<br>

Back to the topic:<br>
<br>
As far a jumping goes, T1 and T2 jumps were to high. VF1 and VF2's jumps were just as bad if not worse.<br>
<br>
FAQs are never right when it comes to damage. Like shou said, The arcade doesnt tell you how much damage each combo does. And the one that do take hella damage are damn near impossible to do.<br>
<br>
Were talking about T4 Vs VF4. The combos in Tekken 3 do take a lot of energy, mainly because the move take as much in a juggle as it does when you get hit with it standing. That game was made about 6 years ago, the system has changed. In Tekken Tag moves take a more in the arcade version than on PS2. But still you have 2 characters so the higher damage is makes the rounds go faster. In T4 a hard juggle doesn't take as much as a 2 hit juggle on T3. There is no infinite combos in Tekken besides the beta versions that has the parking area bug.  <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>

I wouldn't go that far. Even an educated guess by looking at the bar and estimating, i'm damn sure that the faq is about right. Combos like this in tekken 4 for Brian looks like someone like me can even do it-<br>
<br>
Juggle starter         Juggle Finisher<br>
QCF_WS+1       | - d+2, 1,2, f,f+2                   |   44<br>
<br>
That's 44% gone. Even if it wasn't exactly accurate..That's still a lot of damage. You only have to do that combo once and almost half their life is gone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

From the way most of the debate has gone, i assumed we were all talking about the series as a whole (such as talking about the variation in jumping in both series). Oh well. I really dislike Tag (any version of it), i'd rather 3 anyday. With the infinite combos, i was under the impression that in almost any fighting game, there are infinites. Maybe they just haven't found any yet? Judging from what i've read, most infinites are the result of really small overlooked glitches. (Such as the &quot;juggle angel repeatedly with the same move over and over&quot; one in KOF2001). <p><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/bprojectk" target="_blank">

I used to laugh at how floaty the jumps were in VF. But now jumping really doesnt play such a huge role anymore. <br>
<br>
Now to combos that can realy screw a person over... In VF3tb there is a rare case with Akira that if you position a person at 1/3 angle to the wall in his stage and can perform this really crazy combo, you can KO someone in one combo. I cant truly remember the combo, but it seemed logical, but highly unlikely in a real fight.<br>
<br>
The thing I dont like about Tekken now that I think about it is the juggling. The very thing we've been discussing. If a good player can get you into the air, chances are that youre not coming down for a few seconds. That in and of itself is enough to take away a little bit of fun. When I played some &quot;experienced&quot; players over at Gamestop a while back some guy as Jin whomped on me because he quite literally kept me bouncing and in the air. I got one or two hits in, but he just kept uppercutting me right before I hit the floor and opened up on me. Now I'm wondering, in a tournament is this all you see? An exchange of juggles?? Or is it more complex? Is it a game of trying to avoid being juggled? I dont understand. From this debate there seems to be a heavy basis on juggling.<br>
<br>
Once I get my PS2 in about a week I'll have my VF4. But I'm starting to consider maybe picking up a Tekken 4 if I ever have some extra cash...To see what all the fuss is about. <br>

Jins unbloackable does 100 damage, on the life bar it takes away about 80% life. Any damage you see from the arcade version faqs are 100% bogus. And please dont go on a wild tangent saying unblockables are easy to kill someone, only complete newbies who arent paying attention will get hit by an unblockable. They are slow, the character starts glowing, and they cant move or block. Only idiots use unblockables in a fight.<br>
<br>
Take Tekken 4 faqs with a grain of salt. They are written by kids who want to be on a website so they try to act like they know what they are doing so they make up combos. Most of them are a joke, and a lot of their &quot;strategies&quot; to characters are completely made up in their own delusional mind, like in the Hwoarang faq that says his crouch dash can go through a player and his attacks. I dont even know where they get half the stuff they write.<br>
<br>
I can do a hard-to-pull-off-in-a-regular-fight juggle with Jin in T4 that does 79 damage (more if I hit them onto a wall), but it still takes away less than half their life. I dont see this as a &quot;flaw&quot; since anyone can see the move a mile away and if you get hit with it then.. well you suck because its basically like getting hit with an unblockable.<br>
<br>
the move is:<br>
Blood Omen&gt;Lingering Soul(b+1+2,hold,d,u,b,f), b,f+2,1,d+2:2, f~n~d~d/f+2<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Combos like this in tekken 4 for Brian looks like someone like me can even do it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
ha, I will pay you $10 if you can do that 100% of the time in a real fight against someone. You keep acting like juggles are easy. Dont trust the faqs, go try it for yourself and see just how hard they are. Thats one of the main things that made me a Tekken fan, the juggles can get incredibly hard and its fun to try and master the game so you can pull them off and then make up your own.<br>
<br>
As for infinite combos, believe what ever you want. Hwoarang doesnt have one but Im sure the faqs will state differently. He has one that looks like it could be infinite where you have to be perfectly aligned with a wall in the Arena stage, but even then that juggle is extremely hard to do and it takes perfect timing of sidestepping/dashing and punch cancelling. I could say that Christie has an easy infinite if your oponent doesnt tech roll, because she does ONLY if the person you are fighting decides to put the controller down and not press anything since they wont tech roll out of the infinite. Lei Wulong is the only character in Tekken 4 that has ever had a true un-techrollable infinite, but that was only in the very first arcade versions in certain stages.<br>
<br>

Yes in Tekken tournament videos you will see them trying to not get juggled. Theres a lot of side stepping and things get really fast. Its to bad that those Tekken Central videos dont work, the fights there are some of the fastest and best out there. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/banner.gif" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/15/02 10:21:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/umadpower1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madpower1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/16/02 11:11:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img3.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/boardimage.jpg width=64 hight=64></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Inevitable: Virtua Fighter vs.Tekken *LONG READ*</span><hr size=1> Often when people think are infinites are just stupid crap scrubs can’t stop.  Ex. Heihachi’s d+1. If you keep trying to tech you will keep getting hit by it. That’s no infinite, just let it hit you once or twice and you're free. I saw a average player with about 10wins doing this before I stepped up and owned him. <br>

Graphics wise, tekken tag looks better than T4 and VF4. The characters have more pixels, I think Namco went all out with TTT because  it was launch game for the PS2. If you think juggling is bad on T4 you should play a TTT veteran or better look at some TTT combo vids. <br>
<br>
The FAQ’s damage is always off.  If the energy is at 82% before the combo is done it’s a lot harder  to tell how much it took compared to if the bar was on 100%. I don’t read FAQ’s unless it’s by a credible player. <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/madartwork/Main.html"><img src="http://img2.ranchoweb.com/images/madpower/madbanner.jpg"border=0 ></a>
