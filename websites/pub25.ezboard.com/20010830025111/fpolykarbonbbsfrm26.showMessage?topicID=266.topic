She's a character of mine in a manga I'm working on. Right now, the profile I have for her seems kind of...dull. (if you want to see a pic, find the post called &quot;ahh...a decent cg after so many failures&quot; or something like that under the color art forum)<br>
<br>
Ignatia Firesong: <br>

<br>
Blood Type: ? (I'm trying to find the explanation the Japanese people have for the personality of the blood types, so far, I have only found the explanation for &quot;b&quot;. If anyone has some information, please please please send it to me!)<br>
<br>
Height: 154 cm (about 5'1&quot;)<br>
<br>
Weight: 108 lbs (49 kg)<br>
<br>
Hair color: Brown with two red streaks in the bangs and one long streak down the side.<br>
<br>
Eye color: green<br>
<br>

<br>
Weapons: Straight sword, Brass knuckles, tiger claws, and metal fan.<br>
<br>
Favorite People: Kokoro, Bradley Trinn, Ajina, Opal, Erin, Shway, Di, and Fon<br>
<br>
Least Favorite people: Mizu, Chi, Hi and Kaze (four elementals of Japanese sector), Professor Zander (Physics teacher)<br>
<br>
Habits: staying up till three in the morning drawing, spending hours at a time in front of the computer, starting too many projects and not finishing any.<br>
<br>
Hobbies: beating the crap out of a punching bag, drawing, reading, surfing the net, defending the world..<br>
<br>
Personality: assertive and confident, Ignatia shares the job of the main graphic artist with Trinn for the group &quot;paranoia.&quot; As a virgo and a tiger, she has a habit of expecting too much of someone and being a perfectionist 24/7. Her elemental sign is of fire, despite the fact that virgo is an earth sign. Being a fire, she can be somewhat temperatmental and loud when irritated, not to mention too stubborn for her own good. When she doesn't like something, she lets people know her opinion.<br>
<br>
Clothing: Being very physical and active, Ignatia plays a lot of different sports at the College. She's the only one of Paranoia who regularly attends health seminars and sports clubs, depending on the season and her mood. Most of her wardrobe consists of shorts and comfortable tanktops for the summer; long sleeve shirts, soccer shirts and baggy pants of any material for the winder. Her footwear is mainly the lavender and gray sneakers and her trademark black combat boots. Occasionally, she'll put on a pair of white or black strappy sandals. Comfort is preferred rather then style (pants to skirt ratio: 6:1).<br>
<br>
Speaking Manner: Ignatia knows two languages fluently and is learning her third and fourth at the college. After being on the sports field for years with crude guys, she has picked up some slang. Most of the time, her speaking is rather proper and polite. When irritated, he slang comes out (ie: &quot;I will not tolerate this any longer&quot;-&gt;&quot;I ain't gonna take this @#%$ no more!&quot;) Her speaking manner coupled by her temperamental personality has earned Ignatia a lot of enemies on and off the field. Most of the time when she's cursing, she'll slip into chinese or Japanese.<br>

The only thing that seems a bit boring is the 'hobbies' part. Most college students i know are like that. Perhaps,since theres something about a group called 'paranoia' perhaps she could go out and investigate hauntings or UFO sightings for a living. (but i'm not really sure what this group is about. is it about conspiracies?hauntings?the goverments corruptness?The whole urban legend the paul mcartny is really dead and has been replaced by Billy Shears?Or just urban legends in generel?Try to define this a bit more.)Also,with the weapons,why would she have them if she's a college student? I mean even a gun would be uncommon. Also,brass knuckles or tigerclaws,if she were to wear them seperatly that would be diffrent but you can't wear both at the same time. Brass knuckles are for punching and tiger claws are for clawing. You can't punch very well if you have claws on your hand(they would cut into the skin or just plain prevent you from punching.)And it would be somewhat hard to claw when your knuckles are being restricted in a metal cage. Try to add a few more things to your character like hair color,eye color,fmaily members....thinking of it. There is a nice character sheet on the writing board. I think its just called 'character sheets or something similar. It should help you add a bit of flavor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ignatia>Ignatia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/01 8:42:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Character sheet...please reply!</span><hr size=1> i shoulda explained something...Ignatia was originally in this group that defended the world (it's not really earth, considering it's a whole different solar system similar to ours, but not quite, considering that people can live on more then one planet) with Ajina and Trinn. The whole bit about the weapons is the weapons that she used while in the group. Then, she and the other two formed a Manga group called &quot;Paranoia&quot; with Kokoro and Opal (Paranoia does actually exist, me and my friends are the main characters in this). And the tiger claws are a set of gloves with hooks at the knuckle.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/01 9:20:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Character sheet...please reply!</span><hr size=1> yeah,i know what tiger claws are,i just don't care for them.(i prefer projectile weapons because if i miss i cna run away because i'm a little wuss <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Okay,now,about this defending the world thing,perhaps go into a bit more detail. Like,did they fail and thats why she's here?Or after things were over something caused her to come to the place she is now. Another thing,i'm guessing this character is based off yourself. While that is okay,it isn't the best thing to do. I used to be like that,but after awhile,the story will progress but the main character won't because you haven't.(i know it doesn't make sense,but just wait,theres more of an explanation coming up) Basically,humans do grow and become diffrent people but at times it takes awhile. In a story the main character may fall out because they don't stick out enough. I don't mean to be rude,but alot of kids(kids meaning any one 29 or under)or somewhat boring and don't really stick out. Now,what would you find more exciting,a story about a guy and his school life or a pilot who has been exiled from his homeland because of treason,only to roam the universe in search of the culprit who framed him and collects bountys on criminals to survive.(i'm sorry if that was a bad example,i'm not thinking today)Once you break youself away from the character you'll be amazed how they transform.For instance,once i distanced myself from the main character i was developing things just speeded up. She started out as a reincarnated princess and now is a underling of an evil god who is possed by a grumpy sorceress.SO basically,anything can happen if you let it. Sooner or later you'll end up with a world you created youself full of diffrent cultures and countries. Oh!that reminds me..i have to get back to drawing some maps.Keep writing and don't be afraid to explore. (i hope i wasn't to harsh or mean. I'm kind of in a bad mood)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessage?topicID=267.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showMessage?topicID=264.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=266.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=266.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=266.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=266.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm22">How to use Fight Club<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
