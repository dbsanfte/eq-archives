I'll do the art. No problem with compromising: here's a little something that's hardly relevant and was drawn rather a  while ago but it's the only human drawing I got online at the moment: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://gallery.passion4art.com/members/sergei_z/soldier.jpg">gallery.passion4art.com/members/sergei_z/soldier.jpg</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->The image is about 2-3 times as big as the original - my dodgy scanning and general lazyness resulted in this size being put on the web.<br>

<br>
Panel 1: Jake Parker is involved in a high intensity firefight with his partner Gerald Paulsen.This should be a 3/4 overhead view. They are ducked behind a cement partition on a highway. Jake is reloading his weapon which looks like a futuristic gun. Gerald looks scared out of his mind. He's clutching his gun like a child holds a teddy bear. Yet the rest of the scene should look rather calm.<br>
<br>
Jake: Don't worry. You'll get used to it.<br>
Gerald: Used to what? I'm fine.<br>
<br>
Panel 2: Pull in and show them at ground level.  A peice of the partition is blown away right next to them. Jake jumps away from the blast. pulling Gerald with him. Show explosion with lots of shrapnel and destruction.<br>
<br>
Gerald: (screaming) SHIIIIIIT!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Panel 3: Gerald is on the ground and looks as if he's crying. Jake is kneeling over him looking around.<br>
<br>
Jake: Used to that.<br>
<br>
Panel 4: Back to the 3/4 arial shot. Jake stands up and is facing over the partition and starts shooting huge energy blasts from his gun.<br>
<br>
Jake: (screaming) Lets do it.<br>
<br>
Panel 5 runs across the bottom of the page. Its a side view of Jake's face. <br>
<br>
Jake: End simulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 2<br>
<br>
Panel 1: (Half the page) Gerald is rising to his feet. Jake is holstering his gun. They are in a training room like the X-Mens danger room. There is a window overhead for observation.<br>
<br>
Jake: (thought bubble) When are they going to start. . .<br>
<br>
Panel 2: ( The other half) Close up of Jake lighting a cigarette. Showing the window in the back.<br>
<br>
Jake: (thought bubble). . .finding better trainees.<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 3<br>
<br>
Panel 1: Its an office. There is someone looking out the window and is profiled/silouhetted. You can see this over Jakes shoulder. The office is neat and orderly with no trinkets or anything.<br>
<br>
Jake: What the hell is going on with this organization? That kid could have died in there.<br>
<br>
Panel 2: Same setup.<br>
<br>
Boss dude: Well then its a good thing we paired him with you.<br>
<br>
Panel 3: Facing Jake now. He is angry.<br>
<br>
Jake: I'm not a f!@#ing babysitter.<br>
<br>
Panel 4: Arial shot of outside the building. It's not the hugest building. This is the training branch SfCorp. So the building should show that. This will be a small panel sowing some broken buildings and such in a small skyline.  The speech is coming from the topmost window of the SfCorp.<br>
<br>
Boss dude: Listen Jake. The purpose of this corporation is to make money. If he dies in training as opposed to while he's out there. We save some money.  <br>
<br>
Panel 5: Over the boss dudes shoulder. We still can't see him. He's still looking out the window.<br>
<br>
Boss dude: Go home Jake. Get some rest. We're letting you take him in the field tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Jake:But he's not. . . <br>
<br>
Boss dude: Go now.<br>
<br>
<br>
After doing this I don't think that I'll be able to re use anything I've already got. This was hard to transform to comic style from regular prose. Anyway this is only supposed to be a sample. We could start from scratch with characters you've been thinking of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usmiliemaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Smilie Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/4/02 6:21:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mysmilies.com/s/cwm/aim/uraaagh.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Re: This idea I got.</span><hr size=1> Like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's fine - I can work with prose as well.

Finally. <br>
OK this is very rough and general but better than nothing I suppose:<br>
1:Time: near future. 20-30 years or so. Maybe more if you want to. The only thing is that things need to LOOK about the same as they do now. I mean if it will be too far it would be hard to come up with something radically different to fit in realistically. The city in which the action takes place or at least starts  is partly like a normal city but mostly is underground. Cut by a number of massive artificial canyons as well - just for fun and to look cool.<br>
2: we have a main character that is hunted by the entire imaginary world. For no apparent reason at first but there can be some reson to be revealed later on or something...<br>
I also thought it would be good if he has falce memories or he has those memory blackouts or something. This would be cheesy but i am unable to think of anything actually good so there. Just so that he is somehow separated out of the crowd because he should be more or less nomal otherwise. Maybe something that he doesn't know about himself that comes out later on as the story unfolds?<br>
3: we have a super-hero (in a Batman/Spiderman sence: all the normal people adore him and stuff) who also hunts the main character. He is also a more or less normal but with a lot of silly technological gadgets and obviously well trained at all sorts of combat etc. Though if he is slightly stronger than a nomal person is ok as well; just sa long as he is not the Superman type character. In the end we have him finally finding the main character and having a final confrontation whatever. We'll decide who wins later cuz i kinda like it both ways and i don't know which would be better. For this superhero character I already have a number of blueprints and ideas as well as for the general look of the environment... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uascendedbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ascended Bob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/18/02 4:58:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Re: This idea I got.</span><hr size=1> Alright man that sounds awesome.
