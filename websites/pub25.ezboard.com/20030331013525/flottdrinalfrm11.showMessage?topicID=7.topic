This is due to the fact I want to be &quot;in game&quot; rather than writing on the board over the weekend.<br>
<br>
I spent the entire weekend in the South Karana area.  Well, ok, I like the gypsies in North Karana so much I decided to vist them 6 different times via my mastery of travel via the gate spells.  <br>
<br>
/em thinks about what level he would be currently without all the practice in Ranger Gating.<br>
<br>
I started at the spires, as many told me to do.  This started off bad, really bad.  I was the main tank in the first 4 or 5 groups I got in.  This contributed to 3 deaths on Friday and only 1 orange bubble after hours of fighting.  So, I decided to go hunt solo a bit.  In less than an hour I had 2 more orange bubbles to show for it, without even coming close to dying.  Golddiggr and a companion then joined me for a brief period and I managed to get almost 2 more orange bubbles, and was within only a couple of kills of making my 24th season.  Alas, it was getting on in the day and my companions had to depart.  I settled in to camp for the evening as I decided we had cleared away enough vermin to rest peacefully.<br>
<br>
Saturday morn brought a new day.  (Note that EQ is much easier to play without the pain of toothpicks holding your eyes open).  Within minutes I DINGED into my 24th level.  I hunted solo a while longer, but realized this solo hunting would prove to costly on me due to the high cost of arrows.  So, being ready to try my newly improved skills in a group, headed back to the spires.  <br>
<br>
This time, I was lucky to find myself in a group with a valiant warrior named Valdicoor, as well as a couple of shamans, a druid and a bard.  I was not forced to play tank and as a result I came to realize just how deadly I could be when not having to worry about rootin and scootin.  Wielding my now deadly (just getting there due to lack of time spent with 2hs) Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword (a gift from the gods .. errr .. ok Skatt), I was outhitting the warriors easily.  In fact, after this day both of the shamans went off in search of blackened alloy weapons of their own.<br>
<br>
In less than 3 hours I heard yet another DING.  Two in one day is a very good day I must say.  I had made my 25th season, and decided a rest was in order.  I lay down to sleep unable to get my mind off the coming day.<br>
<br>
Sunday found me looking for a spire group again.  I got in a terrible group with a cleric who I will never join with again.  He was too busy ninja looting to keep people from dying, and without the strong tank from the previous day I was forced to visit the gypsies on 3 different occasions.  I was angry and decided to log and do some real life stuff.<br>
<br>
I came back later in the day and logged in to see the mighty Valdicoor right in front of me.  He immediately welcomed me into his group, and what a group it was.  Three Warriors, a bard and a druid joined me.  The druid never even had to lay a DD spell out due to the massive trauma the meleers caused.  It was absolutely unreal.  Not to mention the fact that we were pulling from 2 spires as the one next to us was deserted of campers.  In less than 2 hours I DINGED to 26.  Three dings in two days, looking good.  After fightring for a couple of more hours I now stand 2 orange bubbles from lvl 27 and I am becoming stronger by the second.  <br>
<br>
The best part about all of this is the making of many friends and allies who I will no doubt journey on with as I rise in power.  What started as a weekend in which I ws determined to hit lvl 24 and journey with Golddiggr, saw me instead hit level 26 and finding myself within seeing distance of level 30 and my beloved SoW spell.  <br>
<br>
The money still aint coming in fast enough to outpace arrow production, so I will continue to seek out the aforementioned bracer of unlimited arrows, but until then, I have found grouping to be cheap and effective with the right people.  Class of people in group seems to matter less at this stage than their ability to understand their role in the group.  <br>
<br>
Also of note, if Rangers are supposed to dual wield 1hs weapons, why are the 1hs so pathetic at thsi stage of my career.  Even the 1hs Blackened Alloy Long Sword is a meager joke in comparison with the 2hs Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword.  Oh well, maybe soon I will graduate to the point that I can go after named MoB's that hold real loot.  I can't wait.<br>

Don't worry my friend, you will find the best way's to  make it thru.  And don't worry to much about powerful weapons right now, learning how the Mob works, and seeing how the different classes work, is what you need right now.  Glad to see you catching up.<br>

So long in fact when I started to use other weapons. people didnt recognise me.  These can be found in a rather vial place, the infamous castle mistmoore.  These are not by any means easy to obtain as castle mistmoore is a very difficult zone to learn, as many here will atest.  However, it remains to this day my favorite zone.  I can say with all honesty, I am a master of this zone. I cannot even begin to count the number of people I've taken hunting there.  I must be honest, as I think you may still be a bit green for this zone, at least to hunt the maid and the butler.  However, there are areas there you can hunt, with a group, and the exp there is good as are the spoils.  As it is an outdoor zone, you can solo there (trains there are historic, and if called, DO NOT stay around to watch) but it does take some time to learn the technique.  If I were there I would gladly show you....maybe one of the other seasoned Rangers will show you around when they are not busy.<br>
<br>
Aayways, I'm sure there are better weapons available these days, and in fact, there were then.  But I still love the look of duel waks.......dang, I miss those days :0( <p><a href=http://terstai.trafficblast.com/drinal target=_top><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/chey_sig.jpg border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utalastheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talas the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/01 2:26:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daily Journal (Weekend Report)</span><hr size=1> Heh .. they sound cool on name alone.  Hehe.<br>
<br>
Might have to check out that zone soon, but I will probably try to stay in SK until level 30 or so.  I am hoping that won't be too much longer, and given the rate of levelling over the last few days there, I figure to hit 28 fairly quickly there.  After that I think most things in the zone will be blue to me, which means I drop the group technique and hunt solo, or I move on to tougher areas, maybe the inside of Paw itself.<br>
<br>
At 30 I will go learn spells (saving for them as we speak), and then I will have some decisions to make.  I will have better thoughts on life after 30 when I reach that goal.<br>
<br>
&quot;We take our victories where we find them, small though they may be.&quot;<br>
