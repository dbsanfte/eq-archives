<br>
You can find jobs for gaijins in Japan at www.GaijinPot.com and specifically ENGLISH TEACHING jobs at www.OhayoSensei.com .<br>
<br>
About your CHOICE of jobs:  70% of all foreigners in Japan, who come from English-speaking countries, are professional English teachers.  No matter what you want to become, your best bet to get money in your pocket is to teach English.  It helps ALOT if you arrive with a work-visa, a college degree (in ANYTHING) or a faked college degree, and even MORE if you've got a certification in teachign English as a Foreign Language.  (There are cheap $1,000/1-month courses in that kinda thing .  Do a google search, and I'm sure you can find a school for that in Hawaii. )<br>
<br>
Remember that to WORK in Japan, you have to prove that you can do the work better than a Japanese guy.  Clearly, then, &quot;English teaching&quot; is a safe bet, but &quot;artist&quot; is darned-near impossible.  Take the case of my friend, a 7th generation European blacksmith and lifetime professional:  Despite being a world-class artist with credentials up the wazoo, and being from Holland (a non-English-speaking country), he spent his first 3 years in Japan as an ENGLISH TEACHER, and filing something like 3 kilograms of paperwork to finally, finally get his art-professional work visa.<br>
<br>
The $ for teaching English is phenomenal.  At a commercial conversation school (Eikaiwa) that can give you a visa, you typically get $2000 a month (250,000 yen).  For private lessons that you do on your own, you can get $25 to $50 (3000 to 6000 yen) per hour.  Big, easy $ like that is why so many foreigners in Japan are English teachers.  <br>
<br>
Big English schools like NOVA and AEON and GEOS do their interviewing and hiring overseas.  They're crap to work for, but once you have a work visa, you can change employers in Japan.  Most other schools won't hire you unless you do the interview in Japan, and ALREADY have a work visa, which is a bit of a catch-22... so instead, hire on with one of the big (crappy) companies and then trade up.  Or, if can get it, grab one of the JET (Japan English Teaching) jobs, where you teach English at a public high school.  I'ts 40 % more money per month than regular teachers' jobs, and it's often dead-simple work.<br>
<br>
You could try getting a student-visa, and working as a private English teacher on the side (for the big $).  If it's an art school, maybe they can even set you up with a work-study program so you can get into the pro art scene.  Regular jobs in a Japanese company DO NOT earn you the big bucks for short hours, though.  Japanese &quot;salarymen&quot; &quot;volunteer&quot; evenings and weekends without pay, working late for nothing except to impress their bosses.  And, the Japanese pride themselves on &quot;gaman suri&quot; (enduring crap without complaint&quot;.  The cartoonists' scene is no exception.<br>
<br>
About being a translator in Japan:  Forget it.  Translating is for the cream of the crop...and you're not there, yet.  It's also a crap job, paying little and squeezing yourself into a very uncomfortable role in business negotiations.  Japanese business language and customs are EXTREMELY EXTREMELY finicky, from the way you accept someone's business card to the type of Japanese that you speak.  (Business relations are done in a special, very polite form of Japanese called &quot;keigo&quot; or &quot;Tei-nei go&quot;.  As far as I know, there's no book for foreigners on how to speak Keigo (except for really basic stuff).<br>
<br>
About being a translator in Hawaii:  Different story, there.  There are lots of jobs there where you'll be rewarded for knowing even a little Japanese.  You're competing with lots and LOTS of second-generation immigrants, though, so there are LOTS of top-notch translators.  Set your expectations a little lower, like Japanese sales and tour-guide and airport greeter.  Start out at Kelly temps or any of the other temping agencies, and they'll not only find you work... they'll help you build your skills, too.<br>
You won't earn $ there, though:  expect $10 an hour for almost any entry-level job, and 30% taxes paid on that.  You can get an apartment (expensive), and ride the bus ($15 a month, whadda deal !), but if you're only gonna be there a few months, seriously consider living in one of the HOSTELS, where you can live very cheaply and hang out with tourists.  (I lived in Hawaii for 5 or 6 years, so I speak from alot of experience.)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 6:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.warcry.com/image.php?id=4964 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> well i plan on one year. i am not sure if you have ever been to hawaii, but if you haven't it is very much full of japanese culture. in school we actually recited on a regular basis ichi ni san shi go roku shichi hachi ku ju. over and over. domo arigato. and moving back to my home in hawaii will make it very easy for me to learn it quicker. in fact a funny story. when i arrived on the mainland USA i was a little shocked to see spanish on the public signs instead of japanese. its funny because at the airport you will hear a voice on the intercomm in japanaese. but at the same time, it was all around me so much i never paid attention to it. lol but anyway my level is small. i can read hiragana and katakana. more like a hooked on phoenics commercial though lol. and i can recognize over 100 kanji although i may not be able to pronounce them. thats a problem. noone here in nenada speaks japanese so its hard to learn which is also why im going home to hawaii. there are multiple japanese channels there. used to watch samurai soap operas when i moved into a new house and the cable wasn't hooked up. but yes i will definantly consider teaching english until i become fluent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 6:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.warcry.com/image.php?id=4964 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> thanks for the info. i have gaijinpot bookmarked. what kind of art was your friend trying to get into? was it manga like me?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethness>SethNess</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fureai-ch.ne.jp/~seth/clearhappy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 6:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Unexpected Expenses in Japan</span><hr size=1> Are you already knowledgeable about how much (or little) things cost in Japan ?<br>
<br>
If not...read on.<br>
=============<br>
Expensive:<br>
<br>
Supermarket stuff is generally the same as America, but NOT including bread, coffee, peanut butter, pizza, and breakfast cereals, which are surprisingly costly.<br>
<br>
MOVIES and BAKERY STUFF are surprisingly expensive... 2 to 3 times what you'd expect to pay in America.<br>
<br>
RENTING AN APARTMENT is generally done through a real-estate agent (fudou-san), but this is phenomenally expensive, and the jerk is not on your side.  Instead, he's the front-man for the landlord, whom you probably won't meet ever.  Also, when you move in, the real-estate agent expects you to give him<br>
a) one month's rent in advance<br>
b) one or two months' rent-worth in security deposit and &quot;tatami flooring refurbishing money&quot; that you very likely won't get back when you move out<br>
and (here's the big BIG shocker)<br>
c) one to two months' rent-worth as a &quot;gift&quot; or commission to him, when you move in.  Gag-koff-koff.<br>
This gift is sometimes called &quot;key-money&quot; in English.  Sorry I can't recall the Japanese name for it.<br>
Your best bet is to quiz Japanese friends, and try to find an apartment that a) doesn't have a real-estate agent and b) doesn't expect &quot;key-money&quot;.  These apartments are bargain-basement deals, but maybe you can get lucky if you go through word-of-mouth.  Keep in mind, though, that many landlords and real estate agents expect foreigners to be smelly, noisy flakes who'll befoul the apartment and leave in the middle of the night owing a month's rent.<br>
<br>
OWNING A CAR or a large-engine motorbike in Japan is incredibly pricey.  Gasoline is taxed til it costs twice what it does in America.  On top of that, most people buy their cars through used-car dealers, rather than from private individuals. (You can get deals at yahoo.co.jp's auction site, though.) Still worse, there are incredibly high yearly car-taxes, and a gov't car inspection done once every 2 years (called a &quot;shakken&quot;).<br>
To avoid these expenses, try to buy a scooter or a motorbike of less than 250cc.  The cost-savings for those are significant, and they don't need &quot;shakken&quot;.<br>
====<br>
Refreshingly cheap:<br>
Supermarket stuff, and McDonal'ds/&quot;family restaurants&quot;/any fast food joint.  Also, surprisingly, fast food joints are low-class in America, but in Japan they don't carry that stigma.<br>
<br>
Japanese people DON'T TIP.  Cabs, restaurants, and haircutters are therefore quite a bit more expensive than their American counterparts.<br>
======<br>
Before you come to Japan, STOCK UP.  If your shoe or shirt size is average-to-large, you will have alot of difficulty finding your size in Japan.  I get my stuff sent by a friend in Hawaii, yet I'm only size 10.5/11 shoe.  Buy ALOT of deodorant before you come here, because a lifetime diet of hamburgers has made your body-chemistry significantly different (and stinkier) than an Asian's.  Consequently, deodorant in Japan is weak stuff, nearly useless to us.  Buy extra, and use it as a gift to foreigners you meet in Japan.  (We're always desperate for the stuff !)<br>
<br>
Get an international driver's license from the Automobile Association of America, before you come to Japan.  It's good for quite a while in Japan, and the Japanese driver's test is infamously difficult.  You can get an application for one over the internet, or from a travel agency.  Cost is about $15.  Provide 2 passport style photos, and a copy of the front and back of your driver's license. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sethness>SethNess</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fureai-ch.ne.jp/~seth/clearhappy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 6:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> living and working in Japan</span><hr size=1> My buddy was just trying to do the job he'd done back in Holland:  blacksmithing, cutlery, and wood-sculpting.

Also keep in mind that his craft was considerably different from Japanese-style blacksmithing, which probably made his getting an art-career work-visa a bit easier than for sketchers like you and me.<br>
<br>
Another career to think about in Japan is bartender or waiter in a foreigner-theme bar (not in Roppongi, and check out the management, so you don't end up working in a hostess/girlie bar with a mafia guy as your boss).<br>
The money's good, though the hours are predictably sucky.<br>

Are you a man or a woman ?  (I have specific advice on things to watch out for, if you're a woman.)<br>

Do you have a college degree already, or access to a friend's (and a scanner and a little photoshop-type programming) ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/14/03 8:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.warcry.com/image.php?id=4964 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: living and working in Japan</span><hr size=1> i am a male quarter okinawan-hawaiian-puerto rican. american born.

<br>
That's a BIG plus, depending on how well you speak it already.  For some reason, I'd guessed earlier that you were a total beginner.<br>
<br>
In Hawaii, you can easily find low-paying ($10 per hour) work...again, depending on your fluency.<br>
<br>
An associate's (2-year) degree isn't good enough for a regular work-visa in Japan.  You need a 4-year degree.<br>

I know people who came here on the strength of a forged degree, but can't promise that'll work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=higakun>higakun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://komplx.com/higan/Page_2/IMAG000.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/16/03 11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.warcry.com/image.php?id=4964 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh, you already speak Japanese.</span><hr size=1> elementry level lol. like i said i cant practice talking with anyone. so it really hinders me. but its good to know about the four year degree thing. so would it then be feasible to attend school in japan under a foreign learning program and while there recieve a 4 year then apply for a work visa? also without a work visa, can i still work in places like english teaching? so i can pay for college and stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=souridaijin@polykarbonbbs>Souridaijin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/21/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mainichi.co.jp/eye/feature/article/koizumi/200105/28-02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: moving to japan</span><hr size=1> Many people can speak japanese, but the question is can you write it? I am sure if you are a foreigner you will be tested in your job interview in this skill. <br>
<br>
As a second-generation Japanese/American, I can say that no matter how much Japanese you think you know, you can always learn more (and I go to Japanese school on Saturdays). <br>
<br>
This has already been said, but stuff is expensive in Japan, although thats changing (deflation). Oh yeah, because the Japanese economy is in a recession and companies are cutting jobs, you may have trouble finding a job. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't buy a car if I were you, especially if you're going to live in Chiba. The public transportation in Japan is solid. <br>
<br>
I would hold off moving to Japan without having a more clear and detailed plan of what you're going to do. Also, have a plan of what you will do if you can't find a job and you are broke. Nobody wants to become homeless, escpecially in a foreign country!<br>

You are not technically allowed to work in eikaiwa (english teaching) schools, or anywhere, really, for that matter, without a work visa (though you might be permitted a small on-campus job with a student visa, you`ll have to check online) but many foreigners do it under the table - the best bet is to get private students as there`s very little risk, and anyway, most schools will not touch you with a 10 foot pole if you have no work visa - there are simply too many foreigners out there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>with</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> valid work visas to bother with the risk.<br>
<br>
as an aside, and i don`t want to be rude, but you will need a lot more than elementary japanese to do anything vaugely related to japan/japanese translation (other than english teaching).  The competition is very stiff, and japanese is a suprisingly popular language, especially out here in asia/oceania - i would easily say that 50% of my foreign friends out here have what can be considered an &quot;elementary level&quot; of japanese (especially spoken) - this is in addition to solid 4 year degrees in specialized subjects like business/science/engineering, etc.  So study up now, while you`re still young! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu. </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

It's a brilliant place for getting a job working with tourists, with basic Japanese skills.<br>
<br>
You won't get paid much... $10 an hour is pretty standard.  Choose your job based on 2 factors:<br>
1) the variety of Japanese you'll be required to speak and listen to  (a repetitive narrator's job would suck, but a hotel info/help-desk or tour agent's in-hotel desk would be excellent).<br>
and<br>
2) the amount of quality study-time you can do on the job.  (Again, hotel info-desk or tour agent's in-hotel desk would be IDEAL.  You can browse through pamphlets, label everything in sight, wander through your dictionary... and you're sitting all day in an air-conditioned room, as opposed to standing in an airport or bouncing around in a tour-bus or standing in a clothing store waiting for customers to arrive.)<br>
<br>
Of course, these jobs will hire you based on YOUR proficiency, so you may have to hunt around before you find a company that'll let you start stoooopid and train-up while on the job.<br>
<br>
Hawaii (and Guam) are crappy job markets right now.  Hawaii has plenty of jobs, but all low-paying.  Guam has the same low-paying jobs, but fewer of them, and a much smaller talent-pool of Japanese speakers.<br>
<br>
You're quarter-this, quarter-that, born in Hawaii ?  You LUCKY  DOG !!!!  I'm pure German-looking, and Mainlander Haole.  In Hawaii, I was constantly wishing I had genes and a birthplace like yours.  Every place I went, people said &quot;Look... here comes Haole-Boy.  White as a ghost, long pants, no aloha shirt, even though it's Friday.  Toooooouuuuurrrriiiiiiisssssttttt !~<br>
Betcha he has socks on, between his feet an' his rubbah slippahs.&quot;<br>
==========<br>
<br>
Once you get to Japan, you CAN work under-the-table teaching English.  There's lots of competition, though, and it takes about a year to get a full-time schedule of students.  Oh, and if another private teacher gets jealous of you, he can always call the cops on you.  Anddddd... students will constantly be trying to get you to lower your prices, do free stuff, do language exchanges... anything so they get free English practice.  It's kinda tiring.<br>
<br>
If I were you, I'd solve the housing problem by looking for a homestay situation until you've got enough classes going to pay for your own pad....and know the city well enough to find a decent place to live.  You can probably find a family willing to take you in, based on their chance to chat you up in English.  Kinda like instant celebrity status, isn't it ?  They might ask you to teach their kids a bit.  You can use that as a starting point, asking them to recruit paying kids from the nieghborhood, to join the classes.  The same for the host-family adults.<br>
<br>
Do you look European-ish, or Asian-ish ?  In Hawaii, looking asian will help your job prospects, because tourists will assume that you can speak and relate to them in their language and culture, so they'll relax a bit.  (This is totally unfair, of course, but...those're the facts, not the world we wish for.)  On the other hand, if you look European but your Japanese is totally hot, you'll get alot of amused customers who'll tip you heavily and want their photo taken with you.  <br>
<br>
In Japan, on the other hand, LOOKING Asian isn't gonna help you much at English lessons.  In fact, it hurts in alotta ways.  Many schools and students won't trust your ability as an English speaker, if you look Asian.  The feeling is sort of like if you went into a Chinese restaurant, and the chef was some German/Italian guy.  <br>
<br>
Your career-path-- Manga cartooning-- is a tough one in Japan.  You're setting yourself up to compete with Japanese artists in a Japanese office, at Japanese regular-guy salaries...which stink.  If I were you, I'd look for a career in Japan AT a manga-office, but doing an English-writing job there.  Think of all the software and cartoons that can be translated into English and sold around the world... !!!  You can't read Japanese well enough, of course, but lots of Japanese offices will set you loose in the office to help put the final touches on translations that have been started by Japanese guys learning English.<br>
<br>
Before you get to Japan, see if you can take a TESOL (teaching English as a foreign language) course, 1 month long.  That'll help with your English-teaching job prospects.<br>
<br>
Also, take a Japanese Language Proficiency Test (writing, reading, and listening skills).  You won't be anywhere near the level-2 that you'd need to function perfectly in a Japanese-only office, but it'll start your credentials rolling... and Japanese employers LIVE for credentials.  Knowing the subject means squat in japan... certificates PROVING you know the subject mean EVERYTHING.  The JLPT will get the ball rolling for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1227.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1227.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5>Japanese Language Help</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
