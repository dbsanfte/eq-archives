<br>
I've been drawing for a good while now. Some people love my work, others like it but have their critiques, and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
You can't expect your art to appeal to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everyone,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of course. But when do you know... when do you know when the way you draw is your <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>style?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> When do you know when the stuff you've created is drawn the way you, the creator, envisioned it instead of it being considered to be riddled with mistakes?<br>
<br>
I can understand some little things being off because I'm only human and I will probably never create a perfect image in my own eyes. Therefore I will never be completely satisfied with anything I do. Is every artist expected to render every curve, every muscle, every strand of hair, every detail that exists on the true human form, in everything he or she does? Or can the artist rest comfortably with his or her art even if such things as eyelids, fingernails and muscle indications are left out, as long as the overall image &quot; reads&quot; human? (Or whatever the artist is trying to create?)<br>
<br>
I know there are problems with every piece I create. If I look hard enough, I can find something off on just about every single piece of art out there today. But is it really worth the stress to try to improve yourself if you're already comfortable with the style of your work? Or is that comfort a false claim, a buffer, a shield to protect oneself from the fact that he or she is too lazy or untalented or whatever to improve?<br>
<br>
How good must one be before he or she is willing to say &quot;I am a good artist?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd like to believe I'm a good artist. I also know for a fact that I'll never be a PERFECT one. I understand the concepts of anatomy and there are things I choose not to draw. There are also things I'm not very good at drawing so I don't do them much, if at all (backgrounds and vehicles, case in point).<br>
<br>
What's it all for, when you think about it? When do you know you're &quot;there&quot;? When you have established your style and created a signature you can leave behind when you're gone, something that at least one person in the world will look at and sincerely say &quot;That's the coolest thing I've ever seen&quot;?<br>

It's an expression. If you don't want to include details, then don't. I think it's your style when you drew it that way because that's how you wanted to do it. Picasso was very talented in realistic art, but he decided he wanted to do something else. So he did. It's another thing to not be able to draw better or not feel like it. If in confidence you draw something a certain way because you want it to look that way, and you don't care what others think...then it's your style. <br>
<br>
I personally think there's always room for improvement, and that there should always be that little twinge that you could have done something a little better. Then again I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I'm rarely even satisfied with stuff I do, much less pleased with it.<br>
<br>
If you have any doubt that you have artistic talent, go look at a modern art museum and walk away happy. In most cases the ego outweighs the talent nowdays.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't even like &quot;Fine Art&quot;. I personally don't really find the works of Michaelangelo, Picasso, etc., very appealing. But others do, and there are people who would rip me a new one if I ever said something like &quot;Michaelangelo sucks.&quot; He just created what he wanted to create and he got heralded as one of the greatest artists ever.<br>
<br>
I guess the bottom line is, always try to improve, but be willing to get to a point where you're satisfied ENOUGH (you should never be totally satisfied, IMO) and then let it go.<br>
<br>
That said, my stuff still needs some refinement but I think if I iron out the kinks (heads, feet mainly) I'll finally be able to say I've established my &quot;style&quot; and I'm comfortable with it.<br>
<br>
...And then there's the commercial aspect. While I don't draw because I want to get rich off of it, I would like to sell something someday. But it hurts the confidence to get some crits on something you thought would be good enough to sell at first...then when you hear about the many things that might be wrong with the piece, all of the sudden you lose that confidence you had in the piece, and tell yourself, maybe next time...<br>

Well my pictures are an evolving thing. I may start with one idea and over the course of drawing that image I'd end up with a different picture. So the way I envisioned it has little to do with the final result and when the picture evolves it's kept fresh and interesting to work on. <br>
<br>
And about mistakes, it depends on what you believe a mistake is. If you belive any diviation from reality is a mistake, then all artists work is riddled with mistakes. I believe a mistake is when something is distorted in a different fashion than the over-all whole is. If one draws a really inacurate hand with shaky lines, but the rest of the picture is done inacurately and shakily, then it's probably not a mistake. But if the drawing is really tight and fairly acurate, but you draw an eye in the wrong spot, that's a mistake.<br>

<br>
Funny thing about that is that the people who care most about how well a drawing is done are other artists. There is a lot of BAD comercial art out there but most people in the public don't really care about how well something is drawn. Most of the public can't draw anyway.<br>
<br>
Also don't worry about the little mistakes you make in a picture, it's the whole package that counts. If on the whole a picture is good, then it's good even if there are mistakes. There's this on issue of National Geographic about Abraham with this great painting on the cover, but the eye on the angel is placed so in the wrong place that the angel would look really ugly had she been looking at us straight on. But the painting is still good regardless.<br>

That's very interesting Retro... My design once said that &quot;art&quot; to her is the process of making the piece and the final is just a product of that &quot;art&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well all I can comment is don't rest too much on the technical side of art such as physical accuracy and not just the human body(unless of course realism is called for).  Once you have developed a good eye to produce a &quot;good overall&quot; piece (or better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) you can preoccupy yourself on worrying about improving other things such as how clear your concept is delivered (art=visual communication), is your composition balanced like you wanted and of course your color theory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Just like what Retro said... its &quot;the whole package that counts&quot;.<br>
<br>

In a lot of cases, yes. I don't know your situation, but there are a LOT of people that just use &quot;style&quot; as an excuse for ignorance. Retro mentioned Picasso, who obviously is not famous for his realistic work. However, he knew how to draw realistically and chose not to. He didn't just screw up a painting one day and call it cubism. <br>
<br>
I believe you need to learn the rules before you start bending/breaking them. I don't expect everyone to be a master of anatomy before they start trying to develop their style, but you should have at least a basic understanding. I probably expect more out of a &quot;basic&quot; understanding than many others, though. You don't need to know every vein, artery, and inner working of the body, but you should be familiar with the skeleton and, at the very least, the major muscle groups and how they interact. I don't know anyone going for abstraction here. If you're going to draw figural things, you need to know how the figure works.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But is it really worth the stress to try to improve yourself if you're already comfortable with the style of your work? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're talking about two different things, skill and style. You can be happy with your style and still improve other areas of your drawing. You may like a certain quality/look of the drawing, but still not be pleased with the overall structure of the figure. Maybe it doesn't bend right this way, or you can't get this particular angle right, or the pose looks off. It's not that you can't draw a hand, face, whatever and be happy with it, but you lack the knowledge of how to draw it well in a variety of positions and angles, and how it interacts with other parts. Not to mention, anatomy is only ONE of many areas that require artistic skill. Even if you have the figure down, you need to know how to compose it with the rest of the picture, how to do believable backgrounds (that actually look like a part of the picture), and any other number of objects in the picture. So, yes, it is worth it to improve IF that's what you want. In my opinion, it is very much worth doing, but whether or not it's worth it to you is a question you have to ask yourself. <br>
<br>
And I'd assumed, simply because you brought the question up to begin with, that you do want to improve. Just because your skill improves, doesn't mean you have to drastically change your style. Learning how things realistically look isn't going to hurt your drawings. You may see something you like (that you cannot see by copying or referencing other highly stylized artwork) that you'd like to incorporate into your own style, or you might just gain a new understanding of how something you already draw works while still drawing it similarly, but with more confidence and knowledge in how and why it moves the way it does. It isn't easy to try and apply yourself to learning this stuff, but if you really want to improve, you need to.  <p><html>

<br>
I have a pretty good handle on anatomy, I guess I forgot the reason why I started posting art on this board to begin with... it was for people to see my stuff and point out things that I may not be picking up on, so that my skills would improve. The critiques I've gotten from here and from DeviantART have certainly helped me improve quite a bit, and now I feel like a weight has been lifted because I know now what I must do:<br>
<br>
1. Stop stressing.<br>
2. Keep practicing, and study from life.<br>
3. Enjoy what I do without thinking about it too much.<br>
