MvC2 takes a good amount of skill, especially when it comes to using assists, guard crushes and such. From your statement it sounds like the people you play just use a lot of chipping damage to win matches. Many of the useful moves in the game aren't very flashy at all. On top of that the game is pretty faced paced, so there are lots of split-second decisions to be made; counters and snapbacks can be extremely useful if you know how to read your opponent. <p><i>

P.S with the KOF games, most of the characters come from some of their other games. That's why some of them are &quot;harder&quot; or &quot;different&quot;. Think about it, they aren't going to change the motions just for people that criticise them for being too hard. But you do find that most of the &quot;dashing barrage&quot; attacks are usually QCF HCB + attack button. I guess the different supers is just something you get used to. Or at least, i did. <p>"Either i shoot you or i shoot me.....Doesn't matter which, because we'll never hear from each other again"

Which is better!?!?!</span><hr size=1> Constant fireballs may be cheap, but it doesn't stop people doing it. The thing I dont like about standard moves on 2D games is that theyre usually only a few frames of animation, so they are finished very quickly meaning you end up back in the same position as you were before and you're open to attack again. The only standard attacks I often use are a jump kick followed by a sweep (which gives time to back off again as the opponent gets up). Then again I get the impression you're a lot better than me at these games, so perhaps you know some more complicated uses I dont understand yet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukai321.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kai321</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.namcoarcade.com/icons/icon_t4mlaw2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/27/02 8:32:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  re.</span><hr size=1> I would consider having quick animations a good thing, especially in a 2d game.  For example, if u pull off a sweep move just as your opponent jumps, you have a much better chance of correcting the situation as a fast character, like Ken or Chun-Li, than those with slow animations, such as Zangief.  Meaning if you're fast, you'll have a better chance of blocking or using an anti-air move (like the DP), instead of getting hit as you wait for your animation to finish. <br>
<br>
Fireballers are easy to deal with.  If a person uses cheap tactics like that, then that's a good indication that they don't know how to properly protect themselves.  Instead of groviling about it, capitalize on the situation and figure out a way to get the drop on 'em.<br>
<br>
Also, characters like Cammy are specifically made to be anti-shotokan fighters.  For example, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of her special moves (cannon drill, which goes under fireballs; cannon spike, which passes through them; hooligan combination, which has her flipping in an arc; and that twisting punch move, which also passes through fireballs), are made to deal specifically with shotokan specials (including fireballs<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  She also handy against other fighters since she's so drastically different from shoto's (whom everyone in the world's fimiliar with), and are less likely to suspect potential combos and sneaky tactics.<br>
<br>
Just remember, fighting games are just one big head game.  Standard attacks should become your main weapons and reserve specials and supers for specific events (such as when they jump in air or as counters) and for combos; or for sneaky tactics or if their just wide open <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukai321.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kai321</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.namcoarcade.com/icons/icon_t4mlaw2.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/27/02 8:35:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uvigilante8.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vigilante8</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/27/02 8:51:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rayshinkof.hpg.ig.com.br/gifs_gif_clark02.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Capcom or SNK?

compettion is what drives these games being better than the person next to you...that feeling of dominance...That feeling of playing someone better than yourself...thats My kind of fun.And thats why i learn everymove that character has and when to use them and maximize there uses.Oh and  emmit that move you where reffering to a that akuma and ryu do is called the raging demon and it takes a fair amout of skill to catch someone with it.and its not that hard to pull of either. <p><blockquote><hr>"If you lend someone a 20 and never see them again..Its probably worth it."<hr></blockquote></blockquote>

You talk about Ryu's classic combo - first move is jump in fierce punch - whats to stop a dragon punch at this point?<br>
Also your using the moves in a set sequence - you know what your going to do next before your opponent has even been hit rather than reacting to the situation. Its the same on Teken's chain throws too I know, so I'm not saying its only 2D fighters that do this.<br>
You ask how I expect to win without knowing all the specials? On most 3D games you can beat an opponent with just basic moves without ever using a special because its more about range and timing. I dont think you could say that for many 2D fighters.<br>
I agree with you about compitition being important though, I dont just want to win. I just enjoy using the skills needed for 3D fighters more.<br>
Basically I just think that the special moves should be toned down a bit to put the emphasis back on other things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukai321.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kai321</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.namcoarcade.com/icons/icon_t4mlaw2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/27/02 10:01:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sega-am2.co.jp/vf4/imgs/kage00.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Capcom or SNK?

That's the reason why fighting games are fun; the spotenaity (sp?).  What fun would a fighting game be if you knew everything that was going to happen?  How good u are in 2d games depends on how well u know your combos and can adapt them to any given situation.  2d games at their core are all about who gets the most amount of hits in the shortest amount of time- what better way to do it than to use combos?<br>

I didn't say you shouldn't memorize character moves, I said it made no sense to make memorizing them more difficult. If the motions were the exact same for each character (not the actual move, just the button combinations), then it would allow you to have more fun at the game, and not get confused if you're using a character with completely different combinations. And... playing a 5 year old wouldn't be fun at all, considering most of them would suck. I don't see what wanting the combinations to be easily remembered has to do with the skill level of your opponent.<br>

Um... Yes you can. It's not that hard to beat someone with just standard moves, but why would you? Special moves are what makes a character more unique, and give you some sort of advantage.<br>
<br>
Also, keep in mind (at least for Capcom games, dunno about SNK), that even standard moves have different attacks depending on the character. Characters like Dhalsim or Anakaris attack COMPLETELY differently than someone like Ryu. So even standard attacks are unique to each character. <p><table width=100% border=0>

The only way that would be likely is if he was extremely overpowered, so that if his moves were simple enough to do that everyone would use, and that's the exact opposite of balanced gameplay. I mean, if everyone had the exact same combinations, and everyone picked him, it would only be because they overpowered his character. <p><table width=100% border=0>

I agree with Al on this point.

Well overpowered characters are abundant in pretty much all fighters, 2d or 3d.  The most notable example for 3d fighters being that frikkin mofo Paul from Tekken <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ... ever since the first game, that guy was always given too much power (especially that annoying punch of his that knocks out seemingly 1/3rd of the lifebar!!!) <p>"Black is...

Also Stop bashing on paul damnit!<br>
Kai321 ever heard of countering?geez you people act like you cant stop paul at all.now sure his strong but his moves are so easy to see coming..well execpt his spin sweep elbow move which i use a lot.oh and that punch takes more off him wen you counter it.especialy that slow as death punch. <p><blockquote><hr>"If you lend someone a 20 and never see them again..Its probably worth it."<hr></blockquote></blockquote>

Eddy is the most annyoning character.<br>
Kai321 who do you use in tekken? becuase i dont see how paul is unbalanced.Hes got power but hes slow just.that seems balanced to me...even though hes not that slow.But even still its so easy to telegraph the phenix smasher you can just side step it and get a free 10 string. <p><blockquote><hr>"If you lend someone a 20 and never see them again..Its probably worth it."<hr></blockquote></blockquote>

And Paul? Pff, he may be strong but his moves are so useless. As for that big punch as soon as you hear him yell perform a counter (backwards and a throw). Its easy to do. You gotta play as Jin. Law is good too though, but some players become dependant on that one flip move. Any character will become annoying if you just do the same move over and over, but it will also make em easy to beat (this is another thing like real fighting which makes the game better). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukazuochitori.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KazuoChitori</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://genchi.xoasis.com/star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/28/02 4:04:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gallery.passion4art.com/members/genchix/laingel1.jpg height=160 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Capcom or SNK?

I use the man with the plan; the original master- Marshall Law.  Forest used to be the undespuded best player (for many reasons) in tekken 3, but since the 4th tourney Marshall has been toned down a lil bit.  The 3-punch combo of his has been slowed and has considerably less priority.  His deadly flip kicks now have much longer start-up and recovery times; meaning if u rely on nothing but flipkicks the whole time, u'll be a goner.  He may not be the most feared anymore, but he certainly is still the best character (or at least IMHO <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ).<br>
<br>
As for Paul, yeah he may be slow, but he still is faster than the plodding pace of King and that big UFC guy.  His moves aren't totally useless, but aren't as intuitive as other characters.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   My</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> big problem with Paul is the ridiculous amount of damage one takes from his moves (especially that lunging punch move).  It pisses me the f@#* off when I've been dominating the whole round just for him to make a big comeback within 2-3 moves.  <br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, while I was playing Tekken4 at work during break, this soccer-dad who never played the game before (he kept saying, 'Go ahead and beat me' and 'I don't even know what I'm doing'), beat me in one round with paul (though eventually I won 2-1 rounds).  <br>
<br>
So, I guess the moral of the story kids is if u are a beginner and want to win in Tekken 4 but aren't concerned about stuff like 'combos' or 'defense' or 'skills and abilities' choose Paul and prepared to be scorned apon by the likes of yours truly (no offense to anyone who actually tries to learn how to use paul<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
