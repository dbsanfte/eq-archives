Here's the first chapter of my newest tal. I know its somewhat massive but if you feel like reading it all...well...then...more power to ya! The story is hard to summerize but basically its about a world with extremly advanced technology and the chaos that ensues. <br>
<br>
Here ya go, sorry for any grammer mistakes..I'm lazy...<br>
<br>
It was amazing. Genesis stood silently, her large brown eyes reflecting the skyscrapers of the city. Ivory pillars reaching to the sky, towering above the roads that bustled with cars, running back and forth to wherever they were going. Genesis watched all this, her hands gripping the straps of her backpack. She was completely overwhelmed by this, her slightly trembling form occasionally jostled by the oncoming stream of foot traffic. Her eyes darted back and forth from each street sign that hung at crossways, trying to find her way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She had been so confident that she would find her Aunt’s home on her own, even though she had never been to the city, and now she was horribly lost. Nothing here looked familiar, nothing was even close to her home surroundings. Where in her home there was abundance of green this place was cold and white, sterile and without emotion. Her eyes welled up with tears of helplessness, certain that she would be lost forever within this metropolis.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun was quickly setting as Genesis wandered aimlessly, looking for someone who could help her. The sun drastically changed the appearance of the ivory city, transforming its spotless surfaces into glowing walls of light, the pale red of the sun reflected off the sparkling glass. Streetlights flicked on silently, casting a dead light on the cluttered sidewalk. Even as the sun set on the horizon people rushed about from place to place. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, the sun was completely gone and all went dark. Almost immediately as the last light faded the people who once crowded the sidewalks were gone. Genesis looked about in confuses, catching a quick glance of someone’s heel as they darted inside a nearby building. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They had all disappeared so quickly, but why? The streetlights gave off more than enough illumination. Where she used to live, her old home, the noise of people went well into the night, and businesses stayed well into the night, some of them even twenty-four hours. Her eyes darted across the suburban surroundings, clutching at the straps of her backpack. There must be something that caused all the people to flee so quickly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She walked farther and farther, trying in one last hope to find her destination. As she traveled the city became darker, and the tall skyscrapers seemed to close in around her. Genesis’ heart began to race faster and faster with each step, her skin crawling at the feeling of eyes on her back. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She turned a corner and walked past a dark alley, stopping only for a moment to look in. It was far to dark to see the end of the alley, so she quickly hurried on. A moment later she thought she heard footsteps. She turned and saw nothing. Gritting her teeth she walked on. She heard the steps again, picking up in speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis bolted, running as fast as she can. She ran blindly, far to terrified to look behind her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, her flight was stopped. She ran into something fairly solid and tumbled back. She opened her eyes quickly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A tall woman in a wine colored pea coat stood before her, a cold look in her crystal like eyes. A long sword sheath hung at her hip, and with one hand she brushed back a strand of errant brunette hair. Genesis smelled the fragrant scent of roses that followed her fall from the woman.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What are you doing out so late?” the woman asked coldly. “Don’t you know any better? Any pimp would jump at the chance to pick up someone so young,” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis stumbled back in surprise, the soft glow of the sky clearly reflected in her wide eyes. Above her the woman looked gigantic, more of a god than human. The woman’s face went into a frown and she casually turned away from Genesis, and began to walk off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For a moment she was silent, but quickly overcame her stupor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wait! Please!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman peered over her shoulder, a mildly interested look on her olive skinned face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know where I am,” began Genesis, her voice trembling. “Please, if you could just point me in the direction of Dolmen Boulevard I would be fine I’m sure-“<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You’re a newcomer aren’t you?” the woman interrupted. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Somewhat taken aback it took a moment for Genesis to reply.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, I used to live out on a island. I came to live with my aunt-“<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman cut her off once more with a sharp “Follow me,” Genesis did so, having to jog to keep up with the woman’s long gait. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After some time, Genesis bravely asked the woman’s name. The woman gave her a sidelong glance and after at time replied.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ensifer,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come again?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman rolled her eyes. “My name is Ensifer,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis nodded, still slightly confused.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where on Dolmen do you live?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis rummaged in her pocket for a moment and finally pulled out a piece of crumpled paper. She squinted her eyes, trying to read the writing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Uh..Its building 230, flat 4…I think…”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ensifer let out a quick snort of air in impatience and grabbed the paper away from a startled Genesis. She glanced at it for a moment and quickly handed it back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Flat 9, not 4”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis studied the numbers once more, and after a moment nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, when the sky had turned to an inky black Genesis’ building appeared before them. While walking towards her building, Genesis took the time to look skyward, though she was baffled by what she saw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why aren’t there any stars?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Its far to polluted,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmmm?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “There are to many toxins in the air for the light of the stars to be visible,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah…well…back home at night you can see billions of stars. They’re scattered across the sky like diamonds on crumpled velvet. It’s beautiful,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve never seen the stars,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My grandpa always used to point out pictures to us in the stars. Like Orion, and Leo, and the big dipper. He always used to say that you could tell the future just by looking at the position of the stars,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ensifer let out a small snort. “No one has a future here,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a moment of silence that seemed to drag on for an eternity. Genesis wished to ask what this statement had meant but the serious look on Ensifer’s face halted her every word.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, the two stood in front of Genesis’ building. She scampered up the stairs, and after a moment found her aunt’s name on the intercom. She called her and after explaining what had happened and after a moment of rebuff from her aunt she turned to wave good-bye to Ensifer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ensifer’s brows lay heavily on her face and her mouth was in a tight frown. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You should be careful of who you trust. You might just end up being taken away,”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Uh..I…what..” Before Genesis could finish the door to the building opened up and there stood Genesis’ aunt, her hands on her hips and frowning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, aunt Jade, I want you to meet Ensifer…”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Genesis turned quickly, but Ensifer was gone, her only trace being the light scent of roses.<br>
<br>

Is it the old lady, with her mysterious rose smell?  Or is it the girl, alone and confused in the large island?  Or perhaps the whole thing was a lead up to the aunt that is expecting the girl.  Also, where's this story going?
