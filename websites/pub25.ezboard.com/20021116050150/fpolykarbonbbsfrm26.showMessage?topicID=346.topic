<br>
<br>
<br>
The dark clouds sprank up out of Jon Hung's mind and into his dream. The wind whistled through the tall grass of the open field. The air was cold and the thunder broke the mid day silence. He saw a figure skipping happily through the open path picking flowers. She was a pretty woman, tall with blue eyes and brown hair. She kept a bright smile on her face, carefully choosing each flower as if they were for someone special. She looked his way and smiled while swinging her hair in the other direction. The warm feeling was broken as a shot rang through his ears. He turned to look at where it came from, but only could see a shadow vanashing in the presence of a large tree. He turned back to see that beautiful woman laying on the ground with blood on her chest, she was dead. The clouds got darker the air got heavier and the wind blew stronger. His feeling's churned furiously. Suddenly there was a black screen in front of his eyes and the ringing in his ears was gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter one:<br>
<br>
<br>
        The alarm clock beeped madly as 7:15 a.m. appeared in bright red numbers on the face of the clock. The sunlight bleeded through the curtains of Jon Hung's bedroom. He calmly turned and pushed the bed sheets aside. Glancing at the clock he jumped out of bed and onto the dirty carpet. He never cared how he lived,the floor was always covered with dirty cloths, coffee cups, and whatever else he felt like throwing on it. He walked over to the door grabbing his pants and favorite button up shirt. As he walked into the hall he remembered something. He turned and walked back into his room and over to his nightstand which his nephew made him for his birthday. He grabbed the metal handle and pulled out the drawer. He looked down to see his shiny new berreta 9mm pistol. He grabbed it and shoved it into the front of stomach in between his under shirt and his blue jeans. On the way out he grabbed his keys and a box of leftover donut holes and hurried out of the door. <br>
<br>
        Hung walked into the large apartment complex. The door slamed behind him catching everyone's attention. &quot;Your late&quot; said said a voice. He looked up to see Timothy Hanley glareing at him with a curious face. <br>
&quot;Get over it&quot; Hung said looking back with a grin. He never liked him. He always had something to say, and he was always the bosses pet. across the room where three other bounty hunters. It was a pretty big apartment. by the door was a huge table with each case file. Then each hunter had there own &quot;section&quot;. Hung walked over to his two partners, Forest Law and Mick Lang. Law was a tall man and well built. He had brown eyes and black spiky hair. He was not only Hungs partner but also his best friend, and had saved Law's hide more than once. Mick Lang was a medium sized man with a touch of nerd in him. He was a genuin genius. He had blue eyes and brown hair that was dyed at the tips. He was the computer expert and that was why he was along with them. &quot;Heres your coffee &quot; Law said handing him a cup of french vanilla cappacino. &quot;Thanks&quot; Hung said sipping it slowly.<br>
&quot;So what we got?&quot; Hung asked.<br>
&quot;Oh yeah, remember that that guy Thomas Hunt, the one we put the tracker bug on?&quot; Lang said looking up.<br>
&quot;Yeah&quot; said Hung<br>
&quot;Well he's dead.&quot; &quot;Gunshot wound to the head. A runner found his body laying in the fetal postion by the bay. The tracker bug, it was gone.&quot; Hung looked down to the ground in deep thought. <br>
&quot;How did they find that?&quot; he asked confusingly. &quot;It was virtually invisible to radar.&quot;<br>
Law looked up and surveyed the room curiously. <br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Hung asked. <br>
&quot;Nothing&quot; Law said. <br>
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Lang said. &quot;That guy Ricardo, at Ricardo's tires.<br>
&quot;The &quot;ID&quot; maker.&quot; Hung said grinning.<br>
&quot;Yeah,me and Law went to talk to him. He said a man that fits our description came in and wanted a fake passport made to china.&quot; <br>
&quot;China&quot; Hung exclaimed. &quot;What does a deadly million dollar assasin want with China.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Lang said.<br>
&quot;What else did he say?&quot; Hung asked with his eyes squinted looking down at Lang.<br>
&quot;Well after that his phone rang and we told him that we would be back.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok, now we got something.&quot; Hung said. &quot;Law me and you are going to talk to our pal Ricardo.&quot; <br>
&quot;Sure thing&quot; Law said grabbing his phone off the table. <br>
&quot;Lang you get me a small camera to set up at Ricardo's.&quot;<br>
Lang got up and walked over to the far side of the room and opened the closet. It was filled with small weapons and other equipment. He reached to the top shelf and pulled down a briefcase. He put the briefcase on the table and opened it. It was filled with video cameras and a mini disk under each one.<br>
&quot;This should do the job,&quot; he said taking a small camera out it's compartment. <br>
&quot;Put it somewhere high behind the counter.&quot; Lang said giving him the small camera. He took the mini disk and sliped it into the D drive of the laptop. &quot;And here is how we see what is happening&quot; he said moving away from the screen so everyone could see. A colored screen showed up reveling their surroundings on the computer. Hung moved the camera around testing out the picture.<br>
&quot;It looks good&quot; he said. Hung pointed the camera at Hanley who was sitting and doing a crossword puzzle. <br>
&quot;Yuck,&quot; Hung said. &quot;Tim, you might want to get rid of that large zit.&quot; Hanley looked up mumbling under his breath as they all laughed. <br>
<br>
        The bell above the door rang as the two bounty hunters walked through the glass door at &quot;Ricardo's Tires.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ricardo, my man,&quot;Law said holding up his hands. <br>
&quot;Whats up guys,&quot; Ricardo said sweating nervously. <br>
Ricardo was a small Mexican man With black hair.<br>
&quot;Relax,&quot; Hung said, We aren't gonna bust you. We just want to find out more about the guy who wanted a passport to China.&quot;<br>
&quot;Look I told you everything I know.&quot; Ricardo said. &quot; You told me to call you if a man like that ever walked in so I did.&quot; <br>
&quot;Ricardo why do I feel like your hiding something from us?&quot; Law asked.<br>
&quot;I swear I told you everything I know.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ricardo, since you are our snitch, you are entitled to tell us everything you know when we ask.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok&quot; Ricardo said taking a deep breath.&quot;He told me he would give me an extra ten grand if I had the passport ready in two days.&quot; <br>
&quot;Two days,&quot; Hung asked curiously.<br>
&quot;What time is he coming to pick them up?&quot; Law asked curiously.<br>
&quot;Four o'clock P.M. on wed.&quot; Ricardo said. Law looked over to Hung and nodded.<br>
&quot;Ricardo,&quot;Lang said. &quot;Let's go take a look at some of your work. He put his arm on Ricardo's shoulder as they walked to the back. Ricardo nervously looked back at Hung. Hung walked over behind the counter and looked up on the wall. There was a picture of Ricardo and another man shaking hands. Hung took out a small knife and cut a hole in the middle of it where it was black. He took the camera out of his pocket and carefully shoved it in the hole. It blended perfectly. He reached in his pocket and pulled out his cellphone, hit number one on the keypad. <br>
&quot;Hows that look?&quot; he asked. <br>
&quot;Good&quot; said Lang. Law and Ricardo walked back to where Hung was standing.<br>
&quot;See ya Wed.&quot; Law said as the two men walked out of the door.<br>
<br>
Chapter two:<br>
<br>
        It was a dark, rainy day. The air was humid and thick. It was the ideal day to bust a big time criminal.It was Wed. afternoon and the main focus for every swat member, detective, and bounty hunter was Ricardo's Tire Shop. <br>
&quot;Is everyone in position&quot; Hung whispered quietly into the transmitter clipped to his long trenchcoat. Hung was in one of the chairs in front of the counter. <br>
He was dressed in a trenchcoat with dark black pants on, and a tire magazine in front of his face. <br>
&quot;Lang when I give you the sign through the camera send in the Swat team.&quot; Hung whispered. <br>
&quot;Gotcha&quot; Lang said. Ricardo stood behind the counter whistleing softly. He had no idea what was going on. <br>
&quot;Ok, we got a dark black Lincoln pulling up in the parking lot.&quot; Law said over the ear piece. Hung peered outside of the window to see three men getting out of the car. The man in the middle had his hat in front of his face and a black coat on and was holding a briefcase. There were two men next to him with tight black shirts on, and muscles purtrouding out. <br>
&quot;Is it him&quot; Law asked over the earpiece. <br>
&quot;I don't know, his hat is covering his face.&quot; Hung replied. The man on the right opened the door letting the other two in. The middle man aproached the counter and slammed something on the counter.<br>
&quot;Follow me,&quot; Ricardo said walking down the hall. Their backs were turned and they were looking at the table where Ricardo does his &quot;second job.&quot; Hung threw the magazine down, pulled out his berreta, and raised it up. &quot;Freeze Rikima&quot; Hung said looking straight. The men did not move. &quot;Your done for,Put your hands above your head.&quot; The man in the middle started to raise his hands when the door busted open and the Swat team ran in pointing at them. He jerked the briefcase down and reveled an assult rifle. Hung dove to the ground as gunshots zipped through the room. The two body guards pulled out pistols and started shooting at the Swat members. The loud shots put ringing in his ears as He looked up , quickley aimed at the bodygaurd's head, and shot two rounds. Causing him to take his last breath. Rikima stopped fireing and ran out the back. <br>
&quot;He is going out the back&quot; he yelled through the earpiece. The two body gaurds lay dead along with three Swat members. Hung ran through the back hallway with his gun in his hand. The ran was pounding hard and the lightning was cracklin. &quot;Where is he,&quot; he yelled over the earpiece.<br>
&quot;I am chasing him through a yard, about to be on front street.&quot; Hung ran over to the back ally behind Ricardo's tires. He tried to control his breathing as his track coach taught him to in tenth grade. Taking each step and releasing a breath. He had a sharp pain in his right abdomen. He squinted trying to run it off. Then he remembered his dream about his wife and that made him run faster and suddenly the pain was gone. The ally was messy and full of trash. As Hung ran by the homeless people glared at him. One man in particular stared at him straight in the eyes. There was something about him that looked familar. He ran out onto front street and stopped looking down the long street. The road was empty and wet. Not a soul could be seen through the beads of rain pounding down. Suddenly to figures began to run down the street. He squinted his eyes trying to make them out. It was Law and Rikima and they were moving straight towards them. Hung took out his gun and aimed in the direction of where the two men ran down the street. As they got closer Hung calmly walked up with his gun straight in front of his eye. Rikima ran until he seen Hung holding up his piece. He turned around trying to run back. Law stuck out his foot causing him to nail the ground. Hung pointed his gun down at Rikima's head &quot;Your under arrest.&quot; Hung said. Law was bending over trying to catch his breath.&quot;Turn around and let me see your face before you go to jail.&quot; Rikima took off his hat and turned around showing his face. It was not Rikima.<br>
&quot;What, who are you?&quot; Hung asked in suspense. Law looked over in shock. <br>
&quot;This whole thing was a setup.&quot; Law said. The man laughed madly.&quot; Rikima is going to attack somewhere else.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where is his next target?&quot; Hung asked. His hair was drenched and droopy. <br>
&quot;See for yourself.&quot; the man said looking up behind Hung. Hung turned around and looked into the window of an office building to see a sniper rifle pointing at his head.<br>
&quot;Watch out,&quot;Law said pushing Hung out of the way and taking the bullet in the leg. Blood shot on on to the wet earth. There was a loud scream coming from Law as he hit the ground. The man on the ground took off down the wet street. Hung grabbed his pistol and fired three rounds at the running pretender. He fell to the ground with his eyes closed. Law was on the ground lamenting. Hung pulled out his phone and dialed Lang's number.<br>
&quot;Laws been shot, send an ambulance.&quot; He said slaming down the phone. He picked up Law and carried him under the overhang of a barber shop. <br>
&quot;You ok,&quot; Hung said, looking at the wound. It was big and bloody. <br>
&quot;How does it look?&quot; Lang asked looking up.<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; Hung said.&quot;I owe you my life.&quot; Thanks for saving my neck again.&quot; Hung said looking down. The ambulance raced up the street and darted into the sidewalk next to the barber shop. The men ran up to Law with a stretcher. Hung walked over to the dead man pretending to be Rikima and kicked his side in anger. <br>
<br>
        Hung calmly walked through the office door. Law followed on his crutches. He looked at the hanging clock on the wall, 3:30 AM on thurs. <br>
&quot;Well since it is early lets just stay here and do some data crunching.&quot; Law said proping his leg up on the desk. <br>
&quot;Anyone know what happened to Ricardo?&quot; Hung asked.<br>
&quot;Yeah, he's dead,&quot; Lang said. &quot;Seems he was killed in the ally right before you made it to front street.&quot; Hung shoke his head in grief.<br>
&quot;To many deaths are happening to soon.&quot; Law said. &quot;We gotta bag this guy.&quot;<br>
Everyone looked at each other. <br>
&quot;Does anyone know what happened to Tim?&quot; Hung asked. &quot;what case is he on.&quot;<br>
&quot;He is hunting down a drug dealer.&quot; Law said. Hung had a deep memory, Thomas Hunt was killed with the tracker bug removed. Ricardo, the other snitch, Killed. Then Hung rememerd the homeless man who looked familar. Hung jumped up and walked over to the table where the documents of the case were. He opened up the folder and tabbed through the papers until he came upon the picture of Rikima. It was a perfect match. The homeless person was Rikima, and he killed Ricardo in the ally. But thats not all. There was someone working from the inside. Hung walked over to where Lang and Law were sitting. He covered the paper so only they could see it. This apartment is bugged,he wrote. Lang and Law looked at him laughing in the inside. Hung got up and walked out of the room, the others followed. They stopped outside the door and stood on the red carpet in the hallway. The place is bugged. I figured it out, lets go to my place.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 3:<br>
<br>
<br>
        The three men walked into the messy house of Jon Hung. Law sat on the couch while Lang and Hung sat around the kitchen table. <br>
&quot;I got it all figured out, well most of it.&quot; &quot;First off there is a camera in the office. Second there is a leak in the office who put the camera there. Each one of our snitches where killed the same way, a gunshot. One of them had a tracker hooked to him. They found out some how and killed him. A hobo in the ally caught my attention as I ran by, he looked familar. Somebody I have seen before. I seen this man in a composit sketch done by one of the witnesses to one of his murders. That man was Rikima Loi, a deadly assasin in which we have been looking for for about five months. He new we were there and I have a good idea of who it is.&quot; <br>
&quot;Who.&quot; Law asked.<br>
&quot;Timothy Hanley.&quot; He said smiling.<br>
&quot;Get me a tracker bug,Lang. Law me and you are gonna tail this sucker all day on Sat. so don't make any plans.&quot;<br>
&quot;Gotcha.&quot; Law replied.<br>
<br>
        It was a bright day the cumulus clouds let the sun burst through them. The streets were busy,the woman were going shopping, the men were taking their sons fishing. It was your average Sat. . &quot;Lang you setup?'' Hung asked through the walkie talkie. <br>
&quot;Ya, i'm ready.&quot; Lang replied from Hung's house. <br>
Law sat in the passenger seat looking at a gun magazine. <br>
The air was silent, they waited for three solid hours across the street from Hanley's small Acadian home. Finally he walked out dressed in a sports coat and pants, holding a briefcase. Law spotted him throwing down his magazine. <br>
&quot;Lets do this.&quot; Hung said with the walkie talkie in front of his mouth. Hanley got into his new mercades bends and pulled out of the driveway. They followed him to an art museum, where he got out of the car. Hung pulled a pen out of his chest pocket and twisted the top. A small green light appeared on the pen top. <br>
&quot;How's that look?&quot; he asked through the walkie talkie. <br>
&quot;Perfect&quot; Lang replied. <br>
&quot;From now on you'll have to talk to Law while I am inside the museum.&quot; Hung said as he gave the walkie talkie to Law and slammed the door. <br>
        The museum was quiet. The air was still. You could only hear the footsteps of the young art students examing each piece and recording notes into a notebook. It was bright, the light bounced off of the floor tiles and into the glass cases arranged in an orderly fashion. Hung followed Hanley up stairs into a large room where only people with special passes could go through. Hanley showed his pass and walked through.<br>
&quot;Sir do you have a pass?&quot; the man asked. He was a Cuban looking man about five foot seven.<br>
&quot;What is this &quot;special&quot; room for.&quot; Hung asked.<br>
&quot;It is art work for the higher class to view while eating a superb meal by the finest chefs around.?&quot; the man said. Hung looked at him like he was nuts. <br>
&quot;Ok, Hung said turning the corner down the hallway. He stopped at the end and knocked on the wall loudly. The man turned the corner to see what was going on, when Hung reacted with a neck punch knocking the man out. He looked around to see if anyone had noticed. He pulled a chair up and sat the man in it, resting his head on the wall. Hung turned and entered the room. There was tables set up around a grill where the chefs were a work grilling food. There was a sweet odor to the air. Hanley sat at a table with another man. The man was short, and had a black beard. Hung did not recognize him. The two men talked for hours while Hung sat at a table accross the room getting everything on tape. When there conversasion was ended Hanley got up, shoke the man's hand and began out the door. As he walked out of the door he glanced at Hung who had the menu in front of his face, and kept walking. Hung looked at the man who Hanley was talking to. Before He arrived the man had no briefcase. Now he was left with the same briefcase Hanley had when he walked in. Hung calmly stood up and walked to the table the man was sitting at. <br>
&quot;What's in the briefcase?&quot; Hung asked. The man looked up with a puzzled look.<br>
&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; the man said. Hung looked around to see if anyone was looking and pulled out his berreta.<br>
&quot;Someone who is gonna put you on the news toinght if you don't tell him what is in the case.&quot; Hung said grinding his teeth. The man looked at him with a confused look and reached in his coat pocket.<br>
&quot;Don't be stupid.&quot; Hung said cocking his gun. &quot;Let's take a walk.&quot; he said. pulling the man out of his chair. The other guest looked at him with big eyes as he walked him out with a gun on his back. He walked him out of the musem and into the parking lot. Lang looked out of the car window as they approached. Hung shoved the guy onto the steaming car hood with his face smushed against the glass. <br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Hung asked in a nonpatient voice.<br>
&quot;Your mama.&quot; the man said. Hung grabbed his hair and pulled his head back.<br>
&quot;I asked you a question, Who are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Like I said before your......&quot; Hung jamed his face into the car hood. He heard a faint pop as the man connected.<br>
&quot;You broke my nose.&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;Oh did I?&quot; Hung asked sarcasticaly. As Hung went to ask him again He saw a black van with a man in the front holding a sub-machine gun,coming out of the ally behind the building. <br>
&quot;Get down,&quot; he yelled to Lang. Lang ducked under the seat while Hung threw the man on the ground and got behind the car. Bullets shot the threw the air from the van. Hung looked out to see the van come to a slow speed. The man got up and hurried into the back seat. Hung looked over the side of the car, to see about five men sitting in the back holding machine guns. The van accelerated and sped down the parking lot.<br>
&quot;You ok?&quot; Hung asked Lang.<br>
&quot;Yea I'm fine.&quot; Lang replied sitting back up. <br>
&quot;We almost found out where thier hideout was.&quot; Hung said shaking his head. He got up and procceded into the shot up car.<br>
<br>
&quot;At least we know Hanley is in on it.&quot;Law said sitting up. Hung turned the keys and started the car. <br>
&quot;Tommorow we bust him,&quot; Hung said driving away.<br>
<br>
        &quot;We seen Hanley yesterday making a deal with one of them.&quot; Hung explained to his supervisor. <br>
&quot;Where is he now?&quot; Captian Bruce Stelly asked. <br>
&quot;We don't know&quot; Law said.&quot;he did not come in today. <br>
&quot;Good work, guys, now go find him.&quot; Stelly said. The three men quietly walked out of the room. They walked into Hung's house when his phone began to ring. <br>
&quot;Yea,&quot; Hung said. Their was a pause.<br>
&quot;Now you are trying to screw with my men.&quot; a voice said. It was a scratchy and faint voice. <br>
&quot;Who is this?&quot; Hung said.<br>
&quot;Your shadow.&quot; the voice said hanging up the phone.<br>
&quot;It was him, Hunt said.&quot; that was the assasin.<br>
&quot;What did he say?&quot; Lang asked. <br>
&quot;Nothin.&quot; Just that he was my shadow. Hung glanced outside to see three small figures through the shades. He turned back not thinking nothing of it. Then realized what he was seeing. &quot;Get down!&quot; He yelled shoveing the two men behind his kitchen counter. Bullets shot through the air and into all of Hung's belongings.<br>
Hung pulled out his pistol and hurried through his back door. The loud roar of the machine guns was still heard. Hung ran around the corner into the front yard. He took the three men by surprise. Pulling the trigger twice, he put two rounds in the first one's chest. The other two turned around facing Hung. Two shots were heard and the two men fell to the ground. Law walked out with one cruch under is arm, and his pistol in his other hand. <br>
&quot;Thanks&quot; Hung said. He began walking to the men when he felt a sharp pain on the back of his head. After that all went blank.<br>
<br>
Chapter 4:<br>
<br>
        Hung's eyes opened. He squinted but could not see more than a blur. His eyes began to focus in on his surroundings. He was in some sort of garage. Men dressed in black holding machine guns were everywhere. He heard his partners behind him. They were untied.<br>
&quot;Guys, cut my rope.&quot; Hung said, shaking his head. They laughed as they were enjoying it. &quot;Guys, what are ya'll doing?&quot; <br>
&quot;Oh Jon, i guess you can't take a hint.&quot; Law said.&quot;lets just say me and Lang got paid to work for the biggest assasin in the United States of America. Hung shook his head in confusment.<br>
&quot;You mean....&quot; Hung began.<br>
&quot;Surprise, &quot;Lang said.<br>
&quot;I trusted you with my all.&quot; Hung said in an angry voice.<br>
&quot;I know.&quot; Law said laughing. <br>
&quot;But your leg.&quot; Hung said looking down. <br>
&quot;Oh please that was just a blank and the blood was cornsyrup.&quot; Law laughed.<br>
&quot;Glad you could make it.&quot; a voice said behind him. It was Timothey Hanley. <br>
&quot;You see,&quot;Lang began.&quot;Our friend Hanley is the &quot;Big Time Assasin&quot; you have been looking for.&quot;<br>
&quot;It is amazing how much a little face paint and fake facial hair with change your whole appearence.&quot; Hanley said. Hung shook his head in disbelife of what was happening.<br>
&quot;Let me explain.&quot; Hanley said.&quot;A fairly long time ago, you started coming on to me. So i decided I was going to cancel you for good. I waited until you were in a public place. I belive it was a park of somesort. Oh well I don't remember. But just as I pulled the trigger, your wife skipped right in the way. I was then going to kill you but decided your wife's death would be enough to keep you down for a little while. After that I went to your two partners and offered them ten-thousand to work for me. So you see it looks like you were alone the whole time.&quot; Hung began to pull away at the ducktape around his wrist. He twisted it until one hand was free. He acted like he was still tied up to the chair. <br>
&quot;Sorry but now you gotta die.&quot; Law said smiling and holding up his pistol. Hung threw his hands around hard choping at Law's arm in two different directions causing it to break. His pistol fell and Hung caught it. Raising it up he shot Law twice in the chest. Hanley began to run. Hung ran and jumped behind a metal rack. Bullets from the machine guns ricoched around the large building. <br>
&quot;Stop, you idiots.&quot; Lang said walking to where Hung was.&quot;bullets bouce off of metal, you wanna kill us all.&quot; Hung jumped up and shot Lang twice in the head. Machine gun fire started again. Hung jumped up and shot twice at the men. One man fell. Hung ran aroud the huge rack standing next to him. He picked up one of the machine guns and began to fire into the crowd of men. They fired back. bullets whized by his head. He ducked down. He surveyed his room. On the shelf was a box filled with styfrofoam. He picked it up and threw it into the rain of gun fire. As it flew accross the room the men fired at it. Hung ran out, sliding across the floor he pulled his trigger causing all of the men to fall. He stood lup and ran to the direction which Hanley ran. Inside he was burning with hatered of the whole situation. Everyone was against him. He burst through the door and out into the night. The two buildings made it a bottleneck for him. He looked but could see no sign of Hanley. He began to walk down the path. A noise was heard behind him. Just as he turned he heard a bullet hit the ground by his feet. He quickley turned his head. Looking up on the rooftop of another building he saw Hanley with his rifle. He shot two rounds at him but missed. Hanley turned and began to run. Hung quickley surveyed his surounding. When he was a teenager he studied martial arts and learned to adapt to his surroundings. Hung ran his fastest. He ran kicking one wall and bouncing to the other and kicking himself to the roof. Hanley began down the stairs. Hung fired the machine gun but missed. He pursued after Hanley. Running down the stairs and into the street. No cars were in sight. Hanley turned around and fired his rifle catching Hung in the arm. Hung fired the machine gun hitting Hanley in the stomach. He fell to the ground. Hung walked over and kicked him in the side. A scream came out from Hanley.<br>
&quot;That was for my wife.&quot; Hung said. He aimed his gun at him.<br>
&quot;You can't shoot me. You have to take me in. It is against the Law.&quot; Hanley said laughing. Hung looked at him in the eyes and held the trigger down for a brief three seconds. &quot;I am the Law.&quot;<br>
