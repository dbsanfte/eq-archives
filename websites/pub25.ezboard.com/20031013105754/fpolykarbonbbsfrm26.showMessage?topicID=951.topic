It's just up to the point where Jack and Dan find Lilly after Dan finsihes his little speech on Diane.  I know there's a few style inconsistancies but... I'm really looking for a psychological perspecitve.<br>
<br>
<br>
        A tall brown-haired man with a slightly dark complexion leaned impatiently on the door of a large, rust-festering shipping truck.  His carried a shotgun that was an ever faithful companion with gloved hands &quot;What are you waiting for, we're already late, Jack?&quot;  Dan asked annoyed.  A large man stood in the door way of the shipping office, his short blonde hair danced in the breeze.  He rapidly stuffed away a few papers before breaking into a jog and hoping into the driver's side seat.  The sky was bright and clear, almost cheery, never hinting at what would happen a few hours later.  <br>
<br>
        The rain poured down in sheets out from the darkness, creating ever-changing pattern of impact marks on the windshield.  Jack rolled up the window with his left hand, his right hand held a stack of papers in coffee stained water proof coverings.  The arm of the Republican Checkpoint rose sharply and Jack stepped on the gas.  &quot;Fifteen minutes, does it really have to take them that long, I mean... common,&quot; Jack complained looking tired.  &quot;They are Republicans you know,&quot; Dan replied, his hands gingerly fingering the shotgun that sat in his lap, &quot;Oh, how they love their damn paper work.&quot;  The headlights of the truck pierced through the darkness and illuminated the road ahead like a sentry with a flashlight.  Water glistened wet everywhere, amplifying the strange shadows that danced about the sparsely wooded edges of the road.  &quot;I wonder if they get paid well...&quot; Dan wondered aloud.  Jack replied with a sullen tone after a brief pause, &quot;... more than us probably.&quot;  There was a jolt as the truck passed over one of the many bumps along the unpaved road.  <br>
<br>
        Dan looked out the window, fantasizing about the lovely blonde unattainable maiden that he so wished to befriend but could only achieve that in his wildest dreams.  Though, that wouldn't really stop him from trying to make those dreams a reality.  Dan sat there looking into the cold darkness reviewing the what if's that floated about.  &quot;Thinking about Diane again?&quot; Jack asked his day dreaming friend.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; Dan sighed as visions of Diane grinning at him danced in his mind.  &quot;Even if she did want you, her mom would never allow it.  I mean, you're the only one that I know of that her mom hates more than me, the friend of the idiot brother of the successful rich brother who is pretty the second richest guy around these parts.&quot;  The more logical part of Dan's brain took over and determined that it was impossible and slowly dragged it away and deposited it into a more remote area of his mind.  &quot;But can you blame me?&quot; Dane sighed, his eyes still transfixed on the droplets of rain that slammed themselves on the glass in a slightly suicidal fashion.  &quot;No, not really,&quot; Jack began the lumbering truck into a turn.  &quot;She's just so... &quot; Dan searched for just the right words and failed in the endeavor, &quot;amazingly, fantastically beautiful and so perfect.&quot;  <br>
<br>
        Jack looked at Dan and in his own way, replied, &quot;She's also fairly spoiled and self centered.  Oh, and she also has that bad temper that comes from her mother's side.&quot;  Dan looked at his friend who was now back to staring at the road.  &quot;Everyone has short comings.&quot;  Dan stretched in his seat.  &quot;Face it man, you're not going to make it with her, she's not your type anyway,&quot; Jack concluded abruptly.  &quot;Easy for you to say, you don't have to see her going gah-gah over your best friend,&quot; Dan mumbled, slightly peeved.  &quot;And, what does that exactly mean?&quot; though, Jack already knew.  &quot;You know what I mean, she's in love with you.  You're the one that she finds time to be around and tries to be alone with whenever she can be.&quot;  Jack thought about the accusations, they weren't too far from the truth.  Diane did like him, he knew that very well, but they were only, good friends at the most.  &quot;I've never really noticed,&quot; lied Jack.  &quot;Don't give me that, man,&quot; Dan sounded sick of the conversation.  Jack shifted his attention back onto the barren stretch of soggy road and saw something huddled amidst the rain in the distance.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Do you see that?&quot; Jack automatically asked Dan.  Dan turned and looked.  There was a small figure, illuminated by the head lights, huddled in the middle of the road barely visible.  The mound of unknown origins sat there still.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Dan, slightly surprised.  Jack slowed the truck down and observed it.  Was it a large rock?  No, rocks just don't pick themselves up and then decide to sit in the middle of the road by themselves.  Was it an animal?  Probably not, animals tend to either bolt at the sound or just sit there and stare, petrified by the mysterious light.  They were fairly close now, a few meters and by now, Jack could see that it was a form of a small person, perhaps a child, huddled and covered by some type of fabric.  The bundle rotated itself to see what was producing the light.  &quot;It's a kid,&quot; Dan concluded.  They could both see the face as it turned to face the truck and shield it's eyes.  It was a little girl from what the two men could tell, young and no more than nine she staggered back and slipped, still shielding her shimmering eyes from the intense light.<br>
<br>
        The gigantic thing halted a short distance in front of Lilly, the bright lights turned off and the little elf girl lowered her arm.  Two creatures, who appeared to be the basters of this great behemoth that sat before her, exited it.  Lilly was to petrified to move, all she could do was sit there amidst in falling rain, waiting, wondering of what would become of her and what became of her parents.  She head a click, obscured by the incessant beating of the rain, as a powerful beam of light shot out of what appeared to be the creature's hand.  A giant circle of light covered the ground then surrounded Lilly, again she had to conceal her face, again she thought of her mother.  &quot;Hey!  Are you okay?&quot;  A voice from one of the creatures echo with concern through the darkness.  A tall man ran out of the darkness.  Lilly, her heart beating in her throat, was too scared to twitch, she only watched and waited.  The man knelt down and now she could see his face now, concerned and young, he had short blonde hair and gentle blue eyes, just like her father.  He reached out, extended his large arm out towards her.  &quot;Don't touch me!&quot; She slapped his hand away and scurried backwards a few steps on all fours, half sliding in the mud on her back with the look of sheer terror etched in her youthful face.  The man withdrew after a brief moment of shock.  &quot;I'm not going to hurt you little girl,&quot; he said compassionately.  Fear had impaired her motor skills again and tried get up and dart away but couldn't.  The man tried again but Lilly retreated out of reach.  The other man was not standing behind the kneeling man, holding the light that bathed her.  &quot;What's your name little girl, I'm Jack.&quot;  &quot;Lll-l-illy,&quot; Lilly stammered, her eyes seem to be affixed on Jack for the longest time.  &quot;Okay, that's a nice name, don't be scared please, I'm not going to hurt you Lilly, let me help you up.&quot; Jack's gentle voice tickled her long, slender ears that lay tangled in her mud-caked hair.  Jack extended his hand and, slowly, hesitantly, reached for his large hand.<br>
<br>
        Lilly was shivering all over, as Jack pulled her to her feet.  His head was filled with questions of concern.  It's out of the ordinary to find people, especially defenseless little girls, out on this dangerous and deserted road to Stove Pipe.  The little girl only stood up to his waist.  No more than nine indeed he thought.  Her eyes were strangely large, almost freakishly huge in fact, but Jack paid no attention to this fact, he was too concerned with her getting pneumonia or something, she looked like she'd been out in the rain all night.  &quot;Where are your mommy and daddy?&quot; Jack asked, his eyebrows arched in an upside down 'U'.  For a moment, Lilly remained silent and looked down with her abnormally large and sullen eyes in a way that could compelled anything to despair.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; She said  despondently.  &quot;Lets get you somewhere warm.  Okay?&quot;  Jack gestured and smiled.  She gathered her muddy cloak and wrapped herself in it.  &quot;Are you lost kid?&quot; asked Dan, worried.  The tiny child replied with a disparaging shake of her head.  With that, the three began trudging toward the truck. <p>The existance of Canada has neither been confirmed nor denied by the United States Government.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismrx>PrismRX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freewebsitehosting.net/websites/OneWingedAngel/JackAvatar.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 3/9/03 4:03:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cheezeman8588>cheezeman8588</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/22/03 8:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=951.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First 2 pages of...

Dont worry, the only one reading the article is my teacher. Anywho, the story is nice, but i think you need to start out w/ something besides &quot;A tall brown-haired&quot; yadayadayada. You need to grab our attention. I dont usually read stories looking for stuff about &quot;A tall brown-haired man with a slightly dark complexion leaned impatiently on the door of a large, rust-festering shipping truck.&quot; Do something to attract us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blackrain704>blackrain704</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/25/03 6:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=951.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.endoropolis.org/sampizzacat/teyandee/fa17.jgp height=150 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First 2 pages of...

Anywho... I like it alot. I really like your way of describing things. I can really pictures the scene in my head as I read. I especially like the way you described Lilly's eyes. Something about it sounded really cool. Try giving a touch more background info in the beginning. Just a little to get us interested. <br>
