<br>
The regular disney cartoon may be for children.. but anime is a different ball game and can be for all ages (and imo a lot is aimed at teenagers). <br>
<br>
The bottom line is that people who think cartoons are for children only are morons.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinfire>Sinfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://sin.emeraldwinter.com/graphics/link.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/20/03 12:01:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themightyservo>The Mighty Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/20/03 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2357.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/cmayer/images/servo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cartoons are for children?</span><hr size=1> Well, I'd say it's a product of the &quot;normal&quot; target audiences in a certain country. In Japan, anime and manga (cartoons and comic books essentially) span basically every genre you can think of. From fluffy kids shows to hardcore porn, the Japanese make anime and manga to cover it.<br>
<br>
In the U.S. you have very few animated programs and movies *not* targeted at kids. You have your Fox animated shows (Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, King of the Hill), occasional stuff like Aeon Flux or Beavis and Butt Head. Scattered movies like Heavy Metal (and Heavy Metal 2000), Wizards, Spirits Within, etc. <br>
<br>
Most animation, however, is directed at kids (or &quot;all ages&quot; since some are pretty entertaining regardless). Disney movies, Don Bluth movies, most of Cartoon Network's programming, Nickelodeon programming, Fox Kids, etc. <br>
<br>
Comics are a different game here too. Since most are still confined to the spandex-clad superhero genre, the appeal is limited. Some are very adult now, but still it's just not the same. Japan  you've got all ages and walks of life reading manga, which is considered cheap, disposable entertainment. Comics here are expensive and collectible. <br>
<br>
With the current generation growing up with anime as &quot;normal&quot;<br>
and knowing that animation spans all age groups, you'll see that stigma disappear. It's just hard to shake an image that's been set into people's minds since *they* were kids. If all you'd ever seen was Disney specials and Looney Tunes, you'd think that way too. <br>

If you actually watch them, you'll realize how many verbal jokes (actually most of them) are meant for an adult audience.<br>
<br>
No kids will understand the jokes in a Disney cartoon (and many other cartoons), they simply laugh because of the silly animations or actions that are going on.<br>
<br>
But then again, I wouldn't consider anime a cartoon, because by definition a cartoon has to be humourous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themightyservo>The Mighty Servo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/20/03 8:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2357.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/cmayer/images/servo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cartoons are for children?</span><hr size=1> Oh, I watch Disney movies (and enjoy them), but witty dialogue doesn't change that the plots are designed to be followed by 6 year olds. <br>
It's like those &quot;suggested for 18 and up&quot; things they flash before Adult Swim show. It's not the content in anime that weirds um, &quot;old people&quot; out...it's that it's coming from a *cartoon* (or animation, whatever). Series that they edit to be shown after midnight on CN would be shown on primetime if they were live action. Perhaps &quot;for kids&quot; isn't the correct terminology rather that &quot;safe&quot;. If memory recalls, the first Disney movie to show blood was Tarzan...and I can only think of a couple with any kind of cursing (Secret of NIMH for one (one word)...Titan AE perhaps as another, though that was PG-13). Good always wins, and very few characters die. That sort of thing. <br>
That's why you have parents that complained about Spirited Away being &quot;scary&quot; and walking out of Princess Mononoke in the first 5 minutes. They thought it would be totally harmless and &quot;safe&quot; for their young kids. Like almost all animation since the beginning of the industry in America would be. Establish a 50+ year precedent, and yeah, people will have a certain mindset...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for anime not being cartoons...well, yes and no. I agree with your definition...but last I checked, Spawn wasn't too humorous, but it's still called a comic book (unless in collected form, then it's a &quot;graphic novel&quot;). So the terms are misused anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I guess cartoons have been aimed at children for so long that any other kind of animation is thought of as for kids.  But thats like say that all action movies are aimed at one audience or even that all live action moives are aimed at one audience. <br>
<br>
Anyway these days if i meet anyone who has the view that animation is for children then i refer then to the animatrix which are brillant animations aimed at everyone.<br>

umm acording to miamipanda its kinda expencive, that and they are in the middle of a financial slump where 1 in 25 people are unemployed and people under the age of 25 have a ratio of 1 in 8, so moving to japan would be one serious monetrey gamble<br>

<br>
Cartoons, either western or eastern in nature, are neither just for kids or mostly for adults.  <br>
<br>
I'm still not certain why so many people believe that Disney released animations are for kids, when I believe Disney releases much of them as being family entertainment.<br>
<br>
There is no black and white in the world of animation.  Everyone all around the world is making animations for people in all walks of life.  <br>
<br>
