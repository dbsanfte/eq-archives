<br>
The gnoll started to move.  Knowing for certain that the gnoll was attempting to flank us and get in a better position (i.e - didn't want another group to get it) I decided I had to end its stealthy manuevering so as to protect my casters.<br>
<br>
I carefully root the gnoll in place, knowing it will give my casters ample time to rest.  I start plunking at the gnoll, laughing at it and its feeble attempt to outsmart me.  I knew the root would break soon, and warned my party to be ready for the now vulnerable gnolls direct assault.  My instincts were right.  The gnoll broke free of my entanglement.<br>
<br>
&quot;LOOK OUT HE'S COMING RIGHT FOR US&quot;<br>
<br>
All of the sudden, two more gnolls popped up as the leader called in reinforcements (see strategy section later in post).  Before we knew it, the one gnoll had turned into three.  I rooted the first so as to keep the odds at a decent level.  A lesser experienced druid tried to root another multiple times, but was not crafty enough to figure entangle any moer of the beasts.  <br>
<br>
No problem, as I knew my entanglement on teh other gnoll would last long enough to allow my group to dispatch at least one of the other gnolls.  I was right.  We mangled one quickly, then bested the second just as the first gnoll broke free.  Being the only melee fighter I was taking a beating and the remaining gnoll would have the upper hand on me for sure.  Fortunately, the druid had saved enough mana in reserve to heal me for the final battle.  I proceeded to go blow for blow with the gnoll while my casters medded up as quickly as they could to get back into the fray and help me.  <br>
<br>
Just as I was sure I had the battle in tact, we hear someone shout out for help from our right.  As the gnoll turned to run from what would surely be his dath I snared him so perfectly that in his weakened and panicked state he could not move.  I decided to let our shaman beat on the gnoll at this point as I knew the shaman, weak in melee though his was, would be able to kill the weakened gnoll while gaining experience for future battles. <br>
<br>
Knowing this battle was won I turn to find out who needed help only to see someone run past as fast as he could.  I knew the look of teror in his face, the look of impending death.  I looked behind him and saw nothng save two small trees, with bark as of the whitest of birch trees.  I could not understand what the man was so afraid of that his kilt was up around his chest from the speed of his running.<br>
<br>
Then, wait .... are those two trees moving.  They were ... and fast.  I start to scan up the small trees trying to figure out what is going on ... as I recognize the danger I shout<br>
<br>
UNDEAD CYCLOPS COMING RIGHT ... smack .. FOR .. slap .. US .. kick .. <br>
<br>
HEAL ME!!!!<br>
<br>
The cyclops had grown tired of chasing the girly barbarian and had now focused on what he knew was a much togher foe .. ME.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Cianna the druid was quickly to my assistance, healing me as quickly as she could.  She soon ran out of mana but by that time I was back at full health and was smacking the Undead Cyclops in a way that made him cringe in fear.  I could see his knees buckle with every powerful blow I reigned down upon him.  He would soon fall to my onslaught and learn not to mess with me.  Just as I was about to finish off the gigantic collection of bones I hear <br>
<br>
DING ... knowing full well I had been promoted to my 27th season of experience for bravery and courage byond the call of duty.<br>
<br>
Yet, I had not killed anything recently, so I could not figure out why I had levelled.  At that time I finished off my fight, sending the Undead Cyclops to a more peaceful slumber.  As I play back in my mind the conversation of the battle trying to figure out where that sudden flash of experience had come from, I realize that it was the shaman who had just then finished off that near dead gnoll.  Sighing to myself I tell the group we had better get another melee fighter soon, or we might not be so lucky.  <br>
<br>
Once again my group settles in to rest and allow their respective gods to bless them with their powers.  It has been a good day.<br>
<br>
Quick Notes - Now lvl 27.<br>
<br>
Strategy - Never root in a spawn area.  NEVER!<br>
<br>
Class Strategy - Shamans are excellent casters, buffers and healers, but seem to be awfully weak for a hybrid in melee.  Our bard was easily outhitting our shaman, as were our druids for the most part, especially when in wolf form.<br>
<br>
Funniest thing seen - A Barbarian in full face paint, screaming like a baby as he went running by us.<br>
<br>
Not a very funny thing - A Barbarian in full face paint, screaming like a baby as he went running by us ... with an Undead Cyclops in tow.  Grrr.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a great day LoTT,<br>

Chey ... you must be forgetting .. I don't have any DoT's ... yet. <br>
<br>
So, I go for the root and shoot.  This zone is perfect for the snare use, due to the lack of wandering aggros, but in some zones like Oasis and such .. the snare trick almost always ended up with me having 10 things on my tail.  So, I am learning that different places call for different tactics.  <br>
<br>
Were I playing a Druid, I would snare my life away.  But as a Ranger , especially one building bow skill, root and shoot is a blast.  Important note here is that I rarely root, only do it to put distance between me and foe, when it is kicking my butt.  I root it, back off, then snare, flame lick and proceed.  Works well.  And it allows me to get in non-interrupted spells, thereby allow me to go full bore on the attack when it closes.  The times where I was not the main tank was alot different.  I would basically flame lick and then snare as it got down in health so we wouldn't have to chase it into other aggros.<br>
<br>
My guess is, the tactics will change once again as I mett different opponents, but I am becoming quite well known in the zone as a heck of a good ranger, that knows how to use all my weapons, and is willing to die to protect others.  Thats a good rep to have as it is becoming easy to find groups.  <br>

This lowers AC by 3-5 and only does a few damage, but it pisses off mobs like you wouldn't believe. This in addition to taunt will keep most anything focused on you. Plus remember, you can snare then root so that if root breaks at least the mob will putter around slowly instead of charge in at full speed.<br>
<br>
Excellent stories, keep them coming. <p><font color=blue> Tariskatt Ore'Ereg </font> <BR> <font color=green> <i> Drunken Ranger, the newest class of Tunarian Warrior <BR> Bartender of the Ters'Tai</i> </font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utalastheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talas the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/25/01 9:31:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Journal Entry 4 - Clever Gnolls</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah , I know about the snare then root.  My first spell out is usually snare .. I generally hit with it right after I shoot with bow (sometimes I harmonize things first when solo).  Generally I <br>
<br>
1) Shoot from long way away<br>
2) Snare when in range<br>
3) Shoot again<br>
4) Flame Lick<br>
5) Melee<br>
<br>
I only root when I need to abck off for health reasons, multiple mobs, or when the enemy goes after a caster.  <br>
<br>
I didn't think know Flame Lick really made the enemy mad, and to be honest I don't see much of a difference in attack with it, so I may stop using it.  Which makes it yet another useless spell (how many thousands of useless spells are their in this game).<br>
<br>
Oh well .. off to lunch.  I dont have anything really good to report about last night so I probably wont do a journal today.  Maybe I will get time jut before I go home to ake up something.<br>

It's drops the mobs AC, which is good! It's only a few points, but it will help you to be able to hit it....and you want the mobs pissed at you! The damage it does is minimal, more or less stops the mobs from regenerating basically. I used Flamelick all the way until 49 when you get Immolate which is the upgrade. This is a great taunt tool for when your casters/healers get aggro'd and you can't get the mob off with just taunt, or to get the mob off faster. Even if you've already have it on the mob when you recast it it still seems to piss them off. So Falmelick everything! Except yerself...and mobs you can't take...and yer group members, none of those like it very much. <p><font color=blue> Tariskatt Ore'Ereg </font> <BR> <font color=green> <i> Drunken Ranger, the newest class of Tunarian Warrior <BR> Bartender of the Ters'Tai</i> </font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utalastheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talas the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoTT Member</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/26/01 12:30:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Journal Entry 4 - Clever Gnolls</span><hr size=1> /em snickers as I fell better about someone else who has obviously Flame Licked themselves.<br>
<br>
I honestly didn't know FL did any damage though.  I knew it lowered AC, but I can't seem to see any difference in my attacks after I cast it.  I still throw it often though because it casts so fast it doesn't slow down my attack that much.<br>
<br>
As for wanting the MoB's attention ... are you NUTS!!!  Half the time I am getting beat to death because whatever warriors are in the group either can't taunt or don't.  Or maybe that sword you gave me is too good .. heh.  Actually I rarely seem to have any problems luring enemies aways from casters at this level, but my guess is as the casters get more and more powerful I will need to learn those tricks much better than I know them now.  Thanks for the tips.<br>
