It was common at the time for there to be relationships with young boys, so it's not unlikely that he slept with men here and there.  <br>
<br>
In Alexander's case, a lot of the speculation was surrounding his closest friend, Hephaestion.  If they were lovers, it would have been a bit uncommon since they were both the same age, but they did spend a lot of time together.<br>
<br>
um... so back to the show.  I was really impressed after watching the first four episodes last week.  I like the way they're doing the show and the characters are pretty cool.  I haven't had a chance to check out any of this week's episodes yet, but I have them recorded.  Not sure what to think since Al mentioned they changed the voice actors for some reason.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/19/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: English Theme Song</span><hr size=1> Sorry to harp on it, but just wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy:<br>

Oh, and even further off topic, you know there's currently two movies about Alexander in the works, one by Oliver Stone, the other by Bahz Luhrman (spelling?), the guy who directed the Romeo and Juliet remake and Moulin Rouge. I'm not sure if the other is going to pass on it if the other starts first, but either could be interesting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismrx>PrismRX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/19/03 5:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: English Theme Song</span><hr size=1> Well the Spartian Warrior was a gay one, 'to build a strong bond between men', especially between the young warriors and the older veterans that trained them.<br>

Supposedly it's by two DJ's by the name of DJ Milky and b-nCHANT-d and that's it.  It's driving me crazy as well!  I can't find the song anywhere but the small snippit that is featured on the TokyoPop website.  It's funky and great isn't it?!  Kind of reminds me of Delerium or Enigma but with a more futuristic/techno feel.<br>
<br>
Secondly, someone asked about the thong thing.  Well I'd say that part of it is Chung's style but I'd also say that some of it has to do with ancient clothing.  I know that in Greece, Sumeria, Macedonia, Babylon and other ancient cities, warriors often went into battle with perhaps a loin cloth or nothing but their weapon of choice, a shield and maybe a cloak and some sandals.  The ancient Greeks, especially, believed that nudity was essential because clothing in battle was a nuisance and got in the way of movement.  A simple, warm cloak was sufficient to hide form and movement.  Shields were the main protection for the body and later on warriors did adapt armor and helmets into their fighting but the still wore relatively little clothing so as not to hinder movement.  So I'm actually grateful for the thongs and armor because if it were more accurate, they wouldn't be able to show it on Cartoon Network!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally, I love the show.  It's a perfect combination of history and plenty of what-if kind of scenarios (such as in dreams, visions or filling in sketchy details).  I believe the reason it seems stiff is because Chung wants to convey that Alexander thought very highly of himself, even that he was a god.  Alexander highly identified both with Heracles (Hercules) and Achilles because they were both born to mortal women from Zeus. You know that snake scene?  Well supposedly Olympias mated with a snake and the snake was Zeus.  Kinda kinky but hence the thought that maybe he's a half god or something right?  Chung portrays him as aloof and perhaps distant from emotion.  Let's face it, he didn't have the greatest family life and he's a warrior.  He's bound to have issues.<br>
<br>
Also on his sexuality, it was pretty questionable.  Not only did he have two wives and was intimately close to his best friend but he also had a supposed Oedipal fascination with his own mother.  She was very protective of Alexander and was often jealous of his friends or lovers but he was a momma's boy through and through.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that they address the relationship between Alexander and his horse but they probably won't.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, the show is running all thirteen episodes on Cartoon Network but the best bet to seeing everything is to actually buy the DVD's that are being released through SunCoast.  Heck, I'm saving up because I have a feeling that it's the only place I'll actually get the whole intro theme as well.  <br>
<br>
Here's hoping! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alucard1515>alucard1515</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/21/03 3:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.undeadart.com/forum/alucard.gif width=100 height=94></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: English Theme Song</span><hr size=1> Chung only did the character designs.
