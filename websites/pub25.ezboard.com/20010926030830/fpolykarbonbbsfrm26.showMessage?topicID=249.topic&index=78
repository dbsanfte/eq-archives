Two of them were moving towards Az and the others. The third wasn't moving. Their eyes met. They recognized what each other was and they both knew.<br>
<br>
Something was wrong. <br>
<br>
The light from the saucer behind Azoth dimmed. There was a faint rumbling, he could barely feel it. And it was quiet. Except it wasn't.<br>
<br>
There was a faint humming coming from his waist. The gem in the hand in the bag was pulsing. A sickly blood red light burst forth every second. <br>
<br>
Azoth had been stupid. He had thought that their weapons wouldn't have locators in them. He was astoundingly wrong. He was also a great big beacon telling them where the girl was. <br>
<br>
Grabbing his holdout Azoth flicked off the safety and pressed it into the man's hand. He didn't have much time.<br>
&quot;I'm not sure if they'll follow me or not. If they don't just point and shoot. There's no recoil so you shouldn't have a problem with that. You have twenty rounds, make the best of them. Now when I say go, you head for any cover you can find. Okay?&quot; Not waiting for an answer he dropped the still limp m ech pilot on the ground and sprinted for the opposite side of the street. <br>
<br>
Az passed the two men who had been running the other way at a dead sprint, he needed the speed. Luckily his footing was sure enough that he didn't break his ankle (or any other body part for that matter). <br>
<br>
Azoth was just about under cover when the aliens opened up. Thunderclaps and lightningbolts slammed into the ground around Azoth. This time he wasn't giving them a stationary target to shoot at.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/4/01 12:14:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> That familiar steel, that familiar weight.<br>
<br>
The familiar bark of gunpowder and smoke, that familiar press of recoil.<br>
<br>
Single shots. <br>
<br>
Deuce was running out of ammo.<br>
<br>
The corrugated aluminum of the restaurant shed was perforated by glowing energy blast marks. Shadows moved behind the aluminum. Once he got a line of sight...<br>
<br>
One shot.<br>
<br>
One dead alien.<br>
<br>
But there were dozens.<br>
<br>
They were being seiged.<br>
<br>
As Deuce turned, he zeroed in on a figure sprinting past the feds. One person... one memory of the past. One face that made Deuce grin, and filled him with fear. The one man that kept Deuce awake at night.<br>
<br>
And this was the one man Deuce would want on his side when gunning down aliens.<br>
<br>
The most dangerous man in the world.<br>
<br>
Velario's mystery man.<br>
<br>
Deuce's hunter.<br>
<br>
Azoth. Azoth pulled a long, dangerous-looking rifle from the gearbag slung across his back. He centered the scope of the weapon directly at Deuce.<br>
<br>
Better to be nailed by Azoth than a bastard alien!<br>
<br>
A brilliant white light lanced past Deuce's nose, through the aluminum. A minor explosion within the shed rattled Deuce's teeth and sprayed him with black ooze.He recovered in time to find another alien poking a head around the corner. <br>
<br>
One more shot, and the carriage of his nine millimeter slapped back and stayed. Out of bullets.<br>
<br>
Azoth lumbered down beside Deuce, who began to fish in his pockets for bullets.<br>
<br>
He released the clip, and turned to Azoth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azoth peered at him from behind the mask. His voice fuzzed, &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;  With a flurry of motion, Azoth pulled a throwing knife from a belt, and hucked it behind Deuce, dropping an alien.<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;Think we're going to survive this?&quot;<br>
<br>
As he reached into his left coat pocket for bullets, a pain shot through his palm, like someone had shot him through the hand. Deuce hit his knees and yelped.<br>
<br>
Heat rose up his arms, and he flailed back against the aluminum, swearing repeatedly.<br>
<br>
He pulled his arm from his pocket. Tendrils of hot metal burrowed up his sleeve, digging into the skin of his arm. He turned his palm up to his face. <br>
<br>
There, seating itself into a bed of clotting blod, was the pulsing red gem-weapon.<br>
<br>
The gem stopped pulseing, and the tendril quieted. He could feel them wrapping up into his armpit, digging into muscle.<br>
<br>
His head grew light with pain.<br>
<br>
He saw Azoth reach for his hand with a knife, and Deuce batted him away.<br>
<br>
The gem began to hum as he motioned at Azoth. He felt like a river of energy was flowing from his extremities to his arm. He managed to point it away from Azoth before it discharged, blowing off the corner of the restaurant's roof.<br>
<br>
As the energy settled back in Deuce's body, he shook his head, and stared at his smoking palm.<br>
<br>
Through raspy grunts, Deuce said, &quot;I knew... I needed... a bigger... gun.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/5/01 3:15:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> ((ooh... most dangerous man alive, talk about ego stroking... I like...))<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you have one.&quot; Azoth said simply, &quot;Just try not to point that thing in my direction.&quot; Then he grabbed Deuce's lapel and dragged him down the street. &quot;We need cover.&quot;<br>
<br>
Scanning the street Az watched as the two feds fought off a couple of the aliens  and basically hid. Then there was the sharp electronic report of his holdout. Down the street by an old, large car the man was standing by the girl the weapon in his hand outstretched. At their feet was one alien. One alien of many. Dropping the anti-mech rifle, he was out of rounds anyway, Azoth pulled his KKV's. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can you use that thing or am I going to have to lend you a gun?&quot; He asked Deuce point blank. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've still got my Browning.&quot; Deuce replied, voice still raspy with pain. He pulled a magazine from his coat. &quot;So until I get this thing worked out, It'll do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, let's go&quot; So saying Azoth stepped out into the street. He kept close to the wall of storefronts for cover and to keep his back to a wall. He couldn't help but smile at Deuce's reaction to his appearance. It was a surprise to the assassin. <br>
<br>
They had met several years earlier. Deuce had tried to kill Azoth's then-employer Valerio. It had been a setup. Valerio had wanted Deuce out of the way; so Valerio had one of his many disposable flunkies approach Deuce with a proposition he couldn't refuse. Deuce hadn't refused and Azoth had been tasked with killing him. Fortunately for Deuce he had smelled a trap. Azoth had been unable to kill him, not for a lack of trying mind you, and that had put Azoth in Valerio's bad books. Valerio had informed Azoth that if he didn't bring in Deuce's head in a bag, Az would never work for Valerio again. <br>
<br>
Azoth knew that 'not working for Valerio again' was a polite phrase signifying Az's death. That would never do. Already disenfranchised with his employers tactics, Valerio liked to pretend he was a mastermind while he was little more than a thug with his fingers in lots of pies, Azoth decided he would make an attempt. Or at least it would look like an attempt to Valerio. Azoth just used it as an excuse to get out from under Valerio's watchful gaze. Every &quot;mastermind&quot; has his blind spots, Valerio's were just on a global scale. Az had used those spots to reconnect with his previous employers, the Trinity, and they were more than happy to have him back. He was a walking showroom of their technology after all. He had just completed his contract negotiations with Graydon when this storm had come up.<br>
<br>
Snapping himself back to the present Azoth squeezed the triggers on his KKV's and sent two of the aliens to their deaths. Deuce was behind him lone claps from his browning dropping aliens with deadly efficiency. <br>
<br>
Azoth and Deuce were almost to the man and the girl when a squad of the aliens came around the building in front of them. Az quickly grabbed what looked like a thin metallic gel capsule off of one of his web belts and threw it at the aliens. Deuce was already behind the cover of a brick wall when Azoth jumped to join him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grenade?&quot; Asked the former FBI agent.<br>
&quot;Grenade.&quot; Replied the masked man in concert with a rather large explosion. <br>
<br>
The pace resumed. The two were walking death to any alien that approached. They reached the girl, who Deuce identified as Liz, and the man. Looking at the car hurriedly Azoth asked if it would run.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's got a full tank of gas.&quot; Deuce chimed from the driver side door. &quot;But it's locked.&quot; Deuce was smiling. That was a good thing. While Azoth and the man held the aliens at bay Deuce picked the lock.<br>
<br>
When the door opened Azoth pulled Deuce out of the driver's seat. &quot;Let me drive. I can see.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay,&quot; Deuce replied to the large man, &quot;no problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
They were soon on their way out of town. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugothicchaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/5/01 6:43:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> At one time Liz believed she was the average teen with a slight twist. Looks like she was wrong. Liz stared up at the ceiling, a tired look to her eyes. She half-heartly gazed out the window, searching for any sort of life form that might interfear with their escape. She watched the road roll by in front of her from the backseat. The rain had started to come down heavier now,making the road slick and obstructing her vision. <br>
<br>
So many things had happened that day. Someone had almost drowned, an abnormal storm had hit and a theory that we were not alone was proven. Their was life out their besides that of the tiny little planet she resided on.  With a sigh Liz gazed out the window again. She did not see the rain drenched asphalt as it rolled on past. What she did see though widened her eyes and caused her to gasp silently. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pull over,&quot; she muttered,the breath catching in her throat. <br>
Deuce peered over his shoulder to glance backwards. &quot;What did you say?&quot;he asked.<br>
She swallowed. &quot;Pull over, now.&quot;  <br>
Azoth pulled the car over to the shoulder,placing it in park. Liz pointed a shaking finger to the front of the car,directing their eyes to the space in front of them that was shrouded in mist.  Dimly,a faint light appeared in the sky,slowly getting closer. Soon,more lights followed.  <br>
As the object grew closer the dim car was flooded with light and the object's origin was revealed to the passengers of the car.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubeige.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beige</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/16/01 4:06:58 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/67453 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am beheld to the unraveling threads...</span><hr size=1> ((Just trying to keep it alive.)))<br>
<br>
The air was tinged with dread. Vick had taken a shot to the shoulder, but the blood wasn't coagulating. Ross put more pressure on it - he had to get back to the station. There they could get more ammunition and perhaps there were some medical supplies there.<br>
<br>
Wasn't that hippie guy a doctor? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 7:59:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Back from an emotional hiatus...</span><hr size=1> The weapon implanted in his arm must have released some sort of chemical into his tissues. The throbbing, searing heat had subsided, and Deuce felt light-headed. <br>
<br>
Maybe endorphines... maybe blood loss... maybe stress.<br>
<br>
He gripped his wrist and rubbed the skin on top of the tendrils of metal that had coiled around his ulna, snaking up to his shoulder.<br>
<br>
The gem still felt weird in his palm. His fingers constantly brushed against it, picking at it.<br>
<br>
It was a part of him, now. But for how long? The rest of his life?<br>
<br>
How long would that be?<br>
<br>
If the aliens didn't get him, Azoth would. Deuce was caught underneath the slide, and everyone and everything that ever wanted him dead was looking at him through the microscope.<br>
<br>
All he had was his burning desire to stay alive... and the pirated piece of alien technology now laced into his arm.<br>
<br>
Liz and the Doctor were quiet in the back seat. The doc was languidly tinkering with his electronics as Liz stared out the window. Deuce felt compelled to make some sort of conversation as they wound up the road, but it just felt pointless.<br>
<br>
So he watched Azoth.<br>
<br>
He was gripping the steering wheel with his fingers, rolling them with pressure.<br>
<br>
Just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
He wondered what became of Vick and Ross back in the town. They might be dead by now. Vick was a survivor. In the chaos, he might have escaped. That was ok with Deuce. He owed the man his life... despite the histrionics Deuce pulled. <br>
<br>
Liz's voice barked out from behind them, &quot;Pull over!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce craned his neck back. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pull over now!&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce glanced over to Azoth, who was already complying. Deuce listened hard. His ears were still ringing, but he was pretty sure there wasn't anything out of the ordinary...<br>
<br>
Azoth muttered, &quot;What is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce shook his head. &quot;What is what?&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he saw it... lights pouring from the clouds ahead. Multiple sources of light.<br>
<br>
Deuce swore softly.<br>
<br>
The doctor whispered, &quot;More ships?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azoth quickly unbuckled and began to worry through the satchel at his feet. &quot;Not ships.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deuce squinted at the clouds as Liz and the doc unbuckled in the back seat. Something metallic poked through the clouds. It was sharp, angular, clumsy.<br>
<br>
Mechs!<br>
<br>
Velario had arrived. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 11:31:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It seems great minds do think alike...</span><hr size=1> Mechs. <br>
<br>
Lots of them. <br>
<br>
Hopefully this time they weren't piloted by clones. Lord knew that those creepy red eyed, blue haired girls that Valerio had used last time were unsettling enough...<br>
<br>
In his first glance Azoth had counted at least twenty of them. and there were more following. They wanted either him or the girl. Any which way this was not good. It looked like Deuce was slowly clueing in. Azoth didn't really care about that, he was too busy looking for something that would work against these things. His Mech rifle was gone but he still had the anti cyborg pistol. That and several grenades might buy them some time. <br>
<br>
How had Valerio known? he had covered his tracks well enough. It should have been like Azoth had dropped off the planet. Reaching into the back seat he grabbed the girl by the coat she was wearing, his coat. She started to protest but stopped as soon as he pulled an ovoid device from one of the inner pockets of the coat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody out.&quot; Azoth said to the now unbuckled passengers of the car. Turning to the back seat and speaking to the man and the girl he said, &quot;Make sure that you head for the trees. These things are at least fifty feet tall and twenty to twenty-five feet wide. Try and find cover that they won't be able to fit in and deep enough that their arms won't reach you.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Azoth opened the door and stepped out into the rain.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uazoth30k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azoth30k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/18/01 12:42:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/usempaisloan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SempaiSloan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/17/01 12:12:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Character check...</span><hr size=1> (( Ok, continuity alarm's going off...  exactly where is everyone?
