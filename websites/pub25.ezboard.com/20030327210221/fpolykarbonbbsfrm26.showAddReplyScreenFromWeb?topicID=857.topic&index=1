But he knew just who to talk to... someone with all the answers... with that he walked downstairs and out the street to Leo's house. <br>
<br>
Leo was the type of person you never turned your back on, and never looked directly in the eye for too long of a time. His blood shot gaze could scare away any rat in the city with but a look, only the sharks who gave him orders would make eye contact. Not even his wolves would dare to do that. Sid didn't like dealing with the maniac, but buisness was buisness, work was work, and both of those had been hard to come by lately. A rat could get a lion out of a net trap, and Leo owed him a favor. <br>
<br>
Knocking on Leo's door with his knuckle, Sid took a final drag off his ciggy and flung it away. A panel slid open revealing those dark eyes, and darker hair all but covering one of them. Leo's voice was as gruff as his appearance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whadya want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A favor.&quot;<br>
<br>
The eyes blinked, apparently recognizing him. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Leo,  and the heavy iron door creaked open. <br>
<br>
Leo's office was twice as messy as his own, and with Sid's disaster of an appartment, that was saying alot. Before the door slammed shut behind him with a resounding bang, Leo was already in his seat with his unshaven chin on his hands and his elbows on his desk. Tossing &quot;Roxy's&quot; card onto the table Sid said, &quot;Check her out for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leo held the card under the light and considered it for a moment, then said, &quot;Ok, gimme a couple of days.&quot; With that said, Leo promptly ignored Sid until he let himself out. <br>
<br>
Sid had no intention of letting those two days go to waste. 100 million creds was alot of cigerettes. He had posed as a bounty hunter before, and he could do it again. He knew where they hung out, and so he made his way to _________. <p>&quot;Death is lighter than a feather, duty, heavier than a mountain.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbeaver@polykarbonbbs>MrBeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/15/02 10:48:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continuing...</span><hr size=1> He knew where they hung out, and so he made his way to the local bar down the the street a ways.  The Hole.  <br>
   The Hole was the type of place that people didn't go to unless they had a mean bit of buisness to attend to.  Sid had plenty of this on his plate, and he pushed the door open and walked in.<br>
   Smoke hung like fog and the stench of Rats and Wolves lingered in the air.  Noting to himself that it had gotten a bit cleaner since he got here, he brushed off the stool and sat down.<br>
   &quot;Whadda ya want?  Shnaps, Vodka?&quot; Asked the bartender.  A big burly man.  &quot;Course it'll cost ya quite a bit.  Alcohol's scarce in this part of Grunge-City.  Especially good alcohol...&quot;<br>
   Trying not to look to obvious, Sid lit up a cigarette.  &quot;I need information on a job goin' down.&quot;<br>
   The bartender's gaze wasn't directed at Sid, but his voice was.  &quot;What job?&quot;<br>
   &quot;A dame's being hunted down.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I don't blame 'em.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So you know about it.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Course I do.&quot; The bartender said igdignitly. &quot;Just about every bounty hunter's been hanging around lately.&quot;  He pointed to the far corner, where three men sat on the sticky vinal bench.  &quot;Those three?  They just came in today.  50 million will do that to you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Y'know why they want her?&quot;<br>
   &quot;This chick?  Na, I know that people are after her, but I don't know who.  Word is...&quot;<br>
   &quot;What?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well I can't remember.  Maybe if I had a little grease to help the wheels turh a bit smoother...&quot;<br>

  <br>
&quot;Like how high?&quot; asked Sid<br>
<br>
&quot;High.  We're talking people above the sharks.  People who give the sharks orders&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's high.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.  Yea it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What'd they call'em?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Devils.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid pulled out a cig.  &quot;Creative&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn straight it's creative...  Turns out one of these devils had this lady... what's her name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roxy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right.  Roxy.  Turns out one of these devils had this Roxy lady as a 'special servant'.  You dig?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, I dig.&quot;  Said Sid as he put the cig in his mouth and lit it.<br>
<br>
&quot;She got in a realationship, a special one, and next thing you know, she's pregnant.  She gets an abortion.  Devil don't like that too much, so he gets angry, and puts this warrent on her head.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid puffed out smoke.  Muttering to himself, &quot;These things are gonna kill me...&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender continued. &quot;See, but the only problem is... I can't let anyone know about this little, 'conversation' between us.  Lot of bad buisness see?  So this is where we say goodbye.&quot;  The bartender slowly pulled out a handgun from under the bar.  Sid saw this and took the cig from his mouth and shoved it into the bartender's eye.  He screamed.  Opening his other eye, the bartender tried to aim the gun.  Sid lept over the bar and picked up a bottle of wine.  In one continous movement he smashed the side of the bottle into the bartender's face.<br>
<br>
Wine, glass, and blood splattered the nearby ground.  Sid took out another cig and lit it up.  Stepping over the bartender, he almost to himself said, &quot;Here ya go. Drink's on me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Outside the bar, Sid decided to go see someone he knew.  A rat that had a few connections here and there.  Sid needed an address.  And he knew just where to get one... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrbeaver@polykarbonbbs>MrBeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/15/02 8:13:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Please, please....</span><hr size=1> Try and keep this post on the right subject.  It gets sidetracked pretty soon.  I'm so glad that people are actually doing this!<br>
<br>
    And he knew just where to get one...  Tommy Dee.  Tommy was the type of guy that you assumed saw nothing but florescent light.  His pale white skin and his scrawny body only served to make him look all the more...disturbing.  Twitcy too.  Sid didn't like him, but you did what you had to do when you had a job.  <br>
   He walked into the store where Tommy Dee was assumed to be working now.  A computer electronics store that probably held half of it's stock in stolen goods.  The bell chimed when Sid walked into the store, and a voice in the back faintly said &quot;We're closed.  Go  away.&quot;  Sid grinned.<br>
   &quot;Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.&quot;<br>
   Tommy peeped out the door and rolled his eyes.  &quot;You again?  I don't know anything that would even relate to you.&quot;<br>
   Sid threw his cigarette away.  &quot;Really?  And how would you know?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Word is around the street that you got something goin' down.  I get news.&quot;  Tommy replied in his nasal voice.<br>
   &quot;Sure you get news.  That's why I'm here.&quot;<br>
   &quot;But I can't help you with this whole chick thing.  Devils is just too big.  They can't be brought to justice...&quot;<br>
   &quot;So you aren't going to cooperate?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Co-operate?  There isn't anything to cooperate about!&quot;<br>
   Sid grabbed a computer cord from the wall.  &quot;Perhaps you need some persuasion.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Perhaps you better not touch me.&quot;  Tommy hastily said, pulling out a gun that looked bigger then him.<br>
   &quot;I got things to do Tommy, I don't want to hurt you.&quot; chuckled Sid.<br>
   &quot;We are not friends Sid.  You're just a guy who trys and solves things, but really never does.  What's the last case you've solved?  Huh?  Answer me that.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;That's what I thought.  Get out of my store before they have to carry you out in pieces.&quot;<br>
   Sid walked out of the store.  He lit a cigarette, and walked down the street.  Even from the corner he heard a terrified high-pitched scream, and then a couple of gunshots.  He walked back to the store, and opened the shattered glass door.  He paid the wolves, and walked to Tommy.<br>
   &quot;Let's start over Tommy.  What can you tell me about Roxy and her Devils?&quot;<br>
   Tommy was tied to a chair bleeding perfusly out of what was left of his arm.  He wimpered, &quot;Why should I tell you...?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Cause if you don't, I let you bleed to death, while our common enemies, the wolves out there, keep guard.  If you do, I get your and my good friends, the wolves out there, to come in and save your ass.&quot;<br>
   Defeatedly, Tommy said, &quot;OK, ughh, Ok, this devil character isn't so high up after all.  Fact is, he's living in Grunge-City right now.  Rumor's are flying around however, that he's living in inner-city Grunge.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Now, Tommy, why'd anyone want to live here, huh?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Cause it works better.  No one suspects you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Says you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Says me.  Now get those wolves in here you c*cksucking-&quot;<br>
   Sid picked up the gun and aimed it at Tommy.  Before Tommy got a word out, a loud blast echoed through the store.  Sid muttered, &quot;Kid's these days... give 'em in inch... and then blow their heads off...&quot;<br>
   He paid the wolves again for their service and proceed to Leo's house.  Maybe he knew about these Devils...<br>

Sid wasn't worried. A Shark isn't anything to worry about when it's out of water, and a Devil isn't anything to worry about when it's out of Hell. Looking around him at the filth known as Grunge-City, he wondered how much the latter held up. Fishing in his pocket Sid produced yet another cigarette, then relized he had been chain smoking the mother f*ckers all day long and put it back. Then he took it out again and lit up. &quot;F*ck it,&quot; he said. He would quit AFTER he had sequred the 100 mil. <br>
<br>
Sid had to think about this Devil character. What kind of player with at least a cool 50 million credits under his belt would live in this... hell? He had more street power than your average shark, probably hundreds of wolves at his command, and he puts a public bounty on this Roxy b*tch? The 100 million credits were probably stolen, and Sid would probably have to fend off multiple attempts on his life if and when he got the reward. And yet with that beautiful dame running around in his mind, he found himself more than half way to Leo's. <br>
<br>
The soft footsteps behind him were barely audioble over the gunshots and wailing that were the norm in Grunge-City, but they were enough bring his mind off that hot Roxy chick. Taking a quick right into a dark alley Sid scrambled into the darkest corner, easily hiding behind a garbadge can. His followers would think he dissapeared. <br>
<br>
Lo' and behold the fat barkeep from eailer came in moments after him, an even fatter rifel in hand, and a pack of wolves at his shoulder. Dripping blood (or was that wine?) he ordered his cronies around like the dogs they were. &quot;He's in here, find em, and shoot that bastard!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid held his breath as the wolves filed into the alley. He slid off the saftey on his gun......<br>

He slid off the saftey on his gun and held his breath.  He wasn't afraid of shooting someone, but the problem was that he was outnumbered 5 to 1.  <br>
   He held up his gun and aimed it from behind a garbage can.  He could probably take out the bartender if he tried... but then there were the other four.  And this garbage can wouldn't hold out after three or four shots.  <br>
   He heard footsteps coming toward him.  The @#%$ of a gun, and then the sound of a bullet being blasted out of the barrel.<br>
   Sid recoiled as he expected the bullet to rip through the thin tin of the garbage can, but there was none.  Not even richochet.  He glanced upward above the can and saw a siloutte in the bright light of the street.  Below it was three dead bodies... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gothicchaos>gothic chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/16/02 1:53:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://the.animearchive.org/vampirehunterd/1/hunter_d.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: continuing</span><hr size=1> The figure glanced lazily at the streetlight, gave a bit of a sniff and silently stuck thier hands in the pockets of their worn coat. The figure turned their head towards Sid,no more than a mere glance but in spite of the bright light and dark hood the figure wore, he saw their face.<br>
<br>
A pair of smokey eyes, a full pink mouth set in a cold frown. He could catch no more before the figure turned back to regard the bodies. Carefully stepping forward, the figure crouched beside the bodies, slowly setting some small object in the middle of a pool of blood. <br>
<br>
In one quick motion Sid had risen and pointed the barrel of his weapon to the back of the figure's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your head off,&quot;<br>
<br>
The figure turned, facing Sid directly. <br>

I was saving your as--&quot;<br>
Just then the other two gunmen appeard from behind the shop and shot at the figure.  Soon after, the figure crumpled down holding it's gut.  <br>
   Sid aimed his gun and fired.  He fired until there was no doubt that the other two were dead.  Then he noticed his arm.  Bleeding on the one side, and a tear in his big coat, a bullet had glanced it.  He grimiced and continued on to the figure. <br>
   &quot;Who the hell...&quot; He muttered, taking of it's hood... Sid almost jumped back.  &quot;Aw damn...&quot;<br>
   &quot;I tried...to warn you... Leo's on the run... he's got every hired...ugh...gun on your ass.... you better get outta town...before...&quot;  Gasped Roxy with her last dying breath.<br>
   Sid closed his eyes for a second, and for the first time in a while he almost felt sad.  Closing her open eyes with his rough hand he muttered, &quot;Don't worry lady... I never gave up on a job yet... and I sure as hell don't intend to now...&quot;<br>
   He drug her body into a nearby dumpster.  Not much of funeral, but given that it was Grunge City, it really didn't matter.  Sid got up and made his way to Leo's house.<br>
   When he got to the large building, he check the door.  Locked.  Sid pulled out his handgun and blew off the lock.  Not too many people noticed, and those who did figured that if he was messin' with Leo, he probably was going to never shoot anything else again.<br>
   Walking into the messy building, Sid noticed a noise in the back.  Walking over drawers that were out, and papers that were still flying in the air, he got into some kind of back room.  In it, was an old TV hooked up to a VCR.  Static was playing, and attached to a video tape, a note said, &quot;Play me&quot;.  <br>
   Sid put the tape in, and sat back.  Leo's terrifying mug came into view.  &quot;Sid!  Hello my good friend.  Turns out that you never miss a solid dish in your life.  That card of that chick Roxy?  Pretty good deal I tell ya what.  Her real name's actually Roxane Summers, but given her line of work, I don't think it made a difference.  44 years old.  Can you believe it?  She don't look a day over 24.  But that's what happens when you know a good plastic surgeon.<br>
   &quot;She's got the money Sid.  Even if she was a no good whore, she still was good at getting the fat cows to hire her... So, the credibility issue isn't and issue anymore.  You dig?&quot;  The camera panned to three men, all with guns, axes, and knives.  &quot;These guy?  These are my guys that make sure Roxy can't ever withdraw her money again, if you know what I mean.  But if you do get a message from her, or if you come in a couple days to see if I'm still around...<br>
   Well, I'm not.  You're a detective, detect!  Although it's going to be kind of hard when you have all my wolves, lions, and sharks on ya.<br>
   I'm not afraid of you Sid.  You're old.  You're out of touch.  I got your reality check right here buddy.&quot;  Leo said waving a gun about.  &quot;Right here... but I want to see if you can find me first...  It's going to be a tricky one it is.  After all, when you're the devil, you got plenty of places to hide, and best of all, you got plenty of goons to do your dirty work.&quot;  He held up a blinking light.  &quot;See this?  This is what I can my 'insurance'.  It's a homing beacon telling whatever sharks, lions, wolves, or even rats that I've hired to come and kill you.  And believe me.  It's started.  It's on the back of the VCR, and I had to talk enough to give 'em a chance to get ya...&quot;  <br>
   Leo took out a cigar.  &quot;You got real issues Sid.  Maybe you should work'em out... but given the situation, the only doctor you'll be see'in is the mortition...&quot;  He cackled with laughter... &quot;See ya around...&quot;<br>
  Sid picked up his gun from the endtable.  Things were going to get a whole lot worse real quick.  He turned around to the sound on cocking guns, to see three men and two women with semi-automatic weapons pointed straight out of him.<br>
   No way he was going to get out of this one... No one could save him now...<br>

By the way Beaver, very nice writing, I like it alot. Must admit, I'm growing attatched to Sid. Never thought you would do what you did with Leo, I had my own plans for him.
