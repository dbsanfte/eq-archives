CHAPTER 1: The Arrival<br>
<br>
“Kenton Ridge, a small town near the border of Arizona has mysteriously disappeared, as if, off the face of the earth. It has been months since anyone has heard contact from within the city… Those who were sent there to find out what the problem was have never returned. Those people include 3 policemen, 4 news reporters and 8 civilians. Contact cannot be made with Kenton Ridge. People are becoming afraid to even go near the small town. No one knows what is going on and few dare to find ou--”<br>
<br>
A hand reached for the knob on the radio and switched it off. There was a soft laughter resonating from the driver of the vehicle. A rusted old jeep made its way through the sandy road across the Arizona Desert. She smirked after listening to the radio station’s news caster and she glanced at the man she was sitting beside. He was a lanky fellow with dark hair, dark eyes and a little beer belly. He was dressed ever so casually in a plaid shirt and khaki pants. He was holding onto an expensive video camera. He wiped the lens clean and smiled at it as if it were his true love.<br>
<br>
The woman, with one arm resting against the driver’s side door, yawned while drumming her manicured nails on the top of the steering wheel. She glanced at the rearview mirror and grinned at her good looks. She had the most well-conditioned, shiny and soft auburn hair any woman on TV could have and a pair of alluring and beautiful eyes. Her eyes were a strange form of hazel that appeared more of an amber color in the light. Those unique eyes caught the attention of many men. The only lucky one to get even close to this femme fatale is the man sitting next to her. Her own personal cameraman. He loved her, he cared for her but she didn’t return such foolhardy feelings. She needed a cameraman and he was the best that she could get for no pay.<br>
<br>
Why would this girl need a cameraman? She was an aspiring reporter trying to make it big in the world. She was a rookie and an ambitious one at that; a woman only 26 years of age. Her intelligence and genuine speaking skills got her above her class and gave her an easy time finding a job for a local news station. She wasn’t known in the field, only just finishing her schooling for the career of her dreams, but she wanted to hit it big. She would do anything for it… and that’s where her ambitious revelry led her… on the road to Kenton Ridge. No one else wanted to take the job because they were afraid; at least, that was what she thought. She would take it and she’d show them all how great she was. She wasn’t going to let some rumors get the best of her. She wanted stardom.<br>
<br>
She smiled anxiously even though she was burning up in the heat of the sun and the dryness of her surroundings. The jeep smelt of sweat and cheap leather. Even having all the windows open didn’t help dispel the aggravating warmth of the hot sun. The cameraman, however, was slouched in his seat. He put his camera on his lap and stared out the window, his eyes unable to open any longer, he was exhausted and fatigued. The long ride from Palm Springs, CA, took its toll on him. The sun was high in the sky and that was the worst position it could be in… not to mention the fact that they were driving a black jeep.<br>
<br>
“Hey Riley,” The man said in a cracked voice, “I have the feeling that this trip is a big waste of time.”<br>
<br>
The woman turned and glanced toward him for a second or two and turned back to the desolate road.<br>
<br>
“What makes you say that, Hugh?”<br>
<br>
He coughed and turned toward her, almost in disbelief from hearing her question. “What makes me say that? Personally, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Kenton Ridge. I have a big feeling that the whole reason no one can contact the townsfolk is because their phone lines are down. What they need is a good electrician!” He said it with a surfer’s accent.<br>
<br>
“What the hell? What about those missing policemen and other people? What happened to them?” She asked, aggravated by his unenthusiastic attitude and from the high temperature.<br>
<br>
“They probably decided to stay and… ah… um… help out. However, because their phone lines are down they haven’t been able to call back and assure everyone of their safety.”<br>
<br>
“Hugh,” Riley said slowly.<br>
<br>
“What?” He asked in response.<br>
<br>
“You are the biggest idiot I have ever met.”<br>
<br>
He smirked and returned his gaze to the desert surroundings that seemed so monotonous. Everywhere he looked, all he could see was sand and cacti. He was getting sick of it and he just wanted to go home to his swimming pool and most of all, back to the beach where he could surf all he wanted to. A place without water was like a prison to him. He had no idea. The only reason he came was for her… though he’d never admit it. He shut his eyes slowly losing the battle to stay awake.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Here I am, driving across the Arizona Desert, the hot and soon-to-be setting sun beating down on the black metal of the car. It may as well be raining fire for all my poor body knows. Pair that with the clunker of a jeep I have to drive, and poor Hugh and I are absolutely dying from the heat. I sighed to myself, leaning forward to flick the switch for the A/C, hoping in vain it would work this time, but yet again, it simply sputtered and did nothing. I leaned my elbow on the edge of the open window, and twirled a strand of deep red hair through my fingers, sighing to myself in aggravation. Just as I sat back into my seat, the wheels of the jeep spun out again, fighting with the sand, and I simply narrowed my eyes and pushed my booted foot hard against the gas pedal. Finally the wheels caught themselves, and the jeep lurched forward, almost causing Hugh to smack his nose against the dashboard.<br>
<br>
        Looking to the distance as I let the vehicle slow slightly, I can just barely see the hazy outline of our destination; Kenton Ridge, and shook my head yet again in frustration as I muttered loudly, &quot;Piece of ****, jeep. Trying to drive from Palm Spring to and through the Arizona desert in this piece of crap? I should’ve invested in a better vehicle.” Hugh sat up and chuckled at me. By now he was used to my angry outbursts, and actually found them funny. That is, of course, unless they were directed towards him.<br>
<br>
        Just as I moved my eyes to the lowering gas gauge a loud bang emanated from the front of the car, and the jeep spun out of control. The wheels whirred uselessly, trying, but failing to get a grip on the loose, soft sand. I turned the steering wheel sharply, slamming on the brakes and, finally, the jeep slowed to a spinning stop. Cursing loudly, I slammed my right fist against the dashboard, nearly breaking one of my perfectly manicured nails, and pulled off my seatbelt, throwing the door open and stepped outside. Raising the back of my hand to brush the film of sweat from my forehead, I look again toward the distance, and see an old gas station up ahead.<br>
<br>
Hugh leisurely stepped out of the vehicle and walked up beside me. I shook my head slowly and stared up at him. “Hugh, ‘hon. I need you to do me a big favor.”<br>
<br>
He looked at me and smiled. “Anything for you, Miss Taylor.”<br>
<br>
I smirked. “I need you to put the jeep in neutral and push the car to that gas station up ahead. I’m going to go there and grab a map. I’ll wait for you there. Thanks a bunch.” I held back a laugh and started my run for the old ramshackle of a gas station. Hugh would do anything for me and I can use it all to my advantage. I turned back only to see the surprised look on his face. It was priceless. I grinned and continued on my way there.<br>
<br>
After a few long minutes I finally made my way to the run-down gas station. I panted and rested my hands on my knees trying to catch my breath. Next time I would think twice before running anywhere in loose sand in black knee-high boots. My feet were so sore. Even though it hurt like a bitch to walk, I still managed to step into the dimly gas station. Strangely, the door was wide open and there was no one inside. It was completely deserted. The only things in the gas station were a few racks of magazines, maps, and sand that had blown in through the doorway. I frowned, losing my enthusiasm to finish this stupid story and I sat down on the floor and leaned against the counter. I sighed and watched as Hugh pushed the jeep closer and closer to the station. He looked dead tired when he stepped through the doorway. He looked as if he were ready to collapse at any second. Only then did I see a sign from far away as I glanced in his direction. KENTON RIDGE, 1 MILE. I sighed at the realization of having to walk. Neither of us knew how to fix a broken jeep and it would’ve been a waste of time and effort anyway. I reached into my satchel and took out my cell phone, dusting away the sand on my short black skirt as I did so.<br>
<br>
When I turned it on and pressed it against my ear I had to jerk my head back instantly. All I could hear was loud static coming from it. “What the hell?” I frowned and tossed my cell back into the satchel. I looked over at Hugh and sighed again. I remembered seeing a payphone outside. I stood up and fished around my bag for some change. It was another wasted effort as I heard the same static sounds coming from the payphone.<br>
<br>
“Hugh, grab your camera equipment. I guess we’re going to have to walk the rest of the way there.”<br>
<br>
He looked at me in disbelief and glanced at the jeep. “You’re not going to make me push that to Kenton Ridge, are you?” He shook his head slowly. “So the phones don’t work? You can’t call for help?”<br>
<br>
“Didn’t you see me try just then?” I sighed, agitated at his blatant stupidity. I frowned and walked to the jeep to grab a few bags of mine. We started on our way to Kenton Ridge, walking along the sandy roads, with not even a breeze to keep us cool. I frowned again. This was going to be one long day. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

anyway, onto the crits. you switch from present tense to past tense in the second part:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Here i am, driving across the Arizona Desert<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
then, a few sentences later<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i sighed to myself<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
structuraly, it needs...refinement...that is to say, its not perfect yet, but its not bad. the second paragraph is a little too 'he did this. she did that.' try to add more description and try to make the writing flow better, as it makes for a more enjoyable reading experiance, especialy at the start, to 'hook' your reader.<br>

i would have written that as:<br>
A manicured finger reached for the button on the radio and depressed it, switching the set off with a sharp click. Soft, knowing laughter eminated from the driver of the ancient vehicle: a rusted old jeep making its way across the sandy roads of the Arizona Desert. She smirked at the news report and glanced across at the man sat beside her, closly examining an expensive video camera. He was an awkward, unkept fellow with dark hair, dark eyes and signs of a beer belly developing beneath his plaid shirt. From the pocket of his worn khaki pants produced a handkerchief and wiped the lens clean, smiling at it that camera was his one true love.<br>
