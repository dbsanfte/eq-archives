Inequalities in the art forums.</span><hr size=1> I hear that, man, I've critted LOADS of stuff in the Art forums, and when I post my own art for critique, it just crashes &amp; burns. :/ (I have got some wicked crits though, from generally the same people; Yo Darkreaver!! :D ) Meh! I just crit when I feel like it (I reckon me critting someone else helps me just as much as it helps them, it just solidifies all those little rules you've got built up in your head), and if no-one replies, then *meh!* There's other forums! :D <br>
<br>
I think the AiP forum is the worst for this, 'cos of the sheer weight of people running in &amp; out, most people don't remember who's critted thier work &amp; who hasn't. I think there's that, and there's quite a few people that just post for crits and don't crit back. How do I know? 'cos I post mine for crit, crit 5 others while i'm there (I feel guilty. XD) and they reply to my crits of thier work, but my post still dives. And, I've seen a LOT of posts up there that have dived with only one or two crits on them, and considering the speed at which that board moves at (a post can go from the top to off the bottom in under a day) that just shouldn't be happening. if everyone that posted for crit posted a few crits in return for submission, there would be at least 2-3 crits per post, plus the casual critters. (critters...heh!) I dunno, I say post it, carry on critting back, but don't expect too much.<br>
<br>
The Colour &amp; the B&amp;W forums seem to still be cool with the whole give&amp;take system though, which is nice. :) I like it there, but I dont have time to do much colour work. X( But yeah, don't take it personally man. :) <p><a href="http://www.buttonpusher.net/kindamanga">KINDAMANGA!</a> <BR>

Inequalities in the art forums.</span><hr size=1> the whiles i do lounge about in the art critting forums, i try and not let any of the zero-reply posts get away and actually dont usually reply to the more popular posts aside from looking at the picture to see how great it is (and trust me, it usually is very great. ^_^ or i will stop by to comment on it's greatness.) anyway, the thing for me is, even though i draw pretty stinky myself, i get the number of posts that i do (along with the other big numbered posters) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> because</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> i reply to what they've said. if you're drawing just to get feedback, people to tell you it's great, etc., then there is no purpose in the forums. go back to your posts, thank whichever person decided to crit it, write about each of your errors and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fix</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> them. then repost, and people will know that what they've said really does make a difference and helps you improve. you konw what i mean? the person that said quite a number of the replies in traum's threads are actually his own is right; traum gets the feed he does because he lets everyone know their comments really affect him (rather than posting his work to get &quot;great jobs,&quot; &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs,&quot; which some of the one-replied people were aiming for in the first place.) the purpose isn't to get your rep promoted, we're trying to help you improve.<br>
<br>
some people, however, only get one post, because people seem to think their drawings are hopeless. i've seen so many notebook-paper sketches that i've replied to that have never replied back; maybe too lazy to even check on their own post? but as long as you reply, then they'll know you're still around. if you ever want me to crit something, just say so, and i'll do it no prob. there are plenty of people willing to help the less fortunate, you just have to find them.<br>

Inequalities in the art forums.</span><hr size=1> You know, it is actually really simple to achieve a level of critiques more than 1 or 2 per post.  Here is the step by step procedure...<br>
A) get your avatar (you have done that)<br>
B) introduce yourself (too late if you haven't)<br>
C) post some stuff in the members lounge and reply to stuff so people get to know you<br>
D) critique about a hundred people in all of the art forums, do not sound conceited mean or jealous.  Just give an honest critique.<br>
E) of those people, start repeat-critiquing them so that they realize that you spend time looking at their art.<br>
F) Post your own artwork, about 25 pieces should be good, do this over a period of about 3 weeks to 7 weeks.  This is best done simultaneously to the above steps.<br>
G) now that you have established yourself, you should be getting more critiques than before.<br>
<br>
*Extra* realize that this is not a one time only shot, you will have to keep critiquing other peoples work.<br>

no, really<br>
I would say that of the art that gets about 30 replies, 20 to 25 are just people sticking their noses in the artist's hmm-hmm.  All that does is boost your art to the top of the page again.  If groupies are all that you are looking for, then just create 20 different SNs and post to your own art 20 times saying WOW and COOL and Wish I Was That Good...<br>
Critiques are much more important, and the people who get about 8-12 replies usually get as many critiques as those who get 30 replies.<br>
