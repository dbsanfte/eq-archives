You nearly cut me!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (with a shrug) fine… (Takes off her gloves and throws them to the side.)  Come on!  Let’s just stall for time, Kael is on the way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, if that’s the way your gonna be… (Punches at Feona then does a low kick, which is the only one that actually hits Feona.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is that all ya got?  (Attacks with a series of punches and ends with an uppercut.  In mid air Lena grabs Feona’s arm and brings her to the ground.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How long till they get here? <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (rolls over Lena) Couple of minutes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena kicks Feona off.  Just then the airship crashes through the side of the wall.  Rose jumps down with a rope in her hand.  Quickly, Feona and Lena grab their weapons and grab hold of the rope.  They are pulled up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp NOOooo!!!  Stop them!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They are already pulling out of the wall and heading off.  Esben looks really upset and angry.  He disappears in a cloud of sharp gray wind.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lord Esben!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He reappears on a balcony in the church.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Master!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A dark man appears from the darkness.  He is tall but hidden from view.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lenexa is escaping on THAT airship!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t worry, Esben.  I’ll take care of this, unfortunate turn of events.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He turns toward the airship and squints with his very evil looking eyes.  The airship in the distance has a large explosion.  The airship sparks and pieces of the ship are flying everywhere.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Inside the ship)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re going down!!!  Grab onto something!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Outside.  The ship crashes into a prairie below.  Everyone is coughing Didier opens a white doorway portal.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone in here!  Hurry!! <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all run inside the portal.  In the ship, you see Tyo and Lena’s mind chessboard on the floor.  A hand reaches over and grabs it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone is far from the ship.  Didier walks forward toward the ship.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (quietly) Good bye, Jovanna….<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ship explodes and collapses onto itself.  Didier collapses as well, and appears to be crying.  Rose walks forward and puts her hand on Didier’s shoulder.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You did all you could to save her… I’m sure your father would be proud…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji appears in a large ball of fire behind everyone.  Lena draws out here daggers.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who are you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I…am Akuji!  God of Creation…and Destruction!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose has a memory flash.  Rose’s mother is shouting no.  Akuji is standing at her feet.  He stabs her into the chest.  He looks up at young Rose in a bush, then yanks the sword right out.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s you!!  You’re the demon who wrecked our village!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose draws her sword and runs at Akuji.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose hits a barrier and is bounced back to the ground.  Hiro runs to Rose to see if she is alright then charges at Akuji.  He is also bounced back.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s too powerful!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  He must pay for their deaths!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now, I remember you two.  The children in the bushes.  Well, as I’ve always said…Kill the mother, leave the child.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahhh!!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro charges again but once more hits the barrier.  This time Akuji grabs him ripping his sword out of Hiro’s hand.  Then he hits Hiro sending him flying to the ground.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro!!! (Turning back to Akuji) Urrr…  You’ll pay!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose runs forward and hits Hiro’s sword in Akuji’s hand.  Wind energy gathers around her as she attempts to overpower him.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:  (smiling) Humph…Is that all you’ve got?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji breaks the struggle with a simple push.  Rose backs up for a moment then leads an onslaught on Akuji.  She keeps walking forward forcing him back.  He easily knocks her back away.  Akuji raises Hiro’s sword to stab her.  It is struck by a ball of energy.  The sword is knocked out of his hand.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take that, coward.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Behind her are two identical clowns.  Tyo is also there.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo puts his hand on the ground.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope this works… (His eyes start twitching as he concentrates.  Shards of earth shoot out of the ground and one hits Akuji.  Even so, it only breaks when it hits him.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now that, was pathe…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahhh!!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena runs up and slashes at him with her daggers.  Akuji grabs one of her daggers and throws her to the ground.  He smiles with satisfaction but when he does a drop of dark blood runs from a cut on his face.  He touches the blood then looks at it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Miss Lenexa I presume.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena looks up at him angrily.  Rose, again, charges at Akuji.  She is thrown away by the barrier, almost without Akuji’s notice.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Until we meet again, Lenexa.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A black portal appears behind him.  He turns to leave through it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  You’re not leaving until we settle the score once and for all!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:  (smiling) As you wish.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji turns around quickly.  Silence.  Hiro mouths the words Rose.<br>
<br>
((//Flash back//))<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A little girl is crying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro: What’s the matter?  Why are ya crying??<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deidra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My ball rolled into the forest and I’m lost… (continues to sob.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro: It’s okay!  I’ll find your ball!  (heads into the forest)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deidra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wait!  Come back!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He reappears with the ball and hands it to her.  She hugs the ball.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro: I’m Hiro.  What’s your name?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deidra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m Deidra.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   (confused) Dee drawn??<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deidra: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (laughing) You can call me Rose.  That’s what everyone else calls me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Alright, Rose.  Let’s get ya home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deidra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Young Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Don’t worry!  I’ll protect ya, I promise.<br>
<br>
((//End of Flash back//))<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (faintly) Rose!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose opens her eyes to Akuji’s smiling face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now… (stabs her again)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Behind her, you can see the dagger is all the way through her body.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (whisper) No…not again…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji turns the dagger in the wound, then rips it out.  Rose backs up a few steps then falls to her knees.  Blood drips off Lena’s dagger, just like in Tyo’s vision.  Akuji throws the dagger.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  May your soul be forever tormented …by me… (turns and walks through the portal.  It disappears)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (running to Rose) Deidra!!<br>
Rose:  (coughing and weak) You called me by my first name…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s gonna be alright…  We’re going to get you to a healer and everything’s going to be fine…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (putting her finger on Hiro’s lips) I should have known it would end like this…but I was blind to the truth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (tears are running down his face) You can’t give up!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro…cough…I have something I wanted to give to you…cough…it’s…it’s in my bag.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (reaching into her bag and pulling out a book) Your journal…?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There…there’s a letter for you in it…gasp…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!!  Deirdra!!  Hold on!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Good…bye…Hiro..<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Her hand falls from Hiro’s face.  She looks very peaceful.  A tear falls on her face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp NOOooo!!!  Rose!!!! (he falls over her crying)<br>

<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ishtar:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How’s Hiro doing?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s taking it pretty hard…We should probably leave him alone…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro is outside on deck.  He is looking at the cover of Rose’s journal.  He opens it to a page with a letter.  There is a rose and a feather marking the page.  He picks up the rose and looks at it for a while.  He opens the letter and begins reading.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  Dear Hiro… If you///<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  If you are reading this letter, then I’ve left.  By any means, my message remains the same.  Hiro, we’ve traveled together for years, but I’ve hidden my feelings from you..  I didn’t know what to think…what to feel.  Over time, just being with you, for one moment, eased all the pain…an entire lifetime of hatred could create.  But now, these are only words on paper but through them, I will write…of the lifetime of  love, I have felt for you…every waking moment…every day and every time I looked into my heart.  I don’t know if this is what you feel for me,…but even if your love is nothing but a friendship, my heart will always be there…I will always feel for you and love you with a love stronger than time…I will love you…  Please Hiro…know this, my love is everlasting and even though we are apart…I want you to know.  That forever…Our love will go on…   Love Rose.///&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A tear falls on the rose.  Hiro looks up with tears going down his face.  The feather floats out of the book and into the wind.  It floats away.)<br>

It's not bad.  It's a touch corny, but then again, we're not claiming to be creating high art here.  I like the flashback to them as kids.  The feather bit is nice, but could you perhaps associate it more tightly with Rose earlier in the story?  Perhaps she has an affinity to birds?<br>
<br>
The scope and scale of this story is pretty grand.  I understand that you can't cover each part in exquisite detail, but I like the amount of interaction, development and background revealed in this segment.  Might I suggest you go back and see if you can add some details to some of the previous segments?<br>
<br>
The death of the ship didn't hit me very strongly, because the character of the ship's avatar wasn't strongly developed, nor was Didier's bond with the ship.  Yes, her father built the ship, but it never seemed to be much more than something she took for granted.  Either some back-edits, or perhaps have Didier lament how she didn't realize how much she'd miss Jovanna?<br>
<br>
Still, it's an enjoyable read, and I'm again looking forward to seeing how you handle the next developments.  My critiques are simply that of one reader.  Make sure to show your work to your friends and a representative selection of people from  your intended audience.

<br>
I was thinking about removing the feather.  I'm not even sure why I put it in there.  As for the ship, Didier is more or less saying goodbye to everything her father ever was.  Leaving her old life behind and moving on.  I don't think it got through too well though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think I am going to add Didier talking about the ship later.  I know for certain, that later in the story when they ride in a new ship, Didier seems to be slightly disappointed in the new ships and she also seems think about the old Jovanna.<br>
<br>
I'll keep working at it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utaerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TaerX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/02 12:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: more of the story...corny, wannabe romantic almost ;)</span><hr size=1> It's a nice touch.  Reminds me of Rhionna from FF8 and the wing motif she seems to sport.  Also reminds me of the opening sequence to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Forrest Gump</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but that's probably not as likely to be on the minds of your target audience.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, this could add some dimension to Didier - she may want  to try to rebuild Jovanna or something similar.<br>
<br>
One question - is the &quot;where's my ball&quot; sequence the explaination why Hiro and Rose were spared when their village was decimated? <p><hr noshade size=1><center><font size=1><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/taerx/"> My FreeWebs Home Page</a> (Not a lot there)</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/02 12:44:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: more of the story...corny, wannabe romantic almost ;)</span><hr size=1> yes actually.  It was a reason to get them out in the woods.  You are correct, Didier should try and rebuild the Jovanna.  That would give her something to do later in the story when she loses her legs.<br>
<br>
I've never played ff8 before... that is kinda creepy that it seems similar..  As for Forest Gump, yeah, that was the reason I thought of taking it out.  You see, a few days after writing that part, Forest Gump came on tv and I felt that it was too similar and thought about removing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/27/02 12:21:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hello!</span><hr size=1> Helllllloooooo!!!
