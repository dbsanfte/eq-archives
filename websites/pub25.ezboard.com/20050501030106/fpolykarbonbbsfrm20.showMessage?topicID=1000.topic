So, I've come up with a partial solution to reduce the waiting time to draw.  I know this post looks long, but I think it can be read quickly....especially if you've been longing for a fight<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Here's my idea: <br>
* Have a fight between two artists and have them work on two different stories. Basically, 2 players and 2 stories. <br>
* While one of us is drawing story1 the other will draw story2. <br>
*Story1 will set the standard. When the artist has finished and posted his round of pages for story1, the other must immediately stop his/her pages for story2 EVEN IF they are in mid-page. (That way one of us won't be working on two stories at once.) <br>
*The artists will switch stories, and continue drawing. <br>
<br>
((Of course this works best when I'm doing story1, but alas, as a said, a partial solution to my, haha, partial scannerless-ness.)) <br>
<br>
<br>
Story1: Phantom of the Lonely Hearts Ball <br>
At Lonely Hearts High, the biggest dance of the year is none other than the Lonely Hearts Ball (LHB). The only thing is that, so far this year, the other dances at the school have been plagued by a vicious phantom. All the student body suspects that the LHB will be the phantom's grande finale, and, despite the fact of putting themselves in danger, they are planning on attendending just to see the show. In order to protect the students but still keep the phantom excitement, Cloe and Joey (the student body president and VP, and themselves a couple) promised to &quot;save the last dance&quot; for any student who captures the phantom and unveils him at midnight. Mary (my character), your not-so-average student, plans to capture the phantom just so she can, for once, have a date to a dance. However, she's not the only student with this plan in mind... <br>
<br>
My character for story1: <br>

<br>
Story2:  (insert your idea here....hehe, I have a backup just incase you're dry) <br>
<br>
Backup Story2:  Model Team Zoolander <br>
Retired Model Derrik Zoolander, after saving the world from evil and starting a family, decided that there was really more to life than being really, really good-looking. And that would be: being really, really good-looking and really, really ultra-intelligent. Zoolander's recruiting specialists secretly test male models from around the world to find those worthy of joining the elite Model Team Zoolander. (That is after they pass an intense training course.) The real brains behind the team is former hand model Fox Mulder (sorry, can't remember his movie name), while Zoolander is definitely the funding. Will Model Team Zoolander be able to stop former prison inmate and fashion designer Mugatu's evil plan to take over the modelling world?!! <br>
<br>
<br>
Please do the following to accept my challenge: <br>
(I will NOT accept anything less.) <br>
1.  Post your character pic for story1. <br>
2.  Post your idea for story2.  (Or opt for the backup.) <br>
3.  Post your character pic for story2. <br>
<br>
Don't worry, I'll keep our pages for both stories organized in one of the initial posts in the challenges section when we move there. <br>

<br>
&lt;&lt;I would think that maybe you should give maybe two days after one person posts pages&gt;&gt;<br>
Right, I don't expect someone to only seconds after the other posts there pages.  When I said &quot;immediately&quot;, I meant with minimal delay.  The idea of this is to reduce waiting time to draw, but of course there must be some waiting.  I, myself, have limited scanner access, but as soon as I see story1's pages, I will get my pages up ASAP.  I guess the main reason I said immediate was to hold a sense of urgency.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I also am not sure about the mid-page thing&gt;&gt;<br>
With you being in many fights, you know how some peops have trouble getting even a page up.  I have no doubt that we may sometimes struggle to get those last frames in on that page.  Since Story1 sets the standard anyways, it will be difficult for the one working on Story2 to plan where his pages will stop anyways.  Having the mid-page requirement helps stop any hesitation to scan and post the story so far...plus I think it kinda adds an interesting element.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind this is all very experimental.  I don't think I've seen anyone post this idea before.  Once I find a challenger, we'll really see how the rules I set up work.<br>
<br>
Rockstew--<br>
Okay, let's say:<br>
Story1=Phantom (Story1 sets the &quot;standard&quot; for page posting)<br>
Story2=Zoolander<br>
<br>
So you start drawing Phantom and I'll start drawing Zoolander.  You finish your Phantom pages and post them. Phantom is story1, and as I mentioned story1 will set the standard.  Because Phantom (story1) sets the standard, as soon as I see you post your pages, I will post my pages for the Zoolander story, even if I am mid-page.<br>
<br>
Then we will switch stories, so that now you will work on Zoolander and I will work on Phantom.  Then when you see my posted Phantom pages (and, once again, since Phantom sets the standard) you will post your Zoolander pages, even if you are mid-page.<br>
<br>
Then we will switch stories again, and the cycle continues.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Possibly you could explain it better but right now i have the idea that it's 3 artist&gt;&gt;<br>
No, this is for 2 artists.  Think of this as if you accepted and started fights for 2 different challenges on the PK challenge board.  But, it just so happens that you accepted challenges from the same person.  The result: 2 players / 2 stories.<br>
<br>
Since this is will be at least as demanding as accepting two challenges at the same time, I would highly recommend my acceptor to NOT be involved in any other fights.<br>
<br>
Please remember to post 2 character pics and a story idea.<br>

That with the stop working when the story is posted and all that stuff you said, I somehow dont understand it, so please rely on me, and just tell me what to draw, and Ill make it as fast as possible. you see Ive got a lot of boring school lessons, so shouldnt be any problem working fast. if u accept all this what Ive just said, lets talk a moment about our charakters and their abilities, cause my charakter has some special habilities and I dont know if they are well suited for your highschool battleing<br>

Haha, good to see our challenges going somewhere.  Okay, lemme try to clear some things up.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I dont like or understand story2...&gt;&gt;<br>
Oh yeah, that's no problem.  I was hoping to discard it anyways.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;...is the ending of the stories to be set from the beginning of our work?&gt;&gt;<br>
No.  Let's not worry about the ending now.  I think it's more important to just get started.  If we see that it will become necessary to discuss the ending mid-story or as we approach the end, we'll do so then.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;can we do it like everyone edits his storyline (you make story1 and me story2) and the other artist has to draw it?&gt;&gt;<br>
I mentioned in an earlier post here, that as long as each story contains my character, your character and somewhat follows the plot--I'm happy<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't think we'll need any editing.  And we'll both be drawing parts of each story as we switch between the two.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;..with the stop working when the story is posted and all that stuff you said, I somehow dont understand it, so please rely on me, and just tell me what to draw...&gt;&gt;<br>
I'm sure once we start, it'll make more sense.  Try to follow the plot and draw what you like.  Also you may want to check out my replies to Jonat and Rockstew above.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;...and Ill make it as fast as possible.&gt;&gt;<br>
Right, but remember that all the timing for the posting of both stories revolves around Story1.  You must remember that I have limited scanner access.  If I am working on Story1, no matter how fast you draw your pages for Story2, we will not be able to switch stories until I have completed and posted my pages.  (Ah, I could explain to try to clarify more, but I think it's better to just get things started.)<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;...cause my charakter has some special habilities and I dont know if they are well suited for your highschool battleing...&gt;&gt;<br>
If you'd like, you can use Jenny Redeyes as your character for Story2.  Just tell me the plot and post a different character for Story1.<br>
<br>
ALright, post yer stuff.  I can scan this Saturday. If you can have something up the day before, then I could post my character for Story2.  If not, that's ok.  All in all, let's just aim at getting started.<br>

heres the mainsketch of story2:<br>
jenny redeyes and the charakter youll make up (should be a char which can fight) are kind of partners, and work together. they are both well known (well known in the underground, you know like gangsta circles and that stuff, doesnt really matter anyway). they take jobs like escort important people, liberate persons that have been kidnapped and such stuff. but they allways fight for the good boys, never for the bad boys (at least not knowing it). so in story2 our two chars get a job which consists in bringing back the young son of a rich guy. but then they find out about somethin which is bigger than just a kidnapping and so on.<br>

Stevo, could you do me a favor and save your &quot;Phantom of the Lonely Hearts Ball&quot; pages as:  phantom1.jpg, phantom2.jpg and etc.<br>
and save your Redeyes story as:  redeyes1.jpg, redeyes2.jpg and etc.<br>
It'll just be easier for me to keep the pages separate.  (If you already saved some pages under different names that's okay, just save next ones like the above examples.)<br>
<br>
Oh, do you have an official name for your redeyes story?<br>
