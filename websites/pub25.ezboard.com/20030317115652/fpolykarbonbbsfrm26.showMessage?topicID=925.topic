I have many ideas.</span><hr size=1> I've always wanted to start a web comic. Unfortunately, while my drawing skills aren't crap, they are not good enough for a webcomic. If anyone wants to help (Write, draw, colour, whatever) I would appreciate it. At the very least read this, it's the beginning to a web comic, an overview really. If you like it I can post a little more of the story, if not you could ask to see another concept. Here it is:<br>
<br>
Title: Voyd<br>
<br>
Eighteen-year-old Alex Yazama has lived a very odd life. Son of the prominent Dr. Yumari Yazama there, he was constantly in the middle of a custody battle between his father and his “uncle” Curtis. This uncle had the most bizarre habit of taking Alex to shooting ranges, dojos, and other various training facilities. His uncle said he was ex-military and he enjoyed this kind of stuff, so Alex never questioned. Along with this custody battle Alex had gaps in his memory from times when he would just blackout randomly. Also, for as long as he could remember, there had been a tattoo of the number “666” across his forehead. Although this was very strange, after living eighteen years with it, it seemed to have lost its importance. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Life was going at a normal pace, well as normal as it had ever been for Alex. When one evening, when he and his father were sitting down at dinner, there was a break in. It was chaos, men breaking in through the windows, crashing through the doors, and all carrying highly advanced firearms. That was the last time Alex saw his father alive, it was also the first time he saw his father dead. The air became thick with bullets, which ripped through his father. Eyes filled with tears and mind filled with revenge Alex grabbed a decorative sword from it’s mantle and turned to face the intruders. He blacked out. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When he woke he was in a dark alley and soaked in blood. Confused and frightened he tried to retrace his steps. From deeper in the alley Alex hears a scream and runs off to investigate. He finds a woman being cornered by two knife-wielding thugs. Doing what felt right, Alex leapt in to defend the woman. Dispatching the thugs with relative ease, Alex turns to make sure the woman is all right. When he looks at her, he notices that she is staring at his stomach in horror. Looking down, Alex realizes that some of the blood on him was his own, from a bullet wound on his stomach. He passes out. <br>

But, there's nothing substantial there.  What's he going to do now?  All that's happened so far is that people have died, and he's blacked out for no apparent reason.<br>
<br>
If the story were to go somewhere, I believe the immediate course of action is for him to figure out what's going on.  You should post the main character's goal when trying to introduce a story, otherwise the story has no substance.<br>
<br>
Also I personally dislike the number &quot;666.&quot;  I've been an atheist for four years and it still unnerves me.  Actually makes my forehead itch, actually.  But that's just a personal problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chapel@polykarbonbbs>Chapel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/7/03 5:27:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I see your point...</span><hr size=1> I see your point Rakurai, but I'm just giving an overview of the beginnig of the story. It builds, trust me. Here's where it really starts to take shape:<br>
<br>
(Oh, and as for that &quot;666&quot; thing, it's only a pseuodo religious reference. Since that number is associated with evil I used it, he's not like the anti-christ or something. You'll understand what it's for if you read.)<br>
<br>
Voyd<br>
La Part Two<br>
<br>
Upon awakening, Alex finds himself inside the girls apartment, she apparently nursed him back to health. She introduces herself as Mitoko Shumari (Does that sound Japanese enough?). They talk about what happened to Alex for a while, then Mitoko goes to get some food for Alex. In the living room a TV is on to a news program. It turns out that Alex is a wanted man. They say that he is a viscious serial killer. Mitoko is shocked and not sure what to believe. She confronts Alex about this. They come to the conclusion that he was set up by the people that killed his father. They decide it would be safer for Alex to hide out in Mitoko’s apartment until they can find a way to get out of all of this.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Meanwhile, elsewhere,  Patrick O’Conner (Irish enough?) a bounty hunter whose down on his luck finds a wanted poster of Alex. The reward is $1,000,000 as long as he is alive. In desperate need of the money Patrick decides to go after Alex. Using his investigative skills and various friends in the police, he finds out about the thugs who were attacked by Alex. He finds them and they tell him about the girl. Luckily enough, one of them had swiped her ID and Patrick is able to find out where she lives.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Meanwhile Alex is sitting around Mitoko’s apartment in deep thought. He’s wondering if he had killed those men who had broken in, maybe he was a murderer. Being so deep in depressing thoughts he doesn’t notice Patrick’s entrance. Patrick places his gun on the back of Alex’s head and tells him to come with him. Alex refuses and tells Patrick to kill him. Patrick, who wants the reward money, promptly refuses. Mitoko returns home and is frightened to find a man holding a gun to Alex’s head. She pleads with him to stop and tells him the story. Patrick turns back to Alex and notices the tattoo on his head. Moving the hair away he is shocked to see the number. He reveals that he has seen similar ones on escaped genetic test subjects from Polymorph Co. (a company which specializes in genetic and cybernetic augmentation). Quincidentally that happens to be the place where Mitoko works as a secretary! The next day at work she breaks in to the file room. She searches to find something about project 666. She finds it on a list titled “Project Voyd”. There are a number of test subjects and pictures in here. Some with “Failure” next to their names others with “Employed” or “Escaped” next to their names.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All the time Mitoko is out Alex talks to Patrick. Alex asks Patrick if he had ever killed some one. Patrick confesses that he had. There is a big emotional scene as Patrick describes what it was like.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mitoko returns with the file. Alex tries to reject this evidence but in the end he sees no other explanation for why his life had been this way. They all decide that it would be best to search for the escapees to see if they know anything about the project, in hopes that they could find out what is going on with Alex.<br>
<br>
(Sorry it's really long, but you can't rush stuff like this.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rakuraikillawatt>Rakurai Killawatt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/9/03 2:39:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> okay</span><hr size=1> That's not long.  Actually that's very cool.  I like that.  It's going somewhere now.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I'm unsure of the setting of this story.  Is it like in the near future, or distant future?  Are the cities very high tech or is everything kind of grungy?<br>
<br>
Also, I think the reason Mitoko is going along should be clear.  I think the easiest reason is that she feels somehow guilty for aiding evil, and needs redemption of some sort.  Same thing with Patrick, since he apparently has killed someone innocent.  And Alex, obviously, wants to know what the hell is going on.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you should keep going, there's definitely something there now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chapel@polykarbonbbs>Chapel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/11/03 8:30:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay</span><hr size=1> Mitoko's helping Voyd because he saved her. She's repaying her debt to him. Pat's motivation is a little unsure actually. I never really thought about why he would help. I guess, since he's for hire, Mitoko will pay him for help. In the end he will bond with the two and just help out of the kindness of his heart though.<br>
<br>
As for the setting, kinda a cyber-punk thing, like Akira. A semi-futuristic Japan.<br>
<br>
If you want me to post more of the story say so, or if you would like me to start writing the actual script and post that I could do that to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chumlybob>ChumlyBob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/14/03 12:58:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay</span><hr size=1> I like the story but i was wonderin how pat knew that the sign on al's head is from polymorph co. or watever they were called?<br>
