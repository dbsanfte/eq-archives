I guess im picky. To tell you guys/gals the truth im working on an anime title myself and thought of an creative storyline, but have paused in search for anime/manga to watch. I think my own anime has spoiled me and i can't seem to find an anime i like. Ive seen a lot of anime (at least i think so) and seem some of the mainstream ones and some of the not so popular ones. Here are some of the ones i liked.<br>
<br>
FLCL (one of my favs)<br>
Puni puni Peomi (funny as hell)<br>
Warriors of the wind (Nausicaa I think its called)<br>
Princess Mononoke<br>
X/1999<br>
Pet shop of Horrors (great stories)<br>
Ninja Scroll<br>
Akira<br>
End of Eva (I dont really like series but i thought this movie was kick butt)<br>
Street Fighter: The Movie<br>
Fatal Fury: Motion Picture<br>
Kiddy Grade<br>
<br>
I like a lot of different kinda anime but i like anime with different things in it mostly Action/Drama/Comedy Mix. Now to narrow the search down ill tell ya what im looking for.<br>
<br>
Im looking for an action anime with Great animation (similar to fighting scenes in FLCL) with either qualtiy ecchi (for the perv in me) or decient comedy. I would like an Samurai/Ninja anime (havn't seen a good one in awhile) but not limited to. If its a mecha movie it should move like fast, human like mechas via evangelion im not fond of robots moving slow or looking like gobots, or voltron. <br>
<br>
As far as the story heres me problem. I hate magic unless its mild or super power like streetfighter/fatal fury. Im tired of the love triangles thers to many school kid love triangles running around (and yes i know why). I would like a believable storyline, not saying it should be realistic, but at least be believable. Im not fond of kids doing crap (14 and under) call me weird. <br>
<br>
I found one manga recently that had pretty good art and character design (art quality) but story sucked major blue munkies. It was called Tenjyou Tenge.<br>
<br>
Ok i know im asking a lot and probably will get a lot of post saying &quot;your to picky&quot; and &quot;your anime list suck&quot; but thats all i could think of at 4:30 in the morning. And a lot of the anime seems redundant. OH and ive seen Naruto for people suggesting that. I forgot to mention i would prefer a movie or short series (like FLCL or 12eps or so) i have a short attention span lol. And i don't like wasting money/time.<br>

Possibly some fansubs. I apologize ahead of time for listing stuff that you possibly have already seen and/or don't like. It's not like we also have a list of everything you've seen (and I can't blame you) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, for what you like already...<br>
<br>
Have you seen Laputa/Castle in the Sky? If you aren't familiar it's a Miyazaki film somewhat similar to Nausicaa in style.<br>
<br>
With FLCL and Puni Puni Poemi I'd *assume* you've watched Excel Saga (Poemi is a spinoff), but if not, there's one. Guu, available on fansub, is also pretty offbeat.<br>
<br>
With some of the movies you list, I'd say you might enjoy Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust and Spriggan, if you haven't seen those. Neither are particularly great stories, but have some excellent animation and action. Possibly the movie version of Escaflowne for the same reasons. The Cowboy Bebop movie is also nicely done.<br>
<br>
For comedy you might check out Chobits (don't be decieved by the package design).<br>
<br>
I haven't seen it, but several of my friends quite liked Samurai Deeper Kyo, for that genre. Or of course Kenshin, but I'd assume you've seen that (plus it's quite large).<br>
<br>
If you haven't checked out Wolf's Rain, Witch Hunter Robin, or Stand Alone Complex, they're all more &quot;realistic&quot; style series done recently...all are only on fansub right now (WHR volume one comes out next month). <br>
<br>
For short series, Blue Submarine #6 and Macross Plus might fit the bill (movie version of Macross Plus is supposed to be better).<br>
<br>
I assume that you've seen big series like Cowboy Bebop, Nadesico, Escaflowne (though that would violate several of your dislikes), Trigun, and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, all I can think of offhand at the moment, and it's lunchtime... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kidace22@polykarbonbbs>kidace22</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/3/03 12:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2510.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   thanks a bunch</span><hr size=1> Thanks A Bunch!<br>
<br>
first i re-read my post and i apologize if i come off rude to anybody. But thanks for the ideas yeah i've seen some and i havn't seen some.<br>
<br>
Ive Heard of Laputa Castle of the sky but i keep forgetting about it for some reason. So i will look into that.<br>
<br>
Excel Saga can get annoying but still funny never heard of Guu but will defenitly look for it now.<br>
<br>
I saw spriggan and clips of bloodlust and i  have cowboy bebop movie i love that one. but only cowboy bebop i think i like from those.<br>
<br>
My ex-roommate has been collecting Chobits like its pokemon i like the series for its creativity and ive seen chibits fansub i thought that was funny.<br>
<br>
I heard Samurai Deeper Kyo was very realistic and history based which threw me off but i may look into it. And as far as Kenshin ive seen the Cartoon Network crap but what caught me first was Samurai X i like that one havn't seen it completely yet so i guess thats next on my list.<br>
<br>
Wolfs Rain i love but the series is TOO long and lost interest in it. It seemed it was going no where..Witch Hunter Robin (i read the story on animenfo.com) looks cool i will have to look into that. GiTs: SAC ive seen a couple of episodes i like it mostly cuz i like Gits and the fukicoma thingies! (little spider tank things i butcher the name).<br>
<br>
Blue Sub #6 i like and am saving up to get the dvd hopefully soon. Nadesico seems cool but the series is pretty long for me but i will give it a shot ive changed my mind before. Escaflowne is to umm magical for me i like the escaflowne robot thingy but i can't get into it for some reason.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the ideas i will get started on the new anime soon.

Nadesico is available in one of those $70 big-plastic-case deals that ADV does...so pretty cheap for the length.<br>
Wolf's Rain I just finished last night, and the main plot gets kinda ambiguous (to me). The worst thing to me is that there were *four* recap episodes.  <br>
<br>
Kenshin on CN is butchered. They took a series with blood and death and all that and made it Y-7...but it's also 95 episodes, and if you aren't keen on 26 episode series, then that's definitely too long. Inuyasha is also right out because of that (around 120 and counting).<br>
<br>
A couple others that occurred to me were Neia Under 7 (also offbeat, though I've only seen a couple eps) and also there's a Ninja Scroll TV series currently on fansub...though I haven't seen any of it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=2510.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=2510.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2510.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=2510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=2510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2510.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm45">Community Art Contest<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm46">Contest Art - Works In Progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm47">Past Contests<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4>General Manga/Anime Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31d<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
