<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cold.  Everything is cold.  Where am I?  Who am I?  what is this question?  Being?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It's cold.  It's realy cold.  When I look at my hands, they're blue.  What's this?  no they're not.  they're gray.  they should be blue.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And it suddenly occurs to me.  I'm not cold.  I cant be cold.  In order to be cold there has to be something to compare it to.  Without warmth in contrast, the fact of cold doesn't exist.  But what about life?  Am i alive?  I've got nothing in contrast to this.  What do I know?  Am I existing?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I'm cold.  If i look up from my gray, oddly featureless hands, all i see is nothingness.  No color. No lack of color.  Just an indescribable nothingness stretching, or as close to stretching as nothing gets, as far as I can see.   Just Nothing.  I take a step foward, and it makes no difference.  I may as well be walking in place.  Nothing I can see has gotten closer or farther away.  No breeze or any type of friction has touched my face.  I dont know if that's because it's not there or just because I cant feel it.  I reach up to make sure that my face is even there, and feel it.  But it's not my face.  It's not even a face under my prodding fingers.  Nothing but a featureless blob sitting atop a cyllindrical neck.  No nose, no mouth, no eyes, no hair. But it's there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This place is frightening me.  The cold, the nothing, and this featureless creature that i feel under my eyes.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I run.  But running gives me no satisfaction.  I'm no farther away from what scares me, and no closer to safety.  But I run none the less, if only to feel like i'm getting somewhere by moving my feet faster.  My feet, I hope.  But i'm not going to look down to check.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I can run no loner I stop and turn in place.  Looking around.  Still nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I take a step foward, but something stops me.  Something painful.  I try again, and i fall this time.  Back on my feet I reach out.  The first solid object i've ever felt.  It's a wall, but what is it doing here?  I turn around to go the other way, and another wall slams into my body.  Turn another direction, and another wall stops me.  The only way I can go now is back from where I came.  I turn to retreat but run into another wall.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I'm in a tiny room.  Just big enough for me to lay down in each direction.  I'm in my corner, curled into a protective ball, hiding from the walls I cant see, but trying to find protection on two sides by them.  I feel small and helpless.  And trapped.  I've been here for an eternity.  Or maybe a few minutes.  It's hard to tell when you've got no memory of how time works.  A second is no longer then an hour, an hour no longer then a year.  Increments lose they're meaning.  All I can do is wait and shiver in this cold.  It's cold.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I just woke up.  I'm not sure when I fell asleep, or how long i've been asleep.  But i know it doesnt matter.  I also know that it wasn't restful.  I felt no more safe, and I'm still tired.  And cold.  But there's something different.  I havent opened my eyes yet.  It makes little difference whether or not I can see here.  Either way there's nothing.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I open my eyes and see just what exactly is different. I force the featurless thing behind my eyes to jump up as fast as it can.  I'm on a road.  A small dirt road surrounded by grass, and in the distance a wall of trees rises above the sea of short green ground and scattered bushes.  A watch a small mouse run across the open feild with a sense of urgency.  Everything mice do is urgent, like in the next minute they'll be gone. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm trying to give the reader the same feeling as the narrator.  Confused, a little freaked out, and not sure what the hell is going on.  Although i think you have some idea of what it is.<br>
I'm thinking about change it to past tense rather then present tense, but i'm not sure if that'll ruin the &quot;personal&quot; mood that it has, and maybe loosten the connection between the narrator and the reader.<br>
<br>
So i need some advice.  <br>
1st: did i catch the mood, both for you and the narrator? -a little confused about what exactly is going on.<br>
2nd:Would changing it to past tense give it less of a personal feel to it?  i know it'd be easier to write, but i'm not sure i want to sacrifice the mood of it just to make it a little simpler for me.<br>
3rd:is it crap?  is it too cluttered, or not descriptive enough, or just way to confusing?<br>
<br>
help is appreciated.  I'm still working on the rest of the story. <p><a href="http://www.unixdaemons.com/~brok3nand4ngry" target="new"><img src="http://www.unixdaemons.com/~brok3nand4ngry/images/34banner.gif" border="0"></a><br><a href="mailto:ninthchannel@hotmail.com"><img src="http://www.unixdaemons.com/~brok3nand4ngry/gifs/ba.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushizukashenlong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShizukaShenlong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/23/02 11:00:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.unixdaemons.com/~omegasd/images/drag.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trying to catch a mood here</span><hr size=1> click on the image in my sig, and go to the boards there, get in touch with Lord Baal there, he is a very skilled writer <p><a href=http://www.unixdaemons.com/~omegasd><img src=http://www.unixdaemons.com/~omegasd/images/top.gif border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukadeity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kadeity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/23/02 11:01:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=601.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trying to catch a mood here</span><hr size=1> Ok,<br>
so most of it rocks,but there is one thing that kept annoying me. &quot;i'ts cold&quot;was in ,like every other line.to repititious,try implying that its cold like saying:<br>
<br>
 &quot;The chill began in my feet and rose through my body like the updraft next to a skyscraper.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Or you could imply the temperature by describing other things,seperating the narrator and reader from the description.like this:<br>
 <br>
&quot;With great effort I exhale,expelling the little moisture in my body into the air,only to oserve the futility of its escape as it crystalizes in the air,as if telling me of things to come.&quot;<br>
 <br>
See,i set a mood,described the character/narrator,and threw in a little foreshadowing in too.The only problem with sentences like this one is that they are too rich in detail and are confusing too he reader,but in essays or stories like yours you want the reader to be confused so its perfect.<br>
 Also,you definately want to keep it in first person because the third person point of view implies even more hevily that the main character lives through the situation than the firs person point of view does,But there is something to be said for 3rd person because it allows the writer to express wisdom better because it implies that the writer has lived through the ordeal himself,though that is often not the case.<br>
 Lastly,one of the best pieces of advice,and most often heard is this: &quot;write what you know&quot;.This means ,simply,you should think of a time in your life when you felt the emotion you are trying to express,confusion and/or coldness,and write about it like your still feeling it.<br>
