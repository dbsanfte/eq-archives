NO! NO!</span><hr size=1> well, i'm kind of in a hurry right now, so this will be short but..<br>
<br>
there are few institutions in japan as xenophobic (and some would say racist?) as Japanese immigrations (and there are a lot).  My main point in bringing this up is that this happens to work out in your favor, if you happen to be an american or western european, as you're one of the &quot;favored few&quot; - i.e. it is extremely unlikely you will be denied entrance into the country, even if you come in with a hacking cough or look like you're two-steps removed from a Phish concert.<br>
(some notes to improve your chances: <br>
1) *DON'T EVER* admit to being sick (there's a special line in Narita that leads to &quot;health inspection and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>quarantine</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;.  Don't even go anywhere near that stupid line. (there may be a bunch of yellow signs demanding you talk to a health official if you &quot;feel ill&quot; - ignore them; they are required only for people from Africa/asia (more about this in a second). You'll be asked on the entrance form if you feel ill.  DO NOT SAY YES even if you are sick.  You will be put in that damn line and you will spend your entire week involuntarily detained by the overzealous, all powerful immigrations officials (and it's not a nice detention - it's almost like you're institutionalized...)<br>
2) Dress nice.  No need for a suit (plus i assume you're going with your family so no real worries), but at the same time, try not to look like a dead broke bum.  About the only thing they might hassel you about is if you look like you don't have any money/are looking for illegal work.  so try not to dress too shabby.)<br>
<br>
anyway, as i was saying, japanese immigrations are super xenophobic and super protective when it comes to anything that may possibly harm japanese society.  This generally  means that people from Asia (especially poor countries like vietnam/thailand/china) have a very hard time getting visas to get into the country and are likely to face much more stringent scrutiny (i.e. searches, health detentions, so forth) than westerners visiting japan.  (people from poorer areas like most of africa, south america, eastern europe and so forth also face major discrimination).  However, the 'upside' to all this is that while right now SARS is raging across Hong Kong, China and the rest of Asia, there still has not been a single case in Japan.  It is next to impossible for people from Asian countries affected with SARS to gain admittance into Japan right now, and those who do face intense health inspections.  So thus far SARS has been kept out of Japan, and moreover, so I wouldn't worry about contracting SARS when you're there.  Furthermore, considering that Japan has one of the best health care systems in the world, it is doubtful that even if SARS should enter Japan that it would spread beyond a few isolated cases (certainly less than here in the US).<br>
<br>
One more thing that might not be obvious but that needs to be said:  DO NOT fly a route which has a stop over in an asian country before going to Japan (i.e. sometimes flights route through singapore or korea before arriving in Japan) and DO NOT make a stop over in an asian country (or other &quot;dodgy&quot; (their opinion, not mine) place like Africa, etc.) before arriving in Japan.  You will face much more scrutiny if you come into Japan via an asian country than if you come straight from the US.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps - Good luck!  <br>

<br>
moms top arguments... still..<br>
<br>
1. &quot;we're not rich! we can't afford it!&quot; (or can we?) ok, i have another topic here asking hoq much a flight over can cost, and i got around $1,500 round trip for 4 adults. not that bad! i got these other prices off a website, explaining how much yen should usually be paid in japan for certain things. ex: a dinner for 3 at a nice resteraunt. 3000-4000 yen.<br>
<br>
how much american money does 1 yen equall anyway? i never found that out.<br>
<br>
2. &quot;SARS is very close to japan. it's in hong kong! we're gonna die if we go!&quot; you explained some of this before, but she claims that she read in the newspaper this morning that we need tons of shots in order to get in the country, and of course all of them need money and effort too.<br>
<br>
3. &quot;it's to far...&quot; i'm the only one in the family that doesn't care how far a place is to actually have a good time, and a different experiance in life.<br>
<br>
4. &quot;i was thinkin some place like virgina....&quot; why!? japan is so much cooler! and alot more interesting in my opinion. we wanted to go somewhere new. so why not somewhere exptic and out of the frickin country.... like japan?<br>
<br>

Fortunately, there has not been a single case of &quot;SARS&quot; found here in Japan so far. But in the circumstances, any case of &quot;SARS&quot; could happen anywhere in the world. Neither vaccine nor effective remedy has been invented yet. You must be very careful about infection in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
BTW, US$1.00 equals Japanese Yen 120.00 (varies a little every day). Say, JYen 3000~4000 corresponds US$25.00~33.33. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aohjpn>aohjpn</A> at: 4/22/03 11:39:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nataki526>Nataki526</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://av.gundamforum.com/avatars/anime/ahmygoddess/15.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/22/03 2:53:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1100.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://av.gundamforum.com/avatars/anime/ahmygoddess/15.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NO!

<br>
1. there was only ONE SARS case detected according to the WHO site.<br>
<br>
2. dinner for two in a decent american chain family restaurants like Dennis', SkyLark, Friday etc cost around up to 3000 yen. note that it's only for dinner, u have to think about breakfast and lunch as well as any snacks in between... also being a tourist u'd probably wanna try some of the native cuisine and sometime they cost even more depending on the restaurant.  100 yen = around 80 or 90 american cents? not sure..<br>
<br>
like i said earlier, the trip to japan isn't the big deal, it's the cost of living that's very high in japan... if u have a host family, that's probably cheaper for u since u've already taken care of the accomodation and food... then put some money on the side to buy omiyage for visiting tourist places like the tokyo disneyland and disney sea which cost around 15000 yen for all day all attraction pass (although comin from america they might pretty much be the same although it's pretty cool listening to mickey and donald speaking japanese) or edomura (some ninja attraction and basically miniature tokyo in edo period) and also the 1st shogun house/grave etc etc.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aohjpn>aohjpn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/8/03 8:22:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1100.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: no..no..yes?</span><hr size=1> WHO reported the cumulative cases of SARS (including probable cases) has been 7054, cumulative death as 506 and average death rate as 15% as of May 8 worldwide.<br>
The cause of SARS has been reported to be a variety of corona virus which have been found also in the body wastes from cockroaches and rats and remain active even outside of living bodies for two to four days.<br>
The most effective ways to prevent infection are such sanitations as hand/finger washing, mouth washing, gargling and so on.<br>
Especially when you have come across things that came through ÅgVia Hong Kong/ChinaÅh transportation routes. you must take special care of yourselves.<br>
Fortunately, not a single case has been found in Japan.

not sure if i said anything about this yet, but anthrax lasted for maybe 3 months, until it wasn't really a threat anymore. whatever happened to that?<br>

I didn't hear anything about them knowing what caused it, but then again I did hear about them knowing what it IS, at least vaguely...it's a virus that's always been around, it just wasn't dangerous, and then just recently it evolved or something and BAM, worldwide panic. :P<br>

SARS is still raging in China and Taiwan.<br>
A Taiwanese young doctor who had been taking care of SARS cases came into Japan on May 15 <br>
for his sightseeing tour around Osaka in Japan. He had been infected by SARS even before entering Japan.<br>
He showed symptoms of SARS just before entering Japan. <br>
He didnÅft understand that he had been infected by SARS, but he thought just he was catching cold. <br>
He took antipyretic he bought at drugstores and could not been found as attacked by fever.<br>
He has now returned Taiwan and isolated immediately after returning Taiwan.<br>
We must be very careful at least until the end of May (10 days after his leave from Japan which is considered as the incubation period of SARS cases).<br>
Fortunately, no case of secondary infection has yet been found in Japan.<br>
Japanese government is now paying its utmost effort in preventive measures against SAARS epidemics.<br>
<br>
Take care! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aohjpn>aohjpn</A> at: 5/20/03 9:24:57 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1100.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1100.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1100.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=1100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=1100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1100.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1100.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm5>Japanese Language Help</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
