I however have many doubts about my storys. <br>
<br>
I believe that they need some work, (other than the fact that I haven't completely named anyone with finalized names and am still missing a good  hook.) <br>
<br>
I'm looking for some (easy going, non-strict) comments that could help me along on my way to create an okay story.<br>
<br>
Please realize this is a rough draft and that there are many spelling errors and grammer problems throughout.  I'm still working on them.  <br>

They continue to climb a hill, one walking while the other on horseback.  Coming to the top of the hill, the snow clears revealing a valley.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  Rose wake up.  We’ve made it.<br>
<br>
     (Waking from a heavy sleep, the young girl stirs.)<br>
<br>
                      Rose:  Have we arrived?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:     Yes.  We’ve finally made it.<br>
<br>
     (Turning to the valley.)  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Holden Valley.<br>
    <br>
     (The sun gently rises revealing a town deep within the valley.)<br>
<br>
     (The two walk into town, searching for a stable to rest their horse.  Walking the horse to the barn, they give him to the stable hand.  They walk through the crowd toward a small bar.  Upon entering, they head to the counter.)<br>
<br>
              Bar Tender:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Would you like a drink?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ale, please.<br>
     <br>
     (Music and laughter fill the room.  Some are drinking, others are playing pool, and some are criticizing the singer onstage.  The waiter returns from serving a customer with a golden coil bracelet on his tray.  Hiro looks at the bracelet, a memory flash of a destroyed landscape a symbol.  Another man approaches.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where did you get this?  Tell me!<br>
                    Waiter:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Table three, that guy gave it as payment for his meal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose and Hiro look at the table.  A small person in a brown cape and hood sat finishing his meal.  Even though he was eating, his face was not visible.  Turning to Hiro.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                 Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do you think it’s one of them…one of those monsters?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know but if it is, we’ll soon find out.  (Pointing to the two approaching the table.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (As they come closer the being stops eating.  The man sits next to him while the other sits on the opposite side.)  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp             1st Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (whisper) We know what you are. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The being stirs as if to get up.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp              &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
                 2nd Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not so fast<br>
                  1st Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We wouldn’t want to make a mess. (Pulling out his dagger)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The being motions.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp             <br>
                  1st Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then shall we?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (As the man stands, the piano on the other side of the room lets out a large bang as the singer falls into it.  The man turns to look giving the being enough time to push the man out of the way, grab the bracelet off the table and head out the door.)  (As the being runs the wind pushes the hood back revealing the face of a young girl.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ayah!!  //Hi!  My name’s Lena. If you haven’t guessed already// noise of several money pouches //I’m a thief.  Actually my ancestors were warriors, that I know for certain.  Strange how they were reduced to pick pocketing and stealing.  Well, life’s not that bad.  Hey, at least I haven’t got caught.//<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At that moment, the bartender appears in front of her and grabs her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Bar Tender:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You little thief, how dar you try’en steal a meal on my watch. (Tightening his grip)  I’ll make you pay.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He raises his hand to punch when he is knocked down from behind.  Lena looks up to see a boy behind him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on Lena, let’s get outta here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp //Oh, this is Tyo.  He’s an orphan, just like me.  We’ve been together, forever.  He sees the future of events and I use them to get us money.  A perfect friendship.  We depend on each other almost as if we were family.  But I’m older, so I come up with the schemes.//<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two continue running until they reach an inn and enter.  Acting calm, they walk to their rooms and quickly close the door.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, how much did ya get.  It sounds like a lot.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy shakes a bag making it clear he is blind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, lets see.  (Empties the bags and begins counting)  One, ten, twenty, twenty-seven, (mumbling)  Wow, 250 gin, that makes 750 total.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is that enough for a boat?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, not yet. (sadly)  The boat dealer said a boat costs well over 110,000 gin, but at least we have enough to get us a boat ticket.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One ticket?!  How’s that going to help us?  We both have to go and I know they're in a place that tourist boats don’t go.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I just though we could try’en find a place with lower ship prices.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, we’ve been all over this country and this town has the cheapest boats.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, we could go to Golden Isle and then rob them blind.  (jumping off the chair)  I mean, where else to get good money but a casino town.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, we can’t rob a huge place like that.  We barely get away with robbing restaurants.  We’ll be wanted felons.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But don’t you yearn for the adventure of a lifetime.  We’ll be famous.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, we’ll be wanted, hunted, dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (agitated)  Well, what do you want to do, continue to rob small restaurants?  Every time we rob one, we have to run and at this rate we’ll have the money in…never!!  Our parents will never recognize us if they’re dead!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo becomes very upset)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s ok.  I’m not crying.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright, I’ll pay the 100 gin for the room and you get something to eat.  (Lena leaves.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo grabs a handful of coins and puts them in his pouch.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  I just know we have to stay in this town a little longer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Outside.  Lena heads to the counter and gives the innkeeper the money.  She walks out and looks down at her daggers.  They were poorly mended and looked as if they were very dull.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe I’ll buy some new weapons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena heads toward a store.  Entering, with her hood drawn down, she approaches the counter.  Looking at the merchandise, she looks at the expensive prices.  At this time, Rose and Hiro enter and watch Lena.  Lena gazes over a beautifully crafted dagger set.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     Store Keeper:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah!  That is one of our finest models.  Crafted entirely out of sturdy white platinum and a bargain at only 32,000 gin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do you have anything crafted from diamond iron?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Store Keeper:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Give me a moment.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The storekeeper leaves toward the back while she slipped the daggers under her robe.  He came back with a very expensive short sword.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Store Keeper:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is this to your liking?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, I’ve changed my mind, but I love this full leather case, it has a rather earthy feel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Store Keeper:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well that only cost 150 gin. (Slightly disappointed)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And this staff, it’s just so wonderful.  (She slips a beautiful case into her robe)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Store Keeper:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is a fine model, but it’s only 32 gin.  (Even more disappointed)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I believe I’ll take it.  (Hands several coins to the storekeeper, in so grabbing another staff that looks very well made and expensive)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro and Rose watch her very carefully and when she leaves, they follow her.  Lena becomes aware of being followed.  She starts to jog and cuts down an alley.  Hiro enters and doesn’t see anyone.  He hurries down the alley when the camera rests on Lena standing on a window.  She jumps down and comes face to face with Rose.  Lena turns and Hiro is right behind her.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, hi.  Were you going to buy this?  Or are you officers or, //stuttering// maybe bounty hunters?  I don’t have any bounty on my head but if you want we can haggle for the items I have?<br>
<br>
(Rose draws and puts it up to Lena’s neck area.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take your gloves off, nice and slowly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena takes off her gloves and drops them on the ground, only exposing the top of her hands.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turn them over.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena grows nervous, she slowly turns over her hands revealing two symbols on her hands.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She’s one of them!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose swings her sword.  Lena dodges it but her robe becomes caught.  Lena slips out and takes off.  She runs along the alley until she spots Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo! <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo turns at the sound of her voice and she grabs him and hands him the staff.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I got this for you, but we have to get out of here!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did you get caught stealing it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, but I ran into some people who want to kill me.  //But how did they know about my hands?  I never shown them to anyone and what did they mean by I’m one of Them?//<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They run until Rose heads them off on a horse.  Hiro comes from behind and grabs Lena by her hair.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ow.  Let go!!  I don’t know why you’re after me but lay off my hair!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo stumbles for his staff in an effort to fight back.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, who are they?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose pulls her blade and starts to place it near Tyo’s neck.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo grabs Rose’s arm and takes the sword.  He backs up, blindly waving the sword at an invisible enemy.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let her go!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why do you protect a demon?  We wish to offer you freedom from your servitude.  Why do you refuse it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena’s not a demon.  She’s my friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose: (To Hiro)  She must have complete control over him.  It can only be broken with her death.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena pulls her dagger from her case and tries to cut Hiro’s hand.  Instead, she cuts her hair out of his grasp.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena: (backing up)  Look what you did to my hair! (To Tyo)  Your staff is right behind your left foot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo reaches down and grabs the staff.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo: (To Lena)  Are you okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fine, besides that now I need a new hairstyle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can’t get away, we’ll catch you and kill you just as you did them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who?!  I have no idea who the heck you are talking about or why your attacking me or even who you think I am.  I know I have never hurt anyone, I haven’t done anything to you people and you just messed up my hair!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t lie.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But I’m not lying!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo remains silent as he approaches Rose.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What are you doing?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I want to know who they are.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo touches Roses head.  Tyo sees flashes of fire, death, young Rose and an evil face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena.  They’re on a journey.  They want to find your race also, no, an evil one who is with your race.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose has tears rolling down her face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe we can help you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro, he’s not under evil.  He knows she is not one of the monsters.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all lower their weapons.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What about my hair?!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later, the group is siting around at an inn.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, you’re looking for your families and all you have to go on are a blind boy’s “visions?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  Something wrong with that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, just asking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What about you guys?  What’s your angle?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re on a search for a monster that invaded our village and enslaved it.  They all we taken to be sacrificed to the monster.  Hiro and I hid in the forest until they all left.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena: (sadly)  I’m sorry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose: (scornfully)  You should be!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena draws back to herself.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on Rose, it’s not Lena’s fault it happened.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lets get some rest.  We have a lot of traveling to do tomorrow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, what’s the plan?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, we don’t know much about the monsters, so once you are seeking info about them as well, we will work together.  Once separate our parties have uncovered little.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You need a boat to reach Vile Island and we have one.  However, the island moves and no one knows where it will be next.  Once you, (pointing) see visions of the island, you might be able to find the location.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We believe there is an entire civilization there, made up of beings like yourself.  It may give us the clues to obtain our objectives.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, we better get some sleep before morning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group leaves town, Tyo and Lena are on a horse together while Rose and Hiro ride on their horse.  Lena turns to Rose and Hiro.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why don’t you guys have a buggy?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose: (looking over at Lena)  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I mean, you are old enough to have one, right?  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We can’t afford one yet, besides, (pets the horse) he was my mother’s.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They continue on.  It is still snowing.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, how do you make money?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes we work as bounty hunters, other times we stay in touch with our friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our friend?  His name is Fazz.  He owns a business in Golden Isle.  We met him soon after our parents died.  He helped us out and sometimes loans us money.  In return, we do him favors such as being bodyguards for clients and what not.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So where is this boat of yours?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s actually Fazz’s.  We just borrow it from time to time.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So we’re going to Golden Isle.  //Well, if these guys turn on us at least we might be able to steal their boat and some money.//<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They approach a large gate.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally, Afton Gate.  Strange, it seems larger each time I see it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Two guards come into view.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Guard 1:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m sorry but no one is allowed to pass.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What?!  After we came all this way!  Well, what’s going on?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Guard 1:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is a rebellion going on and the gates have been temporarily closed down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But we have urgent business in Golden Isle and…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Guard 2:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sorry, but no one passes through this gate.  Leave or we will be forced to arrest you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dirty (muffle, muffle).<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group step away from the gate.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The quickest way besides the gate would mean going through Colton.  Its about five miles from here near the Afton reactor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ve got to be careful.  Reactors cause mutations in the mind and body.  The town’s people are probably hideous and mad.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The only other ways are to go completely around the mountain range, which will take four months.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now way!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Or over the mountains, which span an elevation of 16,000 feet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think we should take the village, we won’t be there long enough to go crazy and Lena and me know some people there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  We’ve traveled past the Afton area about three years ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then we’re goin to Colton.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group moves out toward the town.  They eventually make it to the town.  It is filled with demi-humans and mutants.  Workers from the mines are returning from a long day’s work.  Children are playing in the dirt streets.  The houses are very shabby.  A rusty buggy sits in the front section of the town.  As they approach one child yells.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Child:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, its Wena an Treeo!  Theyn come bake!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A lady wearing an apron comes out of one of the houses.  She opens her arms as Lena runs and hugs her.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s been a long time hasn’t it.  It’s good to see ya Aunt Abbie.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, where have you been?  I’ve been so worried that something happened to you.  Well, no need to worry now.  Why don’t you and your friends come in for a bite and a nap, you must be exhausted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo, who is normally helped off the horse by Lena, falls off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp See.  Tyo is already falling head over heals to get in at some of my home cooking.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thanks, auntie but we were only passing through.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo is stumbling up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We need to use the cave to get on the other side of the mountain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, at least eat something before you go.  The cave is quite dangerous and it’s unsafe to travel on an empty stomach.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They tie up their horses and head inside.  The house is very well kept, with curtains and other such knickknacks.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow!  I sure like what you done to the place.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo: (Running into a table) You’ve moved things around.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Abbie starts picking up some dishes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I wasn’t expecting company.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose and Lena move in to help with the dishes.  Tyo uses his staff to map out the room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So what business do you have on the other side?  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ve finally found a boat but it’s at Golden Isle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Truly?  Well, be careful.  The sea has been known to trick the most experienced sailors.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t worry.  Hiro and me have traveled the seas for most our lives.  We’ll be careful.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well that’s a relief.  (To Lena and Tyo) So, what have you two been up to?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:(eating) We’ve been traveling a lot.  Been to about fifteen different cities.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, you two have been all over Auron haven’t you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah, we’ve made 750 gin, but now it’s down to 625gin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But at least you’ve got a boat and now you can find your parents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose, Lena, and Hiro start picking up the dishes.  Tyo tries to help but Abbie motions and talks.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s okay, dear.  I’ll do it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (After putting the dishes away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you for the meal, it was delicious.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Abbie:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, thank you young man.  (To all) You all have a safe journey.  (Abbie’s tone becomes very serious) And Lena, remember that life has a place for everyone, don’t forget your place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena continues to watch Abbie as they get on the animals and leave.  They move through town and finally come along the trail.  It’s a large hole in the side of the mountain that leads into a large cave system.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We have to be careful.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stay together, (to Hiro) we’ll walk the horses on through.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group, continue through.  Rose slightly leaning to Hiro, while Tyo and Lena hold hands as to make sure they don’t loose one another.  They continue, Hiro holding the lamp he pulled from his saddlebag.  A noise springs Rose closer to Hiro with a yelp.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What was that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Probably a bat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They continue onward into the cave.  After so long…)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We should be getting to the end pretty soon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I sure hope so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (There is a rustling from the far corner.  Rose tries to act as if she doesn’t notice.  The noise gets louder.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (whisper) It’s only a bat, only a bat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A large worm-like creature comes out.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It ain’t no bat!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The horses get frightened and try to break free.  Hiro tosses the reigns to Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey Tyo!  Hold on to him for a while and get back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right.  (Pulling the horses away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose has her sword drawn, as well as Hiro.  Lena has her daggers our.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, get out of here.  We’ll handle this.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah right!  I ain’t gonna let you two get killed!  Tyo and me need that boat!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just stay out of our way!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose runs forward and stabs the worm in the side.  They worm shrieks and throws her away.  Hiro runs and helps Rose.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you alright?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The worm heads straight for Hiro and Rose.  Hiro raises his sword for protection.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeeeeaaaaahhhh!!!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena runs up the back of the worm, up to its head.  It swings to knock her off.  Lena stabs her dagger deep in its head.  The worm continues to shake.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Throw me your sword!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro throws the sword upward.  Lena grabs it and jams it into the worm’s head.  The worm shrieks and falls over.  Lena rolls off onto the ground.  Lena stands up and dusts herself off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (yells) Hey Tyo!  Come on back.  It’s dead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena walks over and pulls her dagger out of the worm.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t need my help.  Ha!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro walks over and pulls his sword out while Rose gets the horse from Tyo.  They walk around the worm and head out.  As they do a small shadow appears behind the worm.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (Deep breath) Finally, fresh air.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sound like you’ve never been in a cave before.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose is irritated.  Hiro and Lena take the horses to the water for a drink.  Tyo washes his face in the water.  Rose pulls out a rag and begins to wipe off the worm blood off her sword and clothes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe we should rest here for the evening.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Geez!  At this rate we’ll be at Golden Isle in two weeks.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m kind of tired.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, alright, but don’t complain to me when we are walkin when we could be on that boat and gone by tomorrow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose and Hiro begin to set up camp.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Late that night, Tyo and Lena are out cold.  Lena is snoring and talking in her sleep.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So what do you think?  Can we truly trust her?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know.  Tyo is definitely innocent but I don’t know if Lena will turn on us or not.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She is one of them.  How else could she kill that creature so easily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I used most of my strength to break the skin but she went right through the bone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, we’d better get to sleep.  Tomorrow’s goin to be a long day.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Good night, Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Good night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Morning.  Rose, Hiro, and Lena are loading the horses.  Tyo is sitting next to the water.  Lena stops and looks at him.  Hiro indicates to look at Lena and Tyo.  Lena walks a little closer.  Tyo shakes.  Pictures of an island, blood flowing off a dagger, Lena standing in the arms of someone.  Tyo’s eyes open.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did ya see it?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro and Rose become anxious to hear.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s close and…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We should be able to get to it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You know where it is?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes, but we have to hurry before it moves again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena grabs Tyo’s staff and begins packing the rest up)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, what are ya waitin for?   We’ve gotta get that boat and get off this rock!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena grabs Tyo and helps him on the horse.  Hiro and Rose do the same.  They all leave together, they continue until nightfall.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Comon, we can travel at night!  It’s no big dif then travelin durin the day!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, what’s your problem!  You can’t just run them to the brink of exhaustion! (pointing to the horses.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But we’ve got to hurry!  We can ride all night and make it to Fort Tyon in the mornin!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you sure you’re up for that kind of trip?  That’s a long ride in one night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (Tough)  No worries here.  I could make the journey in my sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group is moving.  Rose is on a horse with Lena asleep.  Tyo is wide-awake riding on the horse with Hiro.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We should be approaching a small stream.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They then come across a stream, not very small but not as large as a river.  Rose goes in fast, splashing Lena with water.  Lena falls off while Rose gets to the other side.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (jumping) You!! I’m gonna get you for this and I swear!  You’re gonna pay..<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena slips in the soft mud and falls on her back.  Rose is laughing hysterically.  Tyo is trying not to laugh.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (trying not to laugh) Are you okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do I sound okay to you?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t just stand there!  Help me!  I’m stuck!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose is still laughing.  Hiro goes back and helps Lena out of the mud.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There should be a small pool at the end of the stream.  Go and get cleaned up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose stops laughing.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You could use a dip, too.  Tyo and I will fix breakfast.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena and Rose leave with a good amount of distance between one another.  Tyo walks to the horse and begins to go through the supplies pulling out a pan and several other cooking utensils.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is Rose always that mean or what?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well,  I just think she doesn’t like Lena very much.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?  Is it because she is like those who trashed your village?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How do you know that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When we met, I shared Rose’s memories and emotions that were making you guys attack us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How come you two are looking for your parents?  I mean, they’re the people who left you guys.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not really.  (continuing to “look” through the different pan sizes)  I was found in a cart in Fort Tyon just after the evacuation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And Lena?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know.  She never really talked about it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Really?  How long have you two been together?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About four years.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And she never told you how she lost her family?  The family she’s been looking for all these years?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, not really.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They hear some screaming coming from Rose and Lena’s direction.  Hiro grabs his sword and runs to the noise.  Tyo follows closely behind.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They arrive at the pool.  Lena and Rose are on top of a large boulder.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s wrong?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena and Rose both point to the bottom where three snakes are.  Hiro laughs.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s so funny!?  Help me!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro walks over and picks up the snakes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What are you doing?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Their harmless.  Come on down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No way!  I hate snakes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So do I!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro moves the snakes over and throws them in the brush. Hiro heads back to camp.  Tyo stands still.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (to Hiro) I wasn’t scared!  (after Hiro walks away) Hey Tyo!  What are you waiting for?  Get outta here!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo turns and leaves.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group are sitting around.  The horses are eating some grass.  Tyo is eating.  Rose and Lena are quiet.  Lena gets up and cleans off her plate in the stream.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (breaking the silence) We should be moving on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena and Rose nod.  They pack up and push on.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They soon arrive at Fort Tyon. There is a large fence surrounding it made from logs.  The front gate is open and people are walking freely about.  As soon as they hitch the horses up, Tyo jumps off and runs to a house and tries to open the door.  He can’t so he knocks.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mom!  It’s me!  Tyo!  I’m back!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (An elderly woman comes to the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, Tyo.  How have you been?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just fine.  We were traveling through and decided to drop by for a visit.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena, you sure have grown into a beautiful young lady.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You don’t look so bad yourself, Grandma Emily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But who is this?  (Points to Hiro and Rose)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh.  This is Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why, hello young man.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (continued) And Rose.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is a pleasure to meat you Ms. Emily.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why it is grand to see you children hanging around with such a handsome couple.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose blushes.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re not going out, we’re just friends.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, you can’t hide anything from me.  Well, come in, come in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They enter into the house.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (anxiously) What did you make for lunch?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Luckily, your favorite.  Hedgehog pot pie.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro, Rose and Lena have a slightly disgusted look on their faces.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And what will you three be having.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re fine.  We’ve had plenty to eat today.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suit yourself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later that evening, they are all lying in the guestroom while Tyo sleeps in his old room.  Hiro is on the floor as Lena and Rose take the beds.  Lena is fast asleep.  Hiro is talking to Rose.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve found out she’s never told Tyo anything about her parents or how she was abandoned.  I don’t even think Tyo knows she’s not a normal humanoid.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe she’s taking advantage of him?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know, but we can take advantage of the fact that they're heading to Vile Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll make those monsters pay for the damage they caused.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Morning, the group packs up and starts heading toward Gilden.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emily:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Good bye, Tyo, Lena, Rose, Hiro, make sure to eat healthy and stay out of harms way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They make it to Starlight bay.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One more day and we’ll be on that boat and off to find our parents.  //And we’ll have enough gin to ditch those weirdoes//.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (All of them are sitting around a fire.  Hiro stirs the food while Rose seems unsettled.  Tyo is unpacking a section of pie he got from Emily.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re not really going to eat that, are you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why not?  She made it for me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo takes a big bite out of the pie.  Lena has a rather revolting look on her face.  The pie has holes in the top of the crust revealing fried scaly flesh.  The matter is gray with brown and orange spots.  The crust itself slimy and in some places appears to have mold.  Tyo chomps away happily.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can’t believe you’ve survived on her cooking for six years.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The night goes on.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Morning, Lena awakens alone.  She looks around and finds that she’s completely alone.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What!  Did they leave me?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She stumbles around in her cover and finally gets free.  She looks around and calls her horse.  No reply.  She spots some tracks and begins to follow them.  They lead her to a pool with Hiro and Rose joyfully splashing around.  Tyo is “looking” at the trees feeling a rock of some sort.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (mad) Why in the world did you leave me all alone!?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo drops the rock in surprise.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s not our fault you slept in.  We just wanted to take a dip.  I mean come on, Lena.  What else could we do.  Your snoring kept us up most the night.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena stomps off irritated.  Rose laughs as she leaves.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later, the group moves onward and makes it to Gilden.  There are many large stores and pawnshops.  There are very little houses.  The streets are filled with people in rags while others in fancy clothing.  Some other people are trying to sell merchandise.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll buy supplies for the trip here.  Just the basics. (turning toward Lena) And stay out of trouble.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright, alright.  Geez, what do you think.  I’ll go off and do something stupid?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They break apart.  Hiro heading toward the dock, Rose for the stores and Lena turns to Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, what do you want to do?  Once we already gotta boat, we have over 600 gin to spend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t you think we should spend it on supplies like Hiro said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro’s not my boss.  We can do as we please.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena heads off leaving Tyo behind.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena!!  Don’t leave me!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena comes up behind him.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on.  Are you waiting for Hades to freeze over?  Let’s go shopping. (pulling on her cloak)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The two head into the crowd.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I wonder where Lena and Tyo are?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thief!!  Police!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Woman:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve been robbed!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Man:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My money’s gone!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro and Rose turn to see Tyo and Lena running to the ferry.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are we leaving now?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I though I told you two to stay out of trouble!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trouble?  Us?  Never…(a money pouch falls from Lena’s cloak.)  Uh…We found it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on.  We’re leaving.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena and Tyo get into the boat.  Rose does also.  Hiro pushes the boat off port and then turns the motor on.  Lena and Tyo start counting the money they collected.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow!  We should of come here when we were aching for money.  10,000 gin in one day!  Wow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll have to drop by that place more often.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ferry continues to travel toward the Isle.  They soon approach the Isle.  There are bright lights and lots of music.  They come across the large gate entrance.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Welcome to the Golden Isle, the one place where dreams can come true.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That sounds nice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only if you’re a business partner with Fazz.  This entire isle is a giant scam to steal money from the gullible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My kind of place.  So where is this Fazz friend of yours?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t worry about it.  I’ll go and get the boat from Fazz.  Rose, you take Lena and Tyo to the inn and wait there until I get back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But I wanted to look around!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Me too!<br>
Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This isn’t the place for pick pocketing.  You could get in big trouble.<br>
Lena:  (aggravated)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just go to the inn and wait for me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fine.  Just make it snappy.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose is sitting in front of the door when Hiro finally returns.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He said it’s fine.  We’ll have to pay him back later, though.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What does he want?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He wants a rock from the island.  But, if we don’t find it, we’ve got to continue with our normal work until we pay him off.  So, how are the others doing?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They’ve complained a few times but I think they’ve fallen asleep.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro opens the door.  Lena has a towel draped around her.  Her cloak is sitting on a chair behind her.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah!  Don’t look!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (shutting the door) Sorry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose is laughing.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe you should of knocked first.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cut it out Rose.  Tell them to get ready.  We’ve got some more traveling to do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro’s face is red when he leaves.  Rose knocks on the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You heard him, hop to it.  (walks off)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk out together and approach the ship dock.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow, when you said you guys had a boat, you weren’t joking.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Before them is a cruise liner type boat with smoke stacks and lots of people loading.  A young girl approaches.  She appears around 20 maybe younger and is a demi-human.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hi, Feona.  Is the boat ready?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Almost, it has a few things that need cleaned here and there but it should be ready to go.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, Feona.  This is Lena and Tyo.  They’ll be coming along with us.  Lena, Tyo, this is Feona, the ships mechanic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s nice to meet you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahhh… Their so cute!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group boards the ship.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve got some work to do down below.  You guys can do as ya please.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro nods.  Feona notices that Lena and Tyo are struggling with a large trunk.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here, let me help you two.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona walks over and picks up the trunk.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, you guys sure know how to pack.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She walks up the ramp with the trunk.  The boat pulls out of the port and starts heading out to sea.)<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo goes up to the wheel room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo, where do we go from here?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m not sure.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What!  Don’t tell me you can’t sense it anymore!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s not like that.  It’s just…I don’t think were going to be going to the island anytime soon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What do you mean by that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:  (Outside) Stop this boat immediately!  This is the APD!  All hands are to report on deck.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone comes up to the deck.  The police come down on their hover bikes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s the problem officer?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Captain:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We have reason to suspect there is a vault robber on board.  It’s standard for us to search this vessel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The police are going through the boat.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Captain.  We’ve found something.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Two officers come hauling Lena’s trunk.  They are having a hard time hauling it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Captain:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s in it?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (One of the officers breaks open the lock with a bar.  They open it revealing undergarments and makeup.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oops!  Sorry sir.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The officers pick up the trunk to take it back when one of the officers drops a side and the top layer of the trunk, with the makeup, comes out revealing a trunk full of money.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Captain:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah ha! (turning to the group)  You are all under arrest.  Once you were caught in Adelle waters, you have no rights and are immediately sentenced to life on Outlaw Isle.  All of your property is to be given back to its previous owners.  The only things you are permitted to take are three pairs of clothing and as many weapons as you deem worthy.  You are not, however, to bring any type of medicine, books, laptops, or any other forms of technology.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The police move forward and cuff everyone.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wait!  I had no part in this!  I’m only the mechanic!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The police each take them to a hover van that has just came up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wait!  This is not fair!  I’m not a criminal!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They are placed in the van and as it leaves the boat turns around and heads back to port.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (In the jail cell.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, it woulda worked if you would of hurried up!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, just shut up!  You and your race have caused enough trouble already!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena sits down and looks slightly upset.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on, Rose.  It’s not all Lena’s fault.  I helped her, so it’s partly my fault.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, I think it’s all of you guy’s fault!  I can’t believe they think a beautiful woman, like me, would steal money!  Men give me plenty of money and gold all the time.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enough babbling over what has already happened.  Right now we’ve got to find a way out of here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Just then, a man comes in.  He is rather odd looking and acts very gay.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, well, well.  Look what the cops caught. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tisk, tisk.  Hiro, you know if you wanted money, all you had to do was ask.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I didn’t.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I know you didn’t but your traveling with two small time pick pocketers with itchy fingers.  Well, I guess I better get going.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wait!  Aren’t you going to help us out?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, I would if I could, but I can’t.  You were convicted and sentenced with no chance of parole.  I just wanted to stop in and say good bye before you’re sent off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  They can’t lock me up!  They just can’t!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fazz:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sorry, but they already did. (To Rose)  Don’t worry, I’ll make sure your horse, Des, will be properly taken care of.  Well, toddles!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Fazz walks away still smiling as big as he was when he walked in.  Feona flops down on a chair.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, you guys have officially ruined my day!  I had a date with Mike tonight.  Thanks a lot!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I told you, we’d get caught.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enough already!  Fine, I messed up everything!  I endangered everyone and now I’m going to pay the price, but we have to get out of this.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And how will we do that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on, there has to be a way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everybody is sitting quietly as if waiting for someone to answer.  The police come in.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright, time to escort these felons to their car.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They come in and everyone is taken to a hover van.  The van takes off.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They are hovering above a watery area.  The officer opens the doors.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright, get out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What!  But we haven’t even landed yet!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:  (raising his gun) Get out!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro stands up.  He walks over to the door.  The officer pushes him and he falls.  You hear a splash in some water.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Officer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose stands and jumps out.  Lena helps Tyo to the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now you’ve got ta hold your breath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo nods and jumps out.  Lena follows closely.  Two officers are pulling Feona to the door.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I won’t do it!  You can’t make me!  No!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They finally get her out and she falls.  Her head comes up out of the water mumbling.  They all come out of the water.  Lena is helping Tyo as he chokes.  Feona comes out and pushes everyone out of her way.  She is still mumbling.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (Very angry) Well, you all did what I thought nobody could do!  You not only got me arrested, humiliated and condemned but also managed to get my HAIR messed up and my clothes wet in the process!!  I can’t believe what’s happened to me!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She stomps off still very angry.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, at least the day hasn’t been a total lose.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I heard that!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose walks forward and looks around.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So this is Outlaw Island.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The scenery is one of a destroyed city with rubble everywhere.  There are several groups of people fighting with some children carrying guns as they walk.  In the distance you can see police control towers on top of the mountains surrounding them.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s even worse than I imagined.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I bet you two have got loads of friends here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Just then a demi-human raises from the trash.  He is large with brown fur all over him.  He looks kind of like a werewolf who has been rolling in the trash.  His eyes are red and his teeth are yellow.  He stands around 7 foot and looks very ferocious.  He comes at Rose but she raises her sword and blocks the attack.  The monster backs up a few steps and starts another attack when a large metal hand grabs its neck.  The monster struggles but to no use.  The robot picks up the monster and hurls it into the water.  Fizz and steam appear as the monster dissolves.  The robot turns around and faces the group, now reformed.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You must be new around here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  Just arrived.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, for your information, this is a tough neighborhood.  No place for girls.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We can take care of ourselves.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t speak so loosely, woman.  You wouldn’t want to loose that tongue of yours.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (pulling out her sword) I’d like to see you try it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, you shouldn’t be threatening me.  I’m a very strong guy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Get outta that tin can and I’ll show you how strong a girl can be.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Kael is silent.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s the matter?  Afraid you might be beaten by a girl?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp N…no.  I just prefer to fight in my mobile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (lowering sword) You’re wasting my time.  You might have a powerful mobile, but you’re nothing but a chicken on the inside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take that back!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (To everyone else) Come on, there’s no help in this guy.  We better get moving.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take it back!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone starts walking away.  The mobile lowers to the ground and the middle opens up.  Out of it comes a little girl with her fists up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on!  Lets get this started!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why, you’re a little girl, ain’t ya?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  I’m not!  I’m a strong young man!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (rubbing Didier’s head.) Ahh.  Aren’t you the cutest little thing I’ve ever saw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier takes a few swings at Feona then trips and falls.  Feona picks her up and begins to rock her back and forth like a baby.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh…Poor little baby.  Auntie Fe will make everything all better.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cut that out!  I ain’t no baby and you ain’t my aunt!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier gets out of her grasp.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are y’all nuts?  Not only are ya all girls but you don’t even have any mobiles…or any sense.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A person who hides behind a mobile is not only a coward but also a weakling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (very red in the face and starting to cry) I…am…not!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier runs over and tries to hit Rose but she just pushes her away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose, look what you did.  You hurt her feelings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo walks over and begins feeling the mobile.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did you build this all by yourself?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  Leave that alone!<br>
<br>
(Tyo gets pulled in and the robot begins walking around irrationally.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Push the red button!  The red one!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s no use, he’s blind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier looks at Lena then she turns back to the robot.  Didier pulls out a control panel and pushes a button on it.  With that the robot stops moving and it falls to the ground.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s okay.  The cockpit’s padded against hits.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all head over to the mobile.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Okay, Tyo.  Now listen to me.  Reach forward and you will find a large lever.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (inside) I feel it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Go over two buttons to the right of the lever.  The button will feel like a triangle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Found it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Push that button.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Even though it is lying on the ground sideways, the robot puts it’s legs together and bends them.  The door opens up.  Lena helps Tyo out while Didier checks the cockpit for damage.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m okay.  I’m not hurt, really.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (Turning to the others) Okay, you guys are desperately in need of help.  (climbs inside the cockpit) How about you guys come over to my house and get washed up.  The water you were just in has a very high acidity and if ya don’t get it off soon it’ll burn your skin off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh!  Not my skin!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fine.  We’ll go kid.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right…and the name’s Didier.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The door on the mobile shuts and they all walk off.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They soon come up to a shabby house but upon entering see there is nothing inside but a steel floor and walls.  All of a sudden the door closes and they start heading down.  The shack is some kind of elevator.  They reach the bottom and a door opens.  There are tons of equipment and technology.  Computers and other machines buzz in the room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow…I thought they didn’t allow any computers or stuff on the island.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’d be surprised what gets by these guards.  The bathing rooms are through those doors.  Women on the left, men on the right.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all thank her.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t mention it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro and Tyo head through to the men’s, while Rose, Lena and Feona head to the women’s.  When they open the doors you can see hot springs and tons of trees and sunlight even though they are under ground.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone has just come out of the rooms.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, do ya want some fresh clothes?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier puts the goggles on her forehead down to her eyes.  She then begins to move her fingers as if she is typing.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What type of clothes do ya want?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I want a new headband, a nice blouse, a new pair of shoes, some nice pants…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Okay, okay, give me a minute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A white ring appears above Feona’s head.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And enter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ring goes down to the floor and on the way back up, Feona’s clothes change.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow!  That’s a neat trick.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the rest of you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We just what our clothes cleaned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Several rings appear above them.  They all lower and rise cleaning everyone’s clothes.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (taking the goggles off and turning to Rose) Just admit it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Admit what?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That I’m a genius.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t push it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier seems a little hurt but soon casts her attention elsewhere.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, what brings you to Outlaw Island, anyway?  You don’t seem like the murderous type.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena looks over at Hiro and Rose and gives a slight laugh.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We were on our way to Vile Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And how do you plan to do that?  No ones even sure it exists.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena here, is a member of the race that lives on the island and is attempting to return.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ve gotta be kidding!  This punk is a member of the Vile?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah, small fry and don’t call me punk!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We were on our way when the police stopped us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena stole a whole bunch of money from Golden Isle and put it in my ship!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have a ship.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You do?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  It’s docked on the other side of the island but it words.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you had a ship all along, then how come you’re still on Outlaw Island?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cause I was born here.  My mom, Edna, was here for terrorism…she died when I was born, and my father, Bahari, was a big time hacker.  He raised me and taught me everything I know.  He’s the one who taught me the weakness of women and men are the only important people in the world.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, of all the…Where is this guy?  I’m gonna give him a piece of my fist!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (sadly) He died two months ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m sorry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (wiping her eyes) It’s okay.  Since my dad never talked about his or my mother’s family, I don’t know anyone on the outside.  But you guys sound like a nice bunch of people and I’ve always wanted to see the legendary Vile Island, so I’ll come along.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all climb in the elevator while Didier packs the rest of her thing in her mobile. She walks over where the bathing room doors are and walks around showing no room behind them.  She picks up a pack and climbs on the mobile.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh yeah!  This is Kael. (pats the mobile’s head)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael…Does it stand for something?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  It means ‘powerful warrior.’  You got to only refer to me as Kael when I’m in him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What ever makes you happy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier gets in Kael and shuts the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on Di….uh…Kael.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Coming.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all rise to the surface and begin traveling to the other side of the island.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They continue to travel until they find what appears to be a buggy junkyard.  Kael heads over to an older buggy.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Over here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Kael opens the entire top of the car revealing a platform even lower than the ground around the car.  It looks fairly new.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Get in, it’s an elevator.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group file in and the elevator lowers.  The sides are glass and soon a large airship appears.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isn’t she beautiful.  My father made her.  The Jovanna.  It means Majestic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This wasn’t exactly the type of ship I was expecting but I’m not complaining.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For a sexist, your dad was one heck of an engineer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier gets out of Kael.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll begin the launch.  You guys go ahead and get in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She pulls out her controller and points it toward the ship and the doors open.  She then points it at Kael and hits several buttons.  Kael gets up and walks inside the ship.  The others follow.  Didier goes to the control panel and begins to enter a sequence.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Computer:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Launch doors open in T minus 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier runs over and gets in the door.  The ship starts to rise and the ground opens above it.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Inside.  Didier walks into the main bridge.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is everyone ready?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:  (outside) Wait!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone heads to the window.  A girl is banging on the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let me in!  I command you to let me in right now!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A large crowd is coming carrying guns and swords, etc.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We can’t just let that mob grab her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier pushes a button while Hiro heads down the ladder.  He grabs Isha when the door opens.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Get in!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The door shuts behind them and the ship lifts off the ground.  Didier heads over to the controls and puts a cord into her goggles.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And we are outta here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ship takes off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You have my supreme gratitude and admiration on your valiant rescue, sir knight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah, I’m not a knight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, someone must decree that you should except knight hood.  I am lady Isha, and what name have the heavens bestowed on my hero?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name…is Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And your name fits you, as you are a valiant and trustworthy defender of damsels and justice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (jealous) Hey, leave Hiro alone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And who might this hag be my beloved?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hag!  You…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose shoves Isha away from Hiro.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How dare someone of your standing even think of toughing me.  You are just as barbaric as that innkeeper who insisted that I pay him for his filthy room and that man in blue who locked me in a dungeon.  But alas, my hero came and rescued me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You take your hands off Hiro!  You’ve only just met unless you haven’t told me something Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know her!  I’ve never even seen her before.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh my dear sir Hiro, (weakening) even though we have just met I feel as if I had loved you for an eternity….<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha fall on Hiro.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I know they say love hits fast and hard but I don’t thing I feel the same way for you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He takes her hands of his neck and she falls limply to the floor.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you alright!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He tries to help her up but she is out cold.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (laughing) Come on, Hiro.  She was shot with a delusional dart.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro notices the dart in Isha’s shoulder.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They’re used by the guards to calm down troublemakers.  They cause'em to daydream then pass out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope she doesn’t act like that when she’s awake.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?  Afraid Hiro might like her?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (blushing) No!  It’s…it’s…just…Ah!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose leaves the room.  Hiro picks up Isha and takes her out of the room.  Lena stands next to Tyo seemingly proud in making Rose mad.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why are you mean to Rose?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well…she deserves it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She won’t tell Hiro the truth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena walks to the front of the ship to look out of the window.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About what?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose is in love with Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  Even I can see that.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She won’t tell him and that’s what drives them apart.  I’m only trying to make her realize that she must tell him that she loves him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I didn’t know.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena walks off toward the back of the ship.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you coming?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They head out leaving Didier by herself.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  Get me something to eat if your not gonna keep me company…(to self) Gees, I hope I never fall in love.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (All of the party, except Didier and Isha, are in the cafeteria.  Rose is cooking something on the stove as Hiro shines his sword.  Lena and Tyo are playing mind checkers but Tyo is wining.  The game is played with electronic headgear that goes around on their ears and is plugged into a normal looking checkerboard.  They sit with their eyes closed even though their hands move around the checkerboard normally.  All of a sudden Isha screams.  Everyone gets up and head over to Isha’s room.  Isha is crunched up on the bed.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What is it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The linings on this bed are filthy!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Look!  They are not white!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t scare us like that.  You almost gave me a heart attack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone leaves.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What about the linings?  …Hello?<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk back into the cafeteria and some smoke fills the air.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (cough cough) What’s going on in there?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose runs into the kitchen area.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The foods burnt.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (just walking in) Try and be more careful.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:  (coming out of her room) Where is the help around here?  I need to be dressed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dressed?  Dress yourself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why I never!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This ain’t no cruse ship.  Hurry up and get ready.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha soon comes out.  Her hair is a little messy and her shirt is crooked.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By what means cause you to distract me from getting clothed and groomed?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Married?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:  (irritated) No.  I mean being fitted for the day.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo still looks confused.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We want to know who you are and why that mob was attacking you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m an ordinary country girl from…er…Granville and…eh…the mob was a bunch of men won over by my…eh…live stock prices.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then why were you on Outlaw Island?  It’s a long ways away from Granville.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Um…I was…eh…lost?  My…ah...dog ran off and I couldn’t..eh…ride it home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (standing up) Alright.  Good to have you aboard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha walks out of the room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on, Hiro.  You know she’s lying, right?  Don’t tell me you believe her story.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think she’s on the run, so it’s best not to bother her.  She’ll tell us the truth when she’s ready.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I just think we should make her tell us the truth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (looks at Didier)  Wait a minute.  Who is flying the ship?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I got it on autopilot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone has secrets…When’s dinner?<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone is sitting around the table with a burnt mean in front of them.  Lena takes a small bite and looks rather disgusted.  Tyo is chewing on a piece that seems very hard.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is this eatable?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (On the other side of the table, Feona is chowing down on the food.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s a little stiff, but it’s really good.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This beverage is flat.  (putting it in front of Rose) Bring me a new one.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (shoving it back) I’m not your servant.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And this food.. (picking it up with a fork) it seems a little overcooked.  I demand a new ordure immediately.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone seems to be ignoring Isha.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group all get up and leave until only Isha and Feona are the only ones left.  Feona reaches over and grabs Isha’s food off her plate with her hand.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You going to eat this?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Not even waiting for an answer, Feona shoves the food into her mouth.  Isha stands up and heads back to her room.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (On the bridge.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So where are we now?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp According to the navigation…we’re on the north side of the Titus continent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (to Tyo) Okay, where do we go from here?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo starts to tremble.  He sees flashes of a dagger with blood in the ground, older Lena being held by someone, and a world map.  He opens his eyes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp South.  We have to head south.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ship turns around and begins heading south.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They travel for a bit, when all of a sudden a large explosion goes off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What happened?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ve been hit!  The engine’s shot!  I have to land.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  I’m too important to have been lost in an airship crash!  Someone must save me!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Save yourself!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hold on!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ship starts heading down.  It pulls up for a moment then lands.  The ship falls over slightly on it’s side.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everyone okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m okay just a little scratched.  (she is really playing with her hair)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Okay, here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m fine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re okay.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh!  I can’t feel my ankle!  I can’t move!  I’m going to die!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Calm down!  You only twisted it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh!  Don’t touch it!  It hurts!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re gonna be okay.  Feona, take Isha to the back room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona walks over and picks Isha up.  Isha keeps yelling in pain as Feona walks away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If she’s the only casualty, I’d call that a good landing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The engine’s really messed up and we’re leaking fuel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The map says there’s a city near by.  We might be able to get supplies and fuel there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What do we need?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About 10 gallons of ethane and maybe some iron ore, but that’s about it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.  Rose and I will head to town and get the supplies.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But I want to go, too.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You gotta stay and help Didier.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just let the girl go.  I don’t need any help from a woman.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll help Feona with Isha.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fine, but no stealing…got it!?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Got it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier pushes the button and the door opens while Rose, Hiro and Lena leave.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk until they reach the town.  The city has a lot of aquatic demi-humans in it.  There are very few humans to be seen.  The buildings are very fancy with blue, pink and yellow hues.  The streets are made of shells.  Some people are wearing bathing suits.  Everyone seems to stare as they enter the town.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There has to be a shop that sells ethane.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There’s a buggy shop.  (pointing) Maybe they got some.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hada is such a beautiful place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose grabs Lena’s shirt and pulls her inside the shop.  There are some buggy pieces laid out on a display case.  A salesman comes up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Welcome to Brook and Son buggy repair and part store.  What can I do for you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re looking for two 5 by 5 iron ore sheets and 10 gallons of ethane.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:  (working it into a cash register) And your total comes to 400 shells.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shells?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re from Auron and only have gin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m sorry but we only accept payment in shells.  Do come again when you get some shells.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now what are we going to do?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena starts to open here mouth.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (quickly) No!  You’re staying out of trouble this time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Just then, a young boy enters the shop.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jafaru:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, dad!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jafaru!  What are you doing home so early?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jafaru:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I found something that you might like.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The boy pulls out a large black crystal rock.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A black diamond!  Where did you get that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jafaru:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I got it at…(muffle)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Brook covers his son’s mouth before he has a chance to speak.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shh!  Come along back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The two walk to the back of the store.  A younger boy walks in.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tai:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have you seen my father?  He runs the store.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s in the back talking with Jafaru.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tai:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …thanks…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tai looks at Lena and shifts from one foot to the other.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tai:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m Tai…What’s your name?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m Lena.  Weren’t you looking for your father?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tai:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah…(pulling out a black diamond) You can have this if ya want.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you!  (kisses him on the cheek as she takes the diamond)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The little boy blushes brightly.  They head out of the store.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe we can exchange this for some shells?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is worth a try.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  (asking a passer-by) Excuse me, but where is the local bank?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He points to a building at the end of the road.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk down to the bank and put the diamond on the counter.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How much is his worth?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The secretary takes the diamond and puts it in a clear container.  She places it over a microscope looking devise.  A red beam shines through it and a number shows up on the tiny screen above it.  She takes the diamond out and puts it on a scale and enters a number.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secretary:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It comes to 15,000 shells.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The secretary walks back to a vault and comes back with 15 pieces of paper with 1,000 written on them.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secretary:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here you go.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They take the money and walk back to the buggy shop.  Brook comes to the counter when they enter.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, hello again.  Do you want to talk again or do you got some shells?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose puts a shell on the counter.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keep the change.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well there, missy.  You are on the right track.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Brook heads into the back and returns with 2 pieces of metal sheets and a large canister.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brook:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And have a nice day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They take the supplies and leave town.  They make it back to the ship.  Kael is outside welding some of the wrecked haul.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re back!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:  (turning) Did you get the supplies?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yep.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Good.  With the supplies, repairing the ship should only take a few minutes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (looking around) Where’s Tyo?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Inside.  Tyo is sweating.  Flashes of a dagger, an island, the symbol on Lena’s hands, Rose, Hiro, Lena, someone in the shadows, Feona, Isha, Princess Ishtar, a dagger, blood, dagger, and red.  Tyo opens his eyes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (breathing hard) I’m okay.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Was the vision that intense?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kinda.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re close then, right?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  I think so.  We have to start heading southeast, though.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll go and tell Didier…or Kael…oh whatever her name is.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena walks off.  Tyo takes a deep breath.  The camera moves to Isha standing in the doorway.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ve gotta go home sometime.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha freezes as if to avoid being caught.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your father is going to start a war if you don’t return.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I…I…don’t have any idea of what you’re talking about.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on, Ishtar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How do you know…?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can’t run from him.  You’ve gotta face him if you ever want to be happy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I just…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you don’t, many innocent people will die!  Others will suffer!  Do you want that over your head?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha seems upset.  She turns and walks away.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone is getting onboard.  They take off.  They travel for a while and everything appears normal except Isha hasn’t complained about anything.  Feona is playing mind checkers against Tyo.  Hiro and Rose are practicing with their swords.  Lena is kind of bored fiddling with a spoon.  All of a sudden, the ship comes to a halt.  The checkers fly everywhere.  Everyone gets up and run to the bridge.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s going on?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m not sure.  But whatever’s stopped us has to be dealt with.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m ready if you are.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier powers up Kael and climbs inside.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let’s deal with it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright!  I could use a little action.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all head outside except for Isha who stays behind staring at the monster through the window.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all pull out their weapons as they head outside.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo!  What is it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo’s eyes flicker.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s an earth elemental dragon.  It’s very strong.  It’s tail is poisonous.  The only vulnerable spot on it is its neck. The rest of its body if heavily armored.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let’s get him.  I could use a new pair of boots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro grabs his sword and starts the first attack.  The tail flings him back.  Rose attacks next.  She runs and hits it a few times.  The dragon swings at her a few times but she blocks them.  The last hit throws her back, though.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You guys okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m fine.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t worry about me.  Help take care of the dragon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona runs forward while Lena goes for a side attack.  Kael is heating up his weapons.  Feona delivers several hard attacks and is shoved aside.  Lena gets a large hit from the tail before she can get too close.  Kael lets off a large assault of rockets and bullets.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.   Huh…?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (When the smoke clears the dragon is still standing.  He hits Kael with a large boulder that he lifts out of the ground using magic.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael!  Are you okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The system’s damaged.  I can’t move.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone has some kind of injury.  The dragon walks over and is just about to stomp Kael.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A golden ring hits the dragon on its neck.  The ring returns.  Everyone turns to see Isha holding the two rings.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (In Isha’s head)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp //Tyo:  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you don’t face him, you’ll never be happy…do you want that over your head?//<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A green glow surrounds Isha as her rings float over her head.  She has her hands in a praying position and raises them up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wind Arrow!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A large arrow made of wind forms above her head.  Her arms go down and arrow shoots forward.  It goes straight through the dragon’s neck and cuts its head off.  The dragon falls over dead.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you ready to talk now?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Back on the ship.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My real name is Ishtar.  I’m a princess from the southern continent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why did you run away?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My father was very proud of me, too proud.  He made a large statue in my honor and renamed the continent and the capitol after me…Ishtar. He told me that if I wished, I could break the prearranged marriage to Prince Aldofo, who I greatly dislike.  It was too much.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But why run away?  Your father doesn’t seem bad at all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.  He was obsessed with making me happy.  He has been obsessed ever since my mother died.  He was trying so hard to make me like my mother, it was unbearable.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I got a couple of my servants to fetch me a boat and I left during the night.  By morning, I reached Adelle and stayed at a local inn.  I began to leave when the innkeeper demanded I give him gin for the room.  I didn’t have any and the room was so terrible, I refused to pay.  The next thing I know, I’m in some dungeon.  I yelled at the guard that the food they were serving was not sanitary.  They dropped me in that horrid lake.  I wasn’t sure where I was so I asked some of the locals where the palace was.  They began to chase after me and that’s when I met you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who were you going to meet at the capitol of Adelle?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was intending to go visit my uncle.  Now I want to go back and confront my father.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So a quick pit stop on Ishtar?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s on the way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.  Ishtar it is.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all head to different parts of the ship.  Tyo puts his hand on Isha’s shoulder.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You finally did it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you for helping me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Isha gets up and goes to her room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What did she mean by that?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nothing.  Want to play checkers?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah and I’ll beat you this time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all go on about their business.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Soon they come to the city.  It is very grand with a main palace in the center and a large statue standing near the lake. The lake is crystal clear reflecting the glow of the city.  They land the ship outside of town.  The group gets ready to leave.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael looks pretty banged up…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, he’s okay.  I’ll fix him right up when we get back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  To bad…I wanted to turn him into a mini fridge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all set out and reach the town.  People are everywhere.  There are soldiers and guards, humans, demi-humans, and beings of several other races.  Lena is wearing her cloak.  A small shadowy being walks by them, but none of them notice it in the crowd.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are a lot of people here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The market is always busy.  People from all over the world come here to negotiate and form business alliances.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I bet they have some great food here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How do you get to the palace?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s almost like a maze but if you head north one block, east another, north then west you will always end up in a dead end.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How’s that going to help us?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At those dead ends are secret passages that lead directly to the palace.  It’s the only way to leave and enter unnoticed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk to a dead en.  Isha pushes on a brick and a door opens up revealing a tunnel.  The inside is stony like castle walls.  When they all enter the door closes behind them.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sure is old here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ewww…and damp.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is one of the older tunnels. It is said that Cosma herself walked down this tunnel thousands of years ago, during the time of the War of Life and Destruction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier pulls out her goggles.  They release a soft green glow.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just a second.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A white portal opens up and Didier pulls a few flashlights out of it.  She places her goggles back on her head.  They walk down the hallway about the length of a block and then pass through a door.  Then enter a lightened room with guards and two staircases.  The guards point their lances at the group.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How dare you!  Pointing your weapons at your princess!  Summon my father.  Tell him his daughter has returned.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The guards come to attention.  The servants come.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Isha:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take my guests to be freshened up.  I will go to my room and change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Two young ladies follow Isha upstairs while the other servant, a young man, takes everyone else to a large room.  He motions them to go in and leaves.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is a pretty nice place.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve never seen such a huge house.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They sit until another servant comes after a while.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      Male Servant:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You have been invited for dinner, curtsy of King Arnold the IV for the safely returning his daughter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (He motions for them to follow him.  They walk until they reach a large dinning room.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow!  Look at all the food!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You could feed all of Outlaw Island with this.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They king arrives with Ishtar.  They both take a seat at the table.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Welcome.  I want to thank you for helping my daughter return to my side.  We’ve discussed our problems and are deeply grateful for your help.  Furthermore, you may have anything you request, just name it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (stops eating) Anything?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro quickly stands up.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your majesty, all we wish is to continue on our journey.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And where do you intend to go?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are searching for Vile Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah…the hidden isle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do you know anything about it?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah yes.  Several years ago, a being from Vile Island came here.  He was in search of a criminal to their people.  He had escaped and was considered extremely dangerous.  For all I know, they never found him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So he gave you the location of the island?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No but he did give me a map of the world.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is the island on the map?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona is stuffing her face and doesn’t seem to be paying attention at all.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You may stay here for the evening.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later in their rooms.  Feona enters Tyo and Lena’s room and falls on the bed.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have you ever been in such a beautiful place.  Ooh…It’s just perfect here…huh?…Are you listening?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo and Lena are playing mind checkers again.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh…don’t you two ever get bored with that thing?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They don’t answer just continue to play.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh…You guys are no fun.  I’ll go bug Didier then.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona gets off the bed and leaves.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (In their minds.  Lena and Tyo are battling.  The pieces are moving at their commands.  Finally only two pieces are left on the board.  They stand facing each other.  Tyo in white while Lena is in black.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll win this time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They are both holding two sided swords and begin to fight.  Lena is on the offensive and gives a large push as to knock Tyo off his block.  Tyo uses the other end of his to trip Lena and she falls off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They are back to reality.  Lena takes off the gear.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll get you next time.  Just you wait.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …want to go again?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re on!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They put the gear back on.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t tell me that you’re going to give up!  Not when we’re this close!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro, we’ve always wanted to avenge our parents but look what it has done to us.  We’ve become slaves of our anger.  We’ve got to stop.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But if we don’t stop them, it may happen again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But what if it doesn’t!  It’s…oh...Hiro…we’ve been so locked off from our emotions, we’ve lost our humanity.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (grabbing Rose’s hand) I know how you feel, it’s just…we must complete our mission.  For our family and anyone else who has been victims of those monsters.  We’ll be rid of this life as soon as we complete this, I promise.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re right.  We’ll avenge our past and prepare our future.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They hug. Not a love hug but a friendly hug.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later in the main hall.  The group is ready to leave.  Princess Ishtar comes from upstairs.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ishtar:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I must fare thee well.  Father has collected a large number of supplies in the western town of Eis.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You are always welcome in Ishtar.  Return if at anytime you require anything at all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We will.  Thank you, your majesty.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp King:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ‘Tis I who should be thanking you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (carrying a large bag of food) Bye Isha!  Bye Mr. King!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They leave.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Back on the ship.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.  Let me get this straight.  Isha is Princess Ishtar and Mr. King is really a King?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ve gotta be kidding!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Over to the others.  Hiro is checking out the controls of the ship.  Rose is watching. Lena and Tyo are messing around with Kael.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (mocking) Look at me!  I’m the great and powerful Kael!  Stand back as I use my giant shield to protect myself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena presses a button and Kael becomes magnetic.  Hiro and Rose’s swords, Lena’s daggers, and Feona’s metal gloves fly across the room and stick to Kael.  One of the swords nearly stabs Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp oops!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What in world do you think you’re doing?  Kael is not a girly plaything!  He’s a serious fighting machine!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We didn’t mean nothing.  We were just checking him out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier turns off the magnet.  Rose walks over and picks the swords up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (picking Lena off the ground) Don’t ever do that again.  Got it?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sure.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona stomps out of the room.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey Hiro!  You think you can fly her yet?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s doing alright on the simulations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier takes out another pair of goggles from a white portal.  She walks over to Hiro and puts them into the slot.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She’s all yours but don’t go off and crash her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro takes the controls and the ship shakes a little but then flies pretty well after words.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.  I better get to work on Kael.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier heads over to a door in the outer wall of the ship.  She pushes a button and Kael, shaking, gets up and walks into the room.  Lena and Tyo head for the cafeteria.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They soon come to a town.  They land and all come out, even Kael.  Lena is wearing her cloak.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ve gotta head to the storage area toward the northern side of town.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What are we waiting for?  Let’s get moving!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She pats Kael on the back and he falls flat on his face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  You alright?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m fine.  The balance control is still malfunctioning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Kael stands up and gets steadied.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let’s move.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The group walks into town.  The houses are fair and the people are all dressed in blue jeans and tight shirts.  There are people gossiping and listening to pop music.  There are lots of cars driving around a square.  They are all around 17 years old.  There are no adults and no children, only teenagers.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Man, these people are weird.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Weird?  They are down right ridiculous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They make it to the storage shed and a group of girls are standing in front.  The leader looks at the group and laughs.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I didn’t know it was Halloween, did you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Other two:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, no.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You guys look about as dumb as that one chick.  What was her name?&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Other girl:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah.  (Out loud)  Hey, everybody, there’s a Freak show goin on over here. /laughs/ Come and see the cat girl, elf girl, midget boy, dork boy, girl boy and the amazing metal boy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Their gang laughs while the group walks away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Do you believe the nerve of that gal?!  Making fun of me!  I’m gonna go back and….<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Kael holds Feona back from walking back out the door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t let her get to ya, she’s only a brat.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk up to the counter.  A young teenage boy walks up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Boy:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can I help you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (stepping up to the counter) Yes.  The King of Ishtar told us we could restock here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Boy:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And you are?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro and Company.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Boy checks the list on the counter.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Boy:  (under his breath) Aha… <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The boy walks over to the wall and pulls on a large chain.  The wall opens to a large storage area, in which you can’t see the end.  They walk in and look both ways…no end.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Boy:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can have all you want.  (Walks away)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where should we start?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now this is a big room…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How about with weapons…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right, I’ll get ta work while the rest of ya just gawk.  Geez, you’d think ya never saw an endless room before.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Kael gets to work picking up supplies and throwing them into one of her white portals.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This may take a while.  We’ll just go and get something ta eat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oooo, I’m coming too!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll all go.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Keep up the good work a…Kael.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They start to leave while Kael continues working.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Get me something too!!<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They walk out of the area and back on the street.  The girls laugh at them when the come out.  They see a restaurant and head to it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This place looks nice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A waitress comes up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Welcome to Happy Burger’s Burger Store.  What will you be having?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll have a #2.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A #4, no pickles.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A #3 for me and a #1 for Tyo, both no onions.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oooo, I want a #3, #4, #1, #5, #7, and a #8.  Oh yeah, and a #2 for Kael, ooo make them super sized.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ooookay,  2 #1s, 2 #2s, 2 #3s, 2 #4s, a #5, a #7, and a #8.  No onions on 1 #1 and #3, no pickles on a #4, all super sized?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All:  (nodding) Yes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And what would you like for your drinks?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’d like a strawberry pop.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ll have a chocolate soft drink.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A vanilla cola.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll have vanilla slushes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And a grape malt for Kael.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright, your total comes to 601 gin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We helped the King out and he gave us anything we wanted in Eis.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And you are?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro and company.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:  (Looking at a pocket pager-like devise) There you are.  Then it’s free of charge.  (Walks away)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We should save princesses more often.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The girls from outside come into the restaurant.  They are giggling all the way to their seats.  Electra comes out with food for another customer.  The girls Shh each other.  Electra walks by their booth and Jenis trips her.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Watch where you’re going Elepta, you might hurt yourself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They laugh and leave as Electra stands up.  Lena and Rose head over to help her up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you okay?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m fine.  (Standing up and pushing them away angrily)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra takes off her apron and walks up to the counter.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey Ezra, I’m leaving early today.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t do anything stupid, Electra.  Electra?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra had already left.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mr. Hiro, please stop Electra.  She’s going to pull something and I don’t need her getting herself arrested.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fine, we’ll look into it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can you deliver our meal to the fourth storage unit.  There’s a girl in a mobile there who can take care of it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Ezra nods)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can’t believe this.  (Gets up)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They leave the restaurant.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra is approaching the girls.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, Jenis!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:  (Turning around) Well, if it isn’t sparky.  Have you come to apologize for you clumsiness?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve had enough of you.  You’re the one who is going to apologize!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh really, I don’t think you have the guts to fight me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra raises her fists in challenge.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wanna bet!  Come on!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ha!  Why would I want to fight a runt like you!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe you’re a coward!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A what?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A chicken, or is that to much for you narrow little mind!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Okay, you asked for it!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Jenis walks forward raising her fists to block any incoming attacks.  The party comes out of the restaurant, now.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (With that, Jenis attacks with an onslaught of kicks.  Electra counters most of them but is tripped by one to her heal.  On going down, she lands on her hands and kicks Jenis.  Jenis blocks them pretty easily but loses her balance.  Electra regains her balance.  She puts her hands together and then apart.  Her fingers let out sparks of electricity which she throws at the now recovering Jenis.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahh!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (There is an explosion of electricity.  Everyone stands still until the smoke clears.  The street is completely destroyed.  Electra stands looking at Jenis sitting on the ground.  Electra turns and begins walking back toward the diner.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You come back here.  You cheated!  You used your freak abilities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra turns around to face Jenis.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:  (Smiling) Now we got proof of them and your gonna go to jail!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra stands facing Jenis, slightly stunned at the what she had just said.  The two other girls rush over and help Jenis up.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jenis:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Police!! There’s a sorceress here, she attacked me!  Help police!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra runs toward the storage area.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, wait!!  Electra!  Where are ya going?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They follow Electra into the storage area.  Electra stops and turns to them.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your travelers, right?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra asked us to look out for you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp then, please, hide me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kael:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can go into our ship through here.  (Pointing to a portal)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you.  (Runs into the portal)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Ezra enters with a tray of fast food packages.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ezra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Take good care of Electra.  I’m counting on you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro nods while Kael takes the food.  They all walk through the portal and end up back at the ship.  Didier gets out of Kael and presses a button on her remote.  The white hole turns into what looks like an empty window frame.  The frame then shrinks into a little box-shaped square the size of a die.  Didier picks it up and places it into her bag.  Hero heads to the cockpit.  Electra is looking around.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wow, this place is huge.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hi!  I’m Feona, but you can call me Fe, this is Didier, Lena, Tyo, Rose, and Hiro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah…hi.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh!  I’m sooo happy!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s up with you all the sudden?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She can probably cook a whole lot better than you guys can, cuz she worked in a restaurant!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (All of a sudden, Tyo gasps.  Lena turns to him.  Tyo’s eyes are closed.  Flashes.  Statues, an island, a woman with her eyes closed.  She opens her eyes.  Tyo opens his eyes.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The island is South 45&amp;#730;, East 40.&amp;#730;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier runs over to the navigation controls and starts pressing in several buttons.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That’s only 20 miles from here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The island’s stopped moving.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What island?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re searching for the Lost Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You don’t mean The Forbidden Land?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yep!  Vile Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But how?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With my good friend, Tyo.  (Hugs Tyo)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How long until it moves again?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Two days, I think.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’ll head out tomorrow.  Let’s get some rest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone grabs their sandwiches and head out of the room.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later that night.  Rose and Hiro are sharpening their swords.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can’t believe the day has finally come.  (Tests her blade, then places it back into its case.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I just hope our training was enough.  (Puts his sword away.)  We’d better get to sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They lie down in different beds and go to sleep.  The camera rises and a shadow is above them.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Morning.  They are heading to the lunch area, where Electra is cooking.  Feona is already sitting at the table with her eating utensils.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m starved!  Last night’s supper didn’t fill me up at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra brings out what looks to be muffin and egg sandwiches.  She sets it on the table.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your bill comes out to 350 gin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have ta pay on my own ship?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra I was only joking.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Electra sits down and they begin to eat.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later on deck, Didier is setting the coordinates into the computer.  Hiro and Rose come in.  Didier continues working.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you gonna fly today?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.  I’m gonna have it go on autopilot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cuz, I don’t think that you could do it yourself and I got to some repairs to do in the woman’s bathing room.  Feona had a problem and broke all the pipes.  And there!  (Starts walking out of the room) We’ll be there in 15 minutes.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena and Tyo are sitting at a table in the cafeteria.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (excited) I wonder what they’ll look like?<br>
Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I bet you got some sisters or maybe even a brother.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh.  This is what I’ve always dreamed but what if they don’t like me!  What if they like girls with long hair!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They’ll love you, they have to!  You’re their daughter!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When I meet them, should I say mom or mother?  Dad or father?  I want to sound smart, but not snobby or stupid!  Ohhh…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are ya going ta wait here or do ya wanna go?  We’ll be coming to the Island in just a few minutes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all head to the bridge.  They look out the front window and see nothing.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are ya sure we’re in the right place?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Positive.  (She checks the ship’s equipment.)  We’re at the right spot.  I’ll raise the ship so we can see more of the area.  Maybe the island moved a little bit off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (As they rise, suddenly everyone gasps.  Lena takes a few steps forward.  She removes one of her gloves and stares at her hand.  We see the symbol on her hand.  She lovers her palm and we see a floating island with the same symbol on it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vile Island.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t believe it!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …home…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The camera goes around the island.  We see the entire island with large statures holding trumpets and a city within, made up of tall buildings and such.  In the center is a large building, a church.  We also get a comparison of the ship to the island.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Later, the group is walking toward the large gates that surround the outside of the island.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No wonder no one has ever found it.  It floats in the air.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Some guards are standing post.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1st guard:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Halt!  State your business.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, we were…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:  (monotone) They are here to see the Priestess Athena.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A well-dressed being comes out from inside the gates.  His hair and eyes are a light gray color.  His skin is pale.  His ears are cut short and he is very thin.  The Vile symbol is plainly burned into his face.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1st guard:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah, Jengo.  How is Athena?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:  (lowering his head in a bow-like fashion.) The priestess Athena is very well, sir.  The priestess Athena asked me to escort her guests to the Cathedral.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1st guard:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very well.  But tell her to send word of visitors prior to their arrival.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very well, sir.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The guard opens the gate allowing the group entrance.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please follow me, sirs and madams.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But where are we goin?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:  (Still walking down the way) Please follow me, sirs and madams.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo follows him.  After a shrug or two, the rest follow to a carriage.  It is pulled by four other beings similar to Jengo except they were poorly dressed.  They all enter the carriage.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who are you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am Jengo.  I belong to the priestess Athena who resides in the cathedral of Esben and Akuji.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who is Athena?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The priestess Athena is the highest ranked priestess of Jericha’s cathedral of Esben and Akuji.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jericha?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jericha is the name of this city?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You mean this isn’t Vile Island?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vile Island is the name of the catacombs beneath the city of Jericha. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, Vile Island is the name of you dungeon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, Vile Island is the name of the catacombs beneath the city of Jericha, the dungeons do not have names.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forget it!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Forget what?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona becomes extremely angry.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How did she know we were coming?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The priestess Athena knew from the young child named Tyo.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Huh?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The priestess Athena could sense that you were searching out Jericha and required me to retrieve you from the gates.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But how to ya know Tyo?!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo puts his hand on Lena’s arm.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think Athena’s the one who stopped the Island for us.  She’s probably the one who gave me the exact spot.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alright.  And we’re goin to meet this Athena?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am required to retrieve you from the gates and bring you to the cathedral of Esben and Akuji to meet with the highest ranked priestess, the priestess Athena.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why do you repeat the same thing over and over again?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am only to repeat what I have been told.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Man, can’t you think for yourself?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No, I have no will or thought of my own.  I am only to serve my master, the priestess Athena, bidding.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re a slave?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:  (nods)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then that means that all the other people who look like…are…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are the slaves of the citizens of Jericha.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But why?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Because we are inferior to the people of Jericha and have no will or thoughts of our own.  We are only to serve our master’s bidding.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The carriage comes to a stop.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Driver:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cathedral of Esben, Akuji and Cosima.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Jengo gets our and holds the door open for everyone, bowing.  He then closes the door and bows to the driver.  Lena looks at the Cathedral and is in ah by the scale of it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now this is the largest house I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Jengo walks to the front door and knocks.  Another slave opens the door.  He is well dressed.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Will you please continue sirs and madams.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone walks into the cathedral.  They see a large room with tons of chairs.  Jengo walks onward as the other slave shuts the door.  Lena jumps at the noise.  Jengo is standing by a door.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jengo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please continue, sirs and madams.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They head over to the door and enter.  The door is shut behind them.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey, Jengo!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The room is white and almost looks as if it continues forever.  Two doors appear, one red, the other black.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Continue through the right door if your birth was on an even day.  If it occurred on an odd day, continue through the left.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who are you?  Why are you making us play such a silly game?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (No answer)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know if I was born on an odd or an even day.  I don’t even know what month I was born on.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s okay.  I don’t either.  We’ll just pick a door and go together.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know mine either.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose, Hiro, and Feona head to the left door while Lena, Tyo, Didier and Electra head into the right.  Lena and the others are in a red room while the others are in another white room, normal size.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:  (In both rooms) Look at the wall on your left.  (Hiro’s room)  You will see a large box.  Look into the box and place your hand (Lena’s room) on the stone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Whatever.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (She pulls out of the box a large black stone.  She places her hand on the stone and it turns red.  After she takes her hand off it, it turns black again.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena steps up.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not you!  Step back!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena seems shocked but does what she is ordered.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Next room)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is ridiculous!  (She lowers her hand to put it on the stone)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena’s room.  Tyo walks up to the stone and places his hand on it.  It turns red.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Voice:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier comes over and puts her hand on it.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is stupid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The stone turns white and suddenly Didier disappears.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t mind her.  She was not destroyed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They turn to see a woman wearing a red gown.  Her hair is straight and black, while her skin is very pale.  Her eyes are red.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where’s Didier?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She’s with the rest who failed.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Other room.  It is empty)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Back to Lena’s room)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where are they?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They are in the Vile, where all of the impure go when not properly taken care of.  Please come with me.  I’ve waited for this day a long time.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (In a cavern of some sort.  Hiro, Rose, and Feona are standing around.  Feona is hitting the wall in anger.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can’t believe you guys got me locked up again!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose is feeling the ground with her hand.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re still on the island.  I can feel it moving.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier suddenly appears.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What the…?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So you ended up here, too.  Well, at least I’ll have one friend here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn’t our fault that you were sent her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are we in the catacombs?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think so.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe it’s some kind of test to see if we’re trustworthy?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Afraid not.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why not?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Head into that passage and keep walking.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Didier gets up and goes into the passage.  Soon she reappears back in the room through a different passage.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (slightly confused) But, how?  I never turned!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Think they want ta keep us here for good.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Back in the cathedral.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where are they?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They are within the catacombs beneath the city.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Why?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Because they are impure.  Enough talk about those tainted vermin let us speak of the matter at hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  Those vermin are our friends!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve waited a long time to meet with you, Lenexa.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lenexa?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That is your birth name.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (blank faced) My birth name?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.  Your family will be here soon to meet you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My family?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.  Your father Armand Chimelu, you mother Dea and your older sister Armelle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sister?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But what about Hiro and the others?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you care for them so much, we will permit them to leave the catacombs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You will?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Of course.  Today is a marvelous day and I’m sure that the god and goddess will be most merciful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Some people walk in.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armand:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We came as soon as we heard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dea:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where is she?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Athena points over to Lena. Lena is shocked, surprised and almost on the verge of tears.  Dea rushes over and hugs Lena.  Lena almost gasps as she feels the embrace.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (crying out) Mother!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dea:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh.  I missed you so, there wasn’t a day that went by I didn’t think of you.  I prayed for your return and my prayers have finally been answered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can’t believe it’s you.  It’s really you!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Armelle seems hesitant and looks to her father for support.  She then walks up to Lena.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope you’ve…I mean…It’s nice to meet you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (still crying) Same here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They hug each other with a pat then stop.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armand:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s nice to know my little slugger made it through damnation and returned a tough little soldier.  Do you know how to use those daggers?  They can be pretty lethal if used by the right person.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeah, I know.  I’ve used them all my life…dad/<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armand:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come here.  (Picking up Lena.) It’s goo to see you’ve grown up strong and healthy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s good ta see you.  (pretty much crying her head off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Armand puts Lena down.  She walks over to Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is my friend Tyo.  He helped me find you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …Is he a slave?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What??<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His eyes are white!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That’s cuz I’m blind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Blind?? <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Armelle looks to her mother for answers.  Dea shrugs.  Lena seems almost shocked.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It means when he was a child, he became very sick and it made it so he can’t see.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And that’s why his eyes are light?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Armelle waves her hand in front of Tyo.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very odd…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Are you pleased?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What do you mean by that?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A clock chimes in the background.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is time to speak with the god Esben.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Athena walks out of the room.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dea:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You and your friends may sit with us if they’d like.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sure.  But don’t get me wrong.  We’ll get to see Hiro and the others soon, right?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dea:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the service.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all head into another room.  They are in the room with all the chairs.  There is some writing on them.  1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, but a row of seats were set apart from the rest with 5th written on them.  No one was sitting in them.  Dea and her family sit in a row labeled 3rd.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So, what’s going on?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We’re going to receive council from the god Esben.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Electra:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You mean your going to pray for your god to tell you about life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Armelle:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No.  He come and tells us what we wish to know.  We pray when we want him to grant us favors.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dea:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shh!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The entire room becomes dead silent.  This is pretty remarkable noting that it seems the entire city is there.  People from all over the town.  How ever, there are no slaves present.  Not even Jengo is in the room.  Suddenly, there is the noise of footsteps on the wooden floor.  A child comes into view.  He has black eyes and his hair is white.  He is very tan and covered with scars.  In his forehead, there is a horn and his nose is like that of an animal.  He is clearly a demi-human.  He is wearing a red robe that covers most of his body.  The child walks to a podium that stands tall over the crowd.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My children!  Today is a glorious day; soon we shall head to the continent of Adelle and purge the city of Aletta of impurity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The crowd claps.  Esben raises his hand.  Silence.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dear priestess Athena is there anything new you would wish for me to consult?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes, great Esben!  I believe we have found the reincarnate of the goddess Cosima!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone gasps and Esben becomes slightly uneasy.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have you?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Annoying Priestess:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yes, as our bible states, Constellations 34:11 “And Cosima shalt come and bring end to corruption as a child born of the forgotten month at the forbidden hour.  She shalt rise from the clouds and show us the way to true happiness.”  Today a child born of the forgotten month at the forbidden hour has rose to our island from below.  She has come and with hope, bring us to happiness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone cheers.  Esben raises his hand irritably.  Silence.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Let me see this child believed to be Cosima.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Athena nods to the annoying priestess.  She walks over and leans near to Lena.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Priestess:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come!  Esben summons you.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Me!  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Priestess:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come quickly!  (Taking Lena’s hand and leading her to the front.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The crowd mummers to themselves.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:  (pointing to Lena) As you can plainly see she wears the eyes of one of the forgotten month and the forbidden hour.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Esben climbs down off the podium and stands looking up at Lena.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What is your name?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:  (Looking to Athena)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tell him your birth name.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …Lenexa.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Several people gasp and others mutter to themselves Esben looks quite angry.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Priestess:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp See!  She bears the name of Constellations 34:20!  “And I shalt be named Lenexa!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone is talking loudly.  Esben swings his hand at the annoying priestess and she dies instantly.  Silence.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t believe you are Cosima.  She must be tested.  Only the true goddess will be know how to be rid of the impure.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hold on!  This is some kind of mistake!  I’m not a goddess!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Enough!  Let us go to the Vile and prove this child is not Cosima!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Tyo runs toward Lena but is cut off.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo!!  Let me go!  Tyo!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena!!  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena is forced out of the room by the guards.)<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Down in the catacombs, Didier sits staring at a wall.  Feona is throwing a rock into one of the tunnels.  It comes back through a different route, hitting Didier.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oops…sorry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (rubbing her head) <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How far away should Kael be by now?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s about 200 feet above us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (throwing another rock) I can’t believe it’s takin this long for a robot to dig a hole.  (Rock comes back and hits Rose)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  Cut that out!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sorry. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (Feona throws another rock, but it doesn’t come back.  They hear a thump farther up in the tunnel.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Did ya hear that!?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Maybe it’s a way out!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah!!  The brave and beautiful Feona triumphs over evil once again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (look of shock) Maybe we should cut down her TV time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose and Hiro nod together.  Feona takes off down the tunnel.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wait!!  It may be a trap!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  I’m not sticking around with you dead weights!  I’m outta here.  (Keeps running)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  (faint) Feona!  Wait!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (fainter) Stop!!  Come back!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona keeps running until she reaches a large stadium.  There are tons of people there, cheering and guards surround Lena.  Esben is sitting on a throne with Athena next to him.  The door behind Feona suddenly closes.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What’s goin on here?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:  (standing and raises his hand.  Silence.)  Now we shall see if the child holds the glory of the goddess!!  (to Lena) Kill the impure one!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The guards take away Lena’s daggers.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey!  What are you doing?!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (walking up to Lena) What’s going on?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The heck if I know!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Athena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena!  Prove to us that you are worthy and dispatch this abomination!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What!?  Feona!?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crowd:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kill her!!  Kill her!!  Kill the impurity!  Destroy it!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think they want us to fight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp More like battle to the death.  What should we do?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (smiling slyly) Why don’t we fight?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What!?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Come on!!  Let’s make'm happy until we can get outta here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t know…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Feona slices at Lena and she jumps outta the way.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What are you DOING!!  You nearly cut me!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:  (with a shrug) Fine… (Takes off her gloves and throws them to the side.)<br>
<br>

A few examples:<br>
<br>
1) I didn't know the story was sci-fi.  With the horses and swords in the beginning, I was under the impression it was historical fantasy.<br>
<br>
2) I didn't know Tyo was blind.  I think that should have been established more plainly (or I just missed it - easily possible).<br>
<br>
Moreover, the situations facing the characters seem a little 'flip' and thin.  It may work as a comic, but just reading the script, the resolutions for the predicaments facing the characters seemed disproportionately easy.<br>
<br>
The script does show promise, and the characters seem very well fleshed out.  I'm just not finding the situations they face to be of my liking.  Probably a personal preference thing. <br>
<br>
It definitely shows much effort and thought.  Keep on the story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/24/02 8:48:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> okay....</span><hr size=1> Well, this is mostly a starter for myself.  I'm using this to animate and get the normal situation under controll.  I'm just trying to get more info on how they can be better.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the advise!!  I'm still typing the &quot;notebook&quot; version into the computer, so it will take some time to get the whole story posted, over 140 pages.<br>
<br>
As for Tyo, it is stated after the second time he is talked about, as soon as they reach the inn.  It is stated when he feels around the money pouches.<br>
<br>
As for the historical fantasy and sci-fi, I was intending to do that.  I wanted to play by my own rule and put the reader off guard.  I don't really like it when people just have it to one specific type.  I mean, look at the modern world.  We have people with computers and in some areas, people live in huts and hunt for a living!  Everything is just mixed together.  Old world ideas and new.  Some people like to keep with the old ways while others wish for the new.<br>
<br>
I guess that's the same as in writing, hehe....  Well, I hope you understand what I'm trying to get across.  <br>
<br>
Thank you, again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utaerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TaerX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(7/24/02 9:35:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay....</span><hr size=1> Quite welcome.  I can see it's a lot of typing, but it seems very worthwhile.  I must admit - the situations do 'hook' me in - I'm very curious to see how this one gets resolved.<br>
<br>
As for the sci-fi/fantasy - that's fine.  I'd suggest that there be some sort of essay or something to give the reader the information &quot;out of band&quot; (not exposition in the comic itself) that the world has some justification for swords while still having mecha, technology etc.  Perhaps a 'deuling code' or something.  While the reader will doubtless be bringing the prejudices of Sol-3 (what we call Earth) in perceving this story, at the same time, the reader has the expectation of being a member of this setting as well, and understanding (at least the basics) why certain things are the way they are.<br>
<br>
Still variety is very welcome.<br>
<br>
Sorry I missed the part about Tyo being blind.  I just thought he was a cutpurse at the time.  I'd imagine he'd not get very positive responses to feeling others change purses.<br>

The last time I posted my story, everyone said it didn't seem to interest them at all.  I was worried that I had done terribly!<br>
<br>
As for the swords and mechas, it's a little strange.  You see, the most advanced culture or civilization is not evenly mixed.  Some places have technology while others don't.  Most people are against technology because of religion, and it is very hard and expensive to get good tech.  Didier is an acception because her father was a very reowned tech expert.  Noted from his constuction of the Jovanna.  <br>
<br>
The people, such as Hiro and Rose, are against tech because they find it cowardly, Tyo and Lena don't have enough money, Feona is just a dits, but Didier doesn't want to be weak.<br>
<br>
hmm....I didn't think that part through very much.  I'll have to pay more attention later on.<br>
<br>
I'm going to post a tiny bit more of the story, up to the meeting of Akuji.  Please bear with me on the last part of the scene with Hiro on the ship.  I was in a hurry when I wrote that section so it is a very corny and used scene.   I'm going to fix it up later, hopefully.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, if that’s the way your gonna be… (Punches at Feona then does a low kick, which is the only one that actually hits Feona.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Is that all ya got?  (Attacks with a series of punches and ends with an uppercut.  In mid air Lena grabs Feona’s arm and brings her to the ground.)<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feona:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (rolls over Lena) Couple of minutes.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena kicks Feona off.  Just then the airship crashes through the side of the wall.  Rose jumps down with a rope in her hand.  Quickly, Feona and Lena grab their weapons and grab hold of the rope.  They are pulled up.)<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Esben:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lenexa is escaping on THAT airship!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Don’t worry, Esben.  I’ll take care of this, unfortunate turn of events.  <br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (They all run inside the portal.  In the ship, you see Tyo and Lena’s mind chessboard on the floor.  A hand reaches over and grabs it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Everyone is far from the ship.  Didier walks forward toward the ship.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Didier:  (quietly) Good bye, Jovanna….<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (The ship explodes and collapses onto itself.  Didier collapses as well, and appears to be crying.  Rose walks forward and puts her hand on Didier’s shoulder.)<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You did all you could to save her… I’m sure your father would be proud…<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose has a memory flash.  Rose’s mother is shouting no.  Akuji is standing at her feet.  He stabs her into the chest.  He looks up at young Rose in a bush, then yanks the sword right out.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It’s you!!  You’re the demon who wrecked our village!!<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose draws her sword and runs at Akuji.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose hits a barrier and is bounced back to the ground.  Hiro runs to Rose to see if she is alright then charges at Akuji.  He is also bounced back.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He’s too powerful!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  He must pay for their deaths!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now, I remember you two.  The children in the bushes.  Well, as I’ve always said…Kill the mother, leave the child.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahhh!!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Hiro charges again but once more hits the barrier.  This time Akuji grabs him ripping his sword out of Hiro’s hand.  Then he hits Hiro sending him flying to the ground.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro!!! (Turning back to Akuji) Urrr…  You’ll pay!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Rose runs forward and hits Hiro’s sword in Akuji’s hand.  Wind energy gathers around her as she attempts to overpower him.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:  (smiling) Humph…Is that all you’ve got?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji breaks the struggle with a simple push.  Rose backs up for a moment then leads an onslaught on Akuji.  She keeps walking forward forcing him back.  He easily knocks her back away.  Akuji raises Hiro’s sword to stab her.  It is struck by a ball of energy.  The sword is knocked out of his hand.)<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hope this works… (His eyes start twitching as he concentrates.  Shards of earth shoot out of the ground and one hits Akuji.  Even so, it only breaks when it hits him.)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now that, was pathe…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lena:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ahhh!!!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena runs up and slashes at him with her daggers.  Akuji grabs one of her daggers and throws her to the ground.  He smiles with satisfaction but when he does a drop of dark blood runs from a cut on his face.  He touches the blood then looks at it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Miss Lenexa I presume.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Lena looks up at him angrily.  Rose, again, charges at Akuji.  She is thrown away by the barrier, almost without Akuji’s notice.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Until we meet again, Lenexa.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A black portal appears behind him.  He turns to leave through it.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No!  You’re not leaving until we settle the score once and for all!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:  (smiling) As you wish.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyo:  (whisper) No…not again…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Akuji turns the dagger in the wound, then rips it out.  Rose backs up a few steps then falls to her knees.  Blood drips off Lena’s dagger, just like in Tyo’s vision.  Akuji throws the dagger.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akuji:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  May your soul be forever tormented …by me… (turns and walks through the portal.  It disappears)<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hiro:  Dear Hiro… If you///<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:  If you are reading this letter, then I’ve left.  By any means, my message remains the same.  Hiro, we’ve traveled together for years, but I’ve hidden my feelings from you..  I didn’t know what to think…what to feel.  Over time, just being with you, for one moment, eased all the pain…an entire lifetime of hatred could create.  But now, these are only words on paper but through them, I will write…of the lifetime of  love, I have felt for you…every waking moment…every day and every time I looked into my heart.  I don’t know if this is what you feel for me,…but even if your love is nothing but a friendship, my heart will always be there…I will always feel for you and love you with a love stronger than time…I will love you…  Please Hiro…know this, my love is everlasting and even though we are apart…I want you to know.  That forever…Our love will go on…   Love Rose.///&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (A tear falls on the rose.  Hiro looks up with tears going down his face.  The feather floats out of the book and into the wind.  It floats away.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rose:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our love will always go on…&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

It's not bad.  It's a touch corny, but then again, we're not claiming to be creating high art here.  I like the flashback to them as kids.  The feather bit is nice, but could you perhaps associate it more tightly with Rose earlier in the story?  Perhaps she has an affinity to birds?<br>
<br>
The scope and scale of this story is pretty grand.  I understand that you can't cover each part in exquisite detail, but I like the amount of interaction, development and background revealed in this segment.  Might I suggest you go back and see if you can add some details to some of the previous segments?<br>
<br>
The death of the ship didn't hit me very strongly, because the character of the ship's avatar wasn't strongly developed, nor was Didier's bond with the ship.  Yes, her father built the ship, but it never seemed to be much more than something she took for granted.  Either some back-edits, or perhaps have Didier lament how she didn't realize how much she'd miss Jovanna?<br>
<br>
Still, it's an enjoyable read, and I'm again looking forward to seeing how you handle the next developments.  My critiques are simply that of one reader.

I was thinking about removing the feather.  I'm not even sure why I put it in there.  As for the ship, Didier is more or less saying goodbye to everything her father ever was.  Leaving her old life behind and moving on.  I don't think it got through too well though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think I am going to add Didier talking about the ship later.  I know for certain, that later in the story when they ride in a new ship, Didier seems to be slightly disappointed in the new ships and she also seems think about the old Jovanna.<br>
<br>
I'll keep working at it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utaerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TaerX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/02 12:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: more of the story...corny, wannabe romantic almost ;)</span><hr size=1> It's a nice touch.  Reminds me of Rhionna from FF8 and the wing motif she seems to sport.  Also reminds me of the opening sequence to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Forrest Gump</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but that's probably not as likely to be on the minds of your target audience.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, this could add some dimension to Didier - she may want  to try to rebuild Jovanna or something similar.<br>
<br>
One question - is the &quot;where's my ball&quot; sequence the explaination why Hiro and Rose were spared when their village was decimated? <p><hr noshade size=1><center><font size=1><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/taerx/"> My FreeWebs Home Page</a> (Not a lot there)</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/02 12:44:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: more of the story...corny, wannabe romantic almost ;)</span><hr size=1> yes actually.  It was a reason to get them out in the woods.  You are correct, Didier should try and rebuild the Jovanna.  That would give her something to do later in the story when she loses her legs.<br>
<br>
I've never played ff8 before... that is kinda creepy that it seems similar..  As for Forest Gump, yeah, that was the reason I thought of taking it out.  You see, a few days after writing that part, Forest Gump came on tv and I felt that it was too similar and thought about removing it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uaokoayame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoko Ayame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/27/02 12:21:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hello!</span><hr size=1> Helllllloooooo!!!
