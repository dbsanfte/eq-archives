I was walking to the store the other day and this guy came to and said, &quot;can I take a picture with you?&quot; I said no and walked away. But I think he got mad and continued to pester me. Luckily I worked near by and called security. And they escorted him away. On my lunch break i would go with my friends to Jack in the Box and order and number six combo which is an Ultimate Cheese burger with french fries and a coke. My friends got that new 99 cent cheese burger of which name I forgot, but I think those burgers sucked hairy nut sacks. But anyway, that guy found me there! I was like oh my God! A fricken stalker. He asked to have my picture taken with me again. So I was like, &quot;get away from me ya butthead!&quot; I know I should have used some curse words, but I'm not rude. So he was like, &quot;why won't you take a picture with me?&quot; And I was like, because I just don't want to be taken pictures with complete strangers! And he was like, but its just one picture. And I was like &quot;Listen, I don't know you, your freaking me out, your stinky, butt ugly, your baggy pants are so baggy your a sumo wrestler uses them for that stupid 'I got baggy pants so I'm cool now look but it just looks stupid period' look, your breath stinks, you wear Lugz shoes , your hair looks like bald (shaved head), and that shrub you call a mustache and goat tee has like bugs residing in them and they have like children to feed in there so they like suck your blood and stuff and thats why there is like blood dripping down you face, and you have frickin huge pimples so large that they like wear baggy pants like you, and on top of that your shoe laces are untied!&quot; SO he got a little angry. Luckily my friends were there to restrain him and take him down. Then security came again and made sure he got out of the whole property. So I weant back to work a little tired from my tirade. But its the same old thing, how can I help you, how ya doing, thats $15.99, thats on sale, you can find it in the classical section, that anime is so old school, in the magazine section you can find some Playboys, the bathroom is all the way at the other side of the shopping center, with this cupon you can get five dollars off, 1 + 1 = 3, Final Fantasy VI BGM we have are the originals and they are not made by SM Record so they aren't fakes and stuff, sir your kid is like wreaking the store, miss your forgot your purse, my name is naoko not noko, yes I work here, yes I have a boyfriend, thank you very much you look lovly yourself (not), no I'm not married, no thank you I don't want to be the mother of your children, yes Tifa is hot, no Celes is the blonde Terra is the one who can transform into this pink whatchamacallit, Transformer are cool but when did the autobots stop flying in that episode at the dam they were flying and stuff but throughout the rest of the series if you weren't an aircraft or have a rocket pack like Sideswipe no autobot could fly, cheeseburgers are the food of the gods, Robotech was the bastard creation of american crappienss of cartoons in which Macross been like chopped up and mixed with some unkown meat with preserveatives and resold as crap, the fourth EVA to reach operational status was EVA-03 was built in the United States and shipped to Japan at Gendo Ikari's request and basically EVA-03 is identical to EVA-02 but the only difference being the head which is very similar to EVA-01 but it was suppposed to be piloted by Toji Suzuhara who is the fourth chil but cost him an arm and a leg literally but during transit to Japan the EVA unit came in contact with a mysterious cloud and bacame infected by the angels then went beserk soon after it's activation and had to be destroyed by EVA-01, Anerobi pathway is without oxygen glucose changes into lactic acid or lactate plus two ATP by which it goes something like this glycolysis by which glucose torsn into pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH but there is an extra step that takes 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH into two lactic acid if the it turns to lactic acid it has less ATP (602 + glucose turns into 6Co2 + 6H2O) and about 36 to 38 ATP, Krebe Cycle takes acetyl of acetyl-CoA and gets stuck onto exaloacetate then turns into citric acid and then the citric acid gets broken down in several steps back to oxaloacetate aas a resuld for each acetyl entering 2Co2 + 3NADH + 1FADH2 + 1ATP are made and all of which takes place in the mitochondria, and I won't get into the electron transport system.... oh what the hay its also done in the mitochondria and the electrons are given to theis electron chain by NADH FADH2 and the electrons pass dwn this chain and the energy lost from them is used to make ATP via chemiosmosis in which the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron chain is O2 which then turns into H2O, the strength of the film is its use of metaphors and the film's weaknes sis the fact that one has to really think hard about what are the metaphors to begin with so in a way the films strength is its weakness, idiomatic expressions are fixed sayings which have special cultural significance which tend to function as proverbs stating general observations which usually but not always holds like &quot;derukui wa utareru&quot; (the nail that sticks up gets hammered down) and &quot;suna o kamu yoo&quot; (boring like chewing sand) &quot;baka wa shinannakya naoranai&quot; (only death can cure a fool) and &quot;gomame no hagishiri&quot; (as powerless as the little fish grinding their teeth) usually need some cultural background to figure out the exact meaning beyond a literal meaning. So I ws like all talking and stuff all day long. So when it came time for me to clock out, my friends gave me a ride home. So on the way out, I see the guy hanging around the front gate so my friend like drove back around and gave a honk and everyone flipped him the bird and a friend mooned 'em.<br>

I am in a weird mood again today. I was actually having a little conversation in my head (theres about five voices up there and one has invited his brother over for dinner so soon there'll be six)... I was wondering who invented the table and why they did it...did they need somewhere to put their vase of flowers? <br>
<br>
Each of my five voices had a different theory as to who, how and why someone invented the table...<br>
