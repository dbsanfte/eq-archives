Sure theres laws against it, but theres also a license for people to do it. Personally to me its no anti moral unless it was to be jacked from the actually owner. Sharring a program with someone should not be a crime.*<br>
<br>
I can't believe I'm reading such nonsense on an art board, of all places.<br>
<br>
BOOTLEGGING IS A CRIME!  In your attempt to justify your own actions, you may want to think that it's not, but it is.<br>
<br>
For a message board where so many posters want to get into the commercial art field, I particularly find this apathy towards bootlegging sickening.<br>
<br>
Wait until one of you get into a licensing argument with a client where they don't think they should have to pay you to use your image more than once (it will happen if you end up in the illustration or graphic design field).  Just because one person buys a program/image that has a licensing stipulation in it, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WITH THAT FILE/DOCUMENT.<br>
<br>
By supporting bootlegging, many of you are shooting yourselves in the foot for future careers in programming and commercial art by supporting this sort of behavior.  If you don't believe me, just wait until you get into the business world where you have to fight tooth and nail to convince clients that you have to make a living and they can't shove you around and use your work without your permission.  Bootlegging is only making this opinion seem more and more justified in many peoples' eyes.  Why pay for anything anymore?  Screw the people who need to make a living from selling the product that they toiled over for months or years.  There's always the internet!  Just keep on stealing and damn the artists and programmers!<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I will admit that I have bootlegged MANY products over the years.  But it wasn't because I didn't want to pay for them.  It was because I COULDN'T.  I didn't have the money.  But as soon as I got into the business and started making money, the first thing I did was go completely legal and gave Adobe a BUNDLE of money (GoLive, Photoshop, Illustrator, Streamline, InDesign, etc etc).<br>
<br>
If you're young and need to learn Photoshop and don't have any money to buy it, I am all for bootlegging if you're planning on getting into the field.  You'll never learn the tools to be successful if you don't use the software.  But the second you CAN afford it, do the right thing and buy the product you're using.<br>
<br>
You might not want to admit that you're stealing, but you are and you should have a guilty conscience for doing it. <p>The surest sign of intelligent life in the universe is that none of it has tried contacting us.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chikin>Chikin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/02 11:23:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4617.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/spoonofdoom/dogtopus.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: piracy</span><hr size=1> &quot;You might not want to admit that you're stealing, but you are and you should have a guilty conscience for doing it.&quot;<br>

Yeah! *points accusing finger* XD<br>
<br>
I'll agree with all of that. If you're just learning, fine, go ahead. Just keep it quiet. If you stand to gain from ANYTHING you do with it (or you begin to get popular), go legal. They CAN catch you. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://articide.keenspace.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/spoonofdoom/banners/longbanner.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->....without...my....pants....</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=psoj>psoj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/02 1:16:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4617.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Piracy</span><hr size=1> Since i was the first to bring up warez i think i should also say that I think warez is only slightly wrong in the fact that is taking money from those that should recieve it, but understand I believe that everything should be free and everything should be at the hands of all that need it...This would take away poverty and some wouldn't &quot;work&quot;, but then again if everyone worked at a job they loved then they would work willingly because in the end how many years can you sit on your ass and do nothing and so in the end warez is alright by me...unless you steal my program in which case i will hunt your ass down and slit your throat...that said, we should all buy the things because we don't want adobe people coming to kill us....or you could look in your printer package that comes with it and realize hey i got something in there since most printers come with graphic programs..heh <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rocketpig>Rocketpig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/9/02 1:35:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4617.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rocketpig.net/images/Click-Icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Piracy</span><hr size=1> *Since i was the first to bring up warez i think i should also say that I think warez is only slightly wrong in the fact that is taking money from those that should recieve it, but understand I believe that everything should be free and everything should be at the hands of all that need it...This would take away poverty and some wouldn't &quot;work&quot;, but then again if everyone worked at a job they loved then they would work willingly because in the end how many years can you sit on your ass and do nothing and so in the end warez is alright by me...*<br>

Everyone would work at a job they loved?  I don't know anyone that WANTS to be a janitor (but it's a very necessary job), or a secretary, or any other number of very important but not very fun jobs.<br>

The fact is that you're talking about an utopian society that will never exist under current human conditions.<br>

So in the end, you're pulling out every excuse possible to justify your theft but no matter how you phrase it, you are still stealing from other people.

You may want to see if you have freinds who have photoshop, but don't use it. (You aren't supposed to share... but people do, though it CAN cause problems and is slightly unethical... a little.) But you may find people who will be like, &quot;Oh, gee, I do have photoshop six, but I never use it. I never even had it on my computer, do you want it?<br>

Yeah, but before that happens, they'll fire half their programmers and the product won't work nearly as well, meaning that a bunch of petty thieves ruined a great product for the rest of us.<br>

If you WANT something, you pay for it. If you NEED something (life saving medicine, food if you're actually starving, etc) and don't have the means, then stealing may be justified. But you don't NEED photoshop. So stealing it isn't justified.

I never would have bought Photoshop until I'd really tried it out and decided for myself how good it is. Adobe makes some totally awesome products which I'm glad to support. <p><img src="http://www.spikescafe.com/shellt.gif"> <a href="http://www.spikescafe.com/">Santa Spike</a> (Like a bowl full of jelly thanks to wsl101)<BR><table width=464 height=64 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
