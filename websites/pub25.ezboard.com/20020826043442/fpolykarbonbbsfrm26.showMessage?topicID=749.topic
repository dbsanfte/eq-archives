It sounds basically the same as Digimon, metebots, or any other story envolving pets and battles. With the stages ('baby','pre-aged' ect,) it sounds similar to tamagatchi.<br><br>Secondly, the characters are a bit boring and somewhat cliche. For example, Dex. In most cases(from what I've seen and personal experience) intelligent charcters who are picked on have a tendency to have something(be it hair, glasses, ect,)covering their faces. I know this idea has some basis, for many of my friends and family who are intelligent display those tendencies, myself included. To make an interesting character try to break out of the stereotypical smart guy. Perhaps you could make him a total jerk who spurts our math formulas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unailthefearless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nail the fearless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/1/02 10:09:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=749.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .PET please comment on this</span><hr size=1> yes I know it is very similar to tamagotchi and other virtual pets.

It's usually a good thing to have the broad character definitions, like the &quot;smart one&quot; and the &quot;joker&quot; however their is a lot of variance within those definitions. For example, the joker could be someone who likes pranks, or one who loves to make puns. He could be smart or dumb. He could be short tempered or easy-going. All of these can work and all of these can make good stories, you just need to be clear on which one.<br><br>The same goes for the lead character. He's a serious loner (a semi-cliche in anime but anyhoo), sure but what else? Why is he a loner? Is it because he isn't &quot;cool&quot; enough or is it because he really doesn't like most of the people around him? Or is it a combination of both? Does he want to have lot's of friends? How is his self esteem, is he cocky, humble? What sort of music does he listen to? Does he like to draw? Sing? Skateboard?  <br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not ripping it apart, it's an interesting idea, the concept that the .pet's personality corresponds to it's owner can be an interesting device to show the  inner life of the main characters and how they differ from the personality they put on for everyone else. Define the personalities a bit more, It will make the story better. <p><hr><br> I was thinking about how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older then it dawned on me . . .   they were cramming for their finals. <hr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unailthefearless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nail the fearless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/2/02 8:57:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=749.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .PET please comment on this</span><hr size=1> wow really getting some good comments...I'll work on the personalities more and report back.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/unailthefearless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nail the fearless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/2/02 9:35:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=749.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .PET please comment on this</span><hr size=1> Character Personalities and .PETS<br><br>Luke - Luke as I said earlier is the Loner and main character. He likes to keep to himself which leads people to think that he is weird. Deep down inside he really wants to have a lot of friends but he is worried that no one will like him. His father left him as a child and he still thinks it was becuase of him so now he really stays away from people in hopes that no one else will leave him. Not even his mother spends much time with him becuase of her job at the Planeterium. The few friends that he does have look pass his outer appearance and see the real Luke a cheerful and proud guy with the will to accomplish many things.<br><br>-Bungy - a baby staged .PET which was made for speed and will. He is all black with red eyes and only two arms which he use to attack or walk around. His special move is shadow wave.He takes on the personality of his owner and attacks with a wave of shadows whoch scare and mystify the opponent.<br><br>Blake - Blake is the joker of the group telling jokes and doing pranks to cheer people up and just to entertain himself. Most people call him a jerk becuase of his tendecies but Luke has been his friends since childhood. Blake was the one who introduced him to the world of .PETS. Even though he is a joker he is still very smart and cunning and willing to help out at any time.He is more of the cool headed guy taking jokes without getting too mad.<br><br>-Kuto - a baby staged .PET which is made for strength and defense. He is a small dinosaur type that has a huge black K on his belly.The rest of his body is a bluish gray color besides his black eyes. His special is timer present. Takes on Blake's personality a lot with his technique the timer present.<br><br>Dex -  the newest member of the group and the aclaimed smart guy. Even though he is very intelligent he sometimes can forget common sense things but can answer tough equations very quickly. His smarts often get him in trouble because teachers think that he is trying to act out when he corrects them. He has a very low sense of humor is is slow in figuring out what is so funny. This guy is definately not the care free type...he is always thinking of ways to fit in more.<br><br>-Bloot - another bay staged .PET which is made for endurance and wisdom. It is a small clock like monster that can shoot out waves of transversed knowlege...lol sounds good<br><br><br>.PETS<br>changed some of the stats here are the definitions. The amount of these stats determine what a .PET turns into. Each .PET starts off with 50 points whch you can distribute...then they are calcualted and you receive a .PET that fits the stats. Eacg additional match that you win will get you more points.<br><br>strength -  of course how hard it can it<br>defense - the amount of damage that it can take <br>speed -  how fast it can move whether it be to dodge or move in<br>will - its will to fight and win<br>honor - its rudeness meter really...can affect if your pet is a cheater or not (working on that)<br>purity-  its rating of good or evil...below 10 its evil above its good<br>endurance -  like HP in most RPGs<br>vitality - the rate at which it heals <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=749.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=749.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=749.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=749.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=749.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=749.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=749.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm25">Pose Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
