<br>
There's a lot of car stuff in this story. I highlight driving talent, and the smart/inexpensive approach to car tuning. Think of a geeky, technically accurate version of &quot;The Fast and The Furious,&quot; that is only about racing, and without the cops and robbers angle. <br>
The entire trilogy makes up a sort of coming-of-age story.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick synopsis of the first part:<br>
<br>
Rev Limit: Rising Star<br>
<br>
Scott wants to join his friend Darren's car club. Darren doesn't want to look like he's playing favorites, so he tells Scott he has to beat him in a race in order to join. Scott has a bit of a problem, since Darren's car is at least twice as powerful as his.<br>
<br>
Scott runs into Shin, a shop owner who sees the potential in him. Shin decides to sponsor Scott, and they begin building up his car. Shin also has Amber, a customer/friend of his, take him out for a driving lesson. To test Scott further, Shin asks Rey, another customer, to ask him to race. <br>
<br>
After racing Rey, Scott gets the news that a guy named Kenneth has been hanging out with Darren and his team. Darren likes Kenneth, and decides that Kenneth and Scott will race to see who will race him for a spot on the team.<br>
<br>
After the race with Kenneth, Rey comes to the shop with Bryan, the leader of his team. Bryan used to be sponsored by Shin, and is jealous that someone else is getting help from him. He wants to race with Scott to see who is the better pupil.<br>
<br>
Finally, Scott squares off with Darren, in a rather anticlimatic race.<br>
<br>
I'm actually done writing and typing this first part. There's a lot going on between the races, btw. If anyone wants to read it, let me know. Just post your emails here, and I'll send it out in a Word doc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofaeolus>FireOfAeolus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/25/03 4:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1014.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> too name names, i cant follow it <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=turbro>Turbro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/26/03 5:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1014.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sorry...</span><hr size=1> I know the synopsis was a bit weird, but I was trying to keep it short.

Anyways, the plot seems like it's missing some key elements. <br>
<br>
-Why does Scott want to join darren's club?<br>
-What will happen if he gets into this club?<br>
 <br>
It seems like a very bad way to start off a trilogy(having some random person just wanting to get into a club for no reason at all). you might want to start it off by showing the main char. as a kid and how he loved cars since he was 5 and how he got his passion for drag racing or something like that. <br>
Then maybe go into how he has always looked up to darren, how darren has always been better than scott at everything they did and how this is scott's chance to prove himself. <br>
Also, you might want to make the names more memorable. &quot;Scott&quot; seems pretty generic, assuming that you are writing about the import tuner scene, you may want to give him a unique asian name or have all the characters call each other unique nick names...      <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=childprodigy11>childprodigy11</A> at: 9/1/03 9:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=turbro>Turbro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/5/03 4:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1014.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Good points...</span><hr size=1> A lot of the things you've mentioned are covered in the story itself. Scott is really just trying to figure out where he belongs. He wants some folks to hang out with, really. Darren has always had more money to throw around, and is very flashy.<br>
<br>
For example, Bryan and Rey are two drivers from another group called the Spartans. Scott is tempted to join them becaus ethey share his view of driving and tuning, but are a bit too aggressive for his liking. That's a bit of a subplot.<br>
<br>
I also explain later on how Scott's father got him started racing go karts at the age of 8. Even after Scott's father died in an accident, Scott kept practicing, and now he's an excellent driver.<br>
<br>
Scott is actually a bit of a generic guy. He isn't Asian, either.lol One thing that makes him stand out is how timid he is, especially when it comes to driving. He is very good, but tends to hold back quite a bit. This gets him into trouble every now and then. Something of a tragic flaw, see?<br>
<br>
I'm actually finished with the first part(for now), and I'm close to finished with the second. I can email it to you if you'd like to see how I develop the plot. <br>
A lot of people already like the plot, action, characters, etc. However, I've been looking for criticism on the actual elements of the story, and it sounds like you can help me out there.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aisuru@polykarbonbbs>aisuru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/6/03 7:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1014.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aisuru.co.uk/saltire.jpg width=100 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good points...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>especially when it comes to driving<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
really? most people i know tend to get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>less</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> timid behind the wheel. if he was that bad, how would he even start racing? maby if the only thing that brought him confidence <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> driving...but thats just my opinion...<br>

He tends to hold back way too much.<br>
<br>
Here's an example during his race with Kenneth: Midway through, Kenneth has to execute a radical, speed scrubbing maneuver to get around a spectator who was in the road. Scott tried to slow down too, but ended up passing him.<br>
At the end of the road, Scott forces Kenneth to lead the way back, because he is trying to be fair. See what I mean? Most folks would just consider it to be part of racing, and get over it. Kenneth shares that view, and he didn't want to go ahead, but Scott insisted.<br>
Later on, Scott also nearly ends up throwing a race so that he doesn't embarrass another driver. Again, he's just too nice.<br>
<br>
In the second part, holding back gets Scott into trouble with Frank, a truck driver who is even faster than Scott thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=childprodigy11>childprodigy11</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/9/03 11:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1014.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ------------------------------</span><hr size=1> Sure, you can email it to me at:<br>
