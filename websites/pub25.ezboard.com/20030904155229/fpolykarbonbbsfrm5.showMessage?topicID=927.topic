<br>
I plan to travel to japan in about 5 months,(waiting for passport to get in mail), but recently ive been having a real hard time buckling down and studying like a mad pro.  I have no teacher, no classes...It's just me and about 7 books.  I did my katakana, my hirigana, boosted my vocab to about 1000...but lately I've been having a real hard time getting enthusiasm.. heh whenever I plan to study i usually end up going and playing dance dance revolution.  i never identified this as a real problem until yesterday when I forgot how to say &quot;Can I have that?&quot;.  A bit too uncomfortable to forget the basics like that...<br>
<br>
Well, heres my q: For anyone else who has encountered the same problem, can you give me tips on how to restart my learning &quot;urge&quot;?  I feel the need to learn, but i never can actually sit down for more than an hou studying....heh...now that i think about it it's kinda weird on how i posted about this...<br>
<br>

I kinda hoped that being here for a year would make up for studying, but it doesn`t. Conversational patterns are still the bane of my study, but i have a solid grasp of the Kanas and Kanji.<br>
<br>
I love Kanji. You didn`t say whether or not you are studying them. If not, start. This will boost your enthusiasm for the language and increase your appreciation and eagerness once again.<br>
<br>
I`ve been here for six months and i cant say &quot;can i have that?&quot;, simply because i havn`t needed to use it once. General conversation is my main focus.<br>
<br>
Don`t spend your time trying to talk like a tourist, it`s too obvious when your here. Of course pronounciation is very important, focus a little on that.<br>
<br>
So good luck, IÅ@wish you the best.  Ç™ÇÒÇŒÇ¡ÇƒÅI<br>

1. Get some japanese friends. Join a club, go to a penpals web site and find a e-mail penpal, something like this.  Studying is a chore, it sucks basically to sit down and try remember stuff, get some friends and you will learn quickly because you want to talk to them, and you remember better. Probably more relevant stuff for everyday life than from a book too. Plus it will all most likely be subconscious, you wont feel like you are studying.<br>
<br>
2. Dont worry too much about it, get some basics (you say you have vocab of about 1000 which is pretty good) then go to japan. You will be living there so all i said above will be relevant 24 hours a day. riding trains, ordering food etc. Get some friends over there, and you will be learning really quick without noticing it.  I had been studying japanese for 3 years before I went to Japane for the first time. I learnt more in those first 3 months than I did in the 3 years I studied at school.  <br>
<br>
Get your hiragana and katakana down, they are simple enough, then get the basic grammer patterns learnt before you go.  If you know those basic sentence patterns and a bit of vocab, any new vocab you learn can be slotted into those patterns, and as you get better, you will be able to use those basic grammer patterns to understand new ones...etc.<br>
<br>
Just get some friends and have fun...it will all come, it doesnt have to be a chore.<br>
<br>
cheers,<br>

I`m finding it difficult.<br>
<br>
Naart, any advice on learning grammer patterns?<br>
<br>
And you`re eight about the friend thing. At the moment all i`m studying for is so i can speak to my friends. And when i get back to England, it will be so i can come to university here.<br>

For instance, something like:<br>
<br>
ÅcÇ™ëΩÇ¢<br>
&quot;It often happens that...; often...&quot;<br>
[example sentences follow]<br>
ÅcÇ…ä÷Ç∑ÇÈ<br>
&quot;concerning...;related to...; for...&quot;<br>
[example sentences]<br>
ÅcÇµÇ©Ç‡<br>
&quot;morever; furthermore; not only that&quot;<br>
[example sentences]<br>
<br>
the reason why i say this is, without a basic grasp of essential grammer patterns, it will be difficult to pick out meaningful contributions from everyday interactions.  If you don't know how to say &quot;I like ...&quot; for example, it will take an inanely long time to 'pick it up' just by watching TV.  If you lack the basics, you will take away very little from spending time in a foreign country, other than headaches and frustration.  Improvement from &quot;immersion&quot; is dramatically fast if you have some solid foundation to build on, but painfully slow if you don't have that &quot;critical mass&quot; to improve on.<br>
<br>
For instance, if you know the grammer pattern &quot;ÅcÇ…ä÷Ç∑ÇÈ&quot; and you spend some time in Japan, you will quickly (and naturally!) come to realize from everyday conversation that &quot;ÅcÇ…ä÷Ç∑ÇÈ&quot; always modifies a noun, while the form &quot;ÅcÇ…ä÷ÇµÇƒ&quot; always modifies a verb.  these subtleties which will go a long way towards making you speech much more natural, would be completely lost on you if you didn't know the basic grammer pattern to start!<br>
<br>
so the long and short of my long-winded grammer advice is this: learn the basics in your native language, practice them extensively by using them in your own conversation and soon you will find yourself picking them, and their appropriate derivative forms out of everyday conversation/TV/adverts, etc.  Things like kanji can be picked up (at least the ability to recognize them) simply by encountering them over and over again.  grammer patterns require extensive review in order to learn them effectively.<br>

It would obviously take longer to go in with no language skills whatsoever. I imagine myself if i went and lived in Romania now, how the hell would I start to learn the language? I'd be pointing at stuff, saying &quot;tree&quot; and wait to see what they say, hoping it was the word for tree and not something like &quot;shut up and buy a dictionary&quot; God knows how long it would take to learn grammer that way, unless you go to a country where conjunctions frolick in fields, Past Participles soar through the sky, and the rivers are brimming with passive tenses, just waiting to be pointed at.<br>
I remember the way i first learnt grammer in school. it was just japanese sentence patterns. Getting to the real basics here. The first sentence pattern i ever learnt was:<br>
<br>
A wa B desu  - A is B, or A are B; A is a noun, and B can be a noun or an adjective. Learn some vocab and suddenly you are making sentences.  watashi wa otoko desu.  Kare wa baka desu.  kimi wa kawaii desu.  kore wa manga desu.<br>
<br>
Learn the two types of adjectives (regular and quasi) and how to put them before a noun, (regular just added before noun, quasi with &quot;na&quot; before noun), and you can expand those sentences;  watashi wa hen na otoko desu.  kare wa dasai baka desu.<br>
<br>
learn the particles. eg &quot;no&quot; can mean possesion. kore wa watashi no manga desu (this is my comic). Still just A wa B desu.<br>
<br>
then as you get more vocab and more understanding, you can say quite a lot with just this. Then try another sentence pattern.<br>
<br>
(A) wa (place) ni (transport) de ikimasu (A goes to (place) by (transport)<br>
watashi wa Soapland ni kuruma de ikimasu. <br>
learn time modifiers (general ones just slot in, specific ones you need to add &quot;ni&quot;)<br>
<br>
mainichi watashi wa soapland ni kuruma de ikimasu<br>
and combine the patterns so far in this breathtakingly comprehensive lesson. <br>
<br>
ototoi kawaii onnanoko wa watashi no kuruma de soapland ni ikimashita.<br>
<br>
Make sure you learn as many verbs as possible and how to form their tenses and the all important &quot;te&quot; form.  It really help to learn the polite &quot;masu&quot; form first, then the plain form.  Plus keep learning vocab to slot in. If all else fails, just single words will get you understood most of the time, then you can do THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!<br>
<br>
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING:<br>
whenever you are talking to a friend and are bumbling your way along the road to being understood, as soon as they understand your meaning, ASK THEM THE PROPER WAY TO SAY IT!  remember it, write it down, beat it out of them. it will be so useful.  So if you dont know any japanese learn this one phrase or something like it;<br>
<br>
ima watashi itta koto no tekitou iikata oshiete kudasai.<br>
<br>
but most of all, just have fun in japan, dont make too much of a chore out of it, have a great time and you will learn quickly. <br>

The joy of writing to someone and reading their reply will be a good reward for your efforts.<br>
<br>
2)  Brag to friends that you CAN do it.  Put your ego on the line.  Make a point of pride out of this.  <br>
<br>
3)  DON'T sit down and study.  Any fool can see that sitting at a desk and staring at a book aren't much fun.<br>
Instead, grab some post-its or tape and 3&quot;x5&quot; cards, and go label EVERYTHING in your house... one color for nouns, another color for verbs, a third color for adjectives, and a fourth color for FULL SENTENCES.<br>
<br>
Japanese, on the front.  English, on the back... and avoid peeking.<br>
<br>
Then as you go through your daily life,  TALK TO YOURSELF.  Imagien conversations with imaginary friends.  &quot;Would you like some OJ from the fridge ?  Reizoko kara, Orenji juusu wo hoshii desuka ?&quot;  &quot;Yes, please.  Hai, choidai.&quot;<br>
Your neighbors and family will think you're crazy, 'cuz you talk yourself all day long, but at the end of it, you'll have avoided sit-down studying, AND you'll have the &quot;path&quot; from brain to tongue beaten-down nicely, so words come easily to your tongue.<br>
