He has limited availability at the moment and also wants to give guild members an opportunity to catch-up. For those of you with multiple characters leaving one around 31 and continuing on beyond 31 with the other(s) is OK. If you have characters under 31 then please continue. I expect we will raise the bar again in April. For my part, Nine (lvl 31) will be offline except for some admin duties. I retired Opus because I hate the intensive interface required to twist songs. Urlek is also retired due to an extreme lack of Wisdom at birth. I will have to work on a new character. Maybe I will create that Wizard I always wanted to try or maybe focus on an evil character, that can do all the things Nine can't do. Hmm. <br>
<br>
We should consider building a party around Ziag's, Timmaer's and Iride's levels (Upper teens low 20's). When they are on, grouping with them should be a priority.<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to recruit a few more players. If you know any exceptional individuals that play well in groups, consider getting them into the guild. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uopusorcharmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Opus Orcharmer</A> at: 2/28/01 1:57:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bthecounciloftwilight.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cashewribs>CashewRibs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/28/01 6:00:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Stop the Madness</span><hr size=1> I guess one good thing about playing so much EQ, I have a lot of characters that seem just about right for this kind of thing.  Cashew is 31 and I plan on leveling her more.  34 will be mine, I can't wait to cast Harvest!  Ribs is at 29 and I can easily put him on hold and have him group with Feldros and the like.  I plan on concentrating on Dalnir with him, and anyone else can join.  Stabb is 22 and I would love to group with Ziag or Irides sometime as I am close to their level.  I would suggest South Karana or Lake of Ill of Omen.  <br>
As for recruiting members, I'm all for it, but like always, we have to be careful.  Loralana and her bretheren is such a huge exception.  We struck gold (and still continue to mine her) when she and her flock joined us. Can we find anyone like her?  I don't think so, but we can try.  But...I just haven't a clue who to ask.  Sure I have acquaitances, but I just don't feel they're &quot;worthy.&quot;  But I trust your judgment, all of you. Having Ziag joined from Guise's recommendation, I didn't hesitate one bit.  He's a good guy!  Be careful in selecting, but don't feel afraid we won't like them.  We gotta trust each other, and we do!<br>

Here's to a safe leveling, no matter what level you are!!!<br>

<br>
First of all, I would like to say that I'm glad this subject has been put into a public forum, where it can be discussed more easily.  It was something that was weighing on my mind for sure.  Maybe I should clarify what my hopes are for my characters.<br>
<br>
I want Loralana to get to 34 as soon as possible.  She has a passion for jewelcrafting of late and is almost to the point that she can start manufacturing platinum jewelry.  At 34 she gets the enchant platinum spell which will enable her to do platinum jewelry at her own whim.  This works two-fold, as if she can sell for a profit she can increase her jewelry skills.  If she can increase her jewelry skills, she can make jewelry for anyone in the guild who wants it.  She has already done several pieces at materials cost for guildmembers, and hopes to do more.<br>
<br>
Kinvarian has just simply been a blast for me to play lately.  All the changes they've made to rangers that affect me have increased the enjoyment level greatly.  Awesome tracking, SOW, animal fear....I truly feel like the outdoor hunter I was always supposed to be, but never quite was.  I'm taking chances I never would before.  A griffon???  I would run away for sure before.  Now if I'm at full health and mana, I'll give it a shot if it cons yellow.  I haven't been able to solo a yellow con since, well never with Kin.  Due to twinking I have with other characters, but still only at low levels.  The other thing I'm trying for with Kin is to make money through quests and such.  Oh, and of course my werewolf hunt...that hide will be mine, and the cloak thereafter.<br>
<br>
So what does this all mean?  I have Marken the monk at 23rd level, perfectly groupable with everyone from Ziag to Feldros.  I would like to use him for any guild events and to help getting the others up to pace.  Once the bar is raised again, then I'd love for Kin and Lora to be my main focus as far as the guild is concerned.  One of the things I love about this guild is just this thing, that there's a concerted effort to do things together.  I love doing anything with guildmates, whether it's hunting hill giants for fun and profit, or making things with tradeskills to give to someone's evil twink.  I've really enjoyed the things that have gotten us to the point we are now, culminating in the slaying of giants and other beasts that were so feared.  Now we look for these challenges, and I can't wait for everyone to be a part of that.  I can only imagine what Feldros will say when he takes part in a successful giant hunt.<br>
<br>
So, I apologize if my decisions for Kin and Lora rub anyone the wrong way, but there is so much more in this world for everyone, and I'd like to see as much of it as possible.  I have friends whom I grouped with when I was younger who have surpassed 50th level now.  One of them was even on a Plane of Hate raid the other night.  Grouping with the guild will always be my number one priority, as that's what's in the best interest for everyone.<br>
<br>
Also, one more thing about level differences now.  It seems a lot easier to have a greater difference in level now, since there have been changes to the way experience is awarded.  The first time we attempted hill giants, we had Loralana (31st level), Galadhrield (31), Cashew (30) and Irides (24).  Irides was getting experience with that group.  How much you ask?  20.6% of the experience awarded for killing the beast ( 24/(24+30+31+31) = 20.6%).  And with there being a group of 4, the beasts would give out 10% more experience than if someone was soloing them.  If you compare this to the level 31s getting 26.7% of the experience, not bad at all considering it takes much less total experience for a level 24 to level than a 31.  I'd be willing to bet that Irides made more progress through her level than Galadhriel (who also died), and possibly even more than Lora did (who didn't die).  She certainly would've made more progress than Cashew, but Cashew was in a H_LL level at the time, so that's not a fair comparison.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that things work differently now, and we can't think like we're 15th level and can only group with people within 4 levels of us, because that's just not the case.  Every member in a group plays a key role, and should never feel like they can't hold up their end because they're not a certain level, or the one's they're with are a greater level.<br>
<br>
Well, I hope I've clarified my position and feelings on this.  I implore anyone with something to say about this, to say it.  If you think I'm talking out of line, then so be it.  My intention is not to go against Feldros' word, I really want the best for everyone.  I know this is a great guild, and we're really capable of doing a lot of great things.  I think we're right on the hump of where we can acquire the items we've always wanted, and to slay the beasts that have vexed our existences.  We've started to do so with the killing of giants, griffons and even GrimFeather himself (makes a checkmark at the top of a list).  I know others feel this way, and want what is right for everyone.<br>
<br>
Okay, lastly, on the subject of bringing in other players.  Most everyone I know outside of this guild, is guilded themselves.  There's only one I can think of that isn't guilded and is a very good group player.  In fact he is who taught me most of what being a good group player is all about.  We had even discussed starting a guild ourselves based upon those principles.  Only problem is I've only seen him online once within the last month, and even rarer in the months before that.  I'll have to e-mail him and see what his EQ plans are.<br>
<br>
So please give any feedback you have on this subject.  I just had to put out what was on my mind, and I hope my wants for Kin and Lora are taken well.  Take care all, and see you in Norrath.<br>

With the grouping concerning levels, I hear ya.  Those of us in our 20s and 30s, we can easily group with much higher levels and still get significant amount of experience. It's the early years that are very limiting.  Last night in a successful dervish cutthroat raid in North Ro, Carabas got great experience.  But the mighty Curlington was kind enough to bow out until I hit level 9.  As he was 14 and I was 8 at the start, I got no experience.  The difference was just too great.  But this CHANGES drastically at later levels.  We must keep this in mind when we group in our 20s and beyond.  As for leveling Loralana and Kinvarian up and up, of course I understand.  Here's to a safe leveling to you and to all of us!<br>

I argued these points with Master Feldros but he didn't agree with me and wanted to impose a ceiling for our guild groups at 31 for now. He is the leader so I will respect his wishes. Also, many of you have multiple characters so keeping just one character around level 31 is not that big of a deal. I would love to take Nine giant hunting or go to Mistmoor but I will sit him out for a few weeks. I doubt Feldros has time to read the posts. I see him in RL every week or two so I will check with him about the limit. I expect we can bump it up sometime in April. In the meantime I believe Irides (25) , Ziag (1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> and Timmaer (24) need to play catch-up. Lets use this pause to help them close the gap. If you see them on try to help them.
