<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Dead Silence<br>
<br>
<br>
He touched down in the Vietnamese jungle in the stark night, his name, Sam Callahan an ex-marine now contracted through an underground special ops syndicate named Dead Silence. His mission was to eliminate a marine general that was funding a large terrorist organization in the east. He knew his target well for he served under him during the Gulf War as a sergeant. Sam had always felt an eerie presence whenever he was with his former head in command, now he knows why. For 8 years general Tom L. Francis was supporting a group of Vietnamese guerillas with money he was secretly hacking from the military through the well underdeveloped Internet. He used this money to buy massive amounts of weapons through the military to support the guerillas terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies. He also paid for the transportation of guerilla terrorists to make several significant attacks on the Pentagon, Area 51 and many failed attempts at the White House and other important military and political structures. Dead Silence felt the greatest urge to stop this threat before it became too great for the government to ignore it anymore.<br>
<br>
Sam was deafened by the large chopping sound generated by the helicopter for a few minutes. He shrunk into the large stems of grass and ferns the minute he stepped from the copter’s side door. He knew from experience how guerilla warfare was played through, and he knew one thing, he was definitely not safe anywhere he went. He started on his long trek through the dark, misty jungle. The blue moonlight shone down on the through the canopy and on to the jungle floor providing a small degree of vision. His eyes took awhile to adjust to the eternal darkness that he was encumbered by for nearly an hour. The predicted time of arrival to the target’s location was 3 hours and thirty minutes. He had brought no rations or medical supplies for it would have been too much dead weight to carry. He only had his PSG-1 Military Issue Sniper Rifle and his trusty Desert Eagle handgun with only one magazine of rifle shells and two magazines of handgun ammo. Sam’s travel had been quite easy and unexpectedly quiet. He had expected to run into several guerillas, but he was quite lucky. Sam had almost thought he had run off his path, but his GPS locating device showed that he was directly on path and thirty minutes ahead of his ETA. As he neared his destination he could hear the sounds of the Vietnamese conversing in their strange tongue. Sam quietly removed his rifle from his back and rested it on its stand in the moist soil. He then, as slowly and silently possible pulled some ferns and dead leaves over him and his gun, to hide himself as much as possible. Sam almost felt he had too much time for his own good, mainly because he didn’t want any chance at being spotted and that the quicker it was over the better. Sam’s missions would always get to him when he had to wait, he hated playing sniper games especially on foreign grounds. The soil was damp and soaked his clothes, the humid air was hot and moist. It was muggy and the sweat stuck to his forehead like thick drops of steaming engine oil. His rough unshaved face rubbed against his collar and made an irritating scratching sound and feeling. His palms drenched with sweat held the gun lightly as a feather, yet he was as tense as the beef jerky he ate the day before. Even through all this he remained calm with deception running through his veins like blood, as several guerilla scouts walked back and forth less than a hundred meters from him. Sam glanced at his watch, “Only one minute left” he whispered to himself with a slight sigh of relief. The general was at a conference in one of the U.S. Embassies discussing the recent attacks on several Embassies in the general area. Dead Silence received intelligence of this through several Secret Service spies that co-operate with their organization. He was to leave the conference at 2300 hours and reach the guerilla encampment by 130 hours. The minute seemed to last an hour as Sam waited patiently for his target arrived. His watch clicked 1:30am, the sound was as loud as a gunshot and the feeling of anxiety dropped instantly from Sam’s body.<br>
<br>
Sam heard the slight roar of an engine as he saw a sleek Mercedes Benz roll down the road on the East Side of the encampment. The encampment consisted of two large brick buildings, three guard towers, and several small poorly constructed huts. The large buildings stood out the most and were most likely the armory storage facilities. The vehicle slowly passed by one of the guard towers and parked near one of the large buildings.  The dust slowly rose from the road and dissipated into the air. The door of the Benz opened as the general climbed out the back and rose from the vehicle. Patiently Sam waited for the perfect moment, knowing that he only has one shot or he’s blown his cover. The general paced around the yard, looking as if he was checking up on things, Sam didn’t want to risk shooting a moving target so he had to wait for the right moment, the moment of truth. This moment was the second he turned his back to talk to one of the head commanding guerillas. Sam quickly but steadily jerked his rifle towards his target. The crosshair was shaking ever so slightly amongst the general’s head . . . . . then it happened, Sam’s finger clenched the sensitive trigger. As Sam did this, the most sinister smirk grew across his face, with the cross hair circling the general’s head like a golden halo. The gun made a sound as loud as exploding chestnuts as the rifle fired. The whole moment slowed down the second the trigger was pulled. Sam swore to himself that he could see the bullet exit the barrel, with a puff of smoke and a blinding flash. He watched in disbelief, as the bullet headed directly at his target on a straight path, like a locomotive on the tracks. The bullet hit the general in the back of the head, piercing through flesh and bone. The bullet thrust itself through the victim’s head and penetrated the guerilla officer in the abdomen and cut through his back spraying blood onto the ground and wall of the armory building. The general slowly crumpled to the ground, and the guerilla grabbed his gut as he fell to his knees and slowly fell to his face. The reality is that it was all over the instant that Sam pulled the trigger. He watched as the confusion kicked in and the guerillas scrambled to organize several scout parties. Sam was already a quarter of a kilometer from the location when the guerillas started on his trail. He had two and half-hours to make his rendezvous, so he knew he had to move fast. The sweat poured down his face, his legs burned and his lungs gasped for air. He had been jogging in a crouch for an hour and he could still hear the faint sounds of the Vietnamese yelling orders. His extraction point was four hundred meters away and he was an hour early. He could hear the helicopter’s blades whirring through the wind and the bushes surrounding it getting swayed around by the vortex. He ran into the clearing and leaped into the chopper. They immediately pulled out and made way back to the home base. The guerillas spotted the helicopter and fired a hail of bullets, but the chopper was too high and out of range.<br>
<br>
Sam was glad this was all over, and the fact that he was back home enjoying the company of his wife. It was three weeks since his mission and has been long lost from his mind, when he heard the news. A Vietnamese terrorist attack nailed Washington D.C. The worst as yet to come. Apparently all the money the general took from the military was used for a top-secret operation of making hydrogen bombs. The U.S. has experienced atomic threats before, but this was no threat. The guerillas obliterated the U.S. capital. It was all over the news for a week, Dead Silence broke down and told the military about the whole operation in the east and the U.S. government and U.N were all over Vietnam. Then the unexpected happened, a marine radar station picked up 6 large projectiles launched from the general location of Saudi Arabia. Identified as possible hydrogen missiles the U.S. went into a state of emergency. It all happened so quickly, a giant flash of white, a huge roar and the force of an unexplainable power,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
then  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  dead silence. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
