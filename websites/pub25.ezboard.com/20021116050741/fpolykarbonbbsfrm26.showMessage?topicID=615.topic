&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The year 2572, the human race had reached a point of overall prosperity.<br>
The world government, while a benign organization, its component countries had their bad elements. Because of these political figures, various groups of people, sometimes even whole cultures came under political pressure. These people fled to space, so far, the only true apolitical zone, where survival and the construction of the first generation space colonies, the Asteroid Excavation fleets and the bases on the Moon and Mars were safe havens. The boldest, and the most hated groups were arms manufactures, and Ex-military.  One of theses weapon companies, Orion Industries, and a thousand or so people, in the only interstellar ship in the Sol system, left earth and its political turmoil.<br>

Crisis<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Part one.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You…. Have advanced through the ranks of the Hunters, defeating each one with un-paralleled skill…” The cloaked man hissed, his speech sounded… artificial, and murderous. Victor just stood a few yards back, cleaning his fingers and dusting off his trench coat. <br>
Victor was a big man, six’ six, built like a heavy weight boxer and master of many forms of unarmed combat, most women couldn’t get over his 18 year old looks, his spiky black hair and humorous demeanor belied his deadly skills as a bounty hunter.<br>
Add the five foot long katana style blade strapped to his back, and the other twenty odd weapons hidden on him, completed the image nicely.<br>
<br>
His adversary on the other hand was very different. <br>
The only name that really fit him was Crisis, the best bounty hunter in the known galaxy.<br>
His reputation for excessive brutality, hundreds high kill count and apparent invulnerability gave him the highest rank in the Hunter’s Guild. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Actually, Crisis wasn’t a he, more of an it. Crisis was a machine, built to be the best, apparently, at killing. His cloak was ragged, and full of holes, it cast a shadow so dark, no one could see his feet. He didn’t have a face, just a hollow, sharp-edged mask.<br>
He was also grossly asymmetrical; his right arm was a huge bludgeon looking apparatus. While it had a hand, it wasn’t meant for manipulation, more for crushing. The large hexagonal shield, like a fencer’s targe, easily four feet in diameter and shaped like an uncut diamond, was essentially his forearm, the deceptively thin, compared to the rest, bicep was packed beyond capacity with cables and hydraulics. All of Crisis was either gray or black. And light seemed to be sucked in by his presence, victor thought that was just his imagination. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I challenge you to Combat Level Five, Win or Die!” Crisis stated. Victor shrugged and walked over to his opponent, the dirt of the blasted and cracked mud-field sending up clouds of dust. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The rules say I can win anyway I want, so here goes.” Victor said. He looked up at the metal man with a barely contained grin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have a baseball team, I’ll recite the starting line-up.” Victor said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Answer me this:<br>
‘Who’s on first. <br>
What’s on Second,’” Victor paused<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ ‘And I Don’t Know is on third’s”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crisis faltered, then said: “um… I don’ know?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor reached up to pat Crisis apologetically on the shoulder, which was a rather comical sight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sorry man, but that was third baseman. I WIN!!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crisis <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Part Two<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ I need sleep…” <br>
Victor growled. He had just walked in to a very expensive hotel, The Amangasia that meant something like perfection. Several pairs and even triplets and quadruples of eyes glared at him while he clomped into the main lobby. The lobby itself was large and ornate, huge columns lined the hallway. The visible side was carved in various artistic ways, some were of people, animals and landscapes, others Victor couldn’t even guess. He walked up to the main desk, composed of three circular island-like desks where staff sat inside and entered the register into a computer. Above the main desk, and the rest of the lobby was this large sculpture, made entirely of golden, circular rings that linked and crossed each other into a mobious pattern, it made victor dizzy.<br>
<br>
“Welcome sir…” the porter wheezed, the porter was a vernaral, and they always wheezed, but victor thought this one had a note of disgust while he greeted him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’d like a single bedroom, hunter’s package, with catering. Thanks.”<br>
Victor stated, now noticing the fact he was filthy. The porter was a little startled at the request for the Hunter’s package. The hunter’s guild had uncountable ties to law enforcement, hotel and restaurants, governments and more, but to the porter, who had dealt with hunters before, never expected a weak, bare necessities creature like a human to be a hunter. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes sir, of course. Do you have any luggage? And note, all explosives must be placed in the hotel vault.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Explosives? Why not all the guns?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Firearms, even the energy and rail based weapons, are rather contained and focused, explosives cause too much damage for the budget to handle, and we respect a person’s profession, or safety.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Fair enough.” Victor allowed, and passed over a few grenades and some of his incendiary devices. His most important explosive devices he kept on him, hidden in detection proof pads adhered over his arms and legs.  The ported scanned victor’s hunter identification and gave him the room key. <br>
“Thanks, I’ll be a good guest, I hope.”<br>
The porter wondered at this last word, and noticed the dossier on Victor, which was still on the screen. It read: Known for excessive force, overwhelming use of firepower, and the destruction of over twenty-seven buildings, four being large hotels.<br>
The porter paled, and called his manager for the next week off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The elevator ride was slow, but interesting and relaxing. Built to hold upwards of fifty people, depending on specie, it was a large glass lozenge on its side, lifted by some gravity trick and wrapped with bands of a gold like metal. Victor had to stand, as he didn’t trust the walls to hold his weight, or pay for damages and cleaning….<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor walked thought the door, which opened just before he hit it, and shrugged off his trench coat. The black garment hit the ground in a great racket, and several of the weapons hidden in its folds peeked out. Next Victor's old body armor fell away and he collapsed on the bed, asleep. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A dark red eye edged its way upward, Soon to settle on the seventy-second story of the hotel. The eye belonged to a dark, cloaked figure, and it stomped slowly towards the hotel foyer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor had perhaps gotten two hours of sleep, enough that a shower and breakfast would complete his restoration, he called room service, ordered some food. And then entered the shower.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people in the lobby, many who had seen Victor come in, were terrified at black-cloaked man before them; of course, most of them weren’t terrified for long.<br>
The black-cloaked man had finally reached the lobby, meditating on how to find his target, and saw a chance to add to his greatness. His red eye stared at the nearest rich person and raised his left arm, palm down and wrist limp, a device extruded from his forearm, and after a brief flash, the rich man was dead, most of his shoulders and his head burnt away. The killing beam swung towards more people, and they too were burnt, the rest fled, but metal tendrils, sprouting out of the attacker’s right arm, skewered those who tried. The death continued, and the cloaked man was ready to start again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor had just eaten, and paid the waiter a generous tip, the food in most of these large hotels were often the best victor had… I keep forgetting, most of the time, these hotels get destroyed when I fight. He mused, and picked up his discarded trench coat.<br>
He shook it out and collected the loose weapons, and proceeded to leave the room<br>
<br>
Victor had just reached the skylight balcony, a huge section of the hotel cut so that natural light could get in, and you could see up or down for miles. Victor was admiring the view when movement where none should be caught his eye.<br>
Several wriggling shapes coiled and snapped about thirty stories down, then a new group appeared, just to the left, and the right hand group of tentacles retreated, the cycle repeated and the whole thing got closer and closer. Victor couldn’t move, the speed was phenomenal; the creature was light stepped, as hardly any debris fell from its handholds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crisis, as Victor knew him, appeared right in front of him, time seemed to stop as victor stepped back and crisis hovered there, wreathed in slowly moving tentacles and his black cloak. Time resumed, and crisis landed and swiped with his left tentacle cluster, so fast that it cut just like a blade. Victor dodged back, and again as crisis followed up from the right. Victor drew his sword and blocked the third attack, and the forth with just a tilt of the blade from it’s current position. Crisis wouldn’t let up; And Victor couldn’t get anything in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor then turned and ran across the balcony, and crisis followed suit.<br>
Victor reached into his coat and pulled out a claw like device, he fit it around his hand and flicked his wrist, the claws opened. He turned around and looked a still charging crisis. Victor slapped the claw against the round hand railing and looked over his shoulder, tossing a quick wave to crisis, he jumped over the edge. Crisis just ran through the railing and fell after him. <br>
<br>
Crisis used his weight to his advantage and gained distance on Victor, who was forced to let the monomolecular line his wrist was attached to run faster. He pulled out his RCN-80 handgun from his coat. The RCN, modified from the old PN90, was turned and aimed at the falling black dart. The mini machinegun spat out rifle size bullets with un-paralleled speed, and crisis took several and tumbled over, the rest ripped into the rapidly moving walls, and ripped chunks out and added them to the decent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor looked at the tiny screen on his grappling device, he had plenty of line, but space to fall in was going fast. Then he hit upon a very obvious idea. Victor reversed the winch and grunted as he stopped suddenly and began to rise quickly, Crisis didn’t expect this, so he plummeted past his target and closer to the ground floor, where the bloodstains of the earlier massacre had occurred.  Crisis hit the polished marble like floor at eighty miles per hour, his metal body took the hit and he stumbled out of the huge, irregular crater. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor allowed himself a tired but genuine grin as the plume of dust from the rapidly receding ground floor blossomed up. So, the rumors are true, he takes a bloodfued with whoever beat him…Damn!   <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dust now masked Crisis, he couldn’t see Victor, but Victor couldn’t see Crisis either.  He lifted his arms, and the tentacles snaked out from under his cloak, the four on his left arm that plugged into his wrist extracted themselves and arrayed themselves like the rest, all twitching like living things. Crisis raised his arms and willed his appendages to grab a very high railing, some thirty meters up. Crisis steeled himself, and a hard tug flung him skyward.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You just don’t give up, do you?” Victor screamed at the onrushing crisis, along the way, crisis had managed to aim himself at victor, and he had no illusions about crisis being able to either kill him or break his monomolecular lifeline and fall. Sheer Luck happened to intervene at that moment. Time stopped, and he stepped out into mid-air.<br>
<br>
“Hmmmmm…” He said, Sheer Luck was amorphous, it was different for every person and instance, so describing him would be pointless. Sheer Luck looked at Victor’s predicament, crisis, frozen in temporal stasis, was less than twenty feet away from victor.<br>
He lifted his non-arms and gently manipulated the spin and momentum Victor had, which with great care was not enough to be noticed by either combatant as outside influence. After he was finished, his half sister twice removed, Pure Luck, appeared.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You tend to help this one a lot, don’t you…”? <br>
She purred, Sheer luck looked at his relation and made a mocking non-bow.<br>
“The big guy has some plans for this one. I just do what I’m told.”<br>
“Alright, just don’t tell Dumb Luck, he’ll just get confused on who to manipulate.”<br>
She said. Their scatterbrained cousin often screwed up, hence his title.<br>
Pure luck winked out of non-existence, and Sheer Luck assessed if he had done what was needed. Thus satisfied, he phased out too. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About five non-minutes later, he realized he left time frozen…. Chronos would not be happy at the glitch in his computer tonight. A simple thought corrected his mistake, and Victor and Crisis resumed their battle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Something had changed Victor’s motion, because crisis shot headlong into the wall, under and to his right, and shredded halfway into the building before stopping.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “God, why can’t you just leave me alone?” Victor shouted. Crisis had already resumed the chase, still going up and at an absurd pace.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You beat me, I shall kill you painfully for such a blunder. I will not stop unless I die.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That’s stupid! You can’t just die! Someone would have to kill you! And I can’t do that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why not?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You make life interesting, deadly, but interesting.”<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor needed to get more space to climb in, he grunted as he grabbed the grappling glove with both hands and gave it a very hard jerk. Victor had commanded the line to use its variable elasticity to snap Victor up even faster than the winch could.<br>
Thus free of relying on the line; Victor cut the line and fastened a new claw set on the glove. Still going up, but running low on momentum, Victor launched the grapnel up and as high as it could. Victor didn’t care where it hit, just so long as it was solid and was much, much higher than he was. Crisis was somewhat distracted, and was falling a little behind.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crisis seemed taken back by this conversation, all the while climbing up a three-mile tall skyscraper.  Victor was using the pause as a way to think of how to get out of there. He finally realized a solution. He swung to the left, kicking off the wall, and then to the right, continuing this pattered as he went up, this was to evade Crisis, and to slow down their climb. Victor had already holstered his gun, and pulled out a small device.<br>
The device was meant to show what was in the area, and he toggled it to life forms.<br>
At that point, the building had only one living thing, he, the rest were either dead or gone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor drew a deep breath and pulled out another glove-like device.<br>
This one was odd, and it read on the back panel: WARNING: ACCELERATOR DEVICE. Victor grinned evilly at the glove and pointed the palm at Crisis.<br>
Crisis had sensed what the device was, and started screaming.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are an complete suicidal idiot! That will destroy us all!”<br>
Victor’s grin expanded even more, and then he fired.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rays of incandescent light burst from the small lens in the glove, all missing crisis, but not aimed at him anyway.  Victor allowed a huge pulse to build up before releasing it, and threw it down to the lobby. The blob of energy nicked crisis, two of his tentacles were affected at the tips, they glowed hot, then exploded. The accelerator device was made to accelerate atoms to the point of explosion, but this was delayed by size to energy ratios, big thing blew up later than small things.<br>
Victor had released enough energy to blow up the entire plaza. Still going up and up, Crisis was now more worried about living the see his enemy dead that joining him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor smiled and cut the line; he ruefully massaged his sore shoulder as he fell back first towards the ground, two and a half miles up. He leisurely stretched, seemingly unconcerned about the fall; he was past the floor where he stayed, at the one-mile mark.<br>
He pulled out a small button and thumbed the trigger. A repulsive matter shield unfurled around his back, tinted blue and mostly composed of air smashed to a monomolecular lattice six inches away from his back. He was just about to relax when Crisis plunged out of a dust cloud right above him. By now the accelerated building was starting to go, most of the structure was glowing white and red, pulsing and humming with pent up energy.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Crisis was screaming in fury, the heat was already singeing his cloak. <br>
The ground was rushing to meet them, and all Victor could do was laugh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fifty feet…<br>
Thirty feet…<br>
Fifteen feet…<br>
Five feet… <br>
<br>
<br>
Impact. Victor bounced and landed on his feet, thanks to the shield, he ran for the lobby doors, his added weight making his footstep in the floor explode. Crisis didn’t bounce, he hit, legs first at over two hundred miles an hour. His only thought was to decapitate Victor, his left arm tentacles slashed for Victor’s neck. But the building blew up in a great outpouring of energy before Crisis could reach. Victor just barely made it, the blast picked up his light body and flung him far and away.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor shook himself out, the dust falling from his hair and trench coat.<br>
He pulled out his phone and speed-dialed Nick, who was on the ship.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, I blew up another one, get in contact with the appropriate people for me, do the right apologies, yeah I know, and debit the damage from my account.”<br>
Victor sighed and hung up. Well, now I can’t use that hotel chain anymore.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He started to laugh again, the only moving thing in the area, amidst the rubble and flames. The sun peeked out from the clouds, and he walked off.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp However, Victor wasn’t the only moving thing, a slab of masonry shifted, and then was flung completely into the air. The arm was damage, but still functional, the battered warrior crawled from the wreckage, and the slab he lifted up landed squarely on his head, breaking in two. He hand closed in simulated rage, he swore.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will beat you… will…beat….be..be tttt.. kill!” Then he fell, not to get up for a long time.  <br>
 <p>My victims are rich of poor, young or old, strong or weak
I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
