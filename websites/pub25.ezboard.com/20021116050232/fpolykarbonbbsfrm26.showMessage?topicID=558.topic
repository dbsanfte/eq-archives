It takes place in the age of dinosaurs, and two sentient races exist on the planet: the reptilian Kyrusan, and the avian Hariyun. The Kyrusan, as a race, follow a feudal system where different lords rule over stretches of territories, with ruling clans and shifting boundaries. Being physically powerful (basically superior to a human in every way), they have a fighting chance against most of the dinosaurs (usually the herbivores and smaller predators), which are just wild beasts. The Hariyun are more refined, and not as physically formidable (although they have talons). Because they can fly, and have cities high in the mountains, their everyday life isn't nearly as dangerous as the Kyrusan, and they can afford to be more intellectual. Although the warring clans of the Kyrusan are constantly in conflict, the entire Kyrusan race are united when it comes to the Hariyun. The two races are at odds, due to a war centuries ago, and to this day distrust each other.<br>
<br>
My story is about one Kyrusan lord, Garaal, who is a very battle-hardened and powerful lord, but is also intelligent and wise. He shows a willingness to compromise, but the years of fighting has gotten to him. Seeking a way to unite the people of his world, Garaal sends messages to the lords of the surrounding lands, as well as the ruling councils of the Hariyun, requesting that they meet with him to discuss something that he's been thinking about for some time: the Stones of Gaia. A series of seven crystalline stones, the Stones of Gaia hold magical properties concerning elemental energy, and are said to have been constructed by Gaia herself. They hold incredible power, but Garaal believes that the seven stones can be split up between the lords and councils, creating a system of checks and balances. Right now, the stones are locked away within an ancient temple far to the north. Garaal wants to send a team to the temple and recover the stones. <br>
<br>
That's the basic gist of the story. The whole universe and world that I've created will be a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy. There will be magic, and even sorcerers called Gaia Mages. Gaia Mages are an order of elemental druid-like individuals who can tap into elemental power to a certain degree. Both Hariyun and Kyrusan have Gaia Mages. However, there will also be evolution and other scientific concepts. Below is the Prologue of my story: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eenank>Eenank</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/12/02 1:40:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=558.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A story I'm writing</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Prologue</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Persirun gazed up into the night sky, his eyes looking up to see the large moon glow against the darkness. An orb of pale white, the moon radiated it's ghostly light onto the jungle below, outlining the black world with silver. Persirun could see the pitch black sillouhettes of the palm trees against the lunar sphere above, their blade like fronds rustling in the midnight breeze. Lowering his head away from the sky, Persirun's gaze shifted back to the dark, shadowy realm that was the jungle. Although it was hard to not stare at the moon, for it's beauty was alluring, Persirun knew that he must keep moving. He can not afford to dawdle.<br>
<br>
Standing in a small clearing, Persirun's current location was only a fleeting moment of open space in the vast expanse of thick jungle that covered most of the land. It was because of this tiny pocket that he was able to see the moon in full glory, for the rest of the jungle had a inpenetrable canopy of branch and vine. With his longbow in his right hand, Persirun peered into the jungle, his eyes piercing into the large ferns and wooden trunks. His eyes, although keen, were still somewhat dependant on light. Persirun would not have even considored hunting on this quiet eve were it not for the heavenly light of the moon illuminating the nocturnal world. <br>
For several long seconds Persirun continued to look forward, and his gaze soon fell onto a patch of snapped branches and bent leaves, the sure sign that his prey had passed this area. <br>
<br>
Persirun let out a satisfactory hiss as he stepped forward, his scaley body reentering the jungle. For nearly an hour he had been tracking the small herbivore, a fleet-footed creature that could cover great distance if time allowed. Persirun could not hope to catch it by simply running it down, for it's speed was like the wind, and instead he had been relying on the cover of darkness to stalk his prey. <br>
<br>
Flicking his long forked tongue into the night air, Persirun could sense that the herbivore was not far off. However, so far he had seen the creature three times, and each time the herbivore seemed to grow agitated and anxious before Persirun could even aim his weapon. Each time it would squeek like a rodent, and dart off into the brush. This puzzled the Kyrusan hunter, for he was usually able to capture his prey within the first sighting. Right now, he was hoping that this fourth time would be the last.<br>
<br>
Stepping carefully on the soft earth, Persirun continued to walk for several minutes, stopping periodically to taste the air for signs of the herbivore. His four-fingered right hand gripped the longbow tightly, it's curved shaft of wood and ivory feeling light and strong, Persirun was prepared for another chance to kill. Strapped to his back was a quiver of arrows, lengths of wood and chiseled stone that could penetrate thick beast-hide. So far he had used three of them, but had managed to recover two. The third went sailing into the night, disappearing into the shadows that enveloped the night like black water. It had whistled through the air, speeding off into oblivion. One of the recovered arrows was now useless, it's arrow-head chipped and shattered after being recovered from a tree trunk. The third seemed fine, but Persirun had placed it back into his quiver anyway, preferring to use a fresh one for this fourth encounter. With a confident demeanor he continued his stalking. <br>
<br>
For another five minutes the Kyrusan silently stepped, shifting between the vegetation like wind through the trees, passing from shadow to shadow. With another taste of the air, he detected another hint of the herbivore, a fleeting taste of it's scent. Much stronger than before, Persirun realized that the herbivore was within a hundred feet of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now's my chance...&quot; he said silently, and immediatly lowered himself below the ferns. With bent knees and a stooped back, Persirun crept along the jungle floor in the direction of his prey. He was careful to keep silent, but he must also maintain a decent pace, and approach the creature before it roamed off again. Finally, after nearly a full minute of creeping, Persirun came upon another clearing, a tiny speck of space. He grinned when he saw that the herbivore was right in the middle of the clearing.<br>
<br>
The herbivore was a small bipedal animal, with pebbled skin and large glinting eyes. It stood no higher than Persirun's chest, and Persirun could easily kill it using his claws and teeth alone. However, it's great speed warranted a ranged attack only. Persirun had hunted them before, and was sure that a single arrow could kill them. Grazing peacefully amongst the vegetation, the herivore was oblivious to the stalking predator that watched it from the ferns. Persirun reached back and pulled out a brand new arrow, careful to be absolutely silent. Lifting his long bow, he aimed his weapon, pulling back on the strip of tough beast-hide, hearing the faint stretch of the strip. The sharp point of the arrow poked against the ferns, glinting in the faint moonlight. After two seconds of adjustment and shifting of weight, Persirun's deadly projectile was aimed directly at the oblivious animal.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the herbivore lifted it's head, it's eyes wide as it looking into the jungle. It was becoming agitated again, for it had apparantly sensed something. However, it wasn't looking at Persirun, who was crouching silently and out of sight. It's attention seemed to be directed to something else, something unseen. Persirun was confused, but also determined to end this hunt. He will not allow his prey to elude him again. This will be the final time. He unleashed his arrow, and with a snap the deadly shaft flew threw the air, cutting across the small clearing, and found it's mark directly into the herbivore's neck just as the creature was getting ready to take off again. <br>
<br>
Persirun let out a sigh as the herbivore was hit. For a moment the animal stumbled as it's escape was cut short, and clumsily fell to the ground. Kicking and thrashing, the herbivore let out a gurgling cry as blood filled it's throat and flowed over it's neck. And then, it was quiet.<br>
<br>
Persirun emerge victoriously from the jungle with a hissing laugh, and strode towards the fallen prey. He stood over the herbivore, the arrow sticking out like a spike. It wasn't breathing, or moving in any way. Bending down, Persirun ran his hand across the neck, feeling the pebbled skin. A slick of blood now covered the neck, flowing from the wound. Persirun grinned, for his marksmanship was flawless. The creature was indeed dead. <br>
<br>
&quot;Finally, I can return home,&quot; said the hunter, looking down. &quot;You gave me quite a bit of trouble, didn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
A snapping branch caught Persirun's attention, and looking towards his left he watched in horror as the enormous predator emerged from the shadows, it's mammoth body revealed in the full moon light. With a ferocious growl, it lunged towards him, it's mouth open and ready. Persirun quickly reached back and grabbed an arrow, and within a single second he had it aimed at the beast's snout. However, one second wasn't nearly fast enough, as the beast pounced down upon him. Gripping him in it's jaws, the beast lifted Persirun bodily, it's teeth deep into his flesh. Persirun could only blink when his back and ribcage snapped, and as the world became a blur, Persirun could only think of one final thought. <br>
<br>
&quot;I was right. This was the last time...&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eenank>Eenank</A> at: 3/12/02 1:42:24 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=558.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=558.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=558.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=558.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=558.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=558.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
