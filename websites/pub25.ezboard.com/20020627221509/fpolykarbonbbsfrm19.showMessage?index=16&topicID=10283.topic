No level headed person here honestly believes that the US is 100% correct and that everyone from the Middle East are insane, evil, terrorists hell bent on our destruction. Anyone with more brain cells than fingers knows that there is good and bad in both of our societies, but Ronin just used this thread as an excuse to launch an inane diatribe against the US. <p><table width=100% border=0>

As you can see, there was definitely a reason behind the actions taken against us, but in no way can they ever be justified.  Nor can our own actions against innocent civilians.<br>
But to spit on the thousands who have died by saying there was some way to justify what actions have taken place is horrible.<br>

<br>
Thankyou for those who saw my true point, Falcon.<br>
    Scorch Knights I tend to try and not call people morons. He is just flippin on me. <br>
     Wyers how many civilians did we kill when we bombed Hiroshima, and then add Nagasaki's death toll? How many people can be considered civilians truly when the world is truly ran by corporations, many of these people all worked for one company or another. None of us are innocent.<br>
    Alucard, your post was harsh, I feel you hold some dislike for me. I feel your wording was very nice, in another mans hands it could have become a trailing malapropism. I did not use this thread as a way to try an denounce the united states, I used this thread to try and help a person who seemed to need help. He defended me so I must have accomplished my initial goal, or at least part of it.<br>
      Futura, your attack against my personal thoughts and intelligence, is rather lacking in...elements of class. I'm no genius but all men and women can think of a better way to describe a person than MORON. I am a christian, and I take a look at christianity in a way many people don't. Satan is not such a bad dude, just in agony, so hey. Theres an example. And if you know the bible then you can say Jesus Christ was a terrorist of sorts. He caused so much damn trouble that he was crucified, yet had done nothing wrong. I don't condone the way they did it, didn't it come through enough in my first post, that it was a desperate/clinging to everything they've got left/we are going to lose and try to take you with us/help us/pathetic attempt to change the world? People accept our way of life because we play it up, seen fight club? Stuff rules us, Jesus said to give up the THINGS you had and follow him. We are all sinners, and we are all greedy, and things are so shiny and great, but you'll find the happiest people on earth have nearly nothing. Yet american organizations want to try and end POVERTY. There are no poor when there are no rich! Read My Ishmael, or Ishmael by Daniel Quinn sometime, they should help you see what many people have that we do not. Our country is the most depressed and angry country in the world! There are reasons for it. Seek these answers. Thankyou for reading this if you still want to try and demean me, then email me at Ech0_x@yahoo.com, thats with a zero not an O. Thankyou all for your time, and for making my life a little more interesting.<br>
<br>
Also I wrote this before, your second post, and feel, that justice and justify are thrown around too much. This rock is dying because of us, and if we were all gone i'm sure it would be a better place, just have fun and die. That is all I ask, and all I do.<br>

The more you type, the more it seems we don't disagree.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I don't deny for a second that we've done our share of terrible things, and continue to do so. But the way you worded your first post seemed to be accussing the US of being the sole aggressor. Instead of trying to see both sides, you just took the other side. I won't pretend like we're perfect, but we're not as horrible as your original post seemed to imply. And I think it's pretty obvious there are better ways to prove a point than killing several thousand people. Sure, it catches their attention, but you can't really complain about someone doing something then do the same thing and not be a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
My main point was, most people here are not stupid. We know that the US isn't perfect, we know that the people we fight aren't evil incarnate. You don't need to talk down to them, and you should choose your words more carefully if you don't want to be misunderstood. <p><table width=100% border=0>
