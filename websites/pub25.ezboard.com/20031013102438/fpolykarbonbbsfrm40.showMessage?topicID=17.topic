Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> I've been at this story idea for a while, so I guess that since I have all my stuff together, I should present it to the board. This is just a rough sketch of what the whole story is about. I don't get into the actual storyline because I have yet to develop it; only the basic jist of what it's about. I haver a rough idea of the main characters directly involved in the story, but that's it so far.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Story</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This story takes place in Japan during the year 2032. Technological advances have brought forth the possibility of genetically engineering the human genetic code to produce a superior human. The Akatsura organization is the leading researcher in genetic engineering, however, since the ban on the genetic engineering of human beings was passed, they had to secretly conduct their experiments underneath the government’s nose. Their leading geneticist, Dr. Kobayashi, was put in charge of the secret project and thus, the “Kobayashi Project” was born. The Kobayashi Project is an underground, top-secret project that’s sole purpose is to create the ultimate human being through genetic engineering. After many years of experiments, all of their projects have come up as failures, except for two. One of them was given the responsibility of making sure the secret of the Kobayashi project is kept safe, and the other was simply kept in “storage”. Tachibana Shima is the main character of the story, and though he does not know, he is one of the Kobayashi experiments. He’s the one who was to keep the project a secret, and also to kill anyone that the Akatsura organization tells him to. Now that Shima has been found to be potentially dangerous for the Akatsura organization, they believe he must be eliminated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Kobayashi experiments</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Each Kobayashi experiment starts off with the creation of two artificial gametes, with one being an artificial sperm cell and the other being an artificial egg cell. These two gametes have replicas of the human genome inside them, with all flaws or imperfections are taken out. The egg cell is then fertilized, and becomes and zygote. The zygote is then placed in a special incubator that simulates the womb and has its genetic code altered during this stage to become a superior human being when born. It is also during this stage when it is given a name. The zygote then goes through the stages a normal child would, and eventually becomes a living baby where it is removed from the incubator and then raised inside the Akatsura organization.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Characters</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Name: Tachibana Shima<br>
Age: 17<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Affiliation: Akatsura Organization<br>
Weapon: <br>
Bio: Shima is the quiet type, and mostly kept to himself. Because of this, he possessed very few social graces and has no friends at his school or his job. He works for the Akatsura Organization, the top genetics company in Japan, and is an agent working directly for their dirty security. The Akatsura Organization is also involved in a top-secret scientific project called the Kobayashi Project. This project exists to construct the perfect human being, and was to be used as soldiers for the government before the project was banned because of the “anti human genetic engineering regulation” and was forced to continue under the nose of the government. Shima’s sole purpose in the Akatsura Organization is to protect the secret of the Kobayashi Project, killing off anyone who comes close to learning the secret. Shima is not informed of why he is killing these people, nor even acknowledges the existence of the Kobayashi Project, for Shima is, himself, one of the outcomes of the Kobayashi Project. He obviously has no idea about any of this. After a confrontation with the Vigilante Faction, Shima hears the name of this project for the first time, and Ginjo reports on this. The Akatsura decide that in order to keep the secret safe, Shima must be disposed, even though he was the only successful outcome of the Kobayashi Project, besides another.<br>
<br>
Name: Toyoshima Ginjo<br>
Age: 28<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Affiliation: Akatsura Organization<br>
Weapon: <br>
Bio: Ginjo is an agent in the field for the Akatsura Organization, working for their security just as Shima does. His sole duty within the organization is to secretly keep an eye on Shima and make sure that he does not find out about the truth to what he is supposed to be protecting: The Kobayashi Project. Since Ginjo is undoubtedly loyal to the organization, he was told everything there is to know about the Kobayashi Project.<br>
<br>
Name: Okada Ryuji<br>
Age: 21<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Affiliation: Vigilante Faction<br>
Weapon:<br>
Bio: Okada Ryuji, the wildcard and Vigilante Faction vice-president. Wearing sunglasses on the hairline of his slicked back, spiky hair, he always has a cigarette in his mouth and a cool, yet badass attitude. He has a carefree approach on things and is always acting like your best buddy. Ryuji has a tattoo of a Japanese dragon that coils around his left arm, owns a motorcycle and a powerful handgun. He seems to be a normal person, but he is far from it. Ryuji is an outcome of the Kobayashi Project, but is one of their failed experiments, which escaped the Akatsura Organization long ago. He joined the Vigilante Faction after discovering he was part of the Kobayashi Project, and is determined on bringing down the Akatsura Organization.<br>
<br>
Name: Hasegawa Kazuma<br>
Age: 17<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Affiliation: Akatsura Organization<br>
Weapon: <br>
Bio: The second successful outcome of the Kobayashi Project, Kazuma is an extremely psychopathic person with a cool head. Kazuma’s appearance reflects his personality perfectly; with his pointy blood red hair that sticks up in random directions and the wicked smile that constantly runs across his face. Kazuma was placed in Shima’s position after the Akatsura Organization targeted him in the first place. Guising himself as a transfer student at Shima’s school, he tracks down Shima for the sole purpose of killing him. In reality, Kazuma has no grudge against Shima, and wishes to invite him to help him destroy the Akatsura Organization. Shima has no desire to become involved in the Akatsura Organization again, and blows off Kazuma’s offer. Kazuma now concludes that Shima cannot stay alive and must die along with the Akatsura Organization. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 6/3/03 11:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerothyme>zero thyme</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/16/03 4:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project. Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> I like it. It obviously has some cliche aspects to it but since you have spikey-haired 17 year olds working for the government I would say you aren't too worried about that. <br>
<br>
It's not necessarily a bad thing either. Spy movies share a lot of commmonalities and that doesn't keep them from being either popular or fun.<br>
<br>
You don't have to but I would include a main female character (I realize you'll have lots of other characters and this is just a start). None of these characters sounds like that have much in the way of socializing skills and this could be fun. She could also be someone close enough to *almost* find out their secret from time to time for a little added tension.<br>
<br>
The character that appeals to me most is the bad boy, Okada Ryuji. I'm curious how you will incorporate him in the story. He wouldn't fit in working in the government, and he's 20 years old so he's not exactly going to fit in at school. <br>
<br>
As part of reference, maybe even assisting with Okada Ryuji or Kazuma's motivation, I would suggest reading a sci-fi novel called &quot;Beggars Ride&quot; by Nancy Kress. <br>
<br>
Kress actually has a trilogy on the genetic modification of humans and evolution but Beggars Ride can be read as a stand alone novel with no problem. Kress did a whole lot of thought around genetic human modification and the very human nature reaction to it. It's a great read. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerothyme>zero thyme</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/16/03 4:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project.

Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> Yeah, some parts of the story will definately be cliche, and I actually intended it that way. All of my writing is influenced by anime and their wonderful charcters designs, story lines, and such.<br>
<br>
I was actually planning on adding a heroine from the start. She would be a transfer student who appears at the start of the story and immediately takes liking to Shima. I don't plan on having Shima get into a relationship with her, though, because he's a very antisocial person. I'm thinking of Noriko (the heroine) to be almost forcing herself into Shima's life, and slowly, she comes to discover his secret.<br>
<br>
The only character so far with horrible social skills is Shima, who's completely antisocial and has no friends at school. He pretty much hates everyone, and is in some small way, sort of an antihero. Kazuma is a psychopathic person, but not in an extremely demented way (He's more or less exactly like Yukishiro Enishi from Rurouni Kenshin.) Ryuji has the most amount of people skills out of the bunch, because he's usually always smiling (except when he's whooping ass) and joking around (I guess if you're comparing him with another Rurouni Kenshin character, Sanosuke would best fit the bill.) <br>
<br>
Ryuji was definateluy the most interesting and fun person to create. The group he belongs to (I'm not so sure if I'll make him the leader of the group or not) is sort of like a small riot group who protests the Akatsura organization. I'm not so sure how to describe them, though. You're right that he wouldn't fit in Shima's environment, and he's not an extremely vital character (like Shima and Kazuma are), so he'll appear on the streets every now and then. I'm still trying to figure out how I'll introduce him and will see how I'll be able to give him a bigger part in the story to make him appear more.<br>
<br>
I'll definately give that book a shot. Thanks for the crits. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A> at: 4/16/03 5:26:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=otakulad>OtakuLad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Canadian <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/19/03 6:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.calgarymedia.com/asuka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project. Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> I'll give you another angle, Kegebu. You don't have to use it, just a different take on the idea...<br>
<br>
Genetic Engineering in humans takes a heck of a long time. You have to wait for the human to grow up. What if their was an organization that had access to genetic screening (blood samples in schools, genetic registries, etc). They had identified the DNA sequencing that made for the best soldiers/mercenaries for the organization and looked for kids aged 8 - 14 to kidnap and &quot;re-program&quot;. Perhaps it's called the &quot;Kaishuu sequence&quot;.<br>
<br>
These children would be trained and brainwashed to their destiny, probably in another country. Once the training is finished, they'd be ultra-loyal lean mean fighting machines. Perhaps Shima was recognized and rescued and now the organization wants him back...<br>
<br>
Just a different angle on the same story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagebu>Kagebu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/19/03 9:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/datenshidojo/sano01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project. Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> You do have a pretty interesting take on my concept, but I'd rather stick to the whole &quot;test-tube babies&quot; concept of the Kaishuu experiment outcomes being brought up inside the organization.<br>
<br>
I already developed Kazuma's motive for destroying the organization, and it's quite simple. Kazuma knows that the Akatsura organization has his his and Shima's DNA already mapped out (or at least the stages of how they were created in the first place), and he also knows that he is a loose cannon just like Shima. He believes that with his genetic code already copied entirely, the organization would have no use for him and would have no problem killing Kazuma off if he became just the little bit rebellious. So he plans on being rebellious and go all out and destroy the organization just out of spite. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.datenshidojo.cjb.net" target="top">Datenshi Online</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chumlybob>ChumlyBob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/25/03 1:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project.

Seriously, though, I need some help on how I should start the story off, because for some reason I can't think of any good opening.<br>
I also kind of decided to take Shima out of the government and just keep him involved in the Akatsura organization only. Basically now he just kills off everyone who comes close to finding out the secret about the Kobayashi project (I renamed the whole thing. Instead of Kaishuu, now, It's Kobayashi) just like before, but instead, isn't involved with the government at all. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.datenshidojo.cjb.net" target="top">Datenshi Online</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chumlybob>ChumlyBob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/27/03 6:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project.

Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> Yeah, that's what I was thinking of at first, but I'm having a hard time coming up with Shima's dialogue. I guess in his position he wouldn't have much to say, though. Anyways, that's pretty much what I'm going to be doing, so thanks.<br>
<br>
I was wondering, though, what the heck else would a rogue organization like the Akatsura want to use Shima for? It would be boring to just have Shima kill a bunch of people who get too close to finding out about the secret of the Kobayashi Project. <br>
I was thinking of having Shima being sent to the faction opposed to the Akatsura organization (the one that Ryuji belongs to) because they are beginning to be a threat and are alerting the government of the Akatsura and the Kobayashi Project. Maybe Shima could run into Ryuji from then on and they become after each other, and when Ryuji finds out Shima's a Kobayashi project just like he is, Ryuji feels sympathy for him and tries to help him (Shima of course, wouldn't want any help and would probably try to kill Ryuji, still.)<br>
<br>
I'm not a gun person, so I don't really know any good pistols for my characters to use. I was thinking sort of like a desert eagle for Shima and Kazuma. If anyone is an expert on guns, then list down some of your favorite.<br>
<br>
I also created a new character...<br>
<br>
Name: Toyoshima Ginjo<br>
Age: 28<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Affiliation: Akatsura Organization<br>
Bio: Ginjo is an agent in the field for the Akatsura Organization. His sole duty within the organization is to secretly keep an eye on Shima and make sure that he does not find out about the truth to what Shima is supposed to be protecting: The Kobayashi Project. Since Ginjo is undoubtedly loyal to the organization, he was told everything there is to know about the Kobayashi Project.<br>
<br>
Obviously, he'll be killed by Shima. I'll have him killed at least halfway into the story, if not sooner. He's a more insignificant character, anyways.<br>

Another story idea of mine.</span><hr size=1> Actually, I was going for a handgun. A socom is a type of rifle, is it not? (I know at least that much of guns.)<br>
<br>
Anyways, I still need ideas for guns for my guys to use. Besides that, I have a perfect idea of how I'm going to set up the beginning part of the stroy. It basically goes like this:<br>
Some businessman is working late at night (he's the only one there). He pops out a floppy disc from his computer, shuts it off, and puts the disc in his pocket. After taking the elevator down and exiting the building, he is confronted by Shima standing in front of the building, waiting for him. Shima raises his weapon and fires one shot into his head. Shima takes the floppy disc and walks away. He is now at the Akatsura building, and walks up to his boss, throwing the floppy disc on his desk. A little conversation happens and then Shima takes off to his apartment. On the way out of the Akatsura building, he is stopped by Ginjo who asks if Shima took a look at what's in the disk. Shima tells Ginjo that he could care less and to get out of his way, that he needs to go home and study for a test the next day (this is when the reader learns that Shima is still a senior high school student). Shima gets to his apartment and takes out his books. The next day, Shima is standing in front of his school and he is described wearing a khaki suit (unbuttoned), with a loosened tie (the khaki suit and tie is supposed to be the average uniform for senior high school students today. His attire also indicates that he doesn't care, since he has his jacket unbuttoned and his tie loosened). Anyways, he gets in class and Noriko, the transfter student is introduced and is placed on the desk right beside Shima. The class takes the test and is dismissed for the next period.<br>
<br>
This is what I have down so far as a quick sketch of what is going to happen in the first chapter. I don't plan on showing much of his school life because it's boring and isn't directly related to the plot of the story.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I was wondering if I should, at the beginning of the story before everything takes place, put in some sort of prelude to describe the Akatsura organization and such. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.datenshidojo.cjb.net" target="top">Datenshi Online</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chumlybob>ChumlyBob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(5/11/03 10:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Kaishuu Project.

By the way, I set back the time period of this story by twenty years...
