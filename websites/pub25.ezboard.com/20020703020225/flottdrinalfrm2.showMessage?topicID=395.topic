<br>
I had just gotten on to mess around for a little while b/c I was not on a very good computer at the time and all of the sudden Kore shouts Lodizal in guild. I forze wondering if it was true and then he said he was not kidding and that Loizal was UP. Everyone sprang into action that very moment. People were given rides very quickly and any person could port (low lvl or not) helped us get everyone there within 10mins I would say-that was extremly good work. A couple of us got aggro and started to kite Lod around...easy enough with sow on. I went down and was propmtly dragged and ressed. After that I saw that we were short on the ppl needed. At max we had two groups and none had an enc or shammy for slow-bad news. Ember, a kind member of DV, ask if we needed some help, I asked her to send a few ppl and she also helped kite Lod for awhile. Then trouble began-word was out across several guilds that Lod was up. For some reason all these guilds thought we needed help and ppl just started showing up all over the place. One member of SW(seventh Ward), Gazemer, asked if I wanted him to bring some help and I replied telling him to bring a small group. he ended you bringing one full grp which made me push raid into four grps. I got the left overs put into the 4th and then we killed Lodizal. I lottoed the loot. Gazemer won the shell, Kuvu the map piece, and Seke and me both got a pair of boots.<br>
<br>
Now here are all the problems I saw. <br>
<br>
Seventh Ward. Their members were almost all causing problems. Several of their members invited themselves. Gazemer did not listen to anything I said and followed ZERO of my directions. when Lodizal was pulled Gazemer just pulled him b/c HE was rdy. I had not given such an order at all and had JUST finished forming grps. Luckily we were already prepared. Gaz also wanted to let eveyone in his guild come that wanted to come and of course I said no to this b/c that would have add an insane more amount of ppl there. One of their enchanters, Prettymoonrose, invited herself and then would not get in the grp I asigned her. She then wanted to roll on a belt if it dropped when I had not invited her enc. She just came as the enc. I said no to this and she just uped and left. <br>
<br>
Stragglers. People thought if they just jumped in the fight that they got a chance at loot. That is totally crazy. Somehow even a low lvl or two snuck into the grps. That was my fault and I'm sorry it happened. I was getting spammed so badly I am suprised I got anything done. Everyone and his mom wanted in on the raid and repeatedly spammed me for a grp. I had to ask atleast 3 times for ppl to stop spamming me to get in on raid b/c we were full. No one listened and it made my job a lot harder.<br>
<br>
Loot. 24 ppl there and I had 4 items to be rolled on. Was going to be a lot of unhappy ppl so I had to make a choice. I chose to only let ppl roll once so they had to chose the item they wanted the most. Since ppl only had one roll they chose the item they would need the most. I think this went well.<br>
<br>
Now the fixes.<br>
<br>
If we can't kill Lod guild only next time there will be a lot more stricker on whats going on. No SW member will EVER join me on another event unless I know them personally and trust them. I will have some ppl help me control the crowd and keep stragglers out of our way. I will make sure anyone of non guild I personally invite. No more ppl just inviting themselves. If we do include non guild ppl, I will most likely only let guild members roll for the shell. I should not have let Gaz roll or take the shell b/c of his actions but at that point in time I was trying to prevent a roit about the loot. Since I won a pair of boots I myself will not include myself in rolls untill several of you get a piece of loot. I want us to all share the wealth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I may chose to roll on an item and defer it to someone I think deserves the item. This would only be non guild only rolls and would take us both out of rolls.<br>
<br>
Okay sorry to make you read all that =P<br>
<br>
Now lets go kill Lodizal again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uphoenixxspiritwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phoenixx Spiritwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/5/01 3:13:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/flottdrinalfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=395.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Lodizal, a very good learning experience - please all re</span><hr size=1> Hiyas all.<br>
<br>
       Just thought I'd add my two cents. The first thing you need to do when he pops is be the first one to AGGRO him. It's best to have a Ranger and/or druid kite him and of course, someone you trust. Snare works great for getting the aggro. Don't dare attack him because he'll summon.<br>
<br>
      Then get a friend or guildmate to the Gnoll camp to start organizing/calling people. That person may want to /petition to have a guide come and witness that he's been aggro'd by a guildmate or someone who is with your party ( in case someone tries to jump him, sadly this has happened to Divinus Veritas far too many times). Also, every 5 mintutes or so /ooc the zone that Lodizal has been aggro'd and &quot;being done&quot; by &lt;insert guild name&gt;, please do not interfer&quot;. <br>
          Lodizal takes 12-15 people all 50 +. 50+ because he'd a lvl 60 mob and anyone under 50 really can't do that much damage if any on him. Heavy on tanks, light on casters. It helps to have a 55 + warrior ( with disc defensive) and/or a high lvl shammy to slow. Just get your forces gathered as quickly as possible to avoid conflicts and you'll all be having turtle soup =)<br>
<br>
      I've made hotkeys for all of the UGoD guilds so if we need that extra tank or two or that cleric, that's where I start first. I would rather see an item won off Lodizal go to a UGoD member then a CiH member.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your future kills of Lodizal. He's gotta be my favorite turtle =)<br>
