     Among my favorite books are "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Bronte, "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Bronte, "It Can't Happen Here" by Lewis Sinclair, "Farenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury and two books by Bud Mc. Farlaine Jr. called "Pierced by a Sword" and "Conceived without Sin".
     I've written many short stories, mostly Star Wars fan fiction.  I'm also an active RPer in a Wheel of Time RPG called The Tower of Hope.</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">I've never been schooled in the "conventional sense", except for eight years of Catholic Catechism (finishing at the top of my class in '98).
     For two years, I was the leader of an online Star Wars club called the SWU, bringing that club into a fun time, only to be impeached by "political rivals" (in an online club!  Can you believe it?).  I'm going to have to write a novel about all that, someday.  It's a very interesting story, if I can dredge up all of the repressed memories.
     Anyway, now I'm active in a national Catholic youth group called Life Teen, and am a Teen Advisor at the local parish and maintain their webpage.  
     I've always been interested in webpage design, ever since I first got online.  I've had many personal homepages in the last (must have been) six years, but all of them have been devoured by unreliable servers and I don't feel a great urge to put them up again.
     I've been into art for as long as I can remember--no, make that much longer than I can remember.  My mom tells me that I began by drawing fish, then dinosaurs.  Now, I concentrate on drawing humans, mostly character design.  I'm a pretty good draftsman, but I have a lot of room for improvement.
     I plan on going to either the University of Illinois or Boston College after I've gotten a few more years of "world experience".  I hope to become a director, because my mind is much too visual to express my ideas in most any other way.  The merger of mediums in motion pictures, I find amazing, especially after seeing "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring".</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">PM ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showMessage?topicID=4469.topic" title="post" target="_blank">What kind of paper should I use...?</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Photoshop and Art questions</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2002 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
