<br>
I personally feel that we need to attack Iraq. I don't want to go to war, but I think right now we need to. There's too much at stake not to make a pre-emptive strike. Seems like everyone points out that we can't find the weapons Iraq has hidden... and everyone who points that out tends to believe that that means they don't have 'em. Yeah... maybe they don't, but what it they do? What if they really are being this successful at hiding weapons? Are you will to stake your life (literally) on the assumption that they don't have supplies and weapons that have &quot;mysteriously&quot; dissapeared? I'm not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Do we really have to wait for an e-coli and smallpox infested crater to be in timesquare before we can do something about it? I hope not... folks, admit it, good common sense dictates that we NEED to go to war.<br>
<br>
The USA is not a warmonger, we're just in a very dangerous posistion right now with Iraq, and the only reason we haven't attacked yet is because George W. is doing everything in his power to end this peacfully, and I really hope we can. But now is not the time to be making dangerous assumptions. We have to do something... and we need to do it QUICK.<br>

He has repeated demands that &quot;either Saddam disarms or we will disarm him&quot;, he has not only built up a military presence there as a prelude to an invasion, but now HAS SPECIAL FORCES operating inside Iraq's borders.  He stated intent to invade Iraq BEFORE approaching the UN.  He has stated intent to invade Iraq no matter what the UN says.  <br>
<br>
Granted, of late, he has cut down on the war rhetoric a bit, and has attempted to slap on a veneer of legality by having Colin Powell provide that... interesting... presentation.  However, Bush has done all he could within the limits of his office and as a UN member to provoke war, and has time and again REFUSED any peace offering Iraq has made, and REDICULED the UN process designed to solve this &quot;dangerous position&quot; without shots being fired.  These are not the actions of a man of peace.<br>

And you're ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! We HAVE given inspections enough time. So let's finally act on the threats that we've made. We need to GO but too many bleeding heart liberals are getting in the way. It's causing a national division that WE DO NOT NEED TO HAVE. <br>

He'll keep lying, and hiding, and he'll continue to fail to disarm, and at the rate we're going, we'll give him another deadline, and another until he has enough time to get a hold of plutonium or uranium, and the next thing we know people are being melted alive from the inside out.

Japanese Nationalist:finally someone said it. yes you are correct my man, if a terrorist ever detonates a an atomic bomb on the U.S. or anywhere else (god forbid) its gonna say &quot;made in u.s.a.&quot; on a little tag in the back (it's not gonna actually have a tag that was just a joke but you get the idea), the last thing you want is to be bombed by a bomb you made and you yourself gave to the enemy. maybe it's already happened in a metaphorical way, the u.s. has been attacked or has come into conflict by there own machinations, Bin laden was trained by the CIA in the 80's, that's why they can't catch him, he obviosly knows all the tricks of the trade.<br>
maybe that's why the u.s. is picking on hussien, the u.s. them selves gave them the stuff and now the last thing the americans want is to be attacked by a weapon they made, detonated by the person they gave it to. it would be not just ironic but also ridiculously humiliating. <br>
<br>
hussein in my opinion is no direct threat to anyone for now, but the gringo's are the ones with the satellites and the spies and the CIA so they surely know if he's a threat or not not me, i just make opinions. when it comes to terrorism and the possibility of harboring terrorist then attack teh terrorists not hussein, deal with the terrorists then see what you can do with hussein, he can't harbor terrorists if there are no terrorists to harbor. so going into conflict with iraq just because he harbors terrorists is stupid, war does not illiminate terrorism (it provokes it), intelligence does(CIA, KBG, FBI, ABC, XYZ, whatever the others are named i don't know). <br>
<br>
of course the suspition of harboring terrorism isn't the only excuse they have, they also say he's a dictator blablablalbal, he's killed alot of people, blablablablbla, he's anti democratic, blablablabla. that's BS, excuse me. i have nothing against the part of the iraqui people who want to take down hussein becasue of him commiting human and political injustices but come on thats alot of BS from bush, did the u.s. ever wage a war against Trujillo in the dominican republic when he was president? or did the u.s. wage a war against somoza? or pinochet? weren't they dictators? and even closer to the u.s.? how many dictators has the u.s. not just help and suport but put into power? think about it.<br>
<br>
but are there reasons that the news doesn't tell us? all in all i'm just a student, i'm not in the u.s. intelligence or in the CIA or do i go by the name of Bond so i have to be aware that what i know, what most of us know of what's going on isn't pretty on neither sides. they both stink to me, so you can imagine on all the ugly and brutal things we don't know of either sides' plans, all in all summing it up, of the little that we know (and the whole lot that we don't know) its simple to say that the war stinks in all aspects, both sides smell like rotten fish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=scorp10n>Scorp10n</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/20/03 9:54:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We HAVE to.

<br>
It is this kind of arrogant American nationalism that has caused this issue in the first place. It is not the USA's duty to meddle in the political affairs of other countries, especially when doing so will enflame the enmity of the given region towards the US. In case you haven't noticed, the (exceedingly bogus) Department of Homeland Security has been advertising a state of high alert for terrorist activities. Any war with Iraq will raise tensions even higher - and after 9/11, do they really need to get any worse? War with Iraq is quite possibly the most self-destructive policy possible.<br>
<br>
Second of all, it is quite obviously an oil-driven action. All counter-arguments I've seen to this statement so far have been incredibly ignorant - &quot;we would have taken over Iraq during the Gulf War&quot; - &quot;we could get our oil from another country&quot; - &quot;if we wanted their oil, we'd just raise sanctions.&quot;<br>
<br>
1) Our president during the Gulf War was not kowtowing to vested interests in oil. On that note, better a blowjob in the oval office than a jerk-off.<br>
<br>
2) Iraq has by far the largest accessible oil supply in the world, estimated to consist of 112 billion gallons of crude. To a country with such a thriving (and technologically backwards) automobile industry, that imports 50% of this oil, this is a godsend, no matter what other areas can be exploited.<br>
<br>
3) Undoubtedly, Bush would rather have economic control over this area so important to him than have to endure some precarious trade arrangement. Political motives are not that simple.<br>
<br>
My final thought on the matter is that, were Saddam to be supplanted, the leaders to follow could only be worse. Right now, the most powerful group in the country is a fundamentalist, extremist Islamic group (please, this isn't anti-Islamic) that is more likely to have ties to al Qaeda than Saddam Hussein would. He may not be a benevolent leader, but he does decidedly less damage to world affairs and to his own country than any alternative would. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eoac.distopia.net"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://eoac.distopia.net/images/button.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Nobody protested Clinton when he bombed Iraq or when he took Milosevic out of power in Yugoslavia for killing his own people.  Saddam has also killed 1.5 million people including 250,000 of his own.  For comparison Hitler killed 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.  Saddams a fourth of the way there. Many that protest in America are mad because Bush stole the election.  God forbid we use the Electoral College.  God forbid we stop a recount when all the previous ones showed that Bush still won.<br>
<br>
Despite what some have said, this isnt about oil.  Saudi Arabia has the most oil in the world.  They also have links to terrorism including a possible connection of money somehow getting to some of the people involved on 9/11.  The US has even tried to keep Iraq from selling any oil because thats the only way they get money and when they do they build weapons.  You can discount these as incredibly ignorant, which some have, but they are both reasons given by Dick Morris, a former <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clinton</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> advisor.<br>
<br>
If a nuke were to go off that said the Made in USA, the only reason it would say that is because we dropped it.  We supported Saddam in the 80s during the Iran/Iraq war because Iran was the bigger threat.  Weve picked the lesser of two evils throughout history.  We sided with Stalin during World War II even though Soviet Russia would cause us a huge problem and a war lasting over thirty years.  However, both France and Germany have supplied Iraq with weapons.  I cant remember which country, I think it was France, sold a nuclear reactor to Saddam that Israel later bombed in 1981.  In Powells presentation to the UN, he showed a video of a F-1 Mirage doing a simulation of spraying anthrax to see how it would disperse.  The F-1 Mirage is a plane exclusive to Iraq so I dont need to explain how Saddam got it.  Also, Germany, France, and Russia have huge oil deals with Iraq that would go poof should Saddam be removed.<br>
<br>
We are not going in unilaterally as some would have you believe.  Leaders of Britain, Australia, France, Italy, and Spain have all said they support Bush, and are among the approximately forty countries that have said they support the USA.  Granted its the leaders of these countries and not the majority of the citizens, a leader is someone who does whats right even when its not popular.  Blair has a horrible rating in England and probably wont be re-elected.  Hell go the same way Churchill did after World War II.  And since when did the constitution say that we need world opinion on our side to do something?  We didnt wait for it for the Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Yugoslavia so why do we need it now?<br>
<br>
The UN is a crock.  It hasnt enforced any of the 17 resolutions passed against Iraq in the past 12 years.  But what about resolutions against Israel and the US?  If they enforce them against one nation shouldnt all be enforced?  No, a major problem with the UN is that it is full of anti-America and anti-Semitic countries.  They havent been able to do much to anybody and did nothing when Saddam kicked them out in 1998 and nothing when North Korea kicked them out just a month or two ago.<br>
<br>
Saddam has known links to terrorists.  We declared war on terrorism, not Al Qaeda only.  From captured PLO documents we have direct finances between them and Saddam.<br>
<br>
For the record, the latest poll says 69% of the American people support invading Iraq while 24% oppose.<br>

He's right. We decalred war on TERRORISM, not one terrorist group. Never before in the history of the United States has the government ever released this much data to get national support to go to war. In the past, the political parties agreed with the president, because in the past they were respectful and honorable. Now we've got a bunch of back biting morons in congress that couldn't agree on something if they had a gun to their head. The only reason that we are in division about way as much as we are is because of idiotic polititions and silicon infested moviestars telling everyone that we don't have any reason.<br>
<br>
WE HAVE A REASON! Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man. And YES, MonkeyPunch, he IS a dictator. I don't know what you've been smoking to make you think he's not. Why didn't we attack those other dictators you named? Very simple: They didn't have the capabilities to shove a virus in fected dildo up our butts. Saddam does. We have always opposed tyranny and we will continue to do so. <br>

Look at the proof they've given us. We can't sit around and wait. It's far too dangerous. <br>

do you have any idea what it means to declare war on terrorism???? it means using a saw to extract a cancer. do you think that tanks and patriot missles will ever stop the terrorist thats probably making plans on blowing up a buildin in the u.s. right now under your nose?? what you don't understand is that war and terrorism are like apples and oranges. terrorism doesn't move within a military enviroment. you can't stop a terrorist with a b-52 bomber. you want to blow up terrorists? then bomb the u.s. because that's where they are. they're not in caves in afganistan, or roaming in the middle of the dessert with rags for cloths, they're in times sqaure, they're probably your next door neighbors, they're at the mall, at the movies, they're normal people with normal cloths on. you wanna knock down hussein then sponsore the so many Iraquis that allready want to becuase of his political crimes. put political pressure on him cut him off economically, use diplomatic tactics, etc., because if the u.s. can prove that hussien harbors terrorists then it's the international comunity's responsability to take care of it with politicis not war. and when the war does start it would be not ridiculous for the u.s. but also humiliating to have a terrorist attack on u.s. soil while their boys are fighting the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; half way around the world.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=scorp10n>Scorp10n</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/21/03 3:29:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Incredible</span><hr size=1> You are so brainwashed.

But I hardly believe any of the drivel they put on Fox News (is that what you watch?) about how he murders children and rapes women for sport - it's such obvious propaganda. Saddam Hussein presents no threat to the US; he's much smarter than to attack us, because he'll meet a much quicker demise by doing so than in any war that's been stalled for months. And why do people believe that it's the United States' responsibility to replace regimes? All of the candidates for successors to Saddam seem to be even more ill-suited to run the country than he is. Not only that, but if the war goes on to Baghdad, we will be directly hurting civilians. This seems to be more damaging than letting the country alone.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;massive&quot; oil and natural gas industry you claim, all of our continental gas reserves are dwindling, as well as production from these reserves. Oil reserves in Alaska are not only not as big, but inaccessible in comparison. Saudi Arabia does have large oil reserves, but a country in which oil accounts for 60% of energy usage requires a tremendous amount.<br>
<br>
And MonkeyPunch makes a very good point - starting a war with Iraq will not achieve anything in the bogus &quot;war against terrorism&quot; - if anything, it will increase anti-American sentiment and increase terrorism. The &quot;war on terrorism&quot; is being fought at home; it is being fought on us. The government has not so blatantly ignored requests for information - requests honored by the Freedom of Information Act - before the Bush Administration. The Patriot Act is a perfect example of the results of Bush's terrorism witch-hunt; near-unlimited surveillance rights for the authorities.<br>

Propoganda?  Although it came from the mouths of former heads of the Iraqi army, and from people who's familly's had been killed by Saddam, and also people who had been tortured by him.  Please find me an Iraqi defector who claims that none of these things have happened.  I bet the pictures of the 250,000 gassed Kurds were doctored too, because they're blatant propoganda as well.  Obviously, if you call anything opposing your view propaganda, I can't change your mind.<br>
<br>
Removing Saddam will, although only slightly, help stop terrorism.  As I have said before capured PLO documents show Saddam giving approximately $10,000 to family's of suicide bombers in Palistine, and less to the families when the &quot;suicide bomber&quot; didn't die.  As for attacking Iraq increasing terrorist attacks on the US, do you suppose they won't attack us at all if we don't invade Iraq?  People that hate us now for our beliefs will still hate us no matter what.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for an answer as to why it was ok to invade countries, including Iraq, for human rights violations during the Clinton administration and not now during Bush's.<br>
<br>
As for the Patriot Act, I'm not a big fan of it although I haven't read the thing.  One good thing to come out of it yesterday was the arrest of 8 people suspected of funneling money to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a known terrorist group.<br>

and if that doesn't satisfy you then all you have to do is type &quot;War and petroleum&quot; on any seach engine and feast you eyes on all the information there is on how war and petroleum has so frequently been hand in hand when it come to U.S. warfare.<br>
