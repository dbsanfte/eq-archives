<br>
With the news of the fairly successful Solusek raid, I felt encouraged and decided to travel there myself, partly due to the quest given to me by Gandari for the Ivy Etched Sleeves.  She told me I must fetch the Rune of Ivy from Grimfeather, that most hated griffon in North Karana.  I have acquired that due to some other braver adventurer slaying the beast.  The only other significant thing I need is a heart of fire from the inferno goblin wizards which are kind of scarce around Solusek.  I also need to buy 2 star rubies, which will be no big deal.  I arrived there and started killing goblins near the entrance, which was surprisingly easy, and they all gave experience, so I was fairly content with that.  I hoped that perhaps someone would kill one of the inferno wizards to open the door for me looting it, much in the same way I acquired the rune from Grimfeather.  Nine had been in the Temple of Solusek Ro getting his new golden briefs, so came over to join in the hunting of goblins.  With a great healer like him, and the population of the dungeon at the time, we got brave and headed deeper into the dungeon.  We found a few spots that had a couple of goblins that needed to be killed, and went about the goblin extermination.  At this point Cashew decided to head over, so we were making our way to the entrance to meet her, and to be a bit safer.<br>
<br>
After killing a couple more goblins, we were resting before our next needed fight to get to the entrance.  All of a sudden, the Kobold Predator came down the hallway and was basically in the same area as us.  I knew he often wore some nice boots, so with Nine sufficiently medded up, I pulled the blue conning beast to us.  He hit fairly hard, moreso than any of the goblins we had fought to that point, but was still not overly difficult and the 2 of us killed him with ease.  Nine looted and found the Kobold Hide Boots on the beast, and generously gave them to me.  They seemed slightly better than the Watchman's Boots I was wearing, and Galadhriel expressed and interest in those if I didn't want them anymore.  Remembering how Melwyn had won the roll on the leggings but let Lora keep them, I gave Nine the Kobold Boots to give to Gala, and I kept the Watchman's Boots.  At this point some druid came through with a bunch of gnomes on his tail, including the Clockwork model EXG(?), who sometimes has the Charred Guardian Sheild, and Charred Guardian Breastplate.  The druid wanted us to finish off the melee for him, but with the other gnomes wandering around, I didn't want a whole bunch of agro stuff beating us down, or the faction hit that would have come with it, I kinda like the little gnomies in Ak'Anon.  So some mage came by, and his pet killed it in short order.<br>
<br>
With the way being clear now to head to the entrance, we went there and found Cashew.  The 3 of us teamed up and started fighting our way into the dungeon again.  After killing a few more goblins, I picked up an inferno wizard on track!  I figured with the 3 of us, we might be able to take him and another goblin, so we started making our way slowly...to the bar room as it turned out.  We had killed more goblins on the way, and then things turned sour.  A goblin I had my eye on suddenly turned a corner and saw me.  He quickly called for help from the bar room and the inferno wizard joined in along with 3 other goblins.  Uhhhh, NOT GOOD!  I told my companions to get out of there, we were definitely overmatched.  I gave a quick shout that there was a train coming to the zone.  At that point Nine gated, as Cashew and I ran to the zone.  It was fairly late, and Nine was bound in Freeport, so he called it a night.  Cashew and I regrouped, but I then had to leave shortly thereafter.  Overall it was a fun adventure for me into Solusek, and the fact that we got another fairly prized loot item was great!  I think I'll be spending some time in the area, hoping to get the heart I need for the sleeves.  I have grown to like this area quite a bit, it's been a lot of fun.  Hmm, a dungeon-crawling ranger, maybe my sister is rubbing off on me.  Nah, I'll have to get to a nice outdoor zone soon, the goblins do give off a nasty stench.  Well, that is all for now, take care all.<br>

<br>
Last night was great as Cashew, Galadhriel and I, along with a slightly younger Iksar necro, Diabolus, did some dungeon crawling in Solusek.  We even came across the named fire drake, Singe!  Unfortunately it was when Cashew was LD, so we killed it without her before it got too far away.  It appeared slightly tougher than me, but went down fairly easily!  We found an Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 3INT 3AGI) on it's body, and I won the roll for it.  After that we found an inferno goblin wizard, the one that drops the heart of fire for my sleeves, so we killed him and another goblin, but no heart.  At that point we decided to call it a night, and teleported out of there to WC courtesy of Air Gala.  I later came back, did a bank run and headed back to Solusek.  What can I say, I'm in love with that place.  After fighting a few goblins at the entrance, a group of 3 (36 druid, 35 ranger and 30 paladin) came in and asked if I wanted to join them.  I agreed, and we decided to go in search of some of the monsters with good drops.  We fought our way through to where the kobold and the goblin foreman are, but neither was to be found at the time.  So we headed more north towards the Kindle, elementals and goblin captain area.  After getting towards there and finding none of them, I saw the kobold predator on track.  We went backwards and killed him.  As the time before when I was with Nine, he dropped the boots (~150p value)!  We rolled for them, and I came out victorious in that roll as well!  Someone else in the group really wanted them, so I traded those for a Polished Bone Bracer (AC2 3INT 3WIS ~120p value).  I know I lost out a little in the value department, but I'm sure Lora would like the bracelet.  We then proceeded back north some more, but then found the foreman on track, so again headed back.  We killed him fairly easily (as with everything with the abilities these guys were bringing), and he dropped the Foreman's Tunic (AC10 3str 3wis, weighs 0.0 ~200p value).  I didn't win the roll on this one, but oh well.  After that it was getting close to patch time, so we ported out to WC (again for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  So now between Lora and I, we've seen probably around 90% of the goblin inhabited parts of the dungeon, so I'm learning my way around there fairly nicely.  I hope we all get to see a good portion of it, and get a taste of all the possible loot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, good bye for now, just thought I'd give you a run down on some of the adventures there.  See you all later!<br>
