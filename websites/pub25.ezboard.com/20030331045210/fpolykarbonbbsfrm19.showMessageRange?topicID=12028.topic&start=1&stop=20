example: What if iraq is working on having a nuclear strike capability over the worlds superpowers and all it takes is a push of the button and well you know the rest...<br>
<br>
or...america's use of agression without full proof of what is really going on is going to force many nations against us and possibly provide even more time for them to conceive nuclear capability...if they are trying that is, wich most likely is the case...<br>
<br>
In my personal opinion Bush is doing a horrible job over here, we are making to many idle threats and bloating ourselves with to much confidence because we are a superpower in the world... They tend to forget it only took a dozen determined people to strike the trade centers and kill thousands, and with biological warfare tech these days who knows what can happen.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ermac@polykarbonbbs>Ermac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/16/03 3:55:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Time is Now!</span><hr size=1> The U.S. is doing what they believe in, stopping an evil man from taking over countries has a crucial point.

The man can't even pronounce &quot;terrorist, he says it like &quot; We gonna get those Terists&quot;. The world has tried peacefully but apparently The Middle Eastern dicatorships are too ignorant and selfish to consider the alternatives of losing their own people to war. Force is the only way to deal with a nuclear threat, mass riots rn't helping. They won't stop a nuclear warhead from bombing a city or ending terrorism, The U.N. and U.S. are doing their best to end the corruption that Osama, Yasar Arafat and Saddam Heissan has broughten. Liberating terrorist organizations will hopefully settle down the chaos and mindless killing for Israel, Iran, and the other countries who are afraid to stand up to the bad guys. Remember, they are surrended by enemies, so they don't have much of a choice. They need outside help, with the power of the Allies, the deadly alliance of terrorist networks will finally be decimated and disbanded.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismrx>PrismRX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/16/03 4:50:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Time is Now!</span><hr size=1> Could be worse, nukes could be posessed by a nation ruled by religious fanatics that do not fear the retalliation dictated in the MAD theory(Mutually Assured Destruction).

Both the British intelligence report issued in Sept '02 and the recent UN inspections stated that Iraq is years away from building 1 nuclear bomb.  The crucial item is the actual weapons-grade fissionable material (plutonium or uranium).  The only way Iraq is going to get that material is if someone ships it in and violates the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.  That's a very short list of nations, and an even shorter list of nations with fissionable material just &quot;lying around&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Arguably, the threat of chemical and biological weapons is greater, as there was evidence that the Iraqis had them (past tense), and it is this where the bookkeeping fails.  There is currently no evidence that Iraq CURRENTLY has the weapons the US claims it has.  Whether this means those weapons were hidden or whether the Iraqis either a) scrapped those weapons as their storage facilities became too unstable or b) sold those weapons to pay financial debts is unknown.  For all we know, the weapons could have been destroyed years ago.  Evidence either way is lacking.  <br>
<br>
Even if Saddam is hiding weapons, he can't hide them forever.  If inspections find them then we have a chance to remove them without risking the lives of either American soldiers or Iraqi civilians.  If inspectors find evidence that the weapons no longer exist then we can rest easy knowing that the world's policy of containment with a limited bombing campaign will keep such weapons programs halted.<br>
<br>
There's over ten million people in Iraq and hundreds of thousands of soldiers on either side that are depending on a proper decision.  We owe it to them all to give a peaceful solution every chance. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Humans are the destroyers, be it of themselves or others.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
while i have made my views somewhat clear on other points, I completely agree that as of late, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bush's</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> warmongering and lack of diplomatic tact has so far overstepped the bounds of common sense as to be unbelievable.  But keep in mind what someone else said above - we're as divided in this country as many others, and few people are truely as extreme as Bush.  He is truely a scary individual at this point.<br>
<br>
That having been said, and i mean this with the utmost respect, &quot;european citizens&quot; are probably the last people who should advise anyone about anything vaugely related to war.  I don't really want to get into another knock down drag out like in some previous threads, but I will point out that Europeans are famous for their a) incredibly short memories (forgetting that a great deal of the problems in the middle east, as well as the north-south economic divide in the world is squarely related to their colonial aggressions of the past 100 years (the us has only ever had 1 colony, in the philipines) and their decisions to slaughter the jews/turn a blind eye while jews were being slaughtered thus neccessitating the development of a jewish state far away from europe to protect them from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the europeans</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) and b) a quite unique (not neccessarily in a good way) perspective on the world on the part of european youth as a result of being brought up under the american security/economic blanket (NATO, Marshall plan aid, economic stability under a fixed dollar-gold standard and so on) and more importantly, under unsustainable welfare states which ensured that the youth of the modern day europe have a radically different perspective on the world than the rest of us stuck in the gritty realist construct of reality.  We see similar phenomenon on the part of South Korean and Japanese youth as well, much to the horror of their parents who have not been sheltered all their lives and realize the true ugliness of the world.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Europe has the dubious distinction of instigating not one, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>two</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the deadliest wars in modern history, as well as an entire host of other crimes against humanity (for instance, french aggression against vietnam, which the US, for less than sound reasons, decided to continue, and more recently and deplorably, French crimes against humanity in Rwanda, where in order to continue the illusion that they are still a big-power, they assisted the Hutu in brutally slaughtering millions of Tutsi civilians during the Rwandan genocide, and then continued their crime by attempting to obfusticate subsequent UN investigations into the incident - I mention the French specifically because they are the most vocal proponents of &quot;peace&quot; in the Iraq issue.  Let us mention nothing of the billions and billions of illicit deals french companies have with the Iraqi dictator to sell black market oil or anthing like that.  Let us furthermore not ask questions of why exactly Butros Gali was suddenly awarded a highly prestigious position at an internationally reknown french charity immediately following the Rwandan genocide.... and so on).<br>
<br>
Furthermore, and perhaps most telling, the europeans have a very infamous tradition of ignoring the bloody obvious until it's too late, preferring instead to cover their eyes and pretend that the world will fix itself.  As the strongest and most damning evidence, I present europe's response (or lack thereof) towards German aggression in the second world war.  Even after Germany had invaded numerous countries, countries like France continued to pretend that everything would be okay if they just &quot;gave it some time&quot;.  This attitude was made all the more ironic by the fact that they had just gotten done fighting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>another</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> world war only a few decades earlier!  Unfortunately, this attitude lasted all the way up until the German army came knocking on the french border.... and the rest, as they say is history.  This is disturbingly similar to the situation now-a-days, when the Europeans want to shut their eyes to the terrorism breeding the middle-east and the weapons of mass destruction being quietly developed under their noses.  How long will it take before they are spurred out of their cowardly complacency and realize that they must act before it's too late?  Will we have to wait until a nuclear bomb explodes in Paris?<br>
<br>
I am not advocating George Bush's warmongering.  I turn on the news with disbelief at the tag team trio of bush powell and rice and their mindnumbingly ignorant alienation of the international world.  However, when I look at the european protesters, I cannot help but to shake my head with the realization that they are just as ignorant as George Dubyah himself.  The world is a complicated place - we should most certainly not be as aggressive or unilateral as bush is driving us to be - but neither should we the ignorant complacent actors that the average european youth would have us be.<br>

I agree with the european complacency that mai mai brought up. If you are looking for evidence of illegal weapons in a country, and all the time there are these &quot;coincidences&quot; that keep slowing you down then slowly (after months) they start letting you in what are you supposed to think. Common sense would say wait there is something wrong. <br>
  A good solution would be to get two or three satellites on Iraq and issue a declaration forbidding them to move any material from any plants without being approved by inspectors. Yes this would burden Iraq but I think if they are complying and don't want to get their assets blown off they would go along with it.<br>
  As for Frances black market deals with iraq, I never knew that (that makes me even more pissed at the protestors). <br>
  What really made me sick was seeing the American protests.  They seem to give a damn about their own troops who are being put in harms way to protect them and the rest of the bloody world. I can't believe anyone can be so insensitive especcially not after the war started on american soil (assuming you consider the iraq action part of the war on terror). We are attack and we vow to erradicate terror from the world and three months later people start saying oh well, you have gotten back at Osama anything else is just warmongering. Anything wrong with that picture? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flare60>flare60</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/17/03 7:14:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12028.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> hmm<br>

let us take into mind here that one reason this war is controversial is that idea.<br>
 That being if we can just remove a government that we (the U.S.) doesn't favor and set up a new one in it's place, then what is to stop us from doing it to whomever we want (not that we don't try anyways). <br>

(funny especially in light of how i just railed on the europeans...)  I cannot fathom why Bush has absolutely no sense of any political/diplomatic tact, or patience for that matter.  I keep wondering to myself if he has something up his sleeve, or some ingenious hidden agenda he's scheming (spelling?) towards, or if he's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really just that stupid...!?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I hope that it's more the former and less the latter.<br>
<br>
Bush's original premise is correct - the middle east is a dangerous breeding ground for terrorists, and those &quot;rogue nations&quot; which support them must be dealt with, pre-emptively if the need be.  This is where I fundamentally disagree with the europeans, most of whom prefer to pretend that if you ask nicely these rogue regimes will simply roll over and &quot;play nice&quot;.  However, while i feel that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>means</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by which we should deal with those regimes should have a place for pre-emptive military force, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>it should not rely solely upon military force to the exclusion of other options.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
And this is where I feel that Bush has gone horribly awry, for reasons that continue to escape me, and i feel, the rest of the world as well.  The inspections should be allowed to continue, intensified, in fact.  If and when they find something (and they may have to continue for a long time, as Hussein is a master of deception), then at that point coercive options, including military force should be considered.  But for now, I think that Bush should bide his time and exercise a little bit of the diplomatic tact that makes for good presidents.  Also, as an IR student with a specialisation in E.Asia, I am somewhat puzzled by Bush's nonresponse to recent North Korean aggressions, especially given the blatantly terrorist tendencies of their regime...<br>
<br>
also, rocketpig has an excellent point.  While some of Bush's recent actions have been questionable, he has hardly done anything to deserve being compared to adolf hitler.  This is all the more ironic, as I presume that Noemi, who made the original comment, is romanian (from his/her avatar and name).  Romania, as we all know, suffered under the tyrannical rule of Ceausescu until <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>as recently as 1989!!!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I think it is safe to say that Bush is nowhere near as &quot;bad&quot; (for lack of a better word) as Ceausescu (ask any romanian who remembers the savagery of this man) and the fact that Ceausescu pales in comparison to the brutality of the Hitler.  Therefore, I think it is a very poor idea to compare bush to hitler.<br>
<br>
I forget where exactly i read it, but someone once said (in response to recent surges of anti-americanism in europe): &quot;You bitch, you moan, but you all know in your hearts that we are nowhere near as bad as you make us out to be, or as bad as we could be if we really wanted to.&quot;  I think that those words very succinctly sum up the truth of the matter with respect to america, the world and all the problems spinning out of control as of late. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mamonaku. 11ban sen ni  Panda densha ga mairimasu.  <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Abunai desu kara, kiiro no sen no uchigawa made osagarikudasai.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
