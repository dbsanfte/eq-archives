They said they'd pay half upfront, which is enough to cover rent and get a bit of a computer upgrade.  My dilemna is this:  What package is better?  I'm not concerned with gaming because most games already run fine, it's more of a photoshop/painter issue because it would be nice if the programs just ran a hell of a lot better, and didn't lag/take 15 minutes to save.<br>
<br>
I don't need new sound or video, so it'll be motherboard, Ram, and CPU upgrades.  There are two different packages offered through the store I always deal with:<br>
-For $344can, I can get a 1.8ghz Celeron.  Plus a new tower, motherboard, and 256mb of RAM to add on to my existing 320.  However, I would still be able to afford a nice $200 printer on top of the upgrade.  The printer could be used to print out lots of stuff to practice inking on as my current printer can't even do a half assed job legible enough to work with.<br>
<br>
Or I could skip the whole printer idea, and just go for the $699 P4 2.0ghz bundle which comes with, again, a tower, new motherboard, and 512mb of DDR SDRam.  Now, I'm not really in the loop anymore about all these new kinds of Ram, so how much difference is there between SDRAM and DDR SDRAM?<br>
<br>
Also, how big a difference would there be between using a P4 system over a Celeron of nearly the same speed?  At any rate, it's still a huge upgrade over my crappy PIII 450 that I'm currently using.  I plan on buying a whole new computer next summer, something that will probably cost about $5000 so I'm not sure what to do right now. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

The P4 is much better than the Celeron and is much more stable.  As AMD has proved that it's not clockspeed that matters.  Speaking of AMD, they're much cheaper.  You could get an AMD chip that does the work of the P4 2.0GHz, for around $100 online.  But that's just my two cents.<br>
<br>
There's 3 types of mainstream RAM out there.  SDRAM, DDR RAM, and RD RAM.  Older comps use SDRAM, the new athlons are DDR RAM, and intel chips are made either for DDR or RD RAM.  In relation to eachother in speed and performance:  <br>
<br>
SD RAM &lt; DDR RAM &lt; RD RAM<br>
<br>
but unfortunately, so is the price.  Here's a nice article I found on the details of each type of RAM:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.gen-x-pc.com/sdram_ddr_ram_rambus_dram.htm">www.gen-x-pc.com/sdram_dd...s_dram.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
BTW, you mentioned things take forever to save.  What speed is your hard drive?  If it's 5400RPM you'll wanna get a drive with an RPM of 7200, or if you're willing to spend more, you can even get 10,000 and 15,000RPM SCSI drives.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukoji150.showPublicProfile?language=EN>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/3/02 8:28:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/udchoi01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dchoi01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PK Dreamweaver</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/3/02 9:07:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11254.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Computer Advice</span><hr size=1> AMD is mostly for games<br>

<br>
Abit VP-6 Dual PIII Motherboard-with onboard RAID controller ($150-$175/2x PIII 1.2ghz ($102-$125 cpu/512 pc133 sdram($30-$50). overall, i'd say max u'd pay for, with dual PIII 1.2ghz systema and 2gigs memory, it would cost you $625, though it really shouldn't cost you more than $530 total. (use pricewatch.com for processor and memory..i use them and haven't had any problems yet)<br>
<br>
as semi-mentioned before, hard drive speed will probably end up being the main cause of any system bottleneck you'll run into, regardless of what proc/memory you upgrade to. (which, currently it sounds like just about anything would be good for you). with RAID(redundant array of inline disks), it easily improved my friend's computer (PIII overclocked to about 630ishmhz with 192mb memory) overall performance/load times by at least 20%. IDE RAID 0 arrays are faster than some scsi speeds. only thing though, is that for a raid config, you'd need 2 hard drives of the same size and same RPM's.<br>
the other main reason why i'd suggest this, is because with, but well worth it imo. both painter and photoshop, its less system memory speed/amount of memory that you would have to worry about, but hard drive and processor speed. since i'm guessing you're working with pretty big files (larger than 500mb). when you run out of system memory/resources, photshop uses scratch space (virtual memory) which is allocated free hard drive space (much like an operating system's swap memory which does the same thing) that is used as virtual memory. this is where people run into the biggest problem...when ps starts using this scratch space, and if the hard drive/s are slow, photoshop slows down, regardless of the processor/memory installed.<br>
RAID=problem solved.<br>
<br>
overall, for price and performance, i think this would be the best option for you. email me if you have questions ;D <p>( ))__crayola__))> -------------...the genesis of all great modern artists.---------</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucaptainmeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captain Meth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Violent Femme</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/4/02 7:02:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11254.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.methart.com/t_meth1.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Computer Advice</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the tips FPG.  Well, I'm very unfamiliar with this whole RAID thing, and I wouldn't know the first thing about installing it all and getting it all configured.  I don't think that my roommate is very familiar with them either.<br>
<br>
I'm not working with files that are over 500mb in size.  Usually the pages I colour in Photoshop at 300dpi are about 50mb in size, and I've been able to go to the bathroom and come back and it's only just finishing up saving the file.  I know that it's a memory/processor problem because I've been using painter, and if I work on a file over 10 MB the brush strokes lag, and I have to wait a few extra minutes for the paint to just slowly animate back and forth over the canvas.<br>
<br>
I'll probably e-mail you thought and pick your brain with some questions regarding this stuff as I'd like to have an editing system one day, and I'll need something super specialized at that point. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

After its opened its nearly 100% ram based when it comes to speed. Saving is probably processor speed based but that should be your least concern, your biggest should be actually working in the program without experiencing lag.<br>
<br>
You can have a 5ghz Penitum 5 and it wont help at all unless you have enough ram to store the information of a long brush stroke. If you want lag free Photoshop no matter what brush or how many layers it has then get around a gig of ram. Your goal is to have enough ram so you will never have to use the scratch disk. I have 512 and only experience a little slow down on brushes that are bigger than 600, before I only had 256mbs and couldnt use a brush over 300 without waiting an hour for a brush stroke to register.<br>
<br>
Profesionals have been lag free with photoshop on gigantic files for years, processor speeds were terrible back then also, they just used lots of ram since that has always been available. <p><a href="http://www.newelysium.com"><img src="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/banner.gif" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ushousetsu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shousetsu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newelysium.com/forum/psicon.gif" BORDER=0> at: 10/4/02 12:23:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukoji150.showPublicProfile?language=EN>koji150</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.koji150.8m.com/koji.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/4/02 5:38:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11254.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Re: Computer Advice</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and DDR Ram is supposed to be 3 times better than SD Ram, no?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
