They kept a journal of their interactions with their contacts, friends and others, and encoded it to prevent its misuse if captured. Their plan was simply to leave the main group and set off on their own. They made no mention of this to the others.<br>
<br>
They understood the risks that they were taking if they left the city without the expressed permission of the king and they made sure that none of their contacts knew too much of their travel plans. My father continued to stock provisions and my mother prepared special clothing and travel gear to insure that we were protected from the elements. For they planned to travel during the worst of circumstances to prevent trackers or bandits from trailing them. <br>
<br>
Through several contacts my fathered had developed a business relationship with a gnome tinker, named Rylin Coil that frequented the shops of South Kaladim. Providing gems and ore at a much-reduced price and plying him with food and spirits. My mother introduced him to a friend of hers that had a particular interest in gnomes and the two quickly developed a relationship that was mutually satisfying and financially rewarding for her. Once my father had the gnome's trust he made known his plans in general and bade him to be silent. If Rylin would help him, my father would reward him with the location of a cache of gems and ore that would keep Rylin for years.<br>
<br>
At some point during my father’s preparations the king’s informants came forward with word of the queen’s deception and my mother and father’s plans to leave with the pioneers. Through his connections the king sent word to a group of bandits outside of Kaladim that their services would soon be needed. As the day for their departure drew nearer, my parents became more apprehensive. My father taught my mother how to use a pick as a weapon, at which she became very adept. My mother, in turn, taught my father how to manufacture armor using hard but useless crystals sewn into the fabric as protection. They managed to collect skunk pelts in order to keep the trackers of their trail. The preparations were long and arduous with main a sleepless night spent at it. <br>
<br>
As their preparations move forward so did the kings. He contracted with the Dunfire clan, through a second person, to track the adventurers and dispose of his former concubine and her husband at the most opportune time. As he put it, “Be sure to let them know who orders their demise”. At the same time, the king planned his revenge upon his first wife the queen. He was tired of her meddling in his affairs and he sought to increase his holdings by marrying the daughter of a very wealthy merchant.<br>
<br>
The day came for their departure and my mother and father completed their tasks just in time. They disguised themselves as the pioneers that they would travel with and made no attempt to contact their friends for their farewells.  The group gathered at the front gate of the city to be blessed by the local clergy and cheered on by the local constabulary. The trumpets blared and the drums pounded out a beat that even the most melancholy of the city would find joy with and join in step. The crowd moved out of the city gates and made their way towards the port city. The well-wishers escorted the group to the first outpost, bade their final farewell and turn back to the city.<br>
<br>
 As the adventurers continued silent, stealthy figures travel the shadows along the same route. Occasionally creatures of the wilds would come in contact with the group but were quickly dispatched and their pelts put to good use. The local goblin tribe’s drums could be heard beating in the distance, but none were seen along the route.  Musicians and bards would break into song along the way to keep up the spirits of the travelers. Since several families had smaller children and their pack animals were somewhat overloaded, several respites where taken and soon night fell and camp was setup. Precautions were taken to prevent intrusion by animals and goblins, sentries posted and fires well maintained. All the time, eyes watched from the darkest shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile back in Kaladim, the king paced his chambers, awaiting news as to whether or not his plans had been carried out. He had thoroughly thought out his response to the masses when they sought answers and demand retribution for the heinous crime that was to soon be committed. He would declare war on the locale goblin camps and have a small, inexpensive monument erected on the site of the massacre. He was prepared to play the part of the grieving monarch and he laughed to himself how easily his locale constituency would be persuaded to believe the lies that would be perpetrated that day.<br>
<br>
At the camp the adventurers were celebrating their fist night into the wilderness, singing songs, dancing and filling their bellies full of ale. My father and mother hung back from the partying crowd and awaited the moment when they could steal away into the night. As the evening worn on more and more individuals succumbed to the alcohol and feasting. Sometime the next morning before the sun rose my parents made their way past the guards, who were also sleeping off a good drunk, through a hole in the barricade my father had made during the party, into the wilderness. <br>
<br>
As they slipped out of camp my father heard the noise of several pairs of booted feet creeping toward the camp. He hid my mother and me in the reed beds of a small stream and crept forward to investigate. As he drew nearer the camp a cry rang out and he saw several guards struck down by arrows then witnessed a volley of fired spears sail over the barricade into the camp, firing tents as they fell. My father’s presence did not go un-noticed and a figure crept from the shadows from behind him. The father was unaware of his assailant until a lifeless figure dropped next to him with an arrow protruding from its back. My mother settled back into the reeds and refitted her bow with another arrow.<br>
<br>
The camp became a frenzy of fighting. Women and children screaming in horror, men yelling the battle cry as they cut through their foe’s or the scream of a dying man as his life left him. But soon all the noise ceased, except for the occasional moan of a dying dwarf. Children could be heard as well crying over their mothers as they rocked back and forth in a emotional stupor. These too cease as they were spirited away from the camp by the assailants.<br>
<br>
My father glared in hatred as he watched the camp continue to burn, swearing vengeance by all the gods. He crept over to the still corpse of his assailant to insure that it was dead. Upon first glance he saw the figure of a goblin, however on further inspection he noticed how strange the face looked and when he touched it the face fell off. In doing so it uncovered the face of a dwarf. And upon that dwarf the distinct markings of the Dunfire clan lay upon its chest.” Why would a Dunfire dwarf bother striking against such a unrewarding target?”, was his first thought. He continued to ponder upon the night’s tragic events as he gather my mother and myself and their goods and continued upon their journey.<br>
