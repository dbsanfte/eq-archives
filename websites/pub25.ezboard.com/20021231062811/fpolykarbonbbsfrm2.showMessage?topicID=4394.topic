<br>
Well I have a ton of questions about everything. I'd like many point of view.<br>
<br>
1. Adobe Streamline is really tough to use. Does anyone have any tips and how important is Streamline in the profesional world.<br>
<br>
2. What exactly is the point of Adobe illustrator? And are there any good sites to help with Illustrator?<br>
<br>
3. What is a &quot;tablet&quot;?<br>
<br>
4. When &quot;cleaning&quot; your line art in Photoshop, Paintshop pro, etc... Is it best to use the &quot;Curves&quot; option or the &quot;Levels&quot; option. I have not noticed much difference between the two. Do they both serve the same purpose?<br>
<br>
5. What programs are used to create an Anime? <br>
<br>
6. What does CG art stand for?<br>
<br>
7. How important is it to have a up to date scanner?<br>
<br>
8. Is there any &quot;best&quot; way to ink a drawing? I've noticed in basic animes they dont use really use a certain style... they just go over the lines. Is that wrong?<br>
<br>
9. What anime artist job does not require you to work for microsoft or move to Japan?<br>
<br>
Well, Thats all I have right now... But I know I had so much more to ask. I think I'll stop here for now. Thanks in advance! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uretrotorque.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RetroTorque</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/24/02 9:03:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/solidnate/sig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> 1. I don't use streamline.<br>
<br>
2. Illustrator is a vector program usually used to make and print logos and graphics at any resolution. It's also used as a lettering program. Some people, including me, use it as a drawing program too. Type in Illustrator Tutorials in google and all sorts of sites about Illustrator will come up. I find that the users manual is the more helpful than any site. There is also the Illustrator 10 Wow book you can find at Borders or Barnes and Noble.<br>
<br>
3. A tablet is kinda like using a pen on paper as a mouse that's aslo pressure sensitive. That's my best explaination for it. I got mine from the good folks here <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.wacom.com">www.wacom.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Check out the site and maybe seeing them will explain what a tablet is better than I can.<br>
<br>
4. They both do the same thing. Just pick which ever you like more.<br>
<br>
5. Likely the same stuff we Yanks use to make comics. Illustrator, Photoshop, Painter, FreeHand... Any decent graphics software should do. If you mean Anime as in animation I can't help you. I don't know a whole lot about professional animation. They propably use Adobe premire as part of the process though.<br>
<br>
6. CG usually means computer generated. Here are the board it usually means computer colored. I.E. &quot;anyone want to cg this&quot; means &quot;does anyone want to color this in photoshop/painter/etc..&quot;<br>
<br>
7. As long as it scans decently you don't need to upgrade to a new one. <br>
<br>
8. There's no wrong way to ink. Do what you like best. Dead lines are probably used more in animation/anime because they're easier to do and save time. <br>
<br>
9. I don't know. But there are animation studios here and in other countries too. It may not be japanese anime style but to me animation is animation.  <p>Be well, do good work, and keep in touch. -Writer's Almanac NPR</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucaptainmeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captain Meth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Violent Femme</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/24/02 9:09:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.methart.com/t_meth1.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> Uh, let's see...  where to start...<br>
<br>
1)  *shrugs*  I don't even know how to use it properly yet.<br>
<br>
2) Illustrator uses vectors.  Uh...  it's used to make logos, and images slicker than ice.<br>
<br>
3) Device you hook up to a computer to draw on...  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wacom.com">www.wacom.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
4) I use Curves because I find I have greater control over cleaning the line art.<br>
<br>
5) To create an anime?  None.  Each frame is drawn by hand, then it's inked, and painted on a piece of plastic.  Each frame is then photographed on 35mm.<br>
<br>
6) Computer Generated<br>
<br>
7) Anything purchased within the past year or two should be fine.  It's not really necessary to update your scanner unless your current scanner breaks, or unless you want a professional one that's capable of higher dpi and has a bigger surface area.<br>
<br>
8 )  Anime isn't really inked, persay.  Everything has close to the same line weight.  They just use colours and shading.  You could say the inks in an anime are merely to hold the colours together.  But where a drawing is concerned, the old fashioned way works best, but a lot are getting into digital inking.<br>
<br>
9) I think you might be slightly confused about the term anime.  Anime (for the most part) refers to any ordinary animation, but the term 'anime' usually refers to Japanese animation.  If you want to be an anime artist, then you want to be an animator.  As well, I'm pretty sure that Microsoft has never made an anime.  I'm about 99.9% sure on this, but maybe we should ask Pat.  :P  I think what you want to be is more like a conceptual artist, meaning that you design stuff (locations, characters, vehicles, weapons, etc...)<br>
<br>
Hope some of that junk helped, and let us know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  exactly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> what it is that you want to do.  I'm all confused now. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

sorry Captain Meth but they do not use 35mm because they will get grain the film they mosly use is specal film called tech pan 6 times 6 that is negtive is 6 inchs by 6 inchs.And most anme now days are not as much hand drawn like the old stuff look at ghost in shell its has CG most of it now days is done on compter and colour like prtty much how you do it and then they are out put on onto cd like dvd but alot better most films going digal like star wars attack of clones was fully digal filming not negtive or help on digs hards   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucaptainmeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captain Meth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Violent Femme</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/25/02 8:53:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.methart.com/t_meth1.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> A piece of negative that is 6 by 6 inches?  Well, that seems unlikely to me because of the cost alone just for the film stock.  And you don't get grain with all types of 35mm film.  You get grain if you're trying to shoot in poorly lit conditions and you have to open the iris all the way, and if they're using a good slow speed film, there shouldn't be a problem. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

<br>
1. What jobs could a anime artist (Japanese style) go into?<br>
<br>
2. How important are tablets to a artist? Are they more important to a graphics designer?

I have never in my life heard of something like that!!! Do you know how detailed you'd need your drawings and BGs to be if you worked that big? And do you know how much it would COST??? (because film cost a LOT! for a 2 mins movie on a 35mm it's 3000$ So imagine with a film that big...)<br>
<br>
The biggest I have heard that was used for animation was 70mm... That's IMAX format. (for The Old Man and the Sea by Petrov and Sleeping Beauty was done in that format too) Why use a 6 inches film if you don't have a screen bigger than the normal size screen we have in our movie theaters anyway??<br>
<br>
And square format film is not very standard. It would be difficult to compress may it be for TV screen or movie screen format.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's not true, but if it is, I want to read about it. Do you have a link somewhere?? I'd be very interested.<br>
<br>

1. Well do be honest, there is barelly any work over here for that kind of style... Especially for animators. If you want to do that you'll have to move to Japan. You might want to do comics, that's all I can see.<br>
<br>
2. I think that until you used one, even if we explain it, it wouldn't say much to you. A tablet is like a mouse, but add pressure sensitivity. You can work without it, but honestly it just makes it easier. I use it to draw, to animate and just like a mouse too. ^______^! <p><a href="http://www.moonlight-whispers.com"><img src="http://www.moonlight-whispers.com/image/banners/moonlight02.jpg" border=0></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ueaglemaina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EagleMaina</A> at: 9/25/02 10:17:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=inkspot>inkspot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.webspawner.com/users/lowbca/Inkspot.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/26/02 7:48:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/lowbca/Inkspot.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> i get you link to it i read it in magazine called Cinerma tech its usa Mag so if you get july it has huge write up on anmie and 6by 6 inch negtives they use  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ubrolly71a.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brolly71a</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/26/02 10:21:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> Isn't it posible for an american to start a company like &quot;Gainax&quot; over here in the states? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uironjackal64.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ironjackal64</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=ff00ff>S</font><font color=ff00cc>&</font><font color=ff0099>M</font> <font color=ff0066>Q</font><font color=ff0033>u</font><font color=ff0000>e</font><font color=ff3300>e</font><font color=ff6600>n</font></span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/26/02 10:58:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4394.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://liquid2k.com/oolong/insanesquirrel.gif height=186 width=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dictionary of questions</span><hr size=1> Meth: Anime hasn't been done on cells since Love Hina or so.

Old skool anime then.  <br>
<br>
And Ink, I can almost gurantee you that they are not using a 6x6 inch film negative, this is why...  As Maina already said, the costs would be astonomical.  It would probably cost at least $5/frame i'm going to estimate because it would be a specialty negative that is not widely in use.  Also, I've never even heard of a negative that high before.  35mm is the most common, and then it gets up to 72mm (i think that's the exact size) and that's the IMAX film size.  After that, any larger negative would be used strictly for still photography.  Also...  there's a resolution isses.  Although 72mm would technically be better resolution than 35mm, it's very rarely used because the only projectors capable of that size of film are in IMAX theatres.  35mm is the standard, and you don't need to get any bigger than that.  HD is about about 35mm standards right now resolution wise.  There would be no need to use a negative larger than 35mm because it's not going to be shown on IMAX sized screens on a regular basis that would even generate enough profit to pay for the cost of making the movie.  At any rate, that's my side of the argument, and if you have the article, please do scan it and send it my way.  I'm intrigued. <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">

As RetroTorque has said, it's probably the same as any other animator, Japanese, American, anyone. If you pool some heavy research, you can find out the names of the programs. Though many use things such as Adobe Premier and suchlike, they also use programs that aren't typically for public retail, and aren't known of by the general public, or even the online art community.<br>
<br>
9. So far, anime-style drawing studios are located mostly in Asia. The bigger ones are located in both Japan and Korea, though the latter is showing up and being employed by Japanese companies more and more. I'm not aware of any anime-style studios in North America or Europe (since it's fairly new, and still being prodded and slowly gaining recognition that isn't related to Pokemon or whatever), and I doubt there will be any for a while.<br>
<br>
1a. Jobs you could take would be as an animator at a company, or strike off as a &quot;mangaka&quot; (manga author). However, it's getting difficult to get into that market, as it's growing very popular in Asia.<br>
<br>
If you want to be an animator, you'll have to be good at mimicking style that isn't yours, since that's the way to making consistancy, so it doesn't irritate the audience (consumers?). Digimon season two is an example of inconsistant animation.<br>
<br>
For mangadom, many started off with &quot;doujinshi&quot; (fan-made comics similar to fanfics in illustrated form that are self-published), and became rather popular and famous mangaka. I'm not sure on the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  exact</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> technicalities on making publishable manga, but it involves getting a publisher interested in your work (just like regular book authoring) and starting off by running in monthly manga serials (telephone-book sized collections of multiple mangas under the same publisher having new chapters [often singular] printed each month or so) like Shounen Jump or Hana to Yume.<br>
<br>
Publishing is always a problem when you're a mangaka (or going for one). Some publishers, if you decide to switch, will retain rights to your work, and hold back publication of the same title by threatening lawsuit and so forth. Minekura Kazaya, I believe, ran into this problem regarding her Saiyuuki Gaiden graphic novels. =/<br>
<br>
Other jobs you might take would be a video game character concept designer (a la Hyung Tae Kim; he chose this field because he thought the chances of making it in the manga field was getting too small) of sorts. That field is promising if you want a bit more control over what style you use.<br>
<br>
Last Question: It is possible for an American animation company akin to Gainax being created, but that won't happen unless you manage to have funds, much public interest with demand, and 20+ (or so) willing employees. The most tetchy thing would be public interest, since mainstream anime over here doesn't exactly have a good name with the older crowd. <p><center><hr width="50%"><br><br><IMG SRC="http://webpost.net/wi/withroo/harusig1.jpg" USEMAP="#harusig1.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=110 BORDER=0>

<br>
Umm... Just an FYI, Mic isn't the only company using Anime style graphics. In fact, They probably aren't the best bet, even IF Pat does work for them (which I can guess that could be part of your reason for mentioning Mic)<br>
<br>
Sony and Nintendo would also probably be safe bets, if you want to get into games, though with N you may find it harder to get a job in the US (though maybe not).<br>
<br>
Sure, I may not have been helpful, and probably wasn't, I just hate generalizations, especially concerning Microsoft. <p><font size="1">
