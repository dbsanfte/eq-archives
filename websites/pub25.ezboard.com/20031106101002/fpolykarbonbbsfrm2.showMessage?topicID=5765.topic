I was browsing thru some websites and it seems most manga artists use Copic markers to colour their art. Copic markers are hella expensive and I need to import them if I want to use them so i'm not gonna bother. Are there other brands of markers that some of you guys use? I did a few searches and it actually does seem the copic ones are the best?<br>
<br>
What about using pencils? I am not a big fan of pencils to colour things in, but I have seen some impressive results from people using pencils to art with.<br>
<br>
Then comes paint... I have never painted art before, it doesn't look too difficult. But I have no idea where to start with paint. What paint should I use? Those in the little tubes(many colours)? Or the jars? <br>
And what would I use to paint on? I'm not sure if it's worth it to just paint on plain paper? <br>
<br>
These questions probably sound dumb... But I only started arting resently and have only used PC to colour, and even though the results have been very nice, people seem more impressed with hand coloured stuff (Even though pc colouring is just as involved)<br>
<br>

In the stores, they're a little more expensive than the copic ones (8.95 compared to 6.95 Australian$). I think they have the advantage myself as they have 3 nibs (including one for detailing small areas) and the copic only has two.<br>
<br>
The main advantage of markers is that you can finish a picture very quickly. The bad news is you have to learn to colour really fast otherwise you get blotches. The trick is to go over a just coloured area with a darker colour while the original area is still wet to create shadows. There's a how to draw manga book entirely on how to use markers, it's a good starting point. It's also a wise idea to use marker paper, as with normal paper the ink seems to spread or bleed into areas. <br>
<br>
Pencils are good. There are plenty of resources around the net that explain how to use them well. Building up tone subtly is usually the way to go i've found. It takes a long time to fill in large areas compared to makers though, particularly if you want it to look good. <br>
<br>
If you're interested in painting, i suggest you start with either watercolour or goauche. Goauche can be watered down and used like transparent watercolour so you get the best of both worlds if you buy those. I find acrylics a little harder to use than either of those, so i'd suggest you start with either of those. Tubes are probably the best way to start, as you can just buy small ones of the colours you want. Otherwise if you find you don't like painting you'll have large jars you won't use. <br>
<br>
As for painting on plain paper, i really suggest you don't if you can help it. While you can do it (i started out using it), smooth watercolour paper with 300gsm is a lot easier. Medium (obviously not rough or smooth) is good as well. If you absolutely must use plain paper, don't use the sort of paper you would put in a printer. Buy slightly thicker plain paper, like the sort that comes in skethbooks. <br>
<br>
The downside to painting is that it costs a little more than the other mediums mentioned before. I suggest if you can afford it a small square ended bround, a round ended brush and a large round brush. It's handy to have. Most painters don't just use the one brush. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

<br>
<br>
many manga artist use acrylic based paints to color their pages or front page , also its easy to cover each paint and blend them, you dont even have to use water .<br>
<br>
<br>
now water colors are EXTREMLY HARD !!!! <br>
even artists who specilise at watercoloring say its hard to learn and do.<br>
<br>
pencils are good especilly watercolor pencils, but some scanners will totally kill pencil colors so beware that..<br>
<br>
you can always get  painter (( burn it from a friend or save up the cash for it !!! ))<br>
<br>
wich can mimic acrylcs , pencils, and water colors not to mention oil colors PERFECTLY !!!!!<br>
<br>
at school we hung an painter pic (( acrylic like )) next to a real acrylic panting....<br>
<br>
walked back........<br>
<br>
and those who looked at it couldn see that one was a printout unless they walked up and touched it !!!! <br>
<br>
painter i have to say is the cheapest even thou it costs alot at once...<br>
<br>
while watercolors, oils, acrylics and the paper wich you should use for it can easily build up a very big pile of cash over time.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=linglingbolt>linglingbolt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://liquid2k.com/lingbolt/spidey10x10.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/20/03 2:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5765.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blindcrocodile.net/banners/willowhead60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I personally find watercolours a lot easier than markers.  Unless you're using marker paper they're quite hard to blend.<br>
<br>
Painter 8 is more expensive than most single other media at about $300 US.  Add to that the cost of a Intuos 6x8&quot; tablet ($350 US) (probably the best size if you're serious) and specialty pens, and it's not cheap.  If you're getting a Graphire that's bundled with Painter Classic, it's not so bad at about $100--but unfortunately no layers, so you can only use the watercolour tool to colour drawings.<br>
<br>
You can get a complete set of high-quality brushes and watercolour paints for about $50.  Watercolour does require special paper though.  There are special liquids you can use instead of water with them (such as &quot;granulation medium) to get different textures.  One nice thing about watercolour is instruction books are readily available and it's easy to get neat effects.<br>
<br>
Many manga artists use watercolour drawing inks rather than markers.  They require heavier paper than just drawing, but not as heavy as watercolour paints.  They can be used with pens and brushes.  Not as easy to blend as paints, because once they're dry, they're dry.  (Watercolour paints can be re-wet.)<br>
<br>
Pencil colours can get good results, but again it's a matter of practice.  Laurentien and Prismacolour are nice brands.   <p>-----------------<br>

<br>
Then you obviously aren't using the markers correctly. The idea of them is that they are the basis, then you use other media like pencil to build up over them. You're not supposed to make a squillion layers, which is why you would be getting those dark spots. <br>
<br>
Same goes with coloured pencil. It is possible to use them so they don't leave a gap. The thing with media is that you have to spend a long time learning the perks of each.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub84.ezboard.com/bprojectk"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.tpg.com.au/adslvba8/sig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirgreensock>Sir GreenSock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(9/23/03 5:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5765.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/sirgreensock/enazni3.jpg height=115 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I agree, <br>
All mediums have their advantages if you learn to use them properly.<br>
I can't use watercolours to save my life, but I can control acrycics pretty well. You just need to experiment and practice to see what suits you.<br>
Pencil crayons aren't that difficult to master imho, all you need is a bit of practice. You will never get white splotches if you use them right, the best idea is to use more than one colour, and overlap them to create a nice richness.<br>
As for markers, i use the Prismacolours, which are probably the cheapest art quality markers. I prefer using them on watercolour or normal printing paper, as the bleeding can create a nice effect, and help blend the shades. If you're going for flat colour with markers, use marker paper. Also i agree with Mister Kyo, it would be a good idea to mix markers with other media, since it doesn't build up too well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=5765.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=5765.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5765.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=5765.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.threadControl?topicID=5765.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5765.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5765.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm2>Photoshop and Art questions</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246h<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
