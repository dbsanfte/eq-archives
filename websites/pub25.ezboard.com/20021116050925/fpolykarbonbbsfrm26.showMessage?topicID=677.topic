This is my first post on the PK Forums, but I've lurked the site for who knows how long.  I noticed this particular forum dealing with authors, so...I decided to check it out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
This short is part of a PbP (Play-by-Post) I'm participating in, but I thought it might be something cool to maybe expand on by writing a story involving the character I am playing...here is his introduction, and it was my first post in the PbP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What can I do you for?&quot;<br>
<br>
Like being slapped, Piter turned bright red at the comment from the serving girl, who was smiling down at him with her dark brown eyes and even darker brown hair. &quot;O-oh, I'll just have some ale, thank you,&quot; he quickly said, trying to hide his flush. Pulling up the collar of his weathered leather longcoat and coughing into his hand, he looked away from the girl. She seemed to have taken it the wrong way, thinking he had no desire to be seen (or to see her), and turned away with a furious swirl of her dress.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  It's not my fault she doesn't speak properly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought wryly. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krite's Blood, she prob'ly did it on purpose, hoping for a better tip. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Adjusting his posture on the fixed bench in a booth at the back of the Kraken's Wench, Piter moved his gaze over the main portion of the tavern. Squinting, he again took in all the details of the Wench. The establishment was of average size, with nine tables and four booths on the back wall. Looking at the ceiling, Piter wondered when the roof would come crashing down; the four support columns situated evenly throughout the main room were clearly in need of bracing, and possibly even replacing.<br>
<br>
The Wench was a crowded dive, clearly seeking the business of sailors, wanderers, and smugglers--who are usually one of the former two. The smell was one of spilled alcohol and urine--though, after awhile, the two melded into one smell that Piter hoped did not stick to his clothes. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Muh...maybe I'll get to change before I hit the dance bars</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought while shaking some dirt off of the bottom of his leather longcoat and wiping it off of his black riding boots. And maybe he wouldn't. It would not be the first time he went to socialize with women while still dirty from a hard day's ride...<br>
<br>
Piter shook his head, running his hand through his raven hair to straighten it back, and fixed his stare back on the parchment in front of him, attempting to get his mind back on the matter at hand. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  She did have a nice figure</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he mused with a impish grin. Shaking his head once again, he cautiously went back to writing, wanting to finish this portion of his trip with haste.<br>
<br>
&quot;...but I still have not received word from our contact, and I am wondering about her well-being. This is most disturbing, because for now I must consider continuing without her part of the quest,&quot; he read to himself, cringing at the latter portion. He remembered the last time he had to go about a mission without a full inventory, and that is why he wears leather armor instead of his regular attire of scale. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Well, hopefully this time I won't have to be on a bloody ship</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he said with a slight shiver. Knowing his luck, that shiver did not bode well. He loathed ships, he loathed water, and he loathed sailors--which, he realized, is why he was sent here. The Council has an odd sense of humor, which he surmised was better than none.<br>
<br>
&quot;...I will leave within three day's time if I do not hear from Jachista--or find evidence of her passing. If the latter, I will perform our last ritual, or attempt to send the remains back so she might receive a proper, prompt and complete burial; our Laskers deserve no less.&quot; Signing with a flourish, he rolled the message carefully, making sure he did not smudge his message and put himself even further in the Council's bad graces. Sarcastically: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  That would just make this a lovely mission, wouldn't it? That, and it would ruin such a lovely piece of handiwork. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Piter fidgeted with the pendant hanging around his neck, thinking one last time on what he had just written. Finally coming to a conclusion, he removed the pendant from around his neck and reached for the booth's candle. Grasping the pendant, he placed it in the candle's flame, letting it heat up until he determined it could melt the wax that was to be used on messages directed to the Council. Holding the pendant in a gloved hand, he produced the wax piece and placed the pendant face down into it before placing it on the parchment to be sealed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you what you could do me for, wench!&quot;<br>
<br>
A crash joined the remark as Piter turned to grasp the situation that was unfolding. A burly sailor, clad in a sweat-stained and sleeveless shirt (though the exposed arms had markings on them), had the serving girl by her arm and was preparing to get to know her better. It seemed he had some grasp of the land's language and had caught the serving girl's remark, deciding to go with it. <br>
<br>
Noticing the turn of the sailor's action, Piter slid to the end of the booth's bench. Right hand over his left hip, he turned slightly and flung his arm out, extending his arach whip. <br>
<br>
Watching it fly behind another large patron, the whip lashed squarely on the sailor's back, breaking the skin like a hot knife through butter. Retrieving the whip as quickly as it had left his side, Piter turned back to his parchment and swung the pendant around his fingers, watching what the sailor would do next.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  What the hell was I just thinking? I'm going to get myself killed! Krite, the sailor behind him is prob'ly from his own shi--</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Before the thought could finish in his mind, the offending sailor let the girl go and turned towards the table directly behind him. Jaw almost hanging to his chest and his exposed flesh clearly turning red, the sailor grabbed the other sailor. &quot;Sod off, Yuslin. I dun' need to deal with you off'da Lady, too,&quot; he said with a cuff to the man's head. <br>
<br>
The girl, who was facing Piter's way when he lashed out, was looking directly at Piter, mouth gaping. Piter flicked the pendant quickly around his right hand and waved at her, mumbling to himself, &quot;Oh <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Krite!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> You've done it now, Piter. Now they're going to kill <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  each other</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot; He placed both hands on his forehead and leaned heavily on the table. &quot;I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  hate</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the sway of females. The Creator has a cruel sense of humor, too,&quot; he said while shaking his head and chuckling to himself.<br>
<br>
Seemingly clueless of the whip attack, Yuslin was aware that he was just struck by his shipmate. Yaslin stood up, which allowed Piter to get a better look at the new sailor: He, too, had markings on a good amount of his exposed flesh, and a few lumps and bruises which only seemed to highlight his platinum hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sod off, eh? Why dun't you come 'ere and show me wha' you'll do when I tell you that you can stick in yer arse, Clyse,&quot; he said while smashing his cup of ale on the side of the table, brandishing the remaining handle as a crude knuckle-cap.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Well, I might as well try and fix this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought while sliding the pendant back around his neck and placing the wax back in his belt pouch. Walking out of the booth and into the tavern's main room, Piter tried to appear bigger than his five feet, ten inches. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gentlemen, please. I am quite sure your Captain would not want you two being picked up by the local Militia, eh? And I'm quite sure neither of you would want to be thrown into jail without even finishing off your first pitchers of ale.&quot; Piter leaned onto a support column that had a portrait of a woman hanging from it, which was about seven feet back and slightly to the left of the two sailors--who were watching him like he was a demon who just walked in on a Greenery's ceremony. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Great...maybe it will only come to words between us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought sarcastically while running a hand through his raven hair. Worse always seemed to come to worse for Piter, and he did not feel prepared for it this night--Clyse and Yuslin were now coming his way. <br>
