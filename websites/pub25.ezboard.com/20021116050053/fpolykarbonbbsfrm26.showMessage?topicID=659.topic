<br>
Saladin Gallows (Sal for short) was brought up in a poor, but intelligent, house. He had the blackest of fur that gave a brillant blue sheen. His eyes were a merry grey with gold flecks in them. He was the one that parents of daughters would like them to marry. So to put it blunty, he was a handsome Mishaar!  His parents were merchants who had no problem selling there abundant stock of ales and wines. It was keeping the money that was the hard part! The Gallows, known as the best brewers in the village, could be one of the richest family's in the village. But they're plagued by the Gallows Curse. The tendecy to waste money on outlandish bets. It's a habit that goes back quite a ways. So they don't even fight it any more. They just throw their money on the table, and wish for the best. Which never turns out to be the best at all!<br>
<br>
And besides having the Gallows curse, Saladin also had the &quot;intelligence curse&quot;. He called it that because his speech was much different then the native Misharr toungue. Instead of rolling his r's and hissing alot, he spoke more refined and hissed very little. Because of this he was ridiculed by both peers and elders alike. So he purposely rolls his r's and hisses. And he ends up sounding like an &quot;out-of-towner&quot; trying to fit in with the natives. Not to mention he spits alot.<br>
<br>
When Saladin reaches the tender age of 12, the Gallows Curse takes no time claiming him. He makes the most outrageous bets. Bets like who can run headfirst into a wall the hardest. One such bet (who can keep there tail in a fire the longest) cost him his tail! It was so burnt, it fell right off! He won the bet by the way! <br>
<br>
Now Saladin is poor, &quot;dumb&quot;, and has no tail. Not a winning combination. The local villagers waste no time in letting the Gallow family know it. They call him half breed, meaning he's only half Misharr. Saladin hates bringing all of this negative attention on his family, he has to stop it. So he runs away. <br>
<br>
He decides to go to the Koresh Kingdom. There he hoped to learn sorcery. Now Saladin was told that magic was an evil and dangerous thing. But he figured that only evil people abuse the power and thus, they do evil things. Saladin only wanted to help people. He aslo wanted to grow back his tail, which was the seed of all this. After about a weak of stumbling lost in the forest, Saladin comes across a portly dwarf who was christened Moente'. Mo for short. He was a squat elf with crimson skin and a turned up nose. His ears were large, large even for a dwarf. Both ears held a gold earring that weighted down his ears.  Mo was busy hunting in the forest and almost shot Saladin! Saladin yelled, &quot;aahhhh don't shoot!&quot;<br>
<br>
After eyeing the foreign beast for a while he said ,&quot;A Misharr heh what ye doing all the way out 'ere?&quot;, Mo asked looking skeptical, &quot; And where's ye tail?&quot; he chuckled heartily.<br>
<br>
Many hours later after Saladin finished his tale. Mo says, &quot;Aye, ye got yourself in a predicament all right. Come to my place, we'll have some grub and set out for the next town in the morning&quot;.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Mo and Saladin set out to the kingdom of Korresh. They had to trek through the grasslands and forest of the countryside. But they didn't seem to mind. To pass the time, Saladin asked of Mo's family.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Mo, what brings you to these parts&quot;, asked Saladin, &quot;where's your family?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mo answered blunty, &quot;Don't ave' any family&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh c'mon now, everyone has family&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not me&quot;.<br>
<br>
Saladin decided to leave it at that because Mo was obviously in a state of longing. He thought he even saw a fat tear escape his eye. Instead of pestering Mo, Saladin occupied himself with the sights. He had never seen trees this big in his home village of Druaknite in the kingdom of Garr. And there were also a variety of plants and animals in the village. They walked steadily on for the whole day. Not once stopping for a break. When the sun had set and was well below the trees, Mo stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to rest matey, we'll pick it up in the morning&quot;.<br>
<br>
And so they did. It went on like this for four and a half days. On the fourth day, Saladin excitedly pointed out colored flags on the horizon. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is that the place Mo?&quot; questioned Saladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Sal me matey, that be the place alright&quot;, said Mo as a slight smile crept upon his face&quot;. <br>
<br>
They hurridely rushed to the village surrouning the castle and tried to locate an inn. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow&quot;, says Saladin, &quot;It's so. Big!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Relax. Try not to look like you've never seen alot of people before&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm trying. There's just so many of em! Wahh!!! what's that?&quot; Said Saladin pointing to a goblin.<br>
<br>
The goblin looked there way. &quot;Got something to say punk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry sir&quot;, said Mo, &quot;Don't mind him. He be nothing but a small town kid&quot;<br>
<br>
The goblin poked Saladin in the chest. &quot;Watch it next time kid, or i'll have ye hide fer brekfist!&quot;<br>
<br>
As the goblin trotted off Mo muttered softly, &quot;Way to go, we've not been in town two whole minutes and already you're stirrin' up trouble. Ye better watch it kid!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Mo&quot;, Saladin started, &quot;I was-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HALT!!&quot; cried a strong voice.<br>
<br>
Mo and Saladin froze<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do you think you two are going?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not realizing it, Mo and Saladin started to wonder into a big colorful building.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry&quot;, said Saladin. &quot;We were searching for a place where I could learn the skill of magic&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mo tried to shut him up, but he was too late. Saladin had already uttered the &quot;M&quot; word, Magic. But to his surprise, THe man didn't seem the slighest bit angry. Instead, he looked excited?<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh!&quot; Exclaimed the man. &quot;Apprentices! Right this way sirs!&quot;<br>
<br>
The man started to walk towards the castle. Mo and Saladin looked at each other and shrugged. They had no choice but to follow him.<br>
<br>
<br>
---------------------------END CHAPTER 1-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 2<br>
<br>
The man chatted excitedly as he led them through the halls. &quot;This is very exciting for us. It isn't everyday we get apprentices. And especially for magic! In many places that's considered a dark art!<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Saladin sarcastically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes indeed. People don't like the thought of othes being able to manipulate things. Quite frankly I don't like it either. But magic can be used for good too&quot;, stated the man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea that's why i want to learn it&quot;, explained Saladin. &quot;To help people&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;What about your tail?, asked Mo mischeviously.<br>
<br>
Saladin looked at Mo sheepishly, &quot;Well that too&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we going anyway?&quot; asked Mo. <br>
<br>
&quot;To your new teacher, Sampetra M. Breeze&quot;, answered the man briskly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can she fix my tail?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh I wouldn't know about that, you'll just have to ask her when we get there&quot;.<br>
<br>
As they walked along the winding corridors, Saladin couldn't help but stare at the massive tapestries that hung on the walls. There were pictures of men wearing armor and striking daring poses. And others sages sitting peacefully on a hilltop with dozens people surrounding them. They were pictures of heroes. Dozens of them lined the halls in honorable respect. &quot;My image will grace these halls someday&quot;, promised Saladin to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're heeeere!&quot; announced the man in excitement.<br>
<br>
They stood before a tall wooden double door that was nine feet tall. The door had carved in it a depiction of an ancient battle between all sorts of races. Commonly known as the Race Wars. With a light shove from the man, the double doors opened to reveal a library! But not just any library. THE library. Shelf upon shelf upon shelf upon shelf lined the huge room. and there were multiple floors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow&quot;, whispered Saladin and Mo in amazement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazing isn't it&quot;, said the man. &quot;It took centuries to gather all these record scrolls. This is the second biggest library in the country.<br>
<br>
In the back a chamber door could be heard opening.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, here she comes&quot;<br>
<br>
Saladin and Mo waited anxiously. But they didn't wait long. A women of unimaginable beauty walked in. She wore a dark, red, velvet tunic that went down to her shins. Her long black hair was tied behind her head with two carved sticks. Her skin was a milky white, but beautiful none the less. She formed her ruby red lips into a warm smile. &quot;Welcome Saladin Gallows and Moente', she said nodding to both of them. &quot;you may be seated&quot;. At the wave of her hands, two wooden chairs emerged in front of them. &quot;Thank you Humphrey&quot;, she said nodding to the person who led them here, &quot;that will be all. And with that, Humphrey strode out of the room. Obviously miffed at being excluded.<br>
<br>
&quot;just once I'd like to stay for a chance&quot;, muttered Humphrey down the hall. It's always Humphrey go fetch our visitors, nevermind that I may want a cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sampetra chuckled,&quot;That man doesn't realize how much I appreciate him. Anyway, on to more pressing bussiness. You both come to learn the skills of magic? Correct?<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot;, stated Saladin, &quot;just me&quot;.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Are you sure&quot;, asked Sampetra in a knowing tone.<br>
<br>
Saladin looked at Mo. &quot;You want to learn also?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, said Mo. &quot;I'd like to learn the properties of the elements and how to manipulate them&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then, you can certainly learn them under me. But all I ask is one thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;what's that!&quot;, asked Mo.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must be willing to learn the bad, along with the good. This will not be easy. I want students who are eager to learn and strive for perfection. Do you think you can do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, they both answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent. We start tommorow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Humphrey walked back in the room. &quot;Gentlemen, I shall escort you to your rooms&quot;.<br>
<br>
When they looked back at the spot that Sampetra last stood, there was nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I'll be a minotaurs rump. Where'd she go?&quot;, asked Mo?<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lady has a way of dissapearing on you sometimes&quot;, chuckled Humphrey,&quot;but you never know when she's watching you&quot;, he added with a more serious tone. <br>
<br>
Mo and Saladin looked at each other.<br>
<br>
They arrived at their rooms shortly thereafter, which turned out to be glamourous. It was a circular room with the huge  bed in the middle of the room. Along the stone walls (which were colored a festive orange) huge tapestries hung everywhere. Most of them showed images of the Race Wars.  There was a huge fire burning in the hearth and stew was cooking over it. The room was filled with the aroma of Chicken soup. On the bed were fresh clothes and towels. There was also a note.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dear Saladin, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Class begins at 9:00 AM sharp in the<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp library. Be prompt or don't bother<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp showing up!<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    -Sampetra<br>
<br>
Saladin chuckled and tossed the note aside. What he really wanted to do was tuck into the delicious soup he smelled cooking. He shoveled ladles full of soup into his bowl and sat at the circular table in the corner. Just as he as about to take a sip, there was a knock at his chamber door.<br>
<br>
Muttering to himself he shuffled briskly to the door, &quot;geez, i was just about to eat, why must they alway bother me at meal time? &quot;<br>
<br>
When Saladin opened the door, he was delighted to see Mo. Mo was already dressed in his fresh clothes that bore the Korresh seal of a knights sheild with a blue jewel embedded in it. Mo walked into his room and sat at the table with his own meal, which was quite different then his. Mo set a flagon of beer and a loaf of bread on the table. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Sal. There's something I need to talk to you about&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it Mo&quot;, said Saladin around mouthfulls of hot soup.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's the lady Sampetra. I get weird feelings from her&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean, she seemed okay to me. What kind of feelings?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mo took a long swig from his flagon before answering. &quot;Evil feelings&quot;.<br>
<br>
Saladin would've laughed if his mouth wasn't burning from the soup.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad feelings? What are you talking about. I think that beer is playing tricks on your mind&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mo chuckled. &quot;Could very well be Sal. Maybe all I need is a nap&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe&quot;, said Sal who wanted to be left alone so he can eat in peace.<br>
<br>
Mo roused himself, &quot;I'll see ye tommorow Sal&quot;. And with those final words. Mo left.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Sal arose at dawn. He put on his fresh garbs which were a little small, but would do. He wore a green vest with the Korresh Kingdom seal on the left breast, a white long sleeved shirt under that, and baggy white pants. After eating a light breakfast of bread, cheese, and wine. He set out for the library. When he arrived, he already saw Mo sitting at a long wooden table chatting with a human girl. Saladin also saw two others sitting at the table. One of them was the goblin that Sal insulted their first day in town.<br>
<br>
&quot;WOnderful&quot;, muttered Sal, &quot;an enemy in my class&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sal settled himself across from Mo and the girl. He sat there for several minutes listening to their conversation about sleeping spores before anyone noticed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! here you are! Janus, this is Saladin. The one I told you about. Sal, this is Janus!<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Janus&quot;, said Saladin with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're Saladin. Tis a pleasure to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before the conversation could continue any further, Sampetra begin to speak. &quot;Welcome students! I must say that this is a nice looking group. Lots of diversity! That should help us along the way. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Sampetra M. Breeze but you will all call me master. I will be teaching you the splendors of magic usage! But before we get underway, I must supply you with your cover story. As many of you may or may not know, magic in these parts are strictly off limits. So what we are doing right now is highly risky. If anyone is to ask you what your bussiness here is, you are to answer that you are apprentices of a librarian, Me. Now that that's done, we can get down to bussiness. First I must tell you about scarred people. Does anyone know about them?<br>
<br>
Two students raise their hands. One of them belonged to Janus. Sampetra chose her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Master, they are magic users who have been altered in some way&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have an example young Janus&quot;, asked Sampetra.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some may have a skin alteration that gives their skin a bluish color. Some acquire a glow around them. And others hair moves without any wind. Those are the sure signs of a magic user.<br>
<br>
Sampetra smiled, &quot;Excellent Janus. Those are the more common alterations. Some can disfigure you permanetly. If anyone sees you scarred. The will undoubtedly report you, and you will be tossed into a prison cell.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/upsychoweb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PsychoWeb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/4/02 11:12:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tale of a cat-like humanoid and a swarf. *LONG*</span><hr size=1> By the way...this story isn't finished yet.&gt; &lt;  <br>

<br>
I'm not reviewing the story just going over some grammatical and style points. <br>
<br>
The Good: <br>
Your characters speech is suitably individualistic and brings out the best in your writing. Although you tend to overplay it a little too much; delicate touches of slang should be enough to keep your characters individual. <br>
<br>
You character descriptions are also well done if a little like lists at times. You should drop some physical mannerisms into your prose if you can. <br>
<br>
The Bad:<br>
<br>
Spelling. Grrrrrgh. No excuses for bad-spelling. The occasional one I can live with but at least use a spell-checker – mine picked up several straight away.  Use a dictionary.<br>
<br>
The tense of the piece changes in the middle of paragraphs. You are switching from what has happened to what is happening very quickly. Good prose tends to be written in the present tense. <br>
<br>
Repetition of words is bad. Don’t start a sentence in a paragraph with a word you’ve used to start another sentence in the same paragraph. Repeating the same word in a sentence is also a no-no. <br>
<br>
The second chapter has far too much dialogue. See below for a solution to that. <br>
<br>
You are skipping through the story as though it is an outline.  Describe the areas and slow down the pace of the piece.  The first three paragraphs would warrant a single chapter. Lengthen it and take your time. Wallow in the description of the trees, the tangible smell of the brewery and sprawling buildings of the city. Draw your readers in with description. Show don’t tell. <br>
<br>
Although you do an admirable job of describing Sal’s background you don’t convey the drive of his character. Is it fear of something or does he hate the village?  Does he want to be rich or does he seek knowledge?<br>
<br>
You should look at the tone of your piece. Keeping it chatty is nice and easy and allows the reader to get it quickly; but it’s not usually the best way because you are keeping the reader at a distance.  You need to let them into the story not tell them it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Saladin Gallows (Sal for short) was brought up in a poor, but intelligent, house. He had the blackest of fur that gave (off) a brillant blue sheen. His eyes were a merry grey with gold flecks in them. He (third sentence to begin with variant on he) was the one that parents of daughters would like them to marry. (bit chatty) So to put it blunty, he was a handsome Mishaar! His parents were merchants who had no problem selling there abundant stock of ales and wines. It was keeping the money that was the hard part (never use !)! The Gallows, known as the best brewers in the village, could (have) be (en) one of the richest family's in the village (double use of village). But they're plagued by the Gallows Curse.(<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The tendecy to waste money on outlandish bets. It's a habit that goes back quite a ways. So they don't even fight it any more. They just throw their money on the table, and wish for the best. Which never turns out to be the best at all!(!)<br>
<br>
And (shouldn’t start paragraphs with and)besides having the Gallows curse, Saladin also had the &quot;intelligence curse&quot;. He called it that because his speech was much different then the native Misharr toungue(misspelled). Instead of rolling his r's and hissing alot (a lot), he spoke more  refined (more?) and hissed very little. Because of this he was (is) ridiculed by both peers and elders alike. So he purposely rolls his r's and hisses. And he ends up sounding like an &quot;out-of-towner&quot; (misuse of quote-marks) trying to fit in with the natives. Not to mention he spits alot (a lot).<br>
<br>
When Saladin reaches the tender age of 12, the Gallows Curse takes no time claiming him. He makes the most outrageous bets. Bets like who can run headfirst into a wall the hardest. One such bet (who can keep there tail in a fire the longest) cost him his tail! It was so burnt, it fell right off! He won the bet by the way! (exclamation mark hell)<br>
<br>
Now Saladin is poor, &quot;dumb&quot;, and has no tail. Not a winning combination. The local villagers waste no time in letting the Gallow family know it. They call him half breed (hyphenated), meaning he's only half Misharr. Saladin hates bringing all of this negative attention on his family, he has to stop it. So he runs away. <br>
<br>
He decides to go to the Koresh Kingdom. There he hoped to learn sorcery. Now Saladin was told that magic was an evil and dangerous thing. But he figured that only evil people abuse the power and thus, they do evil things. Saladin only wanted to help people. He aslo (also) wanted to grow back his tail, which was the seed of all this (trouble?). After about a weak (week) of stumbling lost in the forest, Saladin comes across a portly dwarf who was christened Moente'. Mo for short. He was a squat elf with crimson skin and a turned up nose. His ears were large, large (repetition)even for a dwarf. Both ears held a gold earring that weighted down his ears(repetition). Mo was busy hunting in the forest and almost shot Saladin! Saladin yelled, &quot;(new line) aahhhh(capitals) don't shoot!&quot;<br>
<br>
After eyeing the foreign beast for a while he said ,&quot;A Misharr(,) heh(,) what ye doing all the way out 'ere?&quot;, Mo asked looking skeptical, &quot; And where's ye tail?&quot; he chuckled heartily.<br>
<br>
Many hours later after Saladin finished his tale. Mo says, &quot;Aye, ye got yourself in a predicament all right. Come to my place, we'll have some grub and set out for the next town in the morning&quot;.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Mo and Saladin set out to the kingdom of Korresh. They had to trek through the grasslands and forest of the countryside. But they didn't seem to mind. To pass the time, Saladin asked of Mo's family.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Mo, what brings you to these parts&quot;, asked Saladin, &quot;where's your family?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mo answered blunty, &quot;Don't (‘)ave' any family&quot;. (full stop inside quotes)<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh c'mon now, everyone has family(.)&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not me&quot;.(full stop inside quotes)<br>
<br>
Saladin decided to leave it at that because Mo was obviously in a state of longing. He thought he even saw a fat tear escape his eye. Instead of pestering Mo, Saladin occupied himself with the sights. He had never seen trees this big in his home village of Druaknite in the kingdom of Garr. And there were also a variety of plants and animals in the village. They walked steadily on for the whole day. Not once stopping for a break. When the sun had set and was well below the trees, Mo stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to rest matey, we'll pick it up in the morning&quot;.<br>
<br>
And so they did. It went on like this for four and a half days. On the fourth day, Saladin excitedly pointed out colored flags on the horizon. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is that the place Mo?&quot; questioned Saladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Sal me matey, that be the place alright&quot;, said Mo as a slight smile crept upon his face&quot;. <br>
<br>
They hurridely (hurriedly) rushed to the village surrouning (surrounding) the castle and tried to locate an inn. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow&quot;, says Saladin, &quot;It's so. Big!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Relax. Try not to look like you've never seen alot (a lot)of people before&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm trying. There's just so many of em! Wahh!!! what's (What’s) that?&quot; Said Saladin pointing to a goblin.<br>
<br>
The goblin looked there way. &quot;Got something to say punk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry sir&quot;, said Mo, &quot;Don't mind him. He be nothing but a small town kid&quot;<br>
<br>
The goblin poked Saladin in the chest. &quot;Watch it next time kid, or i'll (I’ll)have ye hide fer brekfist!&quot;<br>
<br>
As the goblin trotted off Mo muttered softly, &quot;Way to go, we've not been in town two whole minutes and already you're stirrin' up trouble. Ye better watch it kid!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry Mo&quot;, Saladin started, &quot;I was-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;HALT!!&quot; cried a strong voice.<br>
<br>
Mo and Saladin froze<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do you think you two are going?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not realizing it, Mo and Saladin started to wonder into a big colorful building.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry&quot;, said Saladin. &quot;We were searching for a place where I could learn the skill of magic&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mo tried to shut him up, but he was too late. Saladin had already uttered the &quot;M&quot; word, Magic. But to his surprise, THe (The) man didn't seem the slighest bit angry. Instead, he looked excited? (full stop)<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh!&quot; Exclaimed the man. &quot;Apprentices! Right this way sirs!&quot;<br>
<br>
The man started to walk towards the castle. Mo and Saladin looked at each other and shrugged. They had no choice but to follow him.<br>

General rule of thumb is that you use them for to mark out speech and if you are quoting a passage from another published work. <br>
<br>
However Strunk (which is pretty hard going at times but is the best style book there is) has more on it. <br>
