I did this for no reason other than to help when asked by someone I didnt even know when I was on my way to a group on Luclin.   It didnt go too well.   <br>
<br>
I managed to get CR group up invis - invised myself and camped to clear agro if I received any.  I come back out of the group.   Rezes take place and then people got agro and the monks FDed I kept the cleric invis after each rez and invised myself immediately.  Apparently the group removal process isnt working because I was not in the group but was hearing others speak and could still cast invis.   I explained this a few times while the rezes were taking place.  Well eventually lots of mean mobs came and some people died.  I can evac people if I am not in the group with them so I wait hoping that someone will invite me.   Eventually I had to evac.   I was alone when I landed.    Cleric managed to camp.   Cleric came back and died - again this was bad.   <br>
<br>
I came back a second time with Auburnn and got him and one of the monks, the other was AFK and missed out on the second evac.  I dont know why he wasnt told the plan, but he should have had plenty of time to understand what was about to happen.   As soon as the three of us land in Sro there are the other two naked people who I was told were not online and could have gone up there and at least looted and ate the exp loss.   I was told by two different people that the cleric was not online and perhaps she wasnt, but we should have know what she was doing off line or if she was on an alt.   <br>
<br>
Sorry it went so bad, and I'm glad I got two of the people out, but I am not too happy that the others are still up there espcially when I could have gotten all of them on the second port.   Im out of hate stones, people are upset and nobody is communicating with each other on what the plan was.  I hope you guys manage to get the remaining people out because I would hate to be in that situation myself.<br>
<br>
Good luck and try and learn from this situation.   If someone tells you to camp to clear agro or camp so we can regroup do it immedately.   I could have gotten everyone out the first time if everyone had listened and definently could have the second time.   Im not coming here to talk down to you, not trying to hurt anyone feelings or imply people dont know what they are doing.  It was a very fluid situation and people paniced.   I just wanted to explain why after I ate two hate stones helping strangers I gave up very frustrated.<br>
<br>
Just curious?  Why were 3 people left up there the evening before?<br>
<br>
Good luck CDO. <p><img src=http://www.scourgeofshadow.com/images/tib_sig.gif >

And thanks again for the help... Though it went wrong the thought was there and appreciated... Unfortunally buggs occure because i should have gated out instead of quiting so that way I would have not have been stuck, but I got a gm to rezz me and then cleard some corpse <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ulozerink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lozerink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CDO Council Member</span><br> <font color=#000000>(12/10/01 5:42:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fcrimsonbrothersofeverquestfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hate Evac</span><hr size=1> Thank you for your post.  I wasnt there at the end of the raid, so I cant say for sure why, just what I have been informed of.<br>

One person had logged before he was able to be ported/TLd out, one person had fell asleep at the keyboard (FAAKed), and one person had dueled for some reason (not sure why) and did not get revived in the alotted time.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your help in getting them down, and if any recoup of costs of the stones, please let me know.  I will be more than happy to repay you for them.<br>
<br>
This is the first time we have had people stuck up in Hate after a raid, hopefully will be the last.  Normally, I do not leave till the last person is gone.  But the night we did Hate I could not stay later than I did.<br>

1--had to duel cause they got stuck behind throne and could not get out so had to duel then be dragged out.<br>
1--died then went LD and never came back<br>
1--died then went LD and never came back<br>
1--Tried to do CR and died then could not find port up again yesterday so I logged.<br>
<br>
I am the last one left I believe. I spent 700pp on coffins and got all the corpses except Nerz though since he was not on the first time we went.<br>
<br>
The reason we left the folks in PoH was because it had been over 2 huors since the final person went LD and we had all waited. It was 4am EST and all were tired.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the original help Tib and thanks for returning for the second try...not sure why we did not get you aded to group for Evac though.<br>

Aye, the reason was that terrible dark night: sleep.  Heh, it sapped our strength after a long night.  I will personally help you recoup your loss.  Please give me all of your alt's names and I shall seek thee as soon as I'm online.  Heh, not comfortable posting all of them?  Please do so at my e-mail address then:<br>
Ned_NeedaLender@juno.com<br>
<br>
Sleep can and will sap one's strength but our precarious position is what made it difficult.  For those curious, we had moved our base camp into Maestro's room and the natural deaths that occurred did so upon a second group's appearence at the port-in point.  (The un-natural ones succummed to the dark night).<br>
Some patrolling mobs had slipped through our able puller's grasp and terrorized the second group that came.  That, combined with the fact that our pullers were overtaken (again by dark night) made the small detachment of...well....detachments.  Heh, but we gathered what was left and got those who had not nodded off into the &quot;Piano room&quot; and got them rezzed.  The others you are refferring to are our responsiblity.  I do so thank you for your help (and my fellow guild mates for fighting the dread with me) and you are 100% right in your assessment of the semantics of following Hate orders.  Because of that, I hope to some day fight Hate with thee as you seem to be one of knowledge.<br>

Until we meet upon Norrath,<br>

Thats just crazy - should let inny deal with him.   We had someone fall asleep in PoG this weekend and missed several rezes, they we were leaving with 15 minutes before the PoGs would pop and he logs in and asks for rez - well after the cleric kited the PoGs for 10 minutes (yes 25 minutes later) he zoned in (64MB of RAM and SoL = slow as hell zoner) and he got out.   Cleric made it out too.<br>
<br>
Glad you guys got out - I spoke with Corr? (57 monk) last night with another account because I was jacked up too...Dont worry about the cost of the stones - VI really needs to get that group thing fixed - Turns out my camping to clear agro caused it.  We have a policy to always camp and come back on zone in and I didnt take that into consideration with you guys - I jacked up the group myself.  I never thought about getting a GM to help because I didnt think they would, but since I evaced and nobody else came but I was getting group chat I would expect that to be a bug and they should have helped.   <br>
<br>
Glad you guys got out - well most of you.  If you didnt, I would petition just to see if they could help because two hate stones later you should be out.  <br>
<br>
What really made this hard was getting tells from three different people - not having guild chat to coordiate things with really sucks - heh.<br>
<br>
