Everything I write sounds like I ripped it off of somebody...I don't mean to, it just happens. So please read this little trailer thingy for a possible manga and feel free to tear it apart ^_^. Honestly ...I need it and if it sounds like something you have seen or heard , please tell me too. <br>
 <br>
       Several ancient cultures talk of people descending from the heavens, bring miracles with them. Early Egyptian texts speaks of times that large flying objects crowed the skies, there are even references in the bible and odd hat shaped ships in old world paintings of the Mother Virgin and child...but people say these things are just theories...there are no aliens. This is very true because they are now us. <br>
      Long ago, just before the end of the last age, they arrived. The earth had always been an unstable place capable of supporting minimal life. After all, what could survive between ice ages and century long droughts? These travellers decided to settle here using their technology to temper the climate. Four computers were designed to support the thriving community, one in each of the great settlements. The computers themselves were not mere machines but the combination of the psy ability of its programmers and elemental laylines or nodes of the planet. The lines crossed from corner to corner of the terrain and were the central communications systems of the time. <br>
       Over time the technology was neglected until the day the first pillar system computer crashed.However, before the crash it was able to send its records to the second pillar computer. Now only three remained, supporting the ground beneath us and the sky above us. Since the computers would only answer to those who carried the DNA strain of its programmers,no one could repair it if they even remembered how. The second and third pillars eventually followed the first<br>
until only the fourth pillar computer remained, pulling the weight of the world. Each pillar collapse had signaled the end of an era and the force restart of civilization. Now in the year 2012, the fourth computer is dying too. If it too crashes there will be no rebooting of life and Earth will return to its original inhabitable state. The computer, as an last resort executes the &quot;Ouborus command&quot; and is able to link onto the world wide web to look for the descendents of its programmers...<br>
<br>
  *present time* Finals week is fast approaching at Kyoto University and term papers are due in just a few days. In their apartment Tenmei and her cousin fight for the control of their PC. Nothing new to see them waiting to the last moment and then wrestle over who gets to write theirs first. Tenmei accidently slips and bumps the mouse. The PC makes an odd noise and both girls are hit by a charge...<br>
<br>
          Possible terms:<br>
OS- the operating system...literally. These are people who are able to connect to the pillar system. <br>
Amatersu- the name the fourth pillar calls itself. Named after <br>
 the sun goddess of the Shinto religion who brought light to    the world, but once plunged the world into darkens when   <br>
 she hid herself in a cave.       <br>
Broken Link- normal humans who have no knowledge of the <br>
 system.<br>
Missing Urls- Ghost or holograms that periodically guide lost<br>
  O.S's<br>
Viruses- corrupted OS who felt that they should be able to<br>
   use the system for their own needs.<br>
Encripters- Are vary rare,because they must have very similar<br>
  DNA to the original builders... they have unlimited access to  <br>
  the system files.They have the potential to rewrite the <br>
  basic program and can use &quot;command lines&quot; , spell like  <br>
  functions.<br>
ISP/ESP?- their connection to the main system allows them to <br>
  communicate telepathically to other OS's. The reason certain characters skills are higher are because they are naturally psychic,( ie. Tenmei is able to communicate with miharu after the viruses found a way to intercept the signals)<br>

You're story was full of potetial, and had a smooth storyline. Though it was slightly cliche' here and there I can't think of what it's ripped off of. But here's a little tip: <br>
<br>
If somebody criticizes your work in such a way that's not helpful (for instance, telling you nothing except that your work is ripped off someting else) then don't listen. You have to learn to make your ears into a filter. When somebody criticizes your work you have to learn to trash the negative and make use of the positive. If somebody tells you that you've ripped off another anime, then do some investigating. Find out what anime it's &quot;ripped off of&quot;, then find out when points are the same, and which ones are different. And if you really feel as though you can't come up with your own story, then send an email to swingerchampion@hotmail.com. That's my business email address and I can help you out. I've got a story of my own that took along time to bend and stretch so that it didn't seem like a knock-off. I even have to cancel the publishing for now because I got a complaint that my story was too much like Dragonball Z. I had to change it. Living with that kind of burdon is not easy. People won't read my story saying &quot;hey it might be a rip-off but it still packs a punch&quot; they'll read it and say &quot;oh yay, another Dragonball Z rip-off&quot;. The truth is (and it took me a long time to figure this out), is that story writing is more than just the writing part. Even afterwards it takes weeks, possibly months of tweaking to a point of phony perfection (you know, cuz' nothing's really perfect). But keep writing, because the more you do it, and the less you stop and worry, the better you'll get. I've got tons of tips that I really want to give you, but I don't feel like making this really really long so you can send an email to that address if you really want to know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uotakulad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OtakuLad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Canadian <img src=http://contest.polykarbon.com/badge1.gif></span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/18/02 5:38:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.7hat.com/PKSub/asuka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God not another cheap knockoff...help me!! please.</span><hr size=1> It's a weird situation.<br>

    I realized that the DNA can never be exact, however certain structures ( such as mitochondria...think parasite eve)  can be traced through maternal lineage. I deffinately have to clearify that but I am thinking along the lines that the people who can connect to the pillar system are genetically more compatable then others... I am taking into account that sixth sense abilities such as esp are genetic.<br>

I launched a search on google but couldn't find it anywhere!<br>
<br>
It basically states that the biosphere creates its own disequilibrium in the atmosphere. Lovelace used it as the basis to prove that there was no existing life on mars because Mar's atmosphrere is in equilibrium. But NASA still wanted to send probes there. Go figure. <br>
<br>
On Earth, out atmosphere would be almost identical to Mars if it were not for Life itself. Plants produce Oxygen and consume Carbon Dioxide, and we do the opposite.<br>
<br>
Just a little something you may be intereseted in.<br>
<br>
Maybe the spires helped promote the conditions for this bio:eco interaction/balance as required. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=themamba2>TheMamba2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/19/02 11:48:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God not another cheap knockoff...help me!! please.</span><hr size=1> When I first started reading it, I thought it was a bit of a rippoff of a computer Game called homeworld in which this species on some made up planet discover that the planet is not the one they are originally from and they were exiled to the planet they are on now and must make th ejourney home, yadda yadda yadda. <br>
<br>
But while I continued to read, I realised that your story is quite different from that one and has some very good ideas in it. However, some questions you have to ask as you construct your story is Why did these 'original people/aiens' grant only certain family lines the abiliy to repair these computers if they are so vital to the existance of all? Also, if these people were advanced enough to create a computer system that could alter the very composition of a planet why were they unable to create some sort of self maintenence system within the computers or some sort of robot/immortal caretakers of these computers. Therein lies the tough part of constructing your plot. If you come up with some good answers to those questions, you've got a pretty good manga on your hands. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uselenesama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selene sama</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/19/02 7:01:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God not another cheap knockoff...help me!! please.</span><hr size=1> Yet again I thank you Otaku Lad, ^_^ <br>
   Your right about the Gaea Phenomenon ...it might just be what I need to make this story really work. Ever notice that the truely good stories always have a basis in scientic theory or mythology?

  Ty to you too Mamba, <br>
     That was the reason I posted this...my originality is well less then I would like it to be, but I'm trying. Anywho, I am thinking one of the subtheories in the story is the idea that everything dies, it's just that planets and gods take longer to do so. Morbid but sadly true. Plus, despite the huge leaps in reallity my storyline sometimes takes, things just wear down... grow old... nothing is eternal except ( and I guess this is off the subject) the soul... but your right I do have lots to work and deeply appreciate your thoughts , thank you ^_^. <p>" Can't fight the moon light" Tis I, Selene!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=themamba>The Mamba</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/19/02 7:04:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God not another cheap knockoff...help me!! please.</span><hr size=1> Glad to be able to help 8O). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kibo>Kibo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/20/02 5:13:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=554.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God not another cheap knockoff...help me!! please.</span><hr size=1> I see you've changed the subject name. Mkay, well, I guess that's that. Hmmmm. I guess all I'm going to say about your story is the same as what I've already said. I will just say this: It's alway going to be a rip-off of something. Until you start your own genre, your work always has an inspiration, most of the time from another story (&quot;you&quot; meaning people in general). What you have to do is learn to live with it and help it as best as you can by rearranging things a little. In fact, just today my story made yet ANOTHER evolution, though it wasn't quite as drastic as the others. It was more like an addition to the same evolution.<br>

 &quot;With anger and hate comes destruction. With Inner Peace comes a true martial artist. Therefore, one who is full of anger and hate will never be a true martial artist.&quot;<br>

  Honestly I was wondering that too...hmmm...ok here would be an interesting theory to add to it. Neanderthals where here before we technically where. They survived the ice age and everyday trials that would kill us. Though they are percieved to be &quot;cavemen&quot;, they were quite able to handle themselves. So my theory is...the origins of our specieses is a hybred between the neanderthals and the aliens. Hence if the computer pillar system crashes, the Earth would revert to its previous uninhabital state ...for us, not other life forms. There is an old legend that started (IRL) in South America by the Aztecs, that said mankind is forced to live in cycles. Meaning one era is born , becomes powerful and then dies away so aother can start. Think Atlantis . Scary thing is though, they predicted our &quot;age&quot; to end in the year 2012, December 21.
