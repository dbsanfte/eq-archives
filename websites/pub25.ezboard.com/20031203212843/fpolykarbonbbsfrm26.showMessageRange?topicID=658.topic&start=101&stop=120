<br>
It looks like the weight has been shifted/<br>
its like an angel has come/<br>
and the eagerness has uplifted/<br>
off of my shoulders/<br>
the holders of this beam has been broken/<br>
if i spit any harder then my throat will start chokin/<br>
this emotoin that bottles up deep inside of me/<br>
makes me spit ryhmes and wanna try to be the best/<br>
i was contained, waitin for the rest to post/<br>
that was the most/<br>
rediculous spit i think i ever heard/<br>
now i got double the trouble/<br>
so im'a work on my word/<br>
and ill attack/<br>
sendin timmy the tooth/<br>
outta tha booth/<br>
some might say im uncooth/<br>
but ill rap, until u catch tha news/<br>
then ill snap/<br>
and after that nothin will cruise/<br>
face it u loose/<br>
cus u choose/<br>
to give me ammo for my gun/<br>
now dont run/<br>
back through the door/<br>
Its complexity u say, so ill give u some more/<br>
looks like i get to spit against timmy the great/<br>
sorry kid ur nothin more than a 8, next to the 9/<br>
i told u im'a spit out wine/<br>
i rewind, to sin/<br>
ur nothin more than a ten/<br>
sometimes i tend, to begin to confuse myself/<br>
if i ever loose a shelf, of confi-dence/<br>
ill jus speak in present tense/<br>
the fog of my lyrics is to dense/<br>
so comense/<br>
u and ur 2 man team/<br>
its me and Zo's dream/<br>
to take down the queen/<br>
but even if Zo dont show/<br>
i better let u know/<br>
it'll be 1 on 2/<br>
cus no matter what happens, i told u ill never be through/<br>
im not scared and im  not gonna run and hide like u/<br>
cus im the best/<br>
and i dont even need a rest/<br>
this battle will be the test/<br>
who can play checkers, and who  can play chess/<br>
its the quest/<br>
and infested has gone behind enemy lines/<br>
so pull ur nines/<br>
if u think u can put up a fight/<br>
i got the right/<br>
to charge into ur base/<br>
its up in ur face/<br>
ur not bringin haste/<br>
and ill never flee from my castle/<br>
its the hastle, of havin to read ur young words/<br>
ill prolly never get the compition i ever deserve/<br>
so swerve and dodge my attacks/<br>
ill take it farther than the racks/<br>
iv done alot to p*ss u off/<br>
and get u off/<br>
causin u to turn blue/<br>
i knew once i started spitting this ryhme/<br>
that it would be my time/<br>
to shine/<br>
if ur whatchin my every tread/<br>
then i would already be dead/<br>
and u would not have to go through the trouble/<br>
of fixing ur sh*t/<br>
i wont quit/<br>
sendin out little attacks/<br>
ill do the grande fanally/<br>
when u got ur backs, turned/<br>
i think i jus burned/<br>

<br>
All I know is if my ass is playa hated/<br>
Someone's ass'll get obliterated/<br>
My colors never faded/<br>
And my view was never jaded/<br>
I have many friends/<br>
And many more enemies/<br>
Who side are u on?/<br>
Well you can't get rid of me/<br>
I'm forever like eternal/<br>
Your sh*t's infernal/<br>
All my rhymes built up inside my internal/<br>
Structure/<br>
Your ass is mine to puncture/<br>
With sharp ass swords/<br>
So be careful who you mess wit' Muthaf*cka/<br>
Dan't you know I roll with matrix we always win/<br>
And crush little bastards like that cat timtim/<br>
You have know idea who you just stepped to/<br>
I'm rubber you're bamboo/<br>
What bounces off of me smashes through you/<br>
Cuz I'm a regular predator/<br>
I run @#%$ like the senator/<br>
I'm the landlord and I said this tah/<br>
Even more punks your ass is tresppassin/<br>
Pay up the rent or your ass'll be gaspin/<br>
For your last breath/<br>
Before you see death/<br>
knockin at your door/<br>
You failed in life you get an F/<br>
I aced every test that life has thrown at me/<br>
I face all opponents with unparralled animosity/<br>
So this @#%$'ll hit you hard at a high velocity/<br>
When I'm done they'll say what a damn atrocity/<br>
To come against me you couldn't possibly/<br>
Think that I'd go away back to the shadows/<br>
I come back piercing your throat like bows and arrows/<br>
Lyrically burn you from teh skin to bone marrow/<br>
I'll choke you so thin your throat will be narrow/<br>
I've been gone for a while but now I came back/<br>
For all you punk ass MC's who though it was safe to attack/<br>
All my credibility/<br>
My uncanny ability/<br>
To abort MC's like a fetus with low fertility/<br>
You morons are killin me/<br>
This thread's a war so be careful where you tread/<br>
Cuz you'll get torn up badly before you end up dead/<br>
I gotta make this mad long cuz I ain't spit in a while/<br>
You soft ass punks are gonna see that I'm vile/<br>
And smash you up like cheap tile/<br>
Cuz that's my style/<br>
I never hit and run/<br>
I stay right with you and have a little fun/<br>
And I don't need any guns/<br>
Cuz I have the most powerful weapon/<br>
My mouth that vanquishes jerks who get to steppin'/<br>
Cuz I'm reppin'/<br>
The clan of all who have real skills/<br>
The assassins who rack up more than 50 kills/<br>
In less than a half an hour/<br>
We possess supreme power/<br>
The Microphones signal will constantly shower/<br>
Your ears with abuse/<br>
Cuz you think your ass was cute/<br>
Trying to tell me I can't f*ck with you?/<br>
I'll give you the boot/<br>
Just leave while you can/<br>
Be a smart man/<br>
And tell all teh haters in your crew/<br>
Don't mess with Zodawg's clan/<br>
And that's why I'm king and you punks duck like daffy/<br>
So when you wanna rhyme don't ever ask me/<br>
Hey Zo how bout a round you can't get past me/<br>
Cuz your ass'll get chewed up like friggin taffy/<br>
<br>
I have no direct beef with sin...but if his lackeys are gonna test me then they are gonna get shut down.  I didn't say anything to anyone but if the war drags me in....I'm in.<br>

Stand up on your feet/<br>
It's time for you to meet/<br>
The f*ckin executioner/<br>
The pro-retributioner/<br>
I'm the comeback king/<br>
So get out the ring/<br>
Of pro killers and mad rhymers/<br>
A little lessons for you first timers/<br>
We go off like explosions/<br>
Let me give you a notion/<br>
To not include yourself in this war/<br>
Cuz your's skills are too poor/<br>
And with you I'll mop the floor/<br>
Before I kick you out the door/<br>
<br>
TIME TO GET BRUTAL.......<br>
<br>
I'm on a  one way crash course/<br>
With an untameable force/<br>
The shogun mic gripper/<br>
Slashin like Jack the ripper/<br>
But you can call me ZO/<br>
It won't matter when you go/<br>
Straight down six feet/<br>
Cuz you couldn't take the heat/<br>
So all amatuers take a seat/<br>
while I murder this f*ckin beat/<br>
I repeat/<br>
Me and infested have taken over/<br>
Your out of luck we got the clover/<br>
But it's really cuz of skills/<br>
That make you fakers pop pills/<br>
To combat depression/<br>
So you better learn a lesson/<br>
Anyone talking sh*t/<br>
Won't have a chance for confession/<br>
Just a little session/<br>
With the masters/<br>
To take out you little bastards/<br>
We do it ten times better/<br>
And 20 times faster/<br>
<br>
This'll be my last transmission/<br>
From this little prison/<br>
I like to call my mind/<br>
But then again I find/<br>
The demons make me stronger/<br>
And able to rhyme longer/<br>
<br>
Enough for now........<br>

All who try to vex me/<br>
Timtim tried to stress me/<br>
Steamed his ass like green tea/<br>
Cuz we went round for round/<br>
ANd pound for pound/<br>
I made sure to ground/<br>
His skull into into a  F*ckin' bloody mound/<br>
Of severed flesh /<br>
Givin you something fresh/<br>
Off the top of my head/<br>
JUst like everything I said/<br>
So now sin and me are neutral/<br>
But my ass will still get brutal/<br>
Cuz those weak Mc's attempts are futile/<br>
And all they get is pure refutal/<br>
To enter the lair of the shogun master/<br>
Better, meaner, and ten times faster/<br>
Cuz this is a new chapter/<br>
In the history of rappers/<br>
Say your last godbye/<br>
Cuz they're gonna find you in a pasture/<br>
With shurikens in your throat/<br>
In your owm blood you'll start to float/<br>
Down the river of sorrow/<br>
Won't see your ass tommorrow/<br>
Find someone else skills that you could borrow/<br>
Meet teh bloody shogun/<br>
Time for hatas to run/<br>
When It's time to have some fun/<br>
You know the war has just begun/<br>
Every line carries the message of being real/<br>
This rap is innnate and so I say just what I feel/<br>
And right now I just feel massive anger/<br>
At the haters who dissed me so I wrote this little banger/<br>
Like chemical brothers I got the shaolin buddha finger/<br>
I'm a hard rapper you're a p*ssy R&amp;B singer/<br>
Thsi rap is just started so I plan to linger/<br>
This one's gotta be jumpin like a phone off the ringer/<br>
I with my new badass crew/<br>
With three badass dudes/<br>
Cuz nobody knew/<br>
With good MC's ther's just a few/<br>
Now I see sin has got the fire/<br>
Let's keep it bouncin like a tire/<br>
Get rid of all the liars/<br>
Cuz infested's gonna take this sh*t 10 steps higher/<br>
Can't forget my man main devil/<br>
He shines like a diamond bezel/<br>
All you cats are gonna revel/<br>
At his skills that are on the next level/<br>
Now getting back to the war/<br>
weaklings hit the floor/<br>
We're blowing lyric bombs up/<br>
Cuz we're hard to the core/<br>
You want more and more/<br>
And supplies are infinite/<br>
So take a friggin hint/<br>
You don't amount to chicken sh*t/<br>
Not one f*ckin bit/<br>
The risk is trivial/<br>
Your skills are pitiful/<br>
But the mic is pivotal/<br>
For my existence to continue/<br>
So stand clear  cuz I'm loaing another clip/<br>
This sh*t's still going it ain't never gon' quit/<br>
Till you haters throw a fit/<br>
I'll slice you up until you split/<br>
HAlf and half/<br>
But still 1/4 an MC/<br>
I'm not very friendly/<br>
So don't ever f^ckin tempt me/<br>
I'm like ice cream so many damn flavors/<br>
I'm the rap savior/<br>
So I'll do you a little favor/<br>
Get out while you can/<br>
Run back to your fam/<br>
Cuz you can't understand/<br>
How much this means to us man/<br>
TO shine on the mic or type at PK/<br>
More than a hobby I do this sh*t all day/<br>
It takes more than just words/<br>
So what you got to say?/<br>
My new clan's called ISAI/<br>
Three verbally abusive incredible guys/<br>
WHose rhymes strike you hard in the face/<br>
Like bullet pies/<br>
The shogun assassin/<br>
My rhyme is everlastin/<br>
Suckas who try surpassin'/<br>
I'm gonna end up blastin'/<br>
Just a little warning/<br>
This is gonna go until the morning/<br>
Two hours in the making/<br>
And for me it's not boring/<br>
I'll show you the color of the energy like 311/<br>
I'm super twin turbocharged like an RX-7/<br>
Ready to blow/<br>
and go/<br>
And send your ass straight to heaven/<br>
Or maybe it was hell/<br>
Cuz that's where I'm from/<br>
The heat gets pretty bad but we have lots of fun/<br>
With amatuer MC's/<br>
We punch you hard like Dempsey/<br>
Cuz you're like a car runnin on empty/<br>
<br>
DAmn need sleep....<br>

its time i begin to complete/<br>
the meat of these words/<br>
unleash heards of strikes/<br>
cus the stripes/<br>

fly/<br>
over our heads, like a bird in the sky/<br>
im starten to feel sorry for sin/<br>
i dont even know why/<br>
because, hes gettin shredded up/<br>
by everyone of us all/<br>
but its my call/<br>
he turned me away from his crew/<br>
little he knew/<br>
that i was already, formin a squad/<br>
all i could do, was look down at him and nod/<br>
cus hes gonna loose, unless he takes this serious/<br>

ill pull the lever/<br>
and bam, ur not here/<br>
to rap, or try to snap me off tha stick/<br>

and ull get the structure/<br>
ill f*ck ur/<br>
whole damn team up/<br>
