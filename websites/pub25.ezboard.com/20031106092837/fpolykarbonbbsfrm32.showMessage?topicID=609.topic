Best game ever!!!!</span><hr size=1> Zone of the Enders(original) was a good game. Sadly, it was short and rather repetitive.  So then ZOE The 2nd Runner shows up and looks amazing.  Not only that but it promises to fix all the problems of the first.  I was captivated by the first screen shots.  Then I saw one of the movies and I was giddy.  Next I saw the Tokyo game show(download it at konami.com/2ndrunner) and I was moved.  I was truly touched by it.  Finally I played the demo and I nearly passed out from the rush of power that surged from it to my very being.  I was taken in by its speed and utter beauty. Its music running through my soul. I became one with the game.  Then it ended and I played through it about 7 more times since.  <br>
<br>
This game is amazing.  It has great music and the best graphics ever.  The anime cutscenes blended with the 3D rendered mechs is amazing.  I have never seen a game like this.  The control and fluid motion of Jehuty is riveting.  And this was only the demo.  I long for this game to come out.  Everyone who remotly likes 3rd person games should check this game out.  This game will become an instant legend and seen as a step above all other games.  Also there are many more one on one orbital frame battles then the first one.  Those are the greatest battles of all.  If you dont believe that this is amazing fo to konami.com/2ndrunner and download the Tokyo Game Show preview.  Also, for anyone who is curious the song played in the background of it is called Beyond the Bounds.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melch14>melch14</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(2/23/03 4:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=609.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/melch49/zzguy.txt height=110 width=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner. Best game ever!!!!</span><hr size=1> I, too, played the 2nd Runner demo. I really liked it. The graphics are great to look at and run incredibly smooth.<br>
<br>
I thought it was really cool that they put the cinematics in anime, but unfortunately, the animation wasn't quite as good as I had hoped. Probably better than a series anime but not as good as an anime movie with a long developing time (animation-wise).<br>
<br>
I definitely look foreward to its release.<br>

Best game ever!!!!</span><hr size=1> I recently bought my copy of ZOE2 and i have to say its the best damn action game i've ever played. Its Fast. REALLY FAST. That and theres so much going on in the screen at all times. This game is graphically and technically amazing. Its graphics are even better than Gran Tourismo 3. This Game really pushes the PS2 with the most amazing levels i have seen. One stage is where you have to fight a whole armada of space ships. Next is they plunge you in a fully realized WAR! Complete with guys freaking out and praying for their lives. Go out and get it NOW!!  <p>WWW.Xcelldesign.com<br>

Holy freaking awesome game, Batman. Its so much better than the demo if thats possible.  Every little detail is taken care of. This is the best game ever!!!  The graphics are only the beginning( even though they are amazing with a combination of 3d and cel shading not to mention this games lighting effects put any other game to shame). I could probably right a book on the lighting effects.  Seriously. No game has better effects. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the combat is flawless and hardcore.  This is one intense game and its not just random button smashing. You have to block fast and attack faster. The controls are tight and there is no bad camera angles.<br>
<br>
The graphics and gameplay would make a great game by them selves but it doesnt end there.  There is the story which is told between anime cutscenes(which rock), computer rendered cutscenes(which rock), and little image transmission screens( which prove to be quite interesting).  The story is about war, love, vengence, annialation, and domination of power.  All of which are done beautifully.  <br>
<br>
Then to add to the story is the great cast.  Featuring familiar people like Leo from the first one(whos not just some stupid annoying kid anymore), and new people like almost everyone else.  I suppose Nohman was in the first since he pilots Anubis even though I dont think he was ever called Nohman.  Viola is also sort of back.  The voices are great and very fitting of each character.<br>
<br>
Then aside from the regular game, 2 player mode returns and I believe there are some additional missions.  Im not sure because I havent beaten the game yet so i dont even have the two player mode so I dont know if its better than the first ones two player mode.  I would think it would be since its going to have a lot more characters to choose.<br>
<br>
Seriously people, this is honostly the most perfect game I have ever played.  Nothing is bad and everything is great.  I you didnt hate the first one buy this one.  If you enjoy third person games buy this before anything else. I recommend it to everyone. I suppose you could wait for the reviews or see what I say once I have beaten the game, but why wait.  I can tell you right now, dont be surpised when you see perfect ratings and I sure the game will be game of the month in every magazine that rates PS2 games.  Im sure I will rate it perfect as well.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agentcryrid>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(3/16/03 3:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=609.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: i got it</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The controls are tight and there is no bad camera angles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Small, cramped areas (like the fortress of moving steel beams) can be a pain if you aren't fast with the targeting. However, that's only a minor problem (that's only one small area in the game, unless you try to master the Extra Missions)<br>
<br>
And the Versus Mode. Oh, the versus mode. There are ten different Orbital Frames to choose from: 4 versions of Jehuty, 2 versions of Anubis, and the 4 boss OFs. Each character has its own advantages over the rest, and a couple have extremely useful special skills (Anubis can use Zero Shift with a push of the L1 button, and the Vic Viper can change between Aero-mode and Humanoid mode).<br>
<br>
The only faults in Versus mode is the lack of some of the stages in the original. As cool as it is to fight in space, or some of the huge battlegrounds featured, they still left out the Park battleground (a halo of buildings where you fight an OF in the first game) and the Cargo Room (where you fight Viola in the first game, moving in and out of the cmpletely destructible moving structures). Still, that's more nitpicking from me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Extra Missions are an assortment of different challenges that vary in difficulty. You only have maybe 60% opened at first (after beating the game once), and then you have to find the Ex Mission icons to add more. You choose the OF you want to challenge with, then you navigate through the subcategories to find missions that pretty much cover every skill you need to develop to become a master with the OF controls. (To tell the truth, I suck at Grab attack missions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
The idea behind Ex Missions is to open 100% of the missions, then complete 100% of the missions, and then get a high score on 100% of the missions. Takes a lot of committment, but it's fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
