instead, I'll probably go to a UC, i mean, it seems to me that actual skills have more to do with future in art than school credits.<br>

If I'm not mistaken, many members of Studio XD (Locke, Saka, and CP) are graduates of the Academy.<br>
<br>
From what I hear of the jobs:<br>
<br>
storyboard artist:<br>
not always fun. you have to work under tremendous pressure and deadlines. not much creativity because you always work under the producer/director's vision<br>
<br>
animation:<br>
animators are very flexible. you can go to games or movies. it takes a lot of talent though... and there's a lot of competition in animation right now. be sure to hone up those claymation and cel animation skills. can you animate a ball bouncing? what about a person walking?<br>
<br>
special effects:<br>
pretty limited. mostly the job falls into the animator's hands. there's not a specific &quot;special effects&quot; animator most of the time. if you're an animator they tell you to animate. anything.<br>
<br>
character design:<br>
hard to get in to. very hard. you would most likely have to be in some lead position already or work your way up there by doing boring tweening jobs. good luck on this one. there is this one board with a lotta illustrators (i cant remember the name...) that are really good with character design. if you think you can match them then go with it.<br>
<br>
with any of these, get a good drawing skill down before you get knee deep into software or animation or anything. you need to be able to draw humans and animals perfectly.<br>
<br>

<br>
Chose a collage that does not produce drone for the industry.<br>
My first collage was like that and i did one yeat and changed.<br>
chose one that allows alterantice media and the student a cahcne to explore the different options in the industry. My studeis where animation and god in some places its night and day going blind over a light box. the one a went to in the end allows us to creat our own works and the course adapted to us not the other way round which i think is wrong( a course forcing the student to become aware only of what is in the books and lectures). you have your strenghs and weeknesses and you should build on both.<br>
 waht i mean is a weekness is only a weekness till you approch it from a differnet point and it can usually become a important part of your craft with practice and experience chossing the right time to use that skill.<br>
<br>
this sounds probaly zen but as i said its just my option.<br>
My collage uas dunlaoghaire institute of art, design and technology in ireland and they take foreign student and there are also grants <br>
<br>
hope this helps<br>

They made me take an MPT Class (Video Editing!?) for a 3d Computer Arts Major?! i found out others in the same major as me didn't have to take it.  COMPLETELY RANDOM!<br>
i hated the school, but i have my reasons, it's because of the person that i am.  <br>
1. I expected it to be a different place than it actually is: (Clean, more Computers around, more interactive environment, more creating your own creations) I expected to have lots of people just like me, into Anime, maybe even games maybe even cars whatever the hell that's fun.  There were just a lotta lame-o's around.. most people were around 4 years older than me (they were 22) and as an example, i had to listen to a discussion about He-Man's sword and Skeletor's sword on a bus ride home.  Needless to say, i never took their bus again.<br>
2. i HATE downtown and i HATE BART.  i had to take bart cuz i live 15 miles from BART.  You're gonna be around Market St., lotsa hobos, damn dirty, rude people everywhere, etc.  Don't pay attention to most of the hobos they're not hungry; i had to learn that the hard way.  And trust me they can get their own food.<br>
3. that video editing class taught some fun skills but for a SIX hour class that can easily be shortened to at least TWO hours and a Teacher who's english i can barely understand.. it SUCKED.<br>
4. This is not so bad but just so you know, they WILL change the way you draw.  I've drawn all my life on simple paper and with my hand down and a mechanical pencil.  Prepare to work with charcoal (my enemy!) and prepare to draw with your whole shoulder, holding your pencil vertically.<br>
My advice, Do yourself a favor and try to go INTO classes in session to check it out.  At least look from the hallway.  The tour they provide doesn't EVEN show how classes are; they'll show you things such as lab rooms, and equipment.  it's much more different than that.  Don't expect the damn school to be so clean or anything even with all the money you pay them.  <br>
If you have your life pretty much dedicated to art right now, i think you could do pretty well, but beware.. some people there have some MAD skill and sometimes their homework will blow yours to hell.  I've spent 4 hours in a lab doing my homework and ended up with some pretty crappy results.<br>
Bah, u know what, if u have more questions about hte place i'd be happy to answer them.  my AIM Screen Name is do0dleboi.  <br>
i also don't attend the school anymore, but don't worry.. i'm not too narrow minded. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doodleboi>doodle boi</A> at: 11/26/02 8:03:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeron30>ZeroN30</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(11/26/02 10:57:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11409.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://zeron30.hypermart.net/images/drunkemon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Help</span><hr size=1>      Something also to consider is when you pick your major, look to see what courses are included in your program. For example my  major is Media Arts and Animation which focuses on animation 2d and 3d but at the same time I'm covering traditional media, illustration, design (graphic to character), a little archetecture, color theory, and a crap load of computer programs I cant even spell let alone use yet, Flash, Maya, AfterAffects, 3d max, and even buisness software, and that isnt including what I get to learn on Mac.<br>
<br>
      Also check to see if they have internships, or job placement. I'm looking into an internship at HI*FI right now, but I know like Cal Arts (tough school, but good) has internships at Disney. Your best bet is to shop around and get as much info as you can. Best wishes.<br>
