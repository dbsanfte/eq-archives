Nope... Sid looked around and surveyed his options.  The way he saw it, it was going to be a hell of a fight.  Sure, he had held his on on more then a few occasions.  But this was going to be tricky.<br>
<br>
   His finger found the trigger, and he almost flinched anticipating the oncoming excitment.  And death.  Then he thought about it.  Who were these guys?  Sharks?  A few Lions maybe?  Probably mostly Wolves and Rats.  Sid smiled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, guys, can't we just all get along?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not for what we're gettin' paid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what if I told you that I could get you more?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gunmen paused.  One even lowered his gun.  Great.  Just great.... If only he could keep this up.  An old lady holding a double-barrel cackeled, <br>
<br>
&quot;More?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sid nodded his head vigourously.  &quot;Yes more!  Listen, I can cut you the deal of a LIFETIME!&quot;  You do know who I am right?&quot;  All of them nodded their heads.  &quot;Yeah!  I'm Sid, and when have I double crossed any of you before?&quot;<br>
<br>
They started to name off some times.  Then they started to name off quite a few times.  Then they just sat there and named more and more times that Sid had ripped them off.  Never said he had to be trustworthy.<br>
<br>
Sid lifted his gun and pulled the trigger.  It hit the light.  By this time in Grunge-City, it was dark.  The pollution made sure of that much.  Sid grimiced about what he was about to do, and went to work.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkboy>Milk Boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 6:00:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yeah, Kudos on writing</span><hr size=1> Sid grimiced about what he was about to do, and went to work.... taking out the male and female rats using memory. Their silent deaths proved his memeory was still good in his ripe age, They were both head shots. <br>
<br>
The sound and smell of firearms filled the room as Sid silently whirled into position behind his filing cabinet. Not that it would provide very good cover, but they were still shooting behind his desk anyway, the morons. Sid had expected more, from the male wolf, and lion. The last female was a shark. In the 15 seconds of studing his assailents Sid had already figured out what each one was. The female might has well have been sporting a dorsal fin for how much she looked the stereo typical shark, except for that she was female. <br>
<br>
Sid leaned over almost right into the fray of flying lead, and carfully picked up his trusty paper weight. Hardley ever used before, Sid hoped it would finnally do him some good. Into the oppisite corner it went, easily drawing the fire of the three thugs. Out came Sids more stealthy weapon. His balisong, known to most in Grunge-City as a &quot;butterfly knife&quot;<br>
<br>
From there it was just knife work. The male lion went down with a quick slit to the throat. Down but not out, unfortunatly, as he slumped into Sid's arms, his life blood pouring out of him in the darkness, he scremed like a little girl. Reacting like lightning Sid used the soon to be corpse as a body sheild and using sound alone popped one into what he hoped was the remaning male. The lion. Then with hot blood continuing to pour on him he remained silent. <br>
<br>
The remaining gun shot off a couple more rounds, one of them actually hit her former comrad, shaking Sid's sheild above him sickenly. Finnally she stopped, Sid knew it was the remaning &quot;she&quot; because foolishly she said aloud &quot;Jack? I think we got him, you ok?&quot; And that was all Sid needed to locate her exactly, throw the bleeding corpse at her as a diversion and quickly dive and grab her to the ground. <br>
<br>
Easily over powering her and knocking her gun away, Sid could feel her panicked breath on his face as he slid his knife onto her neck just soft enough for her to feel.  Minty freash breath. &quot;You're going to tell me everything I want to know b*tch,&quot; he told her. And she would too, but only after Sid found a way to turn on some lights and get a look at her, because from the way her large heaving breasts pushed against his chest, Sid knew she was a sexy dame. He brought her to her feet and began walking her into the next room.... <p>&quot;Death is lighter than a feather, duty, heavier than a mountain.&quot;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shockner>shockner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 9:35:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> test</span><hr size=1> test <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shockner>shockner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/18/02 9:48:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> continue</span><hr size=1> sorry about that other thing before this. i was making sure the password was right.<br>

He brought her into the next room and turned on the light. Sitting her in a chair, he tied her hands to make sure she didnt try anything.<br>
Standing back he finally got a good look. He wasnt mistaken. She was a fine dame. A little dirty and beat up, but fine never the less.<br>
Making sure she could see his gun, she started asking questions.<br>
&quot;So, Leo's a devil, huh?&quot; Sid asked<br>
She simply nodded her head<br>
&quot;Where is he&quot; <br>
She shook her head no. <br>
&quot;Lets try this again&quot; pointing the gun to her head this time&quot; Where is Leo.<br>
After a long pause she started to say&quot;I dont know much, but...&quot;<br>
She was cut off by a gun shot and a bullet that flew through her forhead.<br>
Dropping to a knee, Sid turned around and shot the dame's assailent.<br>
Turning back to the lady, he sighed.<br>
&quot;Just one of those days,&quot; he said.<br>
Ofcourse, in Grungecity, everyday is one of those days.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=misterbeaver>Misterbeaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/19/02 4:55:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continuing...</span><hr size=1> Of course, in grunge City, every day was one of those days... but no time to think about it.  Sid darted outside and ran down the block.  It was stressed times like these that Sid noticed the little things in life.  Old man Mcliney's whores trying to round up business, the drug dealers on the corner, trying to make a deal... And all of this, every iota of it was Leo's doing.  Leo just wasn't the devil, he was Satan himself...<br>
   Sid had found papers and documents in the house with numbers of other devils and sharks.  Lions and wolves weren't important or rich enough to have phones...  but with it were documents of bribary, death certificates, everything that pointed to Leo being the top man of Grunge City.  Maybe even the country... <br>
  But Sid had danced this dance before. He knew the signs of a fishy situation.  Leo was smart.  Wasn't any doubting that.  Then why would he leave this stuff for Sid to see?  <br>
  So Sid sat.  And he rummaged.  One place was mentioned over and over again.  An old warehouse by the dry docks... 1542 Chelsy Avenue... Abandoned for quite some time now... If there was ever a sign, it would be this one.  Hell, Sid almost felt this one bite him on the lip...<br>
  So this was where Sid was now.  Running.  Cars didn't exsist in Inner-Grunge City because of looters and such, so you had to use your feet.  Along the way, Sid shot three pimps out for revenge and a mugger who didn't know who he was.  But this was all very mundane.  <br>
   Sid arrived at the warehouse and walked inside.  Cigarette smoke filled the room.  Noticing that he wanted one, Sid reached for his pocket.  No, not now.  Maybe later...  He walked a little further with his gun in his hand, his finger tense on the trigger.  Then blinding lights came on.  And there, in the middle of the room stood Leo.<br>
   His shadow casting a dark and sinister siloutte on the floor, Leo grinned.  &quot;You bastard.  You finally found me, and even with the cigarette smoke, you didn't... didn't light one up.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;The rooms full of a gas that will explode when the slightest flame is expelled.  Even a gun could do the trick.  So I wouldn't...  Radion-oxide I believe... But in any case, it would blow us both up.&quot;<br>
  Sid stared at his assalent.  &quot;What the hell is the meaning of this?!&quot;<br>
   &quot;You know what the meaning of this is Sid... Hell, you know the meaning of all of this...&quot;<br>
   &quot;All of what?&quot;  Sid snapped back, getting angry now.<br>
   &quot;All of THIS...  Grunge-City!  You fool!  You see the world for what it is!  And with me, that makes two of us...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Talk like you know what your talkin' about Leo.  Or else I might be inclined to pull this tr-&quot;<br>
   &quot;I know you would.  So let me explain.  When you saved me from that nasty gang buisness three years ago...  You remember it don't you?  I finally opened my eyes and saw the world for what it was.  A cold heartless place.  And when you rescued me... Well, let's just say I admired you because you didn't change for the world.  You just stayed the same.  You WERE the world...<br>
   &quot;And you see that don't you?  Below all that toughness, below that cold-heartedness... You see the world for what it is too, don't you?  That's why you can shoot a man and never look back.&quot;  Leo stepped towards Sid.  &quot;So I built on this basis.  Doing what I had to do, cutting any throat in my damn way, and I got to the top.  And don't you point your finger at me Sid, I am at the top!&quot;<br>
   Sid stood there silent.<br>
   &quot;And now, I'm going to get away.  Why?  Because I say so bastard.  That, and you can't escape from the building.  Doors are locked.  And this-&quot;  Leo said knocking on an invisble barrier, &quot;This, is my insurance.  C'mon Sid, you didn't think that I would buy a piece of crap building like this just to meet you here, do you?  Come closer.  Feel the glass.  Unbreakable.  Guarunteed.  Not even a sonic could break it.  But you're welcome to try.  And that gas?  Well let's just say merry christmas.&quot;<br>
  Sid sarcastically muttered, &quot;And a happy new year...&quot;<br>
  &quot;The gas is nothing but perfume.  Bad smell abeit, but perfume none the less.&quot;<br>
   Sid shot his handgun at Leo, dead on.  The bullet made a clinck sound when it hit the glass, and fell to the ground.<br>
  &quot;But you'll starve in here Sid.  You will.  Wolves will protect this building every night until you're dead from starvation.  Ironically, sort of like the world you model so well after.  Starving and dying.  But I intend to be the top man Sid, I really do...&quot;  Leo laughed as he left the building, the last sound he made the clicking of the door latch... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26>Writer's Forum</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
