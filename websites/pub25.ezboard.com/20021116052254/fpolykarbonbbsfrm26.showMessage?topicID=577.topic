I decided I'd torture you all with my writing. I wouldn't mind a few  suggestions to help improve my writing, and any other comments wouldn't hurt,  either.<br>
  This is pretty much a back story for a manga I'm privately scripting, which  exists in potentia. So here it is, the History of Old Earth and the  Colonization of the Draconis Solor System.<br>
  Be warned. It's a background story, but it's gonna be long.<br>
<br>
Chapter One<br>
<br>
  &quot;Prince Shiro? Are you paying attention?&quot;<br>
  Looking out through window, Shiro sighed and admist his mind, he thought -  I may be royalty, but what I wouldn't give to be free of this. I can feel the  Wolf blood in me, I can run right now and no one would be able to stop me,  but what would that gain me? A King must always act for the best of his  people...<br>
  &quot;Of course, Mistress. As always.&quot;<br>
  Mistress Lei, the History Mistress, nodded and muttered something about  Wolves and their attention span.<br>
  &quot;Now, let the test begin.&quot; She stated.<br>
  Shiro sighed, yet again, then said, &quot;A meteor about the size of a small  moon crashed into Old Earth in the year...2695, though we can't be sure since  most records dating back that far have either been corrupted or lost.  However, from what we know, we can safely assume that the people of Old Earth  knew about the meteor for some time, and this is why the colonization efforts  began.&quot;<br>
  Mistress grinned. &quot;Slightly off, my Prince. The colonization efforts began  well before the metoer, though none were really successful until the mid  2500s. Shiro, what happened then that allowed them to successfully complete  future colonizations?&quot;<br>
  Of course! Shiro had forgotten. &quot;They devoleped a type of energy sink, which  allowed nuclear and fision reactors to safely power ships. Not long after  they developed far more efficient Ion engines, this allowed them to make  space travel available to the avarage people, and played an essential role in  establishing the Moon colony. Not long after, other planets were colonized.&quot;<br>
  Mistress again. &quot;Back to the meteor. Why didn't Old Earth do anything about  it?<br>
  Shiro had to think on this one. This is unfair! She keeps jumping from  place to place, time to time! Is she purposely trying to confuse me? &quot;They  did. They knew about the meteor for about 25 years. All efforts to destroy,  or otherwise prevent it's impact on Earth failed. During the last 10 years,  they finally began to realize that there was nothing they could do, and built  colony ships. The ships where originally headed for a closer solar system,  but the meteor's impact on Earth created a shockwave that damaged the 3  ships. It fried most of their computers including communications, history  records, and certain navigational data. Part of the data that was lost was  their original destination. Contact between each ship was limited, and  eventually died out during most of the journey. Fortunately, before that  happened, they were able to pool their efforts and detected this solar  system, the Draconis System.&quot;<br>
  Lei nodded at this. &quot;Don't forget, the shockwave not only destroyed Earth's  solar system, it destroyed the meteor as well, but you are forgetting  something.&quot;<br>
  Confusion, yet again. &quot;What am I forgetting?&quot;<br>
  &quot;The colonization of Draconis, Shiro. As a King, you wil be expected to be  learned in the history of our people. Tell me of how the three races  developed.&quot;<br>
  Taking a deep breath, Shiro continued. &quot;According to the records, the  original colony ships decided to land on three seperate planets. Since their  scanning equipment was partially damaged, and so there was still a good  chance that the any of the landing sites would be unsuitable. This was only  true for Eudora, and so they had to rely on the ship's protection from severe  and unpredictable weather conditions.&quot;<br>
  Shiro hesitated. Lei caught this, and smirked. &quot;Is something wrong, Prince?  Perhaps I'm going too fast you.&quot;<br>
  For the most part, Shiro ignored this. &quot;Due to Eudora Prime being isolated  from the outside, the humans remained, well, human. However the second ship  and third ship were not so well protected. The second ship was to land on the  planet we now call Alexandria, but it's landing equipment was partially  damaged and was forced to crash land. The third ship landed on Vampirus, and  was salvaged to build a more fortified base due to the extreme hostile  environment.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Describe Vampirus' hostile environment and geography,&quot; Lei prompted.<br>
  This was easy. &quot;Vampirus is a mostly mountainous place, dotted with  desserts and small forests. Water tends to be scarce, and is usually found in  caves. All of the life forms are hostile, with exception of some funguses.&quot;<br>
  &quot;And Alexandria?&quot;<br>
  &quot;It was a terran class planet, largely similar to Old Earth. Mostly land  with very large and dense forests. There are no oceans. The life forms are  not hostile, with very few exceptions. It has 2 moons. Both moons orbit  Alexandria in such a way that there are always at least one full moon visible  at night.&quot;<br>
  Lei made no remarks, so Shiro continued, &quot;Vampirus was first referred to as  Draconis IV, however later they changed it's name to reflect it's major  population: Vampires. Vampires came about when a research team was infected  by a rare virus. They did not show symptons of infection until two weeks  later, and so the cause of infection is unknown. The Virus caused a genetic  mutation similar to porphyria, but very different in a way. The victims still  had to obtain a regular supply of hemogoblin, but were hardly affected by  sunlight. Exposure to sunlight would cause the Vampire to become disoriented,  and in some cases unconscious. Physical changes vary. Some have bat-like  wings, while others are reported to look like angels. The reason is unknown  at this time Most are indistinguishable from humans. However, physical  changes that remain constant are increased physical abilites, heightened  sense, fangs, and usually achieve a height of around 6 feet. The virus is now  extinct.<br>
  &quot;On Alexandria, there existed a symbiote that bonded with an animal, and  'absorbed' genetic traits, and then passes the traits it already has into its  host. When the host dies, the symbiote spawns a number of other symbiotes,  then dies itself. The new symbiotes have the genetic information for the  traits its parents already absorbed, and seeks out a new organism to bond  with, and the cycle starts over.&quot;<br>
  &quot;One of the symbiotes infected a colonists, and spread throughout  Alexandria. The planet, at that time, had a number of small villages and  colonies. Most of the population was infected, not to mention a number of  dogs, cats, and other animals that were brought along with the original  colonists. The symbiotes changed those that it infected in a variety of ways,  but none were really well documented until the Symbiote Hunt began.<br>
  &quot;The Hunt severly reduced the number of Symbiotes, but it was not until  later when a team of scientists found a permanent answer. They found that  forcefully removing the symbiote from a host resulted in death. The symbiote  would expire before it could reproduce, but the host died as well.<br>
  &quot;The scientists decided it would be better to genetically alter the  symbiotes so that they could not reproduce. This way, the host survives and  the symbiote never reproduces, hence less symbiotes. Fortunately, the  symbiote's genetic coding was reletively simple. It only took close to 25  years, and by then most of the population was bonded with a symbiote.<br>
  &quot;In the end, the 'wild' symbiotes were killed off, and a new race appeared.  The new race was originally accepted as a mutant race since almost all were  completely different. Soon, however, the genetic information would gather and  produce a more stable race, and soon after that the werewolves emerged.<br>
  &quot;In the beginning, there were different clans of Werewolves: Were-Tigers,  Were-Lions, Were-Cats, etc. This was pretty much based on appearence,  Were-Tigers resembled Old Earth's tigers, Were-Lions resembled lions, etc.  The were really the same race, though. There were small wars fought because  one clan would consider themselves above the other clans, and were not afraid  to put them in their place. That all ended around 1000 years ago, and are now  only referred to as the WerePeople. Recently, the WerePeople have pronounced  the male gender to be name Wolves, and the female gender to be called Cats.  At that time, either gender could be mistaken fir the other. It was quite a logical  choice that influenced almost nothing at all.<br>
  Lei finally spoke up, &quot;Describe the WerePeople&quot;<br>
  &quot;The WerePeople, despite legends, can't turn into a wolf. The name was  chosen because of similarities between wolves and the WerePeople.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Prince Shiro, please stay on topic.&quot;<br>
  Shiro went on with the test, &quot;The symbiote is present in every Wolf and  Cat, this was unavoidable. It causes physical and mental changes. The  physical changes are increased physical abilites, though not as far as  Vampires, and heightened senses and awareness, which exceeds the Vampires by  a good amount, as well as Wolf- or Cat-Like ears, increased metabolism, which  causes the Wolf/Cat to require large amounts of food, and canine teeth. They  tend to have more hair as well. Other then this, The WerePeople resemble  humans in all other aspects.<br>
  &quot;Mental changes were not detected until about 800 years ago. It was  biologically proven that emotions are stronger for Wolves/Cats. Any emotion  they feel is amplified by above 2x, though this varies. A truly enraged  WerePerson could lose a few limbs and not feel it. A very depressed one may  consider suicide, but most likely won't due to their pride, which is also an  enhanced emotion. Simply put, *any* emotion is enhanced.<br>
  &quot;A Halfblood Vampire is one who has a Vampire and a Human parent, or is the  decendent of a Halfblood Vampire. They generally fall anywhere between the  two in regards of physical changes, though no HalfBlooded Vampire will ever  have any of the serious physical changes such as wings or fangs.<br>
  &quot;A Halfblood Wolf, on the other hand, tend to resemble their Wolf/Cat  parent. They have all the physical features of a Wolf, only less so. The  enhanced emotions, however, are always present. It is usually stronger then a  typical WerePerson, though not by much.&quot;<br>
  Mistress Lei stood up. &quot;That will be all for today, Prince. We should continue the test tomorrow.&quot;<br>
  Prince Shiro took a deep breath, and looked out the window. He was glad he was free of history lessons for now. Glad, that is, until the Math Master, Shen, arrived.<br>

***<br>
  Chapter 2 would go here, but I haven't written it yet. I hope that those of you who read it provide your thoughts. I'm still not sure if this manga idea of mine is really worth it. I could provide more information about the manga itself, such as the plot, characters, and even describe in detail each of the main characters. I'm not going to provide any information that would spoil the story, though, unless you insist.<br>
  Thanks for reading this far.
