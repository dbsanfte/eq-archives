'Very nice, very nice. Fire putting-out first, psionic discussion later' Zak shouted as he smashed open a panel and hit the emergency sprinkler system activation. A hissing sound echoed through the ship as water rained down from above and carbon dioxide spread through the ship, clinging to the ground and constricting the air supply of the fires. Within a few seconds the only noise audible was the booming of the automatic external guns firing on the besieging forces. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

All of the armored men ran to the airlock, guns in hand.  Matrix, pulled his large gun, ready for battle.  There was another explosion, the airlock door was swept away into the rain of bullets.  The area was now open for all sorts of fire.  Bullets flew into the hold,  the men ran for cover.  Running to the side walls, for protection from the firepower.  The assasins had tripled, they had more power, and the advantage.  But something had to be done, or the men would become space dust. <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside.

<br>
With that, he cocked his shotgun and turned.  He spang over the bench, firing 4 shots.  By the time the first of his victims hit the ground, he was already hiding behind a locker next to Caron.  She was crouched in the corner, hiding with her eyes closed and her shotgun griped over her head like a shield.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok sweety, this may be your daddy's game, but I'm not getting paid to sit around.  As long as we are in danger, I'm calling the shots!  Wave your little gun around as much as you want...just understand, when there is real work to be done...leave it to the guys with the know-how.&quot;<br>
<br>
He reached down and pulled a small, marble like object off his belt.  He regarded it for a moment, then tossed it into the crowd of assasins. <br>
<br>
A huge explosion rocked the hull of the ship as it exploded, killing several more of the attackers.  Meanwhile, Decker called to Zorbus, &quot;Can you use those mind powers of yours to make some kind of energy shield?  We need some temporary cover!&quot;  <p><P><hr color=blue>

There is no time to waste, he said calmly to himself, as he took out a small, computer-like gadget.  Typeing a few buttons, a large blue bubble, began streching around the ship.  <br>
&quot;Everything that comes threw will be in slow motion, and easy to take out.,&quot; he yelled.<br>
Right after that an assasin walked threw, and was slowed down.  The men fired upon him, and quickley dropped his slow-motin body to the ground. <p>Everyone has an infested soul inside.

His blacc-clad cronies slowly broke the motion field around the ship, and resumed their firing. Three of them stepped around a corner, coming face to face with Decker and Caron. Raising their rifles, they squeezed the triggers...<br>
In a blinding blur, Zak was stood before them, his whirling blades throwing crackling energy into the bulkheads of the ship whenever they met each other or a bullet. The assassins slowly backed off as they saw the spatters of molten metal that were once armour-piercing rifle rounds land at his feet. He leaped forwards, his shorter blade seeking the throat of the lead assassin, his longer sword driving the other two together with a series of flickering feints. As the first corpse dropped to the ground, he finished the other two off with a deceptively slow slash that dropped to waist height as his wakizashi met the skull of the final remaining thug. Lifting his face skywards, he let out a long howl and shuddered as the adrenaline boosters over his adrenal glands quadrupled his power, his face flushing as the oxygen gland located in his throat increased the oxygen supply of his blood. With barely even a look backwards, the psychotic swordsman dashed off, his weapons thirsty for the blood of more victims. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

We've got these guys on the run.&quot; yelled Decker to his men.  &quot;Lets hunt them down and make them pay for the damage to our ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
Decker opened the armor storage closet and began tossing Assault shields to his men.  He took one up himself and slowly began marching down the passageway and out the hatch, firing at anyone who got close from behind the safety of his shield.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the men followed suit, marching in rows of four out the door and into the heart of the battle.  The ranks of assasins began gradually dissipating, and they began to retreat.<br>
<br>
Soon the area was clear, leaving the men to awe at the destruction of their ship, and wonder what wasteland Caron had dropped them on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, everyone...listen up!&quot; The chief gathered his men's attention.  Caron watched from just inside the ship, leaning against the hull with her arms crossed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As this was our first battle,&quot; he continued, &quot;I'll now apoint my commanding officers.  Caron, as you all know will be my advisor and second in command.&quot; A few disgruntled sighs went up from around the group.  &quot;Don't worry, I'll teach her to use her weapon before our next encounter with the enemy.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tired laugh came from his left side, &quot;You'd better, I may not be able to block those bullets next time!&quot;  Zak bent down, resting his hands on his knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which brings me to my next officer, Zak will act as my covert opperations commander.  We all saw him prove himself during the course of this, hell...he saved most of our lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Krein, with the kind of weaponry you carry, I want you at cheif engineer.&quot; he moved towards the young human as he began to protest. &quot;Look, I know this isn't your area of specialty, but the engines of this ship are hyraclion, just like your swords.  Get a group together and fix our ride fixed up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zorbus, I know your still uneasy about this mission, but I'd like you to be my psyonic weapons and defence chief.&quot;<br>

<br>
The repairs had just begun when Decker called Zak to his side.  &quot;I'd like you to take a few men and go after our attackers.  Gather any information you can...chances are they know something about this new trouble.  Report back within 24 hours...and try not to draw too much attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Zak hurried off to gather his supplies and men, Decker stepped backwards, turning towards the ship, almost running Caron over.  &quot;Oh, hello...&quot; he looked her over.  Overall, she seemed to have escaped the battle unharmed.<br>
<br>
Misunderstanding his look, she turned bright red.  &quot;Just who do you think you are.  First you call me YOUR underling and then YOU decide the groups...HA!  And now I catch you checking me out!&quot;<br>
<br>
A few chuckles came from the repair group.  Decker made a half hearted attempt to ignore them.  &quot;Look, my decisions were based on kills, how many kills did you have princess?&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked over to where Matrix sat alone.  &quot;Matrix, Caron and I will see you in her cabin now.  We need to discuss why it is your here!&quot;  He moved towards the hatch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait...whatdya mean my cabin!  That's my private living space....I'll...&quot; she trailed off, following the two men. <br>

He was already in his arena gear, the touch of the stealth suit against his skin bringing back memories. A large, bright place, where Trogian scientists did unthinkable things inside his body... it was as though a steel door had slammed on the memories, and he thought no more of them. Belted at his waist were a pair of wakizashis, a larger katana slung over his back. He shrugged the leather bands into a more comfortable position, before checking his pouch. It was fully loaded with smoke and gas charges, each pill-sized bomb capable of giving out enough cyanide gas to drop an elephant.<br>
'And now, the piece de resistance' he muttered, as he slid a syringe into the covered metallic port in his neck, replenishing the drugs that kept him alive. Under his skin, the glandular implants clicked and whirred as they accepted this new dose of life.<br>
Turning, he shouldered the pack full of demolition charges and supplies, and addressed his men. 'OK, people. This is gonna get tricky. We don't know who or what is out there. I want each man to remain in constant communication, both with the rest of the squad and with the ship. I know they're jamming our comms, which is why I smuggled aboard those highly illegal narrow-beam radios you're holding. Remember, none of you have seen ANYTHING, those things could land my ass in real trouble if we go out of the ruins.'<br>
He spun towards the door with a cry of 'Lets move out!'. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
Meanwhile, in the depths of the ruins, a group of black-clad figures manhandled something out of the darkness in the wreckage of the Terran embassy. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

<br>
“Yes, and why do you think that our mission will help you find them?” added Decker.<br>

&quot;No,&quot; Decker answered.  Matrix sat on a nearby bench.<br>
<br>
&quot;The chosen few, are three transformed superhumans, that are almost in control of the whole galaxy.  There is one from each speices. These &quot;beast&quot; were undergoing the same transformation i was.  They were part of the same organization as i was.  Only the transformation  went bazurk.  Each person wa given two much power, more than the gaurds, and operators of the facility.  They overtook the place.  Then were informed of the Solar-Plant.&quot; <br>
The two looked at him in confusion.<br>
&quot;The Solar Plant, is the planet, in which every thing in the galaxy is controled.  Weather patterns, gravity levels, all of it.<br>
&quot;What,&quot; Decker exclaimed, &quot;how come i was never informed&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because if anyone knew about it's exsistence, then the galaxy could be in danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then how do you know of it?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;well I am part of the team that defends this planet.&quot; Matrix said.  Anyway back to the chosen.  Their birth happend 200 years ago.  Then my team searched and destroyed them, at least we thought.  The remained weak, but now they are strong with life, and are willing to take back the galaxy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Decker looked puzzeled, &quot; So what does all this mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Matrix looked up and smiled, &quot;It means, hold on, cus it's gonna be a hell of a ride.&quot;<br>

In the distance a lone figure is stood wearing red, his face hidden by a helmet, he watched as a squad took off towards the Terran Embassy.

Every RPG I've done with you, you've wanted to be called Alec or Micheal. Mind telling me why?<br>
<br>
Zak moved slowly down the street, looking in all directions at the ruins and destruction. The Terran Embassy was just down the street from his position. His squad had fanned out amongst the ruins, and were covering the area. The occasional brief burst of suppressed fire whispered through the ruins, and Zak nodded with pride.<br>
The Terran Embassy was one of the few mostly untouched buildings in the ruins of the city, and for a moment Zak wondered why. Then he saw movement in the shadows, and drew his blades.<br>
What stepped out was a figure from the past, tall and powerful. Zak dropped his weapons as he collapsed to his knees, clutching at his head. The madness had arisen again, and he felt as though a hand had reached into his head, crushing his mind in a grasp of steel.<br>
'So, mighty warrior. You have returned to us' spoke the figure, the voice of death. 'I often thought that you might have died honourably on the field of battle. But when my scouts reported a man with whirling blades of power and speed, I knew that you were on this ball of dust.'<br>
'D'Archon...' Zak murmured as he rose from the ground. 'What you did to me cannot go unpunished. I have grown stronger, much stronger. If you fight me now, this will not be as our old days. I will crush you.' The utter conviction with which he spoke stopped D'Archon's advance for a moment, but the black being simply laughed and strode forwards again.<br>
Zak threw up his hand, and D'Archon was flung backwards into the wall of the embassy by a burst of sheer power. Zak calmly stooped to retrieve his weapons, and D'Archon drew his greatsword of purest shadow. With a psychic roar that resounded down the street, loud enough to shake the entire ship and cause Zorbus to collapse in seizures, the two warriors charged, blades flickering, each probing weaknesses in the other's defence. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

<br>
Zak staggered back, a dull ache in his hip where D'Archon's shadow-forged blade had slipped between his whirling steel, through the impenetrable wall of both his blades and his psionic field. He changed style, fighting purely defensively, and this saved his life as D'Archon's blade swept in high, dipping low on the backswing, deflecting Zak's defending twin blades but coming to a halt inches away from his neck as it encountered a strengthened energy field. Zak charged straight in with both weapons, but was beaten back by a series of telekinetic assualts he just barely managed to deflect.<br>
'It's no good' he muttered. 'There's only two weapons on this planet that could get through that bastards defence, and he's holding one of them'. Opening a psionic link to Zorbus, he screamed inside his mind. 'Zorbus! There is a long case in my quarters, at the back of the closet! Levitate it to my position now!' <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

Deciding that it is not a good time to interfere when two forces are colliding in such a manner, he decides to head back to the ship he saw them emerge from.<br>
<br>
As he turns around and heads back, he removes his handgun from its holster.  Cautiously he moves in the direction of the ship, stopping occasionally to check the surruonding area.  As he approaches the limits of the capital he heels like he is being watched, his suspitions are confirmed as an alarm alerts him to the people following him, not wasting any time Alec dives for cover.  Looking around the corner he notices a five blacc-clad individuals.  Staying out of sight Alec prepares himself for the worst. <br>
<br>
Suddenly the blacc-clad individuals turns around, breathing a sigh of releif Alec continues his journey back to the ship occasionally looking over his shoulder to check that he has lost the tail completely.  As he approaches the ship Alec holsters his weapon and removes his helmet revealing his battle-scarred face, ascending the ramp he hesitates for a moment but the continues, as he steps inside the ship he says &quot;excuse me I've come to offer my services, who's in charge here&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=neoangel>NeoAngel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/20/02 10:51:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=626.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Angel+ByTheGun RPG</span><hr size=1> Zak pressed the attack, driving D'Archon backwards into the wall of the Terran Embassy. But D'Archon's shadowblade weaved an impenetrable wall of darkness around him, backed by his considerable psionic shielding.<br>
'So, mighty warrior' he spoke as his blade whirled a complete circle around him, leaving his hand, cleaving through the steel wall behind him and just missing Zak before returning to his gauntleted fist. 'You still possess the blade of our master? The twin to the blade in my fist? You were a fool to leave it behind, and a fool not to disguise your sending just now. I sensed it, and intercepted it. Your martian freak friend will not be able to aid you!'<br>
'If there's one thing I learned in the fighting pits you condemned me to after our masters death' Zak retorted, 'It's that the light in the blade is the light in the heart!'<br>
His twinned blades once more crackled with energy. His torn jacket revealed a metallic implant in his spine as he spun around, a syringe embedded under his skin. As his blades crossed in the air, it hissed and injected a fluid of his own devising into his spinal cord. As his eyes began to glow with a harsh red light, his muscles bulged as the physical enhancer took affect. He grew to match D'Archons height and bulk, and his motions became more fluid.<br>
'The neural interface enhancer! They destroyed the test samples!' D'Archon gasped through his mask. 'How did you procure one?'<br>
'That's an easy one. I was one of the test samples. They removed my long-term memory, and put me in the fighting pits. But I survived. All my memory is encrypted in the hilts of these blades!' Zak cried as his swords pierced D'Archon's body, one through his throat, one effortlessly batting aside his great sword and plunging into his left eye. Zak released the hilts and collapsed to the ground, his body returning to normal as he began to spasm and blood trickled out of his nose and mouth. <p>'It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and better than both to remain unseen.'- NeoAngel. .................

She crossed her arms. &quot;How am I supposed to know your not lieing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not missing a beat, Matrix replied, &quot;You are far to young and inexperienced to know the diffrence,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you don't know me well enough to make that judgement!&quot;Caron shouted rising from her seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;In all actuality, your facade is fairly see through, and quite easy to judge,&quot;Matrix replied calmly.<br>
<br>
Taking this as a direct insult Caron began to hurl insults in Matrix's diretion, him parriying each with a calmly stated reply.<br>
<br>
After the exchange of heated words for calm remarks ahd gone on for some time, Decker, sensing impeanding physical conflict leaned over to Kale, asking quietly &quot;Shouldn't you stop her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I had direct instructions from Miss Reine not to interfere if such a situation should arise,&quot;<br>
<br>
Finding Kale useless Decker made to stop the conflict but was beaten by the voice that came in through over the intercom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Decker&quot;the voice began, Caron and Matrix instantly fell silent,&quot;Calling Decker, we have news of a soldier seriously hurt and in need of assitance. I repeat, we have news..&quot;<br>
