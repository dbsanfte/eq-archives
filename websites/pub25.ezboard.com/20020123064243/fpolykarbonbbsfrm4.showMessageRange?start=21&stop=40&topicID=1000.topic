<br>
I think my friend had Legend of Overfiend, I don't know, I only saw about the first half, and I don't think there was any rape in that, at least up to where I saw it. It was just really goofy pornography. <p><table width=100% border=0>

When I first got into anime about 11 years ago now, Overfiend was one of the first things I saw. (Along with Project A-ko, Akira, and Bubblegum Crisis.) It seemed to be ok until the nurse got <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> exploded</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from *within* by the tentacle. It went *DOWNHILL* from there. One of the &quot;highlights&quot; of the series is a &quot;Nazi Rape-Death Machine&quot;. The series is misogynistic and sadistic in the extreme. I'm with Naoko-chan. If you get your kicks from watching that, I sure as heck do not want to know you. Ecchi, I don't mind...heck, I watched &quot;Strange Love&quot; (Hen) and laughed my behind off.

OH JOY!  BRINGING LIGHT TO MY JOYLESS LIFE AND TURNING MY FROWN, UPSIDEDOWN!  After watching the first piece of crap, I figure I've had enough, and excused myself from the apartment and went home sick to my stomach.  Then about a year later, I made the mistake of just reading the title that said &quot;The something, something, something Caesar's Palace&quot; and didn't realise its part of the REturn of the Overfiend story arc (I think its either the 2nd or 3rd episode but who gives a damn).  Long story short, I popped it in the VCR, and said, &quot;Great, its that punk Amano whats-his-face again&quot;, and &quot;Hmmm... more demon rapes&quot; and &quot;Oh great, more rapes but this time, its from family members.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Make no mistake guys, try NOT to tell a girl that you are dating that you enjoy this series that includes the raping of women.  And I dare you to watch this WITH your parents.  I double dare you to watch it with your girlfriend.  Maybe that will drive my point of this series across.  Well this is what I said awhile ago: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My opinion for people who actually enjoy watching rape scenes is very low...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Notice that I said the people who <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENJOY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> watching <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> RAPE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> scenes would get a low opinion from me.  People can watch whatever the hell they want.  I'll just give out my opinion on the people who ENJOY it or thinks its &quot;COOL&quot;.  Sorry, but thats my opinion.  If you want to see nakid anime chicks, I'll gladly point out <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Cutey Honey</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Plastic Little</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, or some of the many T&amp;A titles.  F*ck, if you want consetual sex in you anime I'd even point out <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> End of Summer</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to you.  At the very least there is no rape in them... (I'm not too sure of the Cutey Honey though... just cause I didn't watch it all)  I'm not a prude.  And I'm not idealistic.. I know guys have tendencies towards liking T&amp;A stuff.<br>
<br>
Dude... I've had this &quot;conversation&quot; (not really a conversation when it was just me bitching towards him) about this &quot;anime&quot; with my former boss at Tower Video (T Records is next door so I help T Video out when they need someone to cover for them) to &quot;enlighten&quot; him of that particular series resulting in a placement far from the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Dragon Ball</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> videos (this was before the US had the DBZ saga) and into the adult area... of course I suggested to not even put on the shelves in the first place, but you can't win everything (apparently even after forcing him to watch Overfiend 4: Infernal something or whatever its titled, and him saying, &quot;are those kids or they teenagers being raped?&quot; he still had to turn a profit under the cover of it being only just animated and not real life... of course the backdrop of that story was that a kid with powers conjours up some town full of kids for what reason... I don't know nor do I actually want to find out why.).  So I just give out disgusted stares at costomers that buy this sh!t (cause thats what I think it is) or similar videos.<br>
<br>
I mean, I can be very explicit and give out details if you want.  I guess &quot;demon rape&quot; isn't as impactful as &quot;ugly demon dude rapes pretty woman and woman explodes/ripped to shreds after being violated&quot; (ooooo... people are gonna masturbate to that one!) which is more or less strewn about throughout the whole series.<br>
<br>
I don't know, maybe you guys saw the edited versions where they cut some scenes out, but the perfect collection is just like a director's cut.  Its unedited with added scenes.  Oh Joy!  More stuff to masturbate over!!!  YAY for you guys!!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> theres no way I could watch a whole movie that just had that in it but if it was like one scene that had an effect on the story line then thats different, something like perfect blue. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Spark Dazzle, there are a few number of rape scenes, albeit graphic ones, throughout the series.  To tell the truth, I don't really know why the demons need to f*ckin rape human women... constantly.  If you do know... please do tell because [angrily sarcastic] I'm sure there is a really good reason for raping women [/angrily sarcastic].  But I do know one thing, those demons are not supposedly acting out a scene like in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Perfect Blue</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> nor did the demon apologize.  <br>
<br>
And Al, I don't know what you saw... maybe it is the edited version, but demon rape scenes are one of, if not THE selling points of the UROTSUKIDOJI series.  I guess its one of them &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; kinda things.  I read that the series pushes the boundaries of over the top sexual situations... making it &quot;avant-garde&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (but not smiling)<br>
<br>
I guess you have to be a women to get as riled up as I am.  To be harrased, whistled at, felt up, treated like an object to see my point of view as to why I don't think its cool and why my opinion for people who actually enjoy watching this crap is very low... <br>

There's 11 episodes?  Ugh.<br>
<br>
I only saw the first one since at college some guy showed it to me once.  That was enough for me.  I don't really need to see medical buildings destroyed by male anatomy very often and all the other crap in that movie.<br>
<br>
I think it's just so over the top that it's hard for me to take it seriously.  I have trouble imagining people actually getting off on that crap, so I just ignore it and move on.  Maybe Naoko's right that I would have gotten more offended if I was female,  but then again, my girlfriend also saw it, and we both just thought it was odd. <br>
<br>
The worst part about this movie I think it that since it's gotten so much attention, it probably pushed back the progress of getting more anime over here.  I mean, nowadays, all the ignorant people associate it with Pokemon, but I can remember before that a lot of people always associated it with Hentai or this type of movie.<br>

I can say without hesitation that rape is an ugly nasty thing.  It's not funny, it's not cute, it's not sexy.  <br>
<br>
Oddly enough, I am not bothered by the excessive use of it in hentai.  Look at all the other insane stuff that we watch and enjoy and laugh and cheer at - killing and cruelty.  <br>
<br>
I read an article not too long ago about the usage of rape and other sexual depravations in Japanese animation and live action films (most particularly porn).  I wish I could relate the article to you and tell you why I was so impressed with the argument for the industry to continue along that line.  I don't know.  I wish I could explain myself but it's a highly sensitive area and there are no explanations that would satisfy those who are physically sickened by it.<br>

I do agree that there's something wrong with the person who is gleefully carrying on about how they watched something of this nature.  <br>

This story/plot can be used for any sort of situation and a perfect example just starred most in the face a week and a bit ago with the Twin Tower Distaster.  <br>

<br>
It could be considered in the same way as the 'strip clubs' in Japan in which men can pay to feel up wommen on mock underground trains. They are to divert people from actually doing it.<br>
<br>
To the person who asked how a girlfriend would react: my girlfreind saw some of it, and wasn't outraged with me for owning it. She just found it odd, and laughed at the part where Osakis d*ck starts glowing.<br>
<br>
I don't like the series my self, and haven't watched the tapes more than once. I'm just pointing out a, perhaps, positive reason for a guy 'enjoying' them. <br>

I dunno, its kinda hard.  Sorry Veda Sawa... I can't.  Especially if the creator intended for the scenes to be in there.  Good story or not, those scenes are intended to be there.  I mean, I cannot find a reason for those scenes to be in there other than to sell the video because it has those kinds of scenes in there.  I commend you for turning a blind eye towards it for the sake of the story as if those scenes never happened... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And going under the pretense as if editing the scenes out would somehow vindicate the anime from showing those rape scenes in the first place.  <br>
<br>
As to why you are incorporating the WTC disaster into the discussion, I have no idea.  Maybe to somehow elevate the anime's already low status as an anime?<br>

No, as Demezriel said - children actually get molested in those tapes and pictures. No one is harmed in the making of a hentai flic. If the dicussion were on a hentai anime focussing on children, I'd raise the same point. I'd find the anime sick, nevertheless, but if it stopped an actual rape occuring (I understand this is only a theory) then there would be at least one positive reason for its existence.<br>

Sorry I didn't make that clear. <br>
<br>
Anyway, whatever. It's not going to stop someone from committing rape just because they see some animated character do it, how could you possibly back that up? The reason I brought up child pornography, because whether or not it is real (someone was arrested for making 3d images of child pornography, and someone was arrested for keeping a JOURNAL about the subject, but never actually commited the act) it is still illegal. So, why not the same for rape? I'm not saying they should go to those extremes, arresting people for doing so, or making it illegal, but I certainly don't see how it helps. <p><table width=100% border=0>

I had mentioned that I know it's only a theory. We came onto this subject while talking about people who 'get off' on this kind of thing. <br>
So... if they did enjoy it and 'get off' on it, there's a chance that it might cure their need to molest a child. <br>
<br>
It's always easy to say &quot;it's just a cartoon&quot;... but there again, why is the graphic rape one of 'Urotsukidojis' selling points? There must be someone out there who is turned on by it.<br>
<br>
[Edit]<br>
<br>
I understand I might have dug myself a bit of a hole here, but I'm not supporting child porn, hentai etc... just pointing out one possible upside (it's in my nature to do this.)<br>
