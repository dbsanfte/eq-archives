He was inturupted by another falsh of light.  The angel and the undead warrior continued blasting each other while what was left of Cryrid lay cringing on the floor.<br>

The others whatched in amazement as Sonto chanted words of his ancient ansecstors.  His fireball,ready to be unleashed.  As he reached his hands back to throw, he fell to the ground.  When he hit the floor it was visible a sword had been through his back.  Cryrid's Zombie body then fell to the ground after him.  <br>
Everyone whatched in amazement.<br>
&quot;Cryrid has repaid us for his betrayel, he has taken down Sonto, for his life.&quot;  Timothy said.  <br>

Sonto will return in one day, and all of you will pay for this.&quot; The imp threw down a ball and smoke appeared in front of Sonto, when the smoke cleared up, they were gone. <p>

&quot;Perhaps we should begin to head up, we have been underground for some time,&quot;suggested Anlore. <br>

&quot;Lets get away from him as soon as possilbe,&quot;said Timothy, The group began discussing paths to take, what direction to go, and if the slope of the path might depend on where they emerge. <br>
&quot;There's is a simpler way, you know,&quot;Caprice interjected. The others stopped their discussions and turned their attention to her. She began searching through her cloak and finally pulled out a small leather bound book. She flipped through the pages momentarily, then held the book up for them to inspect.<br>

Cryrid slowly lifted his eyes. Though it was dark,he didnt see anyone. <br>
&quot;Hmm,they're gone, but so is Sonto.&quot;  He gazed down at his hands and saw that his skin has already regenerated. He reached into the darkness and felt for his sword. It was chipped.<br>
&quot;They told me to test them, but sometimes it think it is me they are testing.&quot; He said to himself.In a radiant glow, his sword became like new.<br>
&quot;I best follow them, but I think it will be wise to stay in the shadows.They have passed, but I still need to.&quot;<br>
With that, Cryrid placed his sword into its scabbard and left the darkness. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uagentcryrid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agent Cryrid</A> at: 1/26/02 4:27:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=psychosoldier>Psycho Soldier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/26/02 5:20:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok</span><hr size=1> &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; begged Limpvitch.

But how?!  Already Sonto began to wither and die.  Little from Agaolite could be salvaged, not even enough of a soul was left from Agaolite to make effective use of.  Worse still Sonto was human in body, it is almost impossible to make use out of dead human parts.<br>

<br>
Anlore approached a nearbye plant, plucking off a leaf, bright yellow in color.  He withdrew a piece of parchement from his cloak.  For a brief moment he compared the two, &quot;This is what the king needs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps it's not yet to late?&quot; offered Van.<br>
<br>
A dry wind picked up, flowing steadily from the west.  A forlorn look crossed Elil's face.  He looked to Anlore who nodded in understanding.  Elil stood before Caprice, looking deeply into her eyes.  He then dropped onto one knee, offering his sword to her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I doubted you that day in the bar.  I didn't trust you when it meant the most.  Now I offer my sword and my life to you, my queen.&quot;<br>

The others were silent, then Timothy, now in human form again, followed suite.  &quot;We have nothing left but to protect you and the balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm the greatest warrior in the land, I'll be damned if I'm going to run from a little imp and a wizard!&quot;  added Cameron, bowing at the same time.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no home or family left.  I will have revenge for them, and I will save my friends.&quot;  vowed Anlore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ey.&quot;  was all Van cared to add as he bowed.<br>

In the darkness behind them, another of their party bowed as well.  &quot;I wonder if they'll ever forgive me?&quot;<br>

&quot;Your definatly not a huaman of elf. You can't possible be a dwarf and I sincerly doubt if your an orc,&quot; She paused for a moment,thinking.<br>
&quot;And you must have a high opinion of yourself if you think you can come just floating out demanding answers without even a proper introduction,&quot;<br>
A childish smile crossed her face.<br>
&quot;Information for information. You tell us who and what you are, and if your a baddie or not. Do that, and we might just tell you who we are!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uagentcryrid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agent Cryrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(1/27/02 5:54:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: the new guy</span><hr size=1> Cryrid crouched down into some shrubs.

The creature did not speak it just hovered over the crackleing earth.  The silence was broken by a flash and Timothy's feet hit the ground.  He turned to the others without seeing the ugly creature.<br>
&quot;Guys we have a problem.  Lipvitch, some how has created Three new and improved beast of war.  In the little time he had, somehow he created some kind of war beast.&quot; The others starred at Timothy with shock, forgeting about the hovering creature.&quot;As I was flying I heared a rumbleing from the earth bellow me.  So I swooped down to see what was going on.  As I descended closer to the ground, I saw hundreds of black orcish hordes.  Each lind up in a huge square.  At the front of each army was a beast.  There were three of them.  The orcs were roaring as the creatures shouted something of another tounge, one that I don't even know.  And Behind all of them stood Lipvitch.&quot; Anlore gave a confused look upon his face.<br>
&quot;What about the king?&quot;He asked.  <br>
&quot;Don't worry i sent a messenger angel to bring the herb,and fill the king in on our situation.&quot;  <br>
