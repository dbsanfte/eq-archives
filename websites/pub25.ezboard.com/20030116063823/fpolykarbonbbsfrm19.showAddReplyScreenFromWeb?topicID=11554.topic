<br>
this is what happened<br>
<br>
when we were together like 5 months ago she said she loved me with all her heart and that'd she'd die for me, we trusted eacothers with every lil thing and even told eachother our worst things and the best too<br>
<br>
well this guy that likes her has been after her since we got together and she thinks of him as one of the best friends she has, but i think that once someone likes u like this the relationship cant be the same ever or else someone will get badly hurt, but i was ok with it, i didnt mind even though i felt a lil uncomfortable with him around her i know he meant a lot to her<br>
<br>
turns out he tried moves on her and she kinda liked em, she told him she loves him (in a friend way) but she would hug and play around with him, which obviously will make this guy get high hopes, but she wont admit it<br>
<br>
after i find out some @#%$ happens and im tottally destroyed, but she tells me she just felt good for a moment cuz he made her feel good about herself, so i let it pass by and everything is dandy again<br>
<br>
well she goes to places i find inmoral and and does things with her friends like play fight and hug a lot while at it that make me feel so uncomfortable ya know, and she does all this with that guy and the rest of her friends too but especially that guy cuz he is like SO special to her<br>
<br>
well another thing is this, shes having lots of family probs and she was SO depressed for so long, every time we talked she attacked me and was so mean to me, she noticed she was being unfair to me after she did it every time, blaming me for not being there for her when in fact i was going out of my way, forgetting about myself, to be there for her and help her through it, i did the best i could but im not a psyciatrist. anyways she talked about moving in with this guy, and i was ok with it...trust ya know...well she told me that she felt so weak, that if this guy tried a move on her that she didnt think she had the streanght to deffend herself....i was so scared...i tried to help her and i think i did in the end...but she told me how if she stays close to him he will get hight hopes....and i was like &quot;wait a minute....ive been telling u to distance urself cuz he will get high hopes and u didnt agree but now u tell me u knew all along!?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
anyways, last time we talked on the phone we were play arguing and in the end everything was cool BUT i kinda got reminded of something that happened to me in the past, so i talked to her about it ya know, just to feel her close<br>
<br>
instead what happens is that she gets all depressy cuz she thinks i blame her cuz of it, and she stays real silent for a long time, like an hour...on the phone...and i tell her i need her at the moment but she says she cant, after a long while she tells me to call it a night<br>
<br>
well after 2 days we talk again, and she tells me how she went shopping with this guy, i knew about it but she mentioned 2 more ppl, but it turns out she goes out with this guy alone cuz the others didnt wanna go in the end, and she goes to his house, and his mom has to leave, and she sleeps at his house all alone with him<br>
<br>
i trust her enough to tolerate that, i know she didnt do anything or ever will, but i dont like the fact that she does so many things with this guy, i mean, isnt she raising his hopes?<br>
<br>
another thing that really shoked me was when she was depressed about her fam probs, she saked me to trust her and not fear her anymore cuz she wont take her frustrations out on me anymore....she did after i trusted her with it....she askde me to trust her again...which i did blindly, and i still do. but then last night she said i dont trust her, and that i live in the past with all those past probs with this guy, she says i havent kept my promise of not worrying about this guy...but its so hard when she is doing all this u know, so i finally told her last night that i wanted to brake up...i was taking such a huge emotional beating, she turns things on me, its a bad habbit...when i hurt she turns into the victim....and i have to help HER with my condtion<br>
<br>
well i started thinking clearly again and didnt wanna brake, but she wouldnt accept it, she was like &quot;u broke up with me...&quot; and i pleaded and begged, and she told me how it wasnt all her fault, i tried to let her know WHY and HOW i feel about this guy, and i dont want em to stop being friends at all, just distance him a lil like any other normal person would do, its only gonna hurt either him or me or both...and so far its hurting me<br>
<br>
when i tried to explain what i felt i had to repeat our whole story from my POV, she told me to stop living in the past already..but how else can i explain my feelings whithout telling the story from my POV?....i asked her to please tell me how else to do it, she gave me a cold &quot;u figure it out&quot;<br>
<br>
well in the end she agreed to listen to my story...and she wasnt happy about it...so i did...she interupted near the end with a &quot;must we go over every lil step?&quot; so now i couldnt even use details....i finished the story...i got the &quot;u dont trust me&quot;, i said i do and she's misinterpretting what im saying, i begged her to please trust me and take MY interpretation not hers<br>
<br>
didnt listen to me....she told me shed live in the past too...that she wont forget about the bad things ive done...well im stuck with that i guess<br>
<br>
so now the deal is this...i asked her to come back with me, she told me she is scared of me...i asked her to trust me the same way i trusted her blindly after she had failed me b4 with the family probs she was taking out on me....she said she couldnt....why cant she? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ...i trusted her blindly after she failed me...why is she doing this to me, she decided to be just friends for now<br>
<br>
am i really doing something wrong? what am i doing? i think i should be the one whos scared not her <p>&quot;i think im dumb, maybe just happy&quot; Kurt Cobain<br>

<br>
I read your story and I can't help, but...<br>
<br>
&quot;am i really doing something wrong?&quot;<br>
Yes, you picked the wrong girl. Obviously you have quite different understandings of &quot;trust&quot; and the way I read your story is like she tries everything to piss you off as if she just wants you to brake up with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;i trust her enough to tolerate that, i know she didnt do anything or ever will, but i dont like the fact that she does so many things with this guy, i mean, isnt she raising his hopes?&quot;<br>
I frankly doubt that raising his hopes is your major worry here, nor would it be mine. And if you're not made for a, uhm, &quot;relationship for three&quot;, (whatever you call this, you know what I mean), then the only thing that will happen is that it'll drive you crazy.<br>
<br>
&quot;well i started thinking clearly again and didnt wanna brake&quot;<br>
Sorry, it's really not my intention at all to offend you, but to me it seems that the only moment you were thinking clearly was when you actually did brake up. It's just my opinion, but really, you need someone to open your eyes. <br>
<br>
I might be all wrong and you can never tell without hearing both sides, maybe you'll get married and live happily ever after...throwing dishes at each other all day long. Come on, you begged her for a second chance and she rejected. What are you waiting for?<br>
<br>
Have some, uhm, some more... drinks with a good friend and ask him, that's what I did on such occassions<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And usually we end up talking about cars and stuff<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sounds like this relationship has been draging you down for a while.  Push her aside and have fun.  You need and deserve it. <p><br>

I'm still a teenager and I can safely say that teenage love is not a reality, it's a game played by hormones and it's stupid. In fact I have yet to experience what bieng &quot;in love&quot; is, frankly i don't think it exists. I thought I was in love once, well that was a total fallacy; and a waste of time and energy that could have been spent on something more relevant to my overall happiness, twiddling my thumbs would have been a better use. So just don't fall into these hormone traps, they are stupid. <p>The Hate U Give Little Infants F**k Everybody<br>

They start picking out a poor guy's flaws and thinking about that other guy who's new and looks so nice and &quot;makes me feel good about myself&quot; and start throwing out lines like &quot;living in the past&quot; to justify their decision.  If somebody uses an unnatural TV-sounding phrase like that more than once they probably are just trying to convince themselves.  I'd say you're just a poor unlucky guy victim to oh-so common ficckle high school love.<br>

There is real love out there though, it's just something you gotta wait for a long time and take a lot of punches in the gut in the meahnwhile.<br>

You should try standing up for yourslef alittle more.Take charge and be a man! You should of told her not to hang out with that guy.and if she refused you should have broken up with her right then and there.And im sorry as much &quot;trust&quot;you had in her she oviously didnt care about your feelings olny hers.Thats not the type of person thats worth anyones time.<br>
<br>
I guess you Live and learn.<br>
Dont worry theres other girls out there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blackcircleboy>black circle boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/2/02 8:20:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11554.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/blackcircle/frontpageart.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: knxc</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Take charge and be a man!

well im not her father, she already has enough probs to deal with ya know, and she doesnt mean bad by being with her friend, im not gonna tell her not to do things anymore, it only causes probs and in reality some arent even big deals, maybe im the big gealous type and im discovering it this way, after all, none of u have heard her version, and i have dont some sucky stuff myself<br>
<br>
in the end we always fix things, thats how i know its more than just a teenage hormone thing, we arent after eachothers bodies either <p>&quot;i think im dumb, maybe just happy&quot; Kurt Cobain<br>

<br>
My suggestion: Be there for her as you alwayswere, just don't be so heavily invested in a relationship so mired by self-doubt and paranoia. <br>
<br>
Help her through her problems, 'cause unfortunately, as a human being you are obligated to do so, at least in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Just don't expect her to choose you in the end. It is not in your control any longer, ball's in her court now. You must respect her decision, whether or not it pleases you. <br>
<br>
But its your decision if you want to go through the pain you have for such a long time any longer. Despite what she tells you, she has caused you quite a deal of stress. <br>
<br>
Help her as much as you can, and maybe you'll find she still has trust left for you. If she doesn't, forget about her, 'cause she's made her decision.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=renoslash@polykarbonbbs>Reno Slash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/5/02 2:49:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11554.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sorry. </span><hr size=1> i agree with Nemethyst, its up to her now, she made her choice by not going back with you, from your point of view thats maybe a stupid thing and you cant understand why she wont, but im sure she has her reasons, even if they dont make sense to you, she might come to her sense in the end and see that she may have been better off being with you, and putting more trust in you, but if it doesnt, it shouldnt really surprise you, give her some time and if she doesnt coem round then ya gotta carry on with life =)<br>
<br>
jus my views, sorry bout your breakup, it must suck<br>
gd luck anyways<br>
