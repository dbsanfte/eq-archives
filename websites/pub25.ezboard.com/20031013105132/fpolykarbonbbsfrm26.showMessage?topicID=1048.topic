<br>
I'm new to this board, but I found it because I'm looking for an artist. I am a writer/artist myself and have written for both Comico and White Wolf in a background capacity as well as written numerous scripts and storyboards for computer games.<br>
<br>
I'm looking for someone who really understands the language of storytelling in Manga ala Jill thompson's &quot;At Death's Door&quot; one shot for Vertigo. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.comicbookpros.com/thompson/books/death.html">www.comicbookpros.com/thompson/books/death.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
The stories revolve around an odd couple of armored car drivers in a future Tokyo. One of them is a transplanted American, sloppy, arrogant, guilt ridden, but a  talented rough and tumble guy. The other is a Japanese, disaplined, precise marksman, and with a superiority complex the size of a Buddist bell. <br>
<br>
I've written the first three stories, but I've thought through an entire ten issue arc. They are only seven to eight pages long and are heavily influenced by the storytelling of Masmune Shirow as far as social commentary. But these ideas are brought to the surface in very fun, action oriented ways.<br>
<br>
If this sounds interesting, please respond to this post. Thaks for your interest.<br>

<br>
Thanks for your interest. I'm not so concerned with copying the style as long as it still has that Manga flavor. I've worked with artists from a range of comic book illustrating experiences from veterans where they take care of the plots, to novices where I so thumbnails to guide them. What I'm most interested in, is solid storytelling ability, the ability to really fill the panel (not scrimp on the backgrounds because they serve a storytelling purpose), and a solid understanding and execution of perspective. I also need someone who will be dedicated enough to do the work in a timely manner.<br>
<br>
I will be doing all the lettering, coloring, and post production as well as writing.<br>
<br>
As far as more of the story, I can tell you that every story somehow relates to something that is happening in our world today. For instance, the first story is really about how  our culture of sensorship; how everything in the world these days is watered down so that it is safe for a seven year old child, from TV to consumer products. And how this can lead to deeper societal problems as adults look to individual grown-up diversions.<br>
<br>
In the story, everyday adults in the future are so bored by this watered down culture that they seek their own, often sinister hobbies. &quot;Idle hands are the devil's plaything.&quot; And in this case that means creating a giant robot in order to commit crimes.<br>
<br>
At the same time, the story is about people's preconcieved notions about other people's culture. For instance, many Americans see Manga and Anime as simply big eyed characters, speed lines, and giant transforming robots.<br>
<br>
In addition, there are underlying themes of nationalism and technology vs. humanity that will be played up in every story.<br>
<br>
The best part is that all this heavy stuff is underneath a really fun and action packed exterior. So if you don't care about those things, you'll still have a fun and entertaining read.<br>
<br>
I hope this has piqued your interest. I'd love to see some of your work and I'd appreciate any leads you send my way. However, I cannot pay anyone for their work at this time. But I can guarantee that it will see print either by a publisher or myself.<br>

<br>
Nice stuff. Keep working at it. But I need someone with a bit more experience. Figures are great, but placing a figure in an environment is even better. There's an awesome book on perspective that is both easy to read (It reads like a comic book.) and very informative. It's called &quot;Perspective for Comic Book Artists.<br>
<br>
Take care.<br>
