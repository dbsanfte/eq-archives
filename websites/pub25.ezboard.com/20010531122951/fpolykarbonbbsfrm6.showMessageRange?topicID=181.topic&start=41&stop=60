Hehehe maybe they're all gay, yeah that's it :P lol!!! It's weird, today after class i saw one of the guys that was in my storyboarding class, and so i stopped and said hi to him and he was just talking about how he has no time for anything but school and work and &quot;what eve happened to dating&quot; and then he HUGGED me and said good bye...... hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm am i readin too much into this or was he sort of flirtin with me? :P  i dunno..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub89.ezboard.com/uzaprowsdower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZapRowsdower</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <b>Member</b><br> <font color=#336699>(2/20/01 2:40:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.spinhead.com/tristan/cast.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Flirt?</span><hr size=1> ::rowsdower appears out of nowhere::<br>
<br>
It takes no confidence to Flirt...just inteligence.<br>
<br>
Example. You happen to notice the person accross the room look away when you look past them (happens to ALL of us dont be modest). <br>
<br>
Cure. Stare at them till you make eye contact...then give em a slight smile and wave kinda non-shalantly.<br>
<br>
Very easy to do and conveys alot...basicaly yea I see yas, hI  whats up?.<br>
<br>
But then of course you start getting confidence, and with confidence comes girlfriends and sharing secrets and all that &quot;stuff&quot;, so its easier to stay away. But thats just my opinion.<br>
<br>
And yes there is a definate &quot;Tenchi&quot; resembalance there. DO all the ladies &quot;glomp&quot; you?<br>
<br>
Eh? Eh?<br>
<br>
J/K<br>
<br>
ZAP!!<br>
<br>
[edit after reading above post]Yea he was flirting. That was kinda a given. Do yourself a BIG favor...dont try to cheat the system by taking some &quot;flirt&quot; way of getting a date. Ol' gal natures got everything worked out and just wait. You skip some steps you get a bad future.<br>
<br>
Or a flat cake...either or neither or both.<br>
<br>
[edit after reading Ryo's post]Ok last edit I swear. Yea dont worry about confidence. There are two thing in this world that are a FACT. ONE-everyone has a twin. Weither the twon is a REAl twin (like brother) or jsut a friend doesent matter. TWO-Everyone has something in them that draws people to them. No-one knows how it works, but trust me...It does. SOme people can stand in a corner and attract the opposite sex like flies. But your guarnteed at least ONE person will allways be attracted to you. It might take some searching though.<br>
<br>
Now in my case I've met my twin. Nice guy...we use dto trick his mom by dressing alike and both callering her &quot;mom&quot;. And my &quot;attraction thing&quot; works like a charm. Now I want to know how to turn it off so that all the old (shallow) girls from school will stop calling my house, so I can play UT.<br>
<br>
Wait did that sound shallow? <p><A HREF="http://manga_group0.tripod.com/MG.html"><IMG SRC="http://manga_group0.tripod.com/sse3.jpg"></A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub89.ezboard.com/uzaprowsdower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZapRowsdower</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/20/01 2:53:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub89.ezboard.com/umoodring.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moodring</A></span><br> <b>Member</b><br> <font color=#336699>(2/20/01 6:41:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Breakers/3749/smallhead9.gif W=90 L=109></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flirt?</span><hr size=1> wow zap, you wrote so much i don't know what to reply to hehehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    you sound like you've had alot of experience with this kinda thing though!<br>
<br>
The thing that shocked me about the guy hugging me is that i don't know him very well at all!! i've only talked to him once before this, so it was a little strange...  but i have noticed him lookin at me during classes before :P hmm i dunno, maybe he's just nice<br>
<br>
so zap... you met your twin???  that's just weird.... how'd that happen??<br>
<br>
<br>
hey ryo, i have something cool for you... i dunno if i should post it or if i should send it to your e-squail adress <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub89.ezboard.com/umoodring.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moodring</A> at: 2/20/01 7:34:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub89.ezboard.com/uzaprowsdower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ZapRowsdower</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <b>Member</b><br> <font color=#336699>(2/20/01 7:31:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.spinhead.com/tristan/cast.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dang lucky...</span><hr size=1> I dunno...I have some wierd Ferris Beuler luck or something. <br>
<br>
To start with...im non-shalant. ANYTHING goes and it usualy doesent have much of an effect on me. Thats wierd...I dont get it...I could get shot and the only thing I would think about would be the MegaTokyo tomorrow by Mike Poe of ExploiataionNow. Although for reasons still unknown to me, listening to anime music makes me burst into uncontrolled song. And watching Tenchi Muyo is one of the rare times I smile (for real).<br>
<br>
Anyway so of course it would be with my dumb luck and non-shalant ness that I walk into my 4th period class to find that out of 40 students only 4 besides me were guys...three of the 4 guys were freshmen...the last was maried allready and so cool that I would surrender my firstborn to him if asked.<br>
<br>
My responce to seeing so many gals in one place...<br>
&quot;Aw crap...&quot;<br>
<br>
My life is littered with EXTREME LUCK. I dont know how how ive survived most of the stuff thats happened to me, but its all been fun.<br>
<br>
So yes I have plenty of experience in that kinda stuff...sad to say. <br>
<br>
And the twin experience was funny. He wasnt home when my dad and I went over, but the first thing I knew was being told to &quot;clean my room&quot;...???...he had a nintendo and lived close to his house...we were inseperable. Then he moved to Arazonia and I havent seen him since.<br>
<br>
Ah well, thats life.<br>
<br>
And the guy hugging you was in fact more than likley just a &quot;guy-thing&quot;. Why did he do that you ask...its a guy thing.<br>
<br>
I ofter hugged the gals but it was mostly cause the ravenous nerds were getting too close...they would chase ANYTHING with 2 legs...and stuff...yea...<br>
<br>
Well anyway...<br>

Nooooooo!!!!!! hehehe i meant serial yeah that's it :P hehe  well i think i'm pretty safe when i walk around, cause i only go places in the day.. except one time i went to the emergency room at like 12 midnight. eek!  it was so strange because there were almost NO people out... it was so quiet! then my brother and i had to walk back to the apartment at 3AM  (and the next day i had class erg!)<br>
<br>
Zap!! LOL your mom says that huh? is she a true san francisco driver? man the people are crazy here! everybody screaming insults out their windows... sheesh!!! it's crazy! not to mention rude :P  (no offense to you mom, hehe i didn't mean it that way)<br>

Ya see she wasnt the best ever little kid...so when my loud little brother ask questions like &quot;What happens when you get caught ditching class?&quot; her responce was &quot;I odnt know...I never got cau-UM...nevermind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shes way cool...<br>
<br>
But shes also kinda short...shes 5' 5'' and im like 6'4''...so of course when she gets a car she gets the GRAND CARAVAN!!! The whole deal...V8 engine...nice interior...yea its her baby.<br>
Anyway...<br>
Im just learning how to drive...and of course the only other car around to practice in was a stick shift...<br>
<br>
My first time out im driving along...yay!! this is easy!!  when I see another car coming towards me on the the opposite side of the street...I move over to give em room...[pause time]<br>
Now you have to take into account multiple things...one-this is my first time out. two-i hadnt really gotten the power of a V8 under ocntroll yet, so we were at about 35 MPH. and three-the street were crowded with a U-haul truck parked way out on my side of the road.<br>
[/pause time]<br>
...as I look over to make sure that they have enough room I hear some strange noicses coming from my mom...they sounded like:<br>
&quot;s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-[at this point i noticed that the mirror of the u-haul truck actually PASSED OVER my mirror on the right hand side]::profanity-filth-and more profanity::s-SLOW DOWN!!&quot;<br>
<br>
When I got a car it was a Kia Sportage...big enough for me and 3 other guys comfortably...way zippy...but small enough to fit into some pretty tight spaces...which leads to a funny story about me merging off the coronado bridge with my dad...<br>
<br>
But thats enough typing for now...Laters!<br>

<br>
Im still working on &quot;red light means stop&quot; thing, so I hit my brakes alot. Other than that, im an OK driver. My Sportage is pretty fast for a sportage and since its higher off the ground I can run over stuff like people and boxes and i wont usualy hit them. Makes for interesting races.<br>
<br>
Anyway im cominf off the coronado bridge when I notice that the trafic is stopped and im moving at about 65 MPH...I then noticed a sign by the side of the road which read &quot;Merge or die.&quot;<br>
<br>
I merged from 65 MPH to 5 MPH in a spage about 1 foot bigger than my car (6 inches in front and back)...the guy in front of me looked in his rear view morror once and turned the raido up...the gal behind smiled and waved...my dad made small wimpering noises and slowly uncurled from his fetal position...<br>
<br>
Its hard to drive while being angrily glared at.<br>
<br>
I have some other horor stories but most of em arent that big. <br>
