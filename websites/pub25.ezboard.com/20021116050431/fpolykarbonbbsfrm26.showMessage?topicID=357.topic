Gimme your opinions if you manage to read this. Here:<br>
<br>
My fourth take on the plot I’ve developed for over four years now. This time, however, I’ve probably outdone myself as far as the subplot goes.  The subplot is basically what brings about this millenial war of superhumans.<br>
<br>
        The invention of a new type of weapon (undetermined) brings about the Second Manifest Destiny movement. While the original manifest destiny involved the atlantic-pacific domination of North America, this new manifest destiny involves a worldwide war campaign for the control of all the nations. While US has already taken absolute control over both North and South America, Japan has conquered more than half of Eurasia (thanks to the defeat of a worn down Russia) and Africa.<br>
        Between the two sides, all that is left to conquer is Europe and the EU, which has been torn apart by the introduction of a power hungry dictator, who is believed to be the antichrist. By the time both nations are ready for a full scale assault, Europe has been completely dominated by this man.<br>
        Once the campaign for Europe starts, this dictator not only gives all the land to Japan (because Japan had the most potential for technological improvement) but he also hands over the information necessary to create the extremely deadly Bose-Einstein superconductive freeze bombs.<br>
        These weapons could be programmed to target only certain regions (through use of magnetic fields) and drop modified “warheads” into the area. These warheads start an ultracoolant reaction, dropping the temperatures of the confined area to approximately 170 billionths degree Kelvin (0 Kelvin is absolute zero, and slightly under 170 billionths of a Kelvin is the point at which the fifth state of matter occurs: Bose-Einstein), and forces all matter within this confined space to become one. The reasons this matter is so deadly is due to the fact that everything within the magnetic fields become one, for a temporary amount of time, and once the warmth turns the area back to standard temperature (which is extremely fast, due to thermal energy from the sun) everything is gone.<br>
        The use of this weapon forces the US to surrender inevitably, and Japan is declared the victor, but the weapon disrupts the magnetic plates and brings about the destruction of the world. The dictator (who knew this would happen) has already created New Earth, and named it Japangaea.<br>
        This dictator’s name is revealed, but extremely questionable. His birth name is Robert Pegasus (this is intended; Robert means Bright Fame and Pegasus means Strong), but the names he is given by his supporters is Baal Baldev: “Lord of Strength,” and his opposers dub him Adam Abaddon: “Destruction of Earth/Ruin of Earth.” This negative name becomes very important later on.<br>
<br>
Still awake? Here’s how the story goes:<br>
        It will take place in three books.<br>
THE FIRST BOOK<br>
<br>
The first book will involve Sorcan Warmao Kaier, who eventually becomes “Hazama Maokai” the first of the Genesis (“birth”) species: humans who have been born into substantial omnipathic power. This species has existed for well over one hundred years, but Sorcan was the first to awaken these abilities, in which he becomes Hazama. Hazama’s mission is to destroy Pegasus. This is due to a series of events involving the “death” of Sorcan’s wife by the hands of Pegasus, in which Pegasus reveals that he has created a virus that will enhance the powers of regeneration and create the perfect Genesis. The test subjects of this “enhancement virus?” Pegasus himself, Sorcan, and a number of others who have the qualifications to become a Genesis. Pegasus kills Sorcan’s wife (Selina, essentially the most important character near the conclusion) as a means of awakening the virus. The emotional trauma send the virus into activity, and Sorcan is forced into an immortal rampage to control his godlike powers and destroy Pegasus. During this book, Selina becomes Di Ira, a Genesis who has exceptionally powerful kinetic abilities, and becomes the eventual mother of the twins Hiban Senshi Maokai (unique warrior) and Kuro Jiro (dark second son) Maokai. Also, the spilt blood of the 4 “perfect” Genesis (Those who ultimately control their powers and avoid self-annihilation, including Hazama, Pegasus, Selina, and an enormous freak named Touchi) are gathered by the Shihaisha Goibnyu (a single blood cell contained more than 50% of the energy a normal human possessed) and forged into ceremonial swords, which give birth to yet another superweapon later on. The end of book one involves the deaths of Hazama and Pegasus by the hands of Touchi, who is ultimately the most absurdly demented and sadistic of the four. Di Ira slays Touchi, but his blood infects her, and eventually leads to her second death four years later.<br>
<br>
<br>
BOOK TWO<br>
        Between the first and second books, Hiban becomes a vigilante against the organization that threatens the very existence of the Genesis; the leader of which is his corrupted brother Kuro. The four ceremonial swords are scattered during the conflict. This is further explained throughout the second book.<br>
        The Third book will involve the great grandson of Hazama, Gabriel Maokai III, and the direct son of Pegasus, Adam (remember? Adam has inherited eternal youth from his father’s virus)<br>
        The four ceremonial swords contained so much energy that each sword triggered a chemical reaction that changed the substance of the surrounding area into unique metals. These metals each have unique and exceptional properties, but they all have a similar energy imbalance that gathers energy around them. These metals are harvested after almost 200 years of growth, and formed into armlets to be used by Genesis, now called Kizoku. Each metal is different, however, and is actually determined by it’s owner’s own willpower. Hazama’s metal collects more energy when surrounding movement is more chaotic. Di Ira’s metal constantly collects energy, but the energy is spent by the cells of the body (and actually increases the ability to regenerate from wounds faster). Pegasus’ metal gathers energy from surrounding lifeforms, mostly Genesis, rather than electrical, nuclear, or radiant energy. Touchi's metal constantly collects energy, from both surrounding lifeforms and the wearer, quickly killing all surrounding lifeforms.<br>
        Using omnipathic abilities (which have become progressively stronger since Hazama) this new generation are able to slow down time by gathering massive amounts of kinetic energy, convert that energy into potential energy, and use that massive amount of potential energy to increase the power of physical attacks (for example, if they threw a ball, the ball could go at about 1000 mph, the speed of gas particles). This is the common method of fighting for the duration of the series.<br>
        Gabriel has inherited a large sum of land and money from his family, who have descended as warriors and protectors of Japangaea throughout. Gabriel, who has become more of a heroic figure due to his father’s involvement in a war against anti-Genesis movements. Two soldiers, Tatakai Yousai (war fortress) and Eva Saiai (life beloved) inform Gabriel of his father’s death by the hands of Adam and Adam’s soldiers, who have become the third fighting force in the war. Throughout the book, a skilled assassin named Rillek, three powerful female Kizoku (Alecia, Kenmei, and Saisei), and a doubtful ally named Koi. This group makes up Gabriel’s troope, and these warriors are ordered to eliminate Adam. <br>
        This book is to conclude with the reawakening of Touchi with the death of Adam (by the hands of Koi, who dies in the process), and Touchi begins his final genocidal attack on Japangaea.<br>
<br>
<br>
BOOK THREE<br>
<br>
        Although I haven’t worked out all the details, it involves the ethereal reawakening of all the characters via the destruction of the swords by Touchi. Eva has been chosen as Di Ira’s successor, and Gabriel has become his great grandfather’s figure. Koi was originally chosen as the successor to Pegasus’ power, but his death has given Rillek his agenda, and Rillek has become insane from the conflicting agendas. Touchi has become a freakish beast due to the violent nature of his death(s), and now resembles an enormous war-torn undead demon. I have no idea where to go from there, but the book basically revolves around how Touchi manages to destroy most of Japangaea. Eventually, it will end with Japangaea’s apocalypse, and the rebirth of mankind, and how history will be forgotten, and repeated. <p><b>Gaealord Gabriel Angelo Maokai III</b>

<br>
New Earth and Japan's victory and the Bose-Einstein bombs were all planned out by Pegasus, because he wanted to destroy the earth, and for humanity to restart in a new country (kind of like washing away sins). He could not control America even if he wanted to, and due to the US current culture (presently extremely hostile), and Japan's current culture (usually polite and open to foreigners), he chose to allow Japan to exist as the supreme country, and gave them the weaponry to eliminate America, and Earth, so he could finally bring into effect the new planet. This way he could start an entire new world, and this world can become mobile and gather materials needed to exist if necessary.<br>
<br>
And also, the purpose of the book is to show the destruction of mankind through evolution (how man is afraid of change, and thus fights against it)<br>
