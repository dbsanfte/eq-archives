<br>
The king sat alone in his throne, peering beyond his large windows and watching the shadows of the clouds wimst themselves across the hills of the farm land.  His brow was moist with perspiration from his fever.  He was sick and in danger of dying.  The king was favoured by his citizens as one whom was fair, just, and kind.  His son, the prince, was foultempered; always a self-centered brat from the day he was born.  The king knew this and hoped that he would not have to leave the kingdom to his son.  Yet, another heir was impossible to find.  He had to somehow lengthen his days on Isuria so he could continue to govern his Ringfeld Kingdom in peace.<br>
Doctor Recnac, whom the king trusted for many years, told of an herb; the Lilywild of the Northern Mountains.  With it the Doctor would be able to create a medicine that would cure the King's ailments and lengthen his life for at least a few more years.  Feeling it his best chance, the King has sent out a summons to the bravest and strongest adventurers in the land.  The trip ahead for these warriors will be tough and filled with many obsticals to overcome.  Only now the King must wait for the warriors to arrive.<br>
<br>
((I'll RP the King for the first couple of posts, until the party gets underway.  If you wish to join, RP yourself getting the summons and showing up at the castle.  First one to show up gets to name the head guard.  When just about everyone has appeared, I'll come back in as the King and get you guys on your way.  Have fun! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uwinlabik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Winlabik</A> at: 12/7/01 5:28:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uakumatavlore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akuma Tavlore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/7/01 6:35:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aol.com/PromoArt/LotRLegolas63.jpg.45581.1.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> Then while the kings worries grew I came, Anlore the Orcslayer, the legendary elven warrior rushed in, his long golden hair flowing behind him and glinting in the sun(as is most elves hair).

His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked against the knewly polished floors.  He knelt down before the king and lowered his arms at his side.  The king looked down at the young warrior, and greeted him &quot;Welcome my son, are you here for the great quest?&quot;<br>
&quot;I am,&quot; said the young fighter.&quot;I am Timothy.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where are you from my boy?&quot; The king asked.<br>
&quot;For I have lived many places my lord.  I was recently a gladiator.  One of few who has won their freedom.

Upon the faces of each warrior was the look of honor and of duty; these brave men were certainly the ones to take on the task.<br>
&quot;Greatings my loyal subjects, I am glad you answered my summons.&quot;  The king coughed slightly and leaned forward in his throne.<br>
&quot;I am terribly ill, in fact, I am on the verge of death.  It is a slow disease that will claim me within the next fall; however, there is a medicine that can cure me.  It can only be made from an herb found to the north in the mountains of Lusithia, just past the Kingdom of Shadows.  The journey will be throught with danger and perils for you to face.&quot;<br>
The doors to the chamber opened and the court armourer entered, behind him several guards carried trunks filled with armour and weapons.<br>
&quot;Ah, good.  Gentlemen, this is the court armourer Phillip of Derthchester.  If you wish, you may take your pick of weapons and armour from the chests, Phillip will custom fit or improve anything you need.&quot;  The king motioned to the head guard to come forward.  &quot;And this is my Chief Guard and trusted friend Gardelf of Gandford.  He will give you provisions and a map to assist you on your journey.&quot;<br>
The king rose from his throne, watching as all in the hall knelt in respect to him.  &quot;I am growing weary now, and must retire to my chambers.  I trust that you will find what you need from both Phillip and Gardelf.  Good luck, men.&quot;<br>
The king left through a door behind his throne, leading to his main chambers.  The warriors stood after he left and began to prepare for the journey.<br>
<br>
((Okay, I'm gonna make my exit; you guys have fun now. ^_^  I think you should probably have a small meeting while looking at the &quot;map&quot; that you got from Gardelf.  Also, don't forget: NO PERSONAL ICONS OR SIGS.  If someone else shows up and wants to join the party, let them in.  When we come in for a close, I'll start posting again as the king...  Uh...

After a few hours of fighting crowds, they began to realize how tired they were.  <br>
       They headed for a nearbye Inn.  Anlore was the first to the door.  He turned to wait for his comrades when a halfling ran into him.  He turned to confront the dirty fellow, but before he could say anything the halfling ran into another man.  <br>
       He was bigger in build than Anlore, and and was wearing a cloak.  This cloak was dark, and seemed almost to go on forever, like the night sky.  He lifted the halfling clear off the ground and brought him back to Anlore, where the others were now waiting by his side.<br>
       &quot;Say your sorry to the good man&quot;, said the stranger, setting the short fellow on the ground.  He seemed to shrink in the presence of the larger man.  &quot;I'm sorry&quot; came a surpriseingly deep voice, and he turned to leave.<br>
       &quot;Aren't you forgeting something?&quot; said the man.  The halfling turned back, this time looking the cloaked man straight in the eye, &quot;Look Night, I don't go around hurting your business... oh, why do you do this to me?&quot;  Then a peice of parchment and a sack came out of the halfing's cloak.  Anlore recognised this as the map, and his wallet containing all of his money.  After handing them over the little man simple walked away, grumbling to himself all the while.<br>
      Now the man turned to The three men.  You should be more carefull in a town which has such a strong theives guild.<br>
I'm Elil Duran, but my freinds call me Night.  He pulled back his cloak, revealing his obviously elven features.  Long blond hair, and eyes which almost matched his cloak were his most dominant features.  &quot;I am a drifting ranger, but for now I find harassing the theives here something to do in an all but peicefull world.  Come inside though, may I buy you men a drink?&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukaminosenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kami no Senshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/10/01 11:18:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Polykarbon Roleplaying, Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> &quot;A drink will do nicely&quot; said Cryrid,who was checking his pouch to make sure it was still there. &lt;It's amazing how all elves look the same&gt; thought Cryrid as he followed Night and Anlore.<br>
