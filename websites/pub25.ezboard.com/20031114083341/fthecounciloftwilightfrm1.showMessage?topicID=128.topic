I had no idea that Velious had 3 different factions to work toward.  How does this influence our Guild?  I'm guessing we currently have dragon faction, based on the fact that Gorenaire did not seem inclined to chew us up the other night.  Plus, I imagine our giant faction can't be good after bringing down all their brethren in the Rathe Mountains.  But what about Thurgadin?  Isn't that the dwarves?  Nine?  I realize that this board discusses places too high for us now.  What I want to know is:  should we be concerned with this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uopusorcharmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Opus Orcharmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(9/5/01 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Velious Faction</span><hr size=1> OK the answer to this is very simple. I talked to my cousin Rexx in Thurgadin. He said all we need to do is kill giants. They are big ugly and stupid. No one will miss a few giants. Also, killing giants makes everyone happy. Dwarves and Dragons both hate giants. Killing dwarves is simply out of the question. I cant abide by murdering my own relatives to get ahead. It would be like Druids and Rangers killing bears. I am very concerned that Curlington and Tormenter have different ideas. The evil members of the guild may try to help the giants kill dwarves. So keep an eye on them. <br>

Glad you brought this up Gilraen, I was planning on giving my views on it soon anyway, as it is something that does become very important in Velious.<br>
<br>
First off, the factions of Velious and the factions of Kunark are very different.<br>
<br>
In Kunark, we have the liberty of starting out generally allied towards dragons.  In Velious, the dragons don't share the warm fuzzy feelings their Kunark brethren do, and start out attacking first, asking questions later, until you prove your loyalty towards them.  The main faction for dragons is called Claws of Veeshan.  Their leader is on it's own faction named after himself, Lord Yelinak.<br>
<br>
Kunark giants start out wanting to attack everyone, and for the most part the same is true for their Velious equivalents.  However I have heard tale that they do welcome into their arms those who worship Rallos Zek, The God of War.  I'm sure that doesn't apply to the majority of our Councillors.  There are 3 factions associated with giants, Kromrif, Kromzek and their leader's faction (which other giants are on as well), King Tormax.<br>
<br>
Lastly are the Coldain Dwarves.  They are on their own faction, and start out viewing everyone apprehensively, without acception, possibly showing a bit more favor towards Brell followers, they talk about him much.  Like the dragons they only have 2 factions, Coldain and the faction named after their leader, Dain Frostreaver IV.  There are a large number of dwarves in Icewell keep that are on Dain faction, and everyone starts out being glowered at dubiously by him.  Safe, but right on the borderline.<br>
<br>
Okay, now that you know the basics, perhaps you want to know which is best?  Well, it depends.  I'll look at a few points that are pretty important.<br>
<br>
Cities:<br>
Thurgadin is easily the best city, with just about every resource you would require right there.  Kael is very large, but has fewer merchants and tradeskill stations (forges, ovens, etc.).  Skyshrine is very primitive, they only have a few merchants, which sell food, gems and some spells.  All the cities have a bank.  However, people that have good Skyshrine faction, usually also have good Coldain faction (there is a way to have good Skyshrine and Kael faction, but it really takes far too much work).<br>
<br>
Travel:<br>
Having poor Coldain faction wouldn't have as much of an impact as having bad dragon or giant faction.  The Coldain must be very lazy (too much alcohol I suppose), as they don't wander much.  Most of the zones in Velious have wandering giants, so they're always a threat.  To get anywhere in Velious besides Thurgadin, Great Divide, Eastern Wastes and Iceclad Ocean, you have to either port or run through Kael Drakkel.  The higher level ports in Velious that druids and wizards get (Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) are frequently guarded by beings on Claws of Veeshan faction, the worst being Wuoshi guarding the Wakening Lands portal.<br>
<br>
Armor:<br>
The main reason for faction being so important in Velious.  Some of the best armors in the realms are the ones that are awarded through quests given by the 3 factions in Velious.  The Thurgadin pieces are generally considered the poorest quality of the 3, but also are the easiest ones you can get.  They also require the least amount of faction to be able to do the quests, requiring you only be viewed warmly, whereas giants and dragons wish you to be allied before they give you their armors.  The giant armors have better armor class than the other 2 sets in general, while the dragon armors give more hp and other stats.  The quest pieces for giant and dragon armors drop in Temple of Veeshan though, which requires at the least 2 groups of very high level (58+ for that few people, 55+ if bringing quite a bit more).  The quest pieces for Thurgadin drop primarily in the &quot;Arena&quot; area of Kael, which at the minimum can be done by one group of probably 53+ if they take their time.  Also drops in other places through the zone, have even heard of a piece dropping by the Wakening Lands zone, which usually consists of giants around 40th level, give or take 5.<br>
<br>
Side benefits (or hunting the enemy):<br>
Those that choose to side with giants probably have the best fringe benefits while hunting the Coldain and the Dragons.  There are a couple sets of armor that drop in Skyshrine...Guardian and Sentry armors.  There is also armor that drops in Icewell Keep I believe, Royal Velium Frosted.  These armor sets are very good and can be acquired while increasing faction with the giants.  Hunting giants doesn't net a lot of drops outside the quest pieces, but there are some decent ones (giant scalemail armor, some various pieces here and there).  I believe most of the quests originating from Plane of Growth and the Tunarean Court involve hunting giants, so our tree-hugging friends could definitely benefit in that regard.<br>
<br>
Quests:<br>
Probably the best quests are given by the Coldain and the Dragons.  The coldain prayer shawl and ring quests are very good items and interesting quests, although a bit tradeskill heavy.  The giants have a fair number of quests, but the items they give out you can get by killing them for the most part.<br>
<br>
Increasing factions:<br>
Killing giants gives dragon and coldain faction, and decreases giant factions.<br>
Killing coldain lowers your coldain faction and increases giant faction.<br>
Killing dragons lowers your dragon factions, and increases giant factions.<br>
<br>
So killing giants gets your Coldain and Claws of Veeshan up at the same time.  You can increase giant faction without hurting coldain faction by killing dragons and their allies (several 40ish mobs in Skyshrine), however killing the Coldain is probably the most accessible way of increasing giant faction.<br>
<br>
Well, any further questions, feel free to ask me.  We should discuss what we want to do as a guild with regards to faction.  Lora is allied to both dragons and coldain, and didn't take very much killing giants to get that way.  One idea that might not be bad would be hunting in Skyshrine some to increase giant faction, just so getting around Velious is easier until we're higher level to start doing the armor quests.  We can also get some nice items while hunting in Skyshrine, such as the Sentry and Guardian armors and coin purses which can reduce the weight of coins you carry.  Might be a good idea to just hunt there until we were non-KOS to giants and then leaving however, so if at a later date we wish to be allied to dragons we can switch rather easily.  Although it wouldn't be much of an issue until we wanted to pass through Skyshrine, which we would probably do a lot of Kael hunting at any rate.<br>
<br>
All input is welcome, hopefully I've given enough facts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uopusorcharmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Opus Orcharmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(9/6/01 10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Velious Faction</span><hr size=1> Well Chancelor has taken us on two giant hunting trips in the Great Divide.
