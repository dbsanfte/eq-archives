A story of three humans, a seven thousand year old mechanical armor, and the vagrants of galactic civilization.<br>Now… their story starts just before humanity’s golden age… The time was of war, dissident… and strife… but humanity endured… and the legend begins…”<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Year 2527, Earth had reached a state of global affluence and prosperity, governed by a planetary congress of each country, nation, and organization. Humanity had finally reached for the stars; the past five hundred years saw several space colonies, habitats on the moon and Mars, and the seven Asteroid Mines orbiting the Moon.<br>But all was not well with humanity, Dissidents, rebellions, and terrorism were abound.<br>The Earth Coalition Directorate, Or the ECD, Monitored the groups intently.<br>However, these Terrorists gave the political leaders of countries and nations the popular power to brand any group as a dissident. Arms manufactures, rouge elements of the Armed forces, the dissidents that were tracked down, all were faced with extinction or escape to the only true apolitical zone: Space.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lunar Orbit, June Fifth<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Asteroid Mine OI-5, Owned and excavated by the space-based weapons developer Orion Industries, was the site of a new and terrible discovery; an alien artifact, one that had left a mark on the galaxy thousands of years ago, and one that would leave yet another mark again.  The Asteroid continued it’s new path around the Moon, having being moved there two years previously, content to hold its secrets, and watch the events unfold.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mars Orbit, August fifteenth<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mars had been the place of the second planetary colony, and where the first examples of extraterrestrials had been found, just some old buildings, tools, and bones.<br>The human colony had it’s own space combat group, eight mid range spacecraft, two cruisers and a supply tug that patrolled the orbit of mars and it’s moons. The current group was bored, as usual, and complained to each other.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, I suppose, god this sucks!” Mars-2 said.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, it’s good pay, and the locals are actually quite interesting, hardly and civilized filth.” His wingman said, he rocked his stubby ship side to side along with his response.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hell yeah the civvies are great, specially the women!” Mars-8 chimed in.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Amen and God bless us all!” Reverend agreed.<br>“Hey Lars… I gotta strange sig a second ago… looked about two klicks away on your side.”  Reverend called to Mars-2, or lieutenant Lars Bright. Lars gave his leader a thumb's up and turned to investigate. Lars looked down at the screen inside his cramped cockpit; the signal data was being transferred to his ship from Reverend’s. He lit upon the space and counter-thrusted, stopping in a slow glide.<br><br>“Nothing here…” He said, he tilted his visor up and gave a bare-eyed search of the star-field. <br>“Wait… Oh Holy Mother of God and @#%$!!!” Lars turned and banked hard, effecting a one-seventy degree turn from a standstill. The first volley of purple light lanced past his fighter, continuing on and stitching a line across Deimos. The second volley tore through the fuselage of the small craft, burning the paint away and nearly destroying it. Lars and his ship were lucky to be in one piece, let alone be alive.  <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reverend turned with the rest of his command, breaking for Deimos base. <br>The light beams streaked past Mars-6 from the left, then below, final from both right and above for the kill. Mars-6 clawed franticly at the controls as the beams shredded the ship in a blossom of fire. The seven other ships increased their thrust and ran even more.<br>Mars-4 crumpled for no apparent reason, then, a flare of energy lit up the unexploded wreckage and it’s cause.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was large, about forty feet tall, if it was on land. It looked humanoid, bipedal. <br>Two arms ended in two fingered hands with two opposing thumbs. It had wings, like a bats’. The face was the most disturbing; it was a long-necked lizard like shape covered in spines. The whole thing was a dark reflective black with blue and red highlights. It twitched its tail and opened it’s mouth, the purple death beams lanced out and shredded another fighter. Lars had limped behind it and toggled to fire all his ships weapons at once. Lars screamed and pressed the trigger…almost.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Something shoved a spike of pure light into Lars’s mind, stopping his finger before it pressed.<br>The lizard turned to face Lars and his ship, and its eyes glowed a cold blue.<br>Lars broke the barrier however, and depressed the trigger, dumping a swarm of missiles at the lizard machine. Lars switched the weapons to the space cannons, built like dual sabot type cannons. The missiles engulfed the dark machine, obscuring its polished metal skin.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Earth, Washington State, Sector Six Seattle<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am is so much @#%$!” Nick Rand swore. He smashed his foot down on the accelerator and the monstrous motorcycle roared forward. Nick spared an arm to shift a pair of beat up goggles over his eyes, keeping his blue dyed hair away and back. The bike heaved and bucked over the small hills of the industrial district. The ground reverberated with a persistent thump…thump…thump… Nick could even feel it over the throbbing ‘cycle. Nick leaned low and hopped over a little hill/dip in the road; the sun was setting and setting the river next to him ablaze. It would’ve looked picturesque if not for the two hundred ton Cancer Tank tearing after him.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Cancer tank was an old and distinguished model, now obsolete; it still found uses in the civilian and law enforcement sectors. It was large, an octagonal body with a diamond shaped cockpit and four large legs coming out of the sides. The paint on this particular one was tan, and faded with over fifty years of service. Everyone knew this old tank, it had quelled riots and terrorist attacks numerous times, often alone and in the hands of its crew.  Of course, Nick didn’t care as this particular tank was shredding the road in chase.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nick revved the bike, leaning towards a walkway over the river; the tank altered its course and followed. At the last second, Nick jerked hard right, effecting a near- 90-degree turn into the industrial district. Now, cancer tanks were known for their maneuverability, but two hundred odd tons can’t stop at over one hundred miles and hour, and the armored behemoth crashed into the river.  Nick shook his head and relaxed, the danger over, for the moment.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mars Orbit, August fifteenth<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The missile barrage was great, but short lived, and the turbulent flame dissipated.<br>The black lizard robot still floated, unscathed and still radiating a malevolent image.<br>All the sudden, it flexed its wings, and three more of the lizards seemed to appear, occulting the stars where they rested, and becoming visible. Of course, any sane man, or a military tactician, did the only thing open to him and his men. RUN!!!<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fighters were built for speed, firepower didn’t matter when you expected to face ships of similar design, avoiding damage was better than surviving it. This guided Reverend and his group as they fled, the lizards took chase.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “@#%$, I’ll bet only a magnetic cannon can kill those things!” Mars 5, Lucious Jackson, said. Jackson was right, assuming the cannon could hit them, it would.<br>The lizards caught up quickly, they came from a technology bred for space, and they were shredding local space with their needle-breath.  Reverend had finally started to broadcast the warning, nine separate signals, to three separate locations, in individual frequencies, to ensure that most jamming methods wouldn’t work.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We have a First Priority! Code OTHERWORLD!!!” That one word set the entire earth military on fire… OTHERWORLD was repeated throughout the relays, until everything was lit up and primed. OTHERWORLD was the code for Hostile Alien Encounter. Where as SAMEWORLD was the one for peaceful.  But even as the nearest elements from Deimos, not more than three thousand kilometers away, the dark lizards had struck.<br><br>They had quatered Deimos!<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Washington State, Industrial district.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nick motored down the small alleyway, the monstrous bike almost too big for the alley. As he rolled down the way, a distinctive thump disturbed the quiet of the district.<br>Nick groaned and looked behind him; all though drenched, the Cancer tank stood at the alleyway entrance.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Shiiiittttt…” Nick moaned, and stomped down on the pedal.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nick had been searching for his safehold, a small room cut into a building where he kept supplies, weapons, once he had a vial of Ebola on his hands….  Anyway, he had found the hole, stashed his bike, and unfurled his power armor, the Adamantine.<br>The Adamantine was Nick’s own design, and licensed by Catastrophe ltd. The suit was about 6’ 6”, and was blue with black trim. It had four arms and enough weapons to put a mechanized division to shame. He had five or so minutes before the Cancer plowed through the two city blocks to him. It’s sensors locked on Nick, and it shouldered and smashed through a building of ferroconcrete. Nick just attached his armor faster. The armor clicked into place of it’s own accord, only following Nick’s prompts. The tank hadn’t fired any of its weapons during the chase, so the thieves couldn’t hack into the fire control systems. Or at least that’s what Nick reasoned, until a cannon bolt cratered the building on his left. Finally, the armor was secure, and nick executed a powered jump the roof of the smelting complex he was under. The crab tank seemed to shudder, and then it punched its front feet toe deep into the building. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh… holy @#%$, that thing is climbing? Idiots!” Nick swore, and ran in a huge, loping gait, heading for the edge. Nick had just jumped from the overhang as the Cancer heaved itself onto the roof. The roof of the aged and beleaguered building started to cave in, but before the tower and tank fell, the armored vehicle sprang.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Venus relative May tenth.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Out of a tear, deep in space, a new threat emerged, ships, far different from the lizard men attacking Mars. It would take them several weeks to reach their destination.<br>And earth would suffer!!<br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mars orbit, August fifteenth.<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Space, and all things, ships, planets, random bits of stuff quaked in the distorted gravity, Deimos drifted slightly, creating a misaligned gravity source, the change in gravity rolled out from Mars orbit, Back on earth, clocks jumped a few seconds back.<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now, only five of the original eight space fighters survived, overcoming their shock, and doing their best to deal death to the alien invaders. One of the four lizards had its arm blown off, but that did not keep it from being deadly. What was left of Deimos had disgorged its remaining garrison, a war ship, several hundred Spitfire combat suits, and a carrier, all making a mad dash for Earthspace. The populace of Mars had evacuated to the Catacombs, a huge network of mineshafts that reached from one side of the planet to another. So, on the darkside, mass freighters would haul the people away from the war.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The spitfires were the best off, they were small, hard to hit, and were able to get close enough to the alien suits to crack the polished armor. Spitfires were one of the newer space combat vehicles, simply a space suit merged with power armor. Strangely, the pilots of the Spitfires often customized their suits, some sporting chains and hooks; others decorated with decals and paint. One particular suit out did the rest; it was a base black, with white checker patterns across the thighs and biceps. Also, it had two distinct weapons: a Thermite dagger, built so it could heat and melt even the toughest metals, which was also attached to a chain fed from a back pack. Plus a cannon with a muzzle decorated with a metal feline skull. The Spitfires set upon the lizards; blowing armor and system away with a vengeance, and it turn, dying by the second. One of the lizard machines finally succumbed to its wounds, malfunctioning and dashing away from the battle. One of its battle mates followed closely as it fissured and heaved, missing a leg and both wings shredded, it let loose it’s pent up energy. After the explosion, which had dazzled everyone there, the other dark machine reached out its arm to the wreckage.<br>A light blue aura appeared around the machine’s hand, and another around what was left of the cockpit to the alien ship. A brackish, toxic looking blood boiled away into space.<br>The auras connected, and the living lizard went rigid, and its eyes and mouth glowed. The remaining parts of the other lizard seemed to bend and warp while in the aura, and then it smashed up and melded to the other lizard. Everyone rested and watched as the suit merged with the other, becoming a super lizard man. New armor covered the eyes, and they moved like eyelids, narrowing in a very human like gesture, and a single word echoed through space, time, and all communications gear in range:<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Die.” <br><br>END CHAPTER ONE<br><br><br><br><br><br>A gloved hand swung towards Victor’s face, but Victor wasn’t there, he shifted and brought his hand back, going for an upper cut, but his opponent jumped and landed on Victor’s fist. Victor could easily hold the young man, but couldn’t defend against the twisting kick, tagging him neatly in the face. The other combatant swung down, and worked a fast hand combo, leaving Victor off guard, the next set Victor managed to block, the mask his friend wore hiding the grin he most assuredly held. <br><br><br>“Cut the @#%$ and your stupid tricks!” Victor hissed, he snapped his arms up to block another kick, and another. A sweeping hammer blow, cut short in a fake, snapped at Victor’s nose…<br><br>Iron beams, flame and pain… tearing metal and flesh… The bar swung on chains, heading for the machine’s head, cutting squarely and deep into the metal visage.<br><br>Rifles, old ones, ancient ones, all aimed at him… All spitting lead at him, all hitting him…<br><br>A gargantuan, metal-shod fist swung for his nose.<br><br>“Ahaha!” Victor yelped, he blanked out for a moment, the punch tagging him neatly in the face, the lower gravity sent Victor reeling. James Rand pulled the wire mask off his face, he looked down at his sparing partner with a worried look.<br>“You OK man?” he said, he held his hand out, waiting for Victor to get up.<br><br>Victor grasped the offered and heaved himself up, towering over the other man.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A full blood American, Victor was tall, meaty, but proportionate, he had many a great passion, and weight lifting showed most in his broad back and thick arms. He had a mildly angular face, sharp chin, deep, mid set eyes, and a small, well-defined nose. His shock of black hair fell just above his neck, his bangs fanned out and spiked in front of his eyes. His eyes were the strangest, his irises like purple crystals that were broken, then pushed into a glass ball, making a distinct, faceted look.  <br><br>The other man was shorter, by about eight inches, lean, and well toned, but lacking mass, as most other space faring people were. He had dark black hair, but that was hidden by a very expensive blue hair dye. James was of varied decent, but mainly American, and held the normal, meaty features of the breed.    His sharp blue eyes snapped at the other man in concern, actually, Victor wasn’t really a man, legally, being eighteen and all, he was, but to the twenty-five year old pilot, he was a junior.<br><br>“Hey… What just happened?” James asked, he waited, he knew Victor had some weird thing happen to him, and these blanking out sessions had occurred before… Still.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have no idea… some strange daydream…” Victor breathed, his lungs sucked in the air a lot faster, the lower gravity in the complex easing the muscle’s workload.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Right, well, I need to get to briefing, they’re testing that new orbital design.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You mean that one shaped kinda like a human? Based on a spacesuit or something?” Victor asked, incredulity creeping into his voice, along with some lingering uncertainty. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah, to hear them tell it, it’s more like an up-scaled Spitfire.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah… I’d like to ride one of them…”<br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nick fell swiftly, the armor he wore adding to his decent. Just as he landed, the teenager turned and unlimbered the Catapult. Nick called it the Catapult because of it’s unique fire design. It simply used a tray to fling a slug down the barrel at very high speeds. Unfortunately, it was a single shot, slow re-loader, but he had to take that chance.<br>With a brief snapping motion, he swung the cannon at the plummeting tank, he centered on the body, and fired. The slug left the barrel, after being flung by the track and tray, at thermal speeds, the special bullet made to burn ultra hot. The blob of molten metal slid into the first layer of armor on the tank’s belly, then…<br><br>Boom, I really love the explosives… Nick thought.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp However, the cannon recoil had flung Nick and his Adamantine back, into the parapet, and he fell twelve stories down. <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Comics… figures… model kits… Giant robots? I guess there have been stranger ideas…” The young woman murmured, she gingerly stacked the items in the shelves.<br>The young woman was about 15, average height, and had fiery, crimson hair that fell to her knees. She kept most of it held behind her by a hidden clip, but let light bangs and other loose waves frame her neat face. Her eyes were a stunning indigo, well shaped and clear. She didn’t wear makeup, actually, she didn’t even need makeup, her face kept looking that good anyway. A gently curved jaw line held a well-defined mouth, and a tiny, cute nose.  Her nametag read Amy Kisaragi.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amy was about to move onto the next set of boxes when a weak tap sounded against the glass. We’re closed… everybody knows that… who…! Amy looked past the posters and stickers covering the thick glass, and saw an armored hand was tapping at the lower pane. Amy ran to the door, but not before grabbing the shutter remote. The remote would cause titanium blast plates and curtains to drop down, shutting the store out.<br>Amy opened the door, and saw a man in powered armor, She nearly fell over just looking at the thing. Holy @#%$! That thing is huge, I do not want to know who built that, or what for! <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Either way, Amy tried to drag the unresponsive machine into the store, she looked at the industrial district, about half a mile east, and saw two buildings gutted, and others smoking. Suddenly, the man wearing the armor woke up, he mumbled incoherently, then started to push with his power-assisted legs. Amy had already triggered the doors to open widest, so the armor could fit, but it was still close.  Once inside, Amy started to pull at the helmet seals, barely remembering the starting course she took on powered armor.<br>Amy succeeded in removing the metal mask, but the rest of the armor was a problem, every time she pushed at the seals, a holographic display popped up, saying that the armor was only able to open it’s helmet. It said her clearance wasn’t high enough.<br>The young man moaned, he tilted his head and tried to right himself, but fell back, his head landing in Amy’s lap.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes sir, no sir, no questions sir!” James braced, he stood tall in front of his commanding officer, one of the few ranking men on the ship to have actually been in real combat. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Very well, the exercise has been altered, we shall be testing both Alpha and Beta models, I leave it to you to pick the pilot for Beta.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp James stiffened, he listened, but didn’t really understand… What was going on?<br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amy held the young man’s head in her lap, she knew him from school, with the blue hair and all, but she didn’t know his name… He coughed, then his eyes snapped open.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah! P-pain! H-head hurts!” He said, he was slurring slightly, and she felt something unnaturally warm in his hair. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “H-help me, check e-ear… F-for clear fluids…” He gasped, he turned his head, and Amy, not really sure of what he was talking about, looked. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No fluids, some red scrapes on your temples…” She said, concerned.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have a-a c-concussion, that’s w-why I can’t talk s-straight.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What? We need to get you out of here!” <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Help me g-get out of my suit…” He collapsed again, breathing hard and sweat streaking his face. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “See the r-red valve? P-press the switch u-under the collar n-near it.”<br>Amy searched under the collar, as instructed, which was rather hard as her legs were pinned under his head. She found the button and pressed, and a computerized voice spoke quietly. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nick Rand, your armor has been enabled for all users, releasing clamps.”<br>The armor shook and cracked, the arms and chest blossoming open. <br>Nick? Amy thought, she watched him struggle up, then helped push him upright.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have some pain killers… can you wait enough for them?” She offered, thinking it was the best she had.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Y-yes! G-get the pills!” he hissed, the thundering, driving pain in his head was near debilitating, he could barely see from the red haze of agony.<br>Amy shot back to the counter, grabbed a box of medicine and bandages, and ran back to him. Nick snatched the bottle shakily and swallowed three white pills.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hold m-my back…” He ordered, Amy pressed her hands into his shoulders, waiting. He couldn’t help but notice how warm she was. Nick reached up and gingerly touched his head, he felt the warm, sticky blood under his hair, and the lump of misplaced bone. His fall from the building caused a fragment of skull to snap and shift out, riding over another section. He grit his teeth and pressed, snapping the bone shard back into place. He screamed, nearly crushing Amy, and nearly went into shock.<br>But that subsided, and he slowly asserted his iron calm over his throbbing head, the painkillers were a great help as well. <br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, I do not like it, but I’ve decided to ask you to pilot the Beta suit.”<br>James said, he looked at the other pilot, who leaned against a bulkhead.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Are you kidding? I’d love to ride that one! It’s a lot better than the Alpha suit!”<br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So… who are you?” Amy shifted back and forth uneasily, she eyed the teenager warily, He had finally extracted himself from the armor, and was sitting cross legged in the comic store. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah… My name is Nick Rand.”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “ I’m Amy… What are you doing in that armor?”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You know that ancient cancer tank? The fifty year old one?”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yeah…”<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Some ass hacked it and tried to kill me… I blew it up.”<br><br><br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor and James waited as the elevator lifted them to the surface level. The test was starting; the military was testing the concept of a human shaped spacecraft, gathering data on effective ways of fuel economy. Neo was in the Alpha suit, a design licensed by the military, and rather ugly.<br>Like most military machines, the Alpha was functional first, aesthetic last.<br>The suit was essentially a boxy, cumbersome rig of servos, generators, and actuators.<br>The head was built like a gorilla, thick of chin with a large brow over a thin slit for two blue lenses, cameras. It’s arms were big, bulky, and extremely clumsy, but they each had vernier engines, as did the legs.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Victor sat in the Beta, slowly wondering if he’d go crazy from claustrophobia.<br>While the large man wasn’t really claustrophobic, he didn’t really like small spaces.<br>While the Alpha was all bulk and ugly, the Beta was a wonderful machine. Even if a test type, exposed joints and frames, waiting for armor and weapons, the Beta had a beauty that took the right kinds of eyes to see it. The Beta was taller than the Alpha, it’s face a simple mask like shape, with a slit and two golden eyes cut out. It’s shoulders were large, it’s biceps thin and wiry, it’s forearms bulked with mock weapons. The Beta also had two booms, mounted on pivots that held engines, as did the thick legs. It’s cockpit looked like a jet aircraft’s glued to a man’s chest.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Alpha and Beta confirmed launched.” A technician said, Naomi something if Victor remembered correctly. Actually, she was kinda cute… The test was basically about the next level of spacecraft design, a proliferation of the current fighter type, lightweight, conventionally armed, and rather fragile. The test was made to find a new basis for the workhorse of the space forces, as the small fighters were rather useless against most large ships, and had only one use, space combat. Ares Industrial, the corporation responsible for the Beta suit, had begun design of a multi-planar vehicle, a craft that could work, fight, and be produced at cost on both land and space. Their efforts ended in a humaniform design.
