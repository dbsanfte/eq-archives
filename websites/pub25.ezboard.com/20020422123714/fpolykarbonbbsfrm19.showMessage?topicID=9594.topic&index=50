<br>
And I also heard that the DVD release for LOTR with the added footage was going to be rated R. So obviously, if they cut footage pushes the DVD to an R rating, then the movie would have been R had it not been cut. <p><table width=100% border=0>

In my own experience the people who have seen the film but not played the games enjoyed it much more than those who had played all the games.<br>

Everybody thought it sucked (me included).<br>
<br>
As for LOTR, I thought it was an enjoyable movie but I view it much like I do Episode I... They are both movies setting the table for a trilogy.  Sure, LOTR was a much better movie, but the biggest problem both of those movies had is that they lacked emotion.  They both seemed kind of sterile, something that I hope will be changed with the next two movies when the story really gets rolling.  I hold my judgement until I am able to see the whole story and not just one part of it.  Of course, they were both meant to be stand-alone movies but I feel parts of them are missing without seeing how it all plays out.<br>
<br>
Both Jackson and Lucas had an enormous task in front of them for those movies... They had to take two of the world's most famous childhood sagas and while Lucas had to set the table for the prequels, Jackson had to convert one of the most well known books in the the world to a 3 hour movie.  Both were enormous tasks that would be ridiculed for either not playing out the exact way the public wanted (LOTR) or not catching the spirit of the original (Star Wars).  Give them both a break and wait until the second movie.  If that one sucks, then feel free to bitch. <p>No one has ever accused me of having an opinion.  Don't be the first.<BR>

<br>
I read half of the first book (though I remember basically nothing).  Every channel I turned to on the T.V. they were advertising this movie and it's merchendise.  I hated the book, but everyone was praising it so much, I thought that the movie would be worth it. <br>
<br>
It was not worth it at all.  Apparently, it strayed from the book a great deal, disappointing fans...and the story and the acting didnt intrigue me at all.<br>
<br>
They are even still advertising merchendise for this film.<br>

ohhhhhhhh i am NOT kidding.  Even though i was age 12 at the time i still went to see it with friends.

As far as the overrated topic goes here are my opinions: Star Wars:Ep1, LOTR books (ya, hate me for that. Are they good?  Ya.  Overrated? hell ya!), and just for kicks, that st00pid &quot;ginger&quot; scooter that was gonna change the world over night.

I didn't enjoy it and found it hard to get through, but I think the book does make you think and in that sense it is good. I wouldn't say that its over rated, its just hard to enjoy.<br>
(If any of that actually made sence, congratulations, if not too bad).<br>
<br>
Also with LOTR I don't think it was over rated, I didn't think that it was the best movie in the world and it did feel as if it was going through the motions, but all the reviews I read and listened to don't rate it as the best movie ever. I think a movie/book which doesn't reach the hype and expectations can be confused with being overated too easily. <p>"What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
