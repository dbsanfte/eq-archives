I will try to give you as many pointers to improve your work as I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This will be long, but it's because I'm going in detail, not because there are tons of mistakes. I rarely (never actually) go this detailed, but go ahead and read it all. Anybody else, follow up with comments or corrections as you like <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Well... for 3 weeks that is very good. It's hard not to hold you to hire standards, just for posting here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But... I want to say everything is wrong, but you are drawing better than my bro who has been trying for a month or two. When I say everything is wrong, by no means get discouraged! It looks very good.. the wrinkles are quite good for you drawing this long (now... by drawing anime for three weeks I basically assume you haven't been drawing seriously for much more than three weeks either).<br><br>Work on head shape, eye placement, nose placement, mouth placement, and the hairline, and how the all fit together like one puzzle. Practice faces. Study them, a lot, also. After you get the basic head shape down, find your eyeline. Put your eyes in, and figure out where they should go exactly on the face, how far they should be seperated (like maybe one imaginary eye between the two) and then where your nose would be below your eyes. And then your mouth. Your hairline is more important than what you would think at first. Your character's head looks a bit flat on top. It should be more rounded, like a ball, but dont make it unusually large either. Practice! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ALso, the two strands of hair in her face look rather flimsy. I can tell you were going for that wavvy look. There are different ways to do this.. try making it more twirly, in a circle, or maybe make the points where it would &quot;wave&quot; from one direction to the next more sharp and less rounded (but dont go making pointed angles either). Your nose, also, is a big too sharp. It shouldn't be a 90 degree angle and the top of the nose should curve more up. You could use a bit more detail in the ears, eyes, and hair, but don't worry now! That will come with practice. As you start getting your face down better.. work on the &quot;smaller&quot; details like that.<br><br>Faces change a lot based on your personal style in anime. Find a style you like, practice with it, and mold it as you please as you start to absent-mindedly design your own artistic style!<br><br>Your neck is perhaps a *smidge* too long, and your head is sat lopsided on it too! Straighten that head out, and lower the neck a bit if it's to your liking (or maybe small necks are just my style).<br><br>Here's a mistake. Arm length. HER left arm is shorter than her right arm. Also, I usually make their elbow in the bellybutton area. For me, elbow height = naval height. Her breasts look okay... make the &quot;stretch&quot; line from on boob to the other shorter. It should stop between just the beginning and the middle of either of her breasts. Also, the wrinkles above her breasts are probably unnecessary.<br><br>Waiste looks good, as does her skirt and... thong strap? Heh. Belt looks very good! Good job... you don't ever want to make your belt flat, like it's part of the pants/skirt/whatever. Legs are improperly shaped. Pick up an anatomy book and see where they become more rounded and get skinnier. Knees are also too skinny. Lower leg -- too skinny; upper part should be more rounded. Shoes are too flat at certain edges and are incorrectly shaped to fit the foot. Nice detail in the socks and shoes. I like the tree shadow in the background<br><br>Summary: Practice proportions and anatomy! My mum had an old book from college I used. Or go to the library, you can always find great reference material for clothes, medieval outfits, anatomy, hairstyles, etc.! You are off to a good start. Practice, practice, practice. I draw everday. If you are more serious about drawing, then you should too. If it's meant to be more of a hobby, then I reccomend drawing when you feel like it. But if you want to improve draw daily, if possible, or at least bi-daily. Keep it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Take some of this into consideration, and keep posting your work for more help. Just because an anatomy diagram is more realistic than that of an anime drawing, does not mean you shouldn't disreguard it!! All anime is based off realism and reality! Work at it! Copy the muscles, learn how the move, and you will see Massive (massive with a capital M) improvement, i promise<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/utraia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Traia</A> at: 6/7/02 5:09:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucold1981.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cold1981</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 5:14:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5559.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm a 3 week newbie, Please give me a c&amp;c</span><hr size=1> I agree! *runsforexit*<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uoriginalronin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OriginalRonin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/7/02 5:14:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5559.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm a 3 week newbie, Please give me a c&amp;c</span><hr size=1> Hey, Traia.

Imagine a light source and then shade accordingly. Shading will only get better as you get better as an artist. Shading will look good to you one day, and a year later look like crud. It's something that only develops when your drawing develops. <br><br>If I were to guess, it seems the majority of your shading makes it look as if the light source is coming from the direct right. As if it's nearly approaching sunset.<br><br>Usually the shading under the chin is almost always there, as you have portrayed. occationaly there will be more of a shadow, sometimes less, on more rare occations no shadow at all. Depends on your light of source.<br><br>The shading just under her skirt should be more defined... dont just make it on the left side, but a bit more up top, just below her skirt. Also, assuming the lightsource is from our right, the entire left edge of the leg should be shaded... so pull your shading further down as well. And in relation to that.... the left side of her stomach.. left side of her left breast.. skirt.. both arms.. legs and feet. <br><br>Her right breast shouldnt have a shadow like that... not angled to the right. The sun's there, remember? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   same thing with top of the right shoulder. and the lower right side of her skirt... true there should be a shadow due to the wrinkle but not so large.<br><br>Decent shading in relation to wrinkles. Probably could have shaded her hair better... good job at catching the shadow from her strand of hair over her face.. and now to move on to the last part i've been avoiding..<br><br>The face..<br><br>The most difficult part to shade, much less explain. Think of the face in more of a 3D object than a flat anime. Your faces will probably keep that more of a 2D flattish look for a while, but that's normal for everybody. There is no key way to explain face shading.... it ALL depends on the source of light.. there are so many varying objects on the face.. the indention at they eye, the rounded cheeks, the indention under the lower lip, the small indention above the lower, the rounded nose, the hump of the nose creating a shadow, hair dangling, etc. So much to look at when you shade. All I can say is, look at it as if it were made of a 3D object, no matter how 2D your art ever looks. The face is rounded in so many spots and has so many indentions, and every face is different too, sometimes cheek bones stick out creating more things to look at sometimes not. Your shading on the face looked to fast and isn't too good, but don't worry about it. Try expirementing.<br><br>Hope that explains everything. If you got any questions about either of my posts, then ask away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Continue to post your work if you want more crits on your shading and the like.
