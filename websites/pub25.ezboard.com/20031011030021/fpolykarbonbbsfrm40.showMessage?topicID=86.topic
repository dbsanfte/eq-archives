I don't know if it will have a storyline or not (seeing as finding members who have skillz and would be dedicated to making a good story would be hard).<br>
<br>
If not it would be strictly multiplayer but that's beside the point.<br>
<br>
I'm want to develop this story either way (in game or comic form) but I can't think of enough characters or enough details to the setting. Anyway I should just tell it to you so I could have some criticisms. <br>
<br>
Setting: specifically unknown as of now. I do know it shall be set in the future, since their will be mecha. Also action will take place in space, on different worlds (though I don't think there should necessarily be aliens), and in ships. <br>
<br>
I really can't think of any conflict in the sense of politics or war, because the emphasis will not be on that. There will be some sort of corruption going on though. Something like secret experiments (by the government or some defunct arms bussiness) which resulted in bioengineered atrocities, all of which that had to be destroyed...except one.<br>
<br>
Mech's: first I don't know what t call them (since if I use &quot;mech&quot; FASA will run me up the ass). One thing I'm intrigued, though, is the gundam philosophy with mecha. Gundams (not gundam wing, UC Gundam) are standardized suits, and really aren't super powerful ultimate weapons. That's how I really want to design the mecha's. They shouldn't be over flashy with lots of bright colors, and the pilot will NOT yell out an attack when she does it (like in G Gundam). <br>
<br>
All the weapons they use will be similiar to real world weapons, and they will have their limitations. the larger they are, the slower they and the mech are. The smaller they are, the faster and more lightly armored they and the mech are. Also combat will be more team oriented, though there will be times where they will go solo. <br>
<br>
Finally their look will be humaniod but they will still act like tanks. They also won't have specific human facial features  (maybe eyes, but no specific nose or a mouth). They might have things that resemble human facial features that give them a them ( like a tear). <br>
<br>
Get the Idea yet? I don't have a scanner so I can't show you any designs I've drawn but I'll get one soon enough.<br>
<br>
Plot:  The plot would be more focused on individual people's emotions than on the thing's that are happening around them ( not that that won't be important). <br>
<br>
There is going to be some sort of obvious really powerful evil, but I have no Idea what it is. <br>
<br>
The main character's will be a mercenary group (that pilot's mechs) and the story center around one in particular...Dawn. She's going to be the newest member, a very skilled pilot, and an equally good fighter.  The minute she goes on an assignment with them a mysterious unbeatable mech appears with an unknown pilot. As the plot goes on she learns of her past, but less of herself. She has powers that allow her to become a better fighter, and allow her to operate more closely with her mech. But her abilities are closely in tune with her feelings.  When she loses control of herself (which happens a lot because of her constant confusion over what she is) she loses control of her powers and her mech. This is where the mysterious character comes in. Though he is not neccesarily good, he helps her gain better control of herself. <br>
<br>
There might be other mercenaries but they won't be as important as Dawn. <br>
<br>
Character's: <br>
<br>
Nirhlus: He's going to be totally shadowy, heartless, and unpredictable. He pops in the the story at random times, but he himself doesn't make any major decisions that affect the plot. He has no identifiable reason, past, or motive. If anything he only serves to cause character's to develop themselves. He will never be defeated, and has no weakness, but he also has no actual goals. I know this is everything you don't do with a character but don't argue with me on this one.<br>
<br>
Dawn: I've already described how she fits in the story. In the beginning she will be really Kickass. In the first scene she will get in a bar fight with three guys twice the size of her and win. Physically she wll also be very strong and very athletic. I drew a picture of her (though I can't think of any good clothes), but I can't upload it. She'll have black hair, but with a purple irridescence to it. She'll also have purple lips (don't ask). In terms of sex, she'll be more like Samus Aran then Lara Croft( I think I might cameo Samus). <br>
<br>
Other: I can't think of any other character's. There's going to be some sort of evil person, but Im don't know who or what it will. <br>
<br>
I can only think of one other merc that will appear, but I can't think of a name. He's going to be big, really big. When you look at him you'll be immediately intimidated, and be persuaded to think he's a tough guy. On the battlefield he will be, though. Outside the battlefield he'll be very quite. You eventually learn that he only joined the merc team to travel the universe to find his long lost daughter, that was kidnapped.<br>
<br>
A big twist in the storyline occurs when she is found by none other than...Nirhlus! Nirhlus gets captured by the same people who kidnapped the big guy's daughter( she's going to be about 3-4). They get put into similiar holding cells. During this time Nirhlus and the young girl engage in a long conversation. Interstingly enough, despite the fact that she has been imprisoned for a year, she has very little idea what is going on and is very playful. He of course will be very cold.  the twist occurs at the end, where he shoots her. <br>

<br>
I don't know though. I think that would be cooler as a callsign.<br>
<br>
If your an artist that would be cool. In all honesty my skills as an artist are developing. I am sketchy about drawing my character's, specifically Dawn, since I've already completed a good concept of her likeness. I just must find a suitable outfit. Nirhlus, or something original owuld be r4x0r.<br>
<br>
Though in all honesty right now I want to at least get some model's done before I ask for help in anything but the storyline. I know how people are paranoid of those with a half-baked Idea that doesn't come around. I've had this for at least a year. It was originally gonna be a mod for UT With Dawn being the Daughter of Xan Kregor. Her name being Dawn Kregor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ermac@polykarbonbbs>Ermac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/10/03 10:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> comment</span><hr size=1> Here's my evaluation of your story and characters - <br>
It's one of those post apocalyptic type wars, 2 nations fight each other or something similar to that. Mechas, obviously, are the main weapons of choice. Rebels come together to form a mercanary group and during their missions they get involved in alot of unavoidable trouble.. Nirhlus is one character who most likely seems to want Dawn to become a better pilot so he can fight her. <br>
<br>
Nirhlus - He is your typical nuetral character. He has a sinister mind and lives to fight. In short, don't get on his bad side because he shows no mercy to anyone, even children who pose no threat to him. He will go to the extreme by fighting someone only to let them live long enough to improve their abilities until the final battle were he can still prove to be superior.<br>
<br>
Dawn - I honestly think she would make a cool character. You may want to rethink about using the whole enhancing her abilities to pilot a mecha because it has been done so so much. G - Gundam's Domon Kasshu, Pilot Canidate ( I think), Gundam Wing Mobile Suit's Hero Yui, the main character, and in both Zoid anime series. <br>
<br>
 One way to make Dawn become a better pilot is if she just has alot of training sessions and has a pretty good idea of how to predict her enemy's movement. <br>
<br>
Gundams are referred to either &quot;gundam&quot; which is just a substitute word for a superior mecha or the word, &quot; mobile suit &quot;.   The robots they pilot in your story can be called Mechas but its more fun to think of a name to call them.  - hope this helps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phobos@polykarbonbbs>Phobos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/11/03 1:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: comment</span><hr size=1> Yeah, a tengu is long nose god or something like that<br>

the tengu name has appeared in many games like...<br>
Dead or Alive 2,<br>
Metal Gear Solid 2,<br>

maybe, you could change the mecha's into armor suits?<br>
that way it would be easier to draw, and you could have your boosters and mech equipment...<br>
just an idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showPrevMessage?topicID=86.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showNextMessage?topicID=86.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.polykarbon.com/bbsimage/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.emailToFriend?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.threadControl?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm39">What is Fight Club?<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm40">Story Ideas</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm40>Story Ideas</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
