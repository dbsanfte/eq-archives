A warm welcome was not something she was used to in this part of the country.<br>
When she heard Elil's remark, a pair of cold blue eyes fell on him.<br>
&quot;Just so you know, I WASN'T trying to kill you! In fact I have a message for this merry group of people, but if you keep being rude you might not get it!&quot; She pulled out another envelope, this one with its seal still intack, and waved it about in the air. <br>
&quot;Oh and just so you know, that wolf you killed wasn't a real wolf. Only the illusion of one,&quot; Her eyes fell to Timothy and she smiled.<br>
&quot;Thankyou for stopping that big hairball. It wouldn't have been to wonderful if I had died.

&quot;Caprice is it?  I am Van Eyck.  Now I must ask you,  what is this note that you have for us?  Good news or Bad?&quot;<br>
