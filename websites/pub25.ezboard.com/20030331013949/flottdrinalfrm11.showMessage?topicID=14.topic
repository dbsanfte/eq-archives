<br>
In the midst of having a bad luck outing on EQ last night I have decided to investigate the bubble scheme.  First, my bad luck was caused by sitting in what was thought to be a safe place while going AFK and somehow having a centaur charger aggro on me.  I still do not understand what could have happened, and alas no one said anything on screen before the attack, so if it was somehow trained (shouldn't have aggroed me) then the person who trained it must be a real jerk.  <br>
<br>
It is possible that whilst picking off some of the centaurs around the centaur village that this charger aggroed, but couldn't get to me due to building structures or something, and then somehow broke loose and aggroed on me.  Not really sure, but the fact remains, I died while not at my keyboard, and that will not happen again.  Fortunately I killed a cyclops and a few other centaurs on the night, so I at least came out ahead on XP, but just barely.<br>
<br>
Now, on to the Bubbles.  Why are they called bubbles?  Seem like segments would be better.  Bubbles sounds like some female was entirely drunk when they gave them that term.  Those wacky beta testers.<br>
<br>
And who in the world would choose orange and blue.  Being a Georgia Bulldawg fan, I have an immense hatred of anything using the colors orange and blue.  I think the bubbles (segments) should be red with an internal black line.  Thats what I'm talking about.  I mean, we are killing things for these bubbles (cant get that stupid term to go away), so therefore, red would be better, as it represents blood, and black usually represents evil and/or death.  What exactly could the orange and blue mean?  Someone please tell me.  <br>
<br>
I suppose there might be a way to edit this, maybe in the eqclient.ini, but who knows ... and I mean that seriously, if you know, you had better tell me now.  I plan on creating a secrets guide with just this one hint in it, and sell it for $10 ... yes Shazdan, on Yahoo.<br>
<br>
Another point on bubbles.  Why do I seem to lose varying amounts of bubbles (argh ... this bubble thing is driving me nuts) every time I die.  Sometimes I don't even seem to take a hit on my black (err blue) bubble count, while others I see almost an entire red (err orange, man do I hate the Florida Gators) bubble go bye bye (wish I could make Steve Spurrier go bye bye).  <br>
<br>
Maybe we could have different colored bubbles for different days, kind of like bread.  That way you could see your progressing/regression in a sort of bar code like form.  Of course, with all the potheads and beer drinkers out there, the slightly mind alterig affect of the colored bar might lead them into even more delusions, which could cause a whole series of issues that could be blamed on 'role-playing'.  Heaven help us if we have more people like 'Skatt out there running around on mind trips.  Would be kind of funny to see Shazdan attacking Naggie in nothing but his ... ummm ... helmet.<br>
<br>
Speaking more on the bubbles, I think just to incite anger in people they should segregate the blue bubbles into 5 leeetle beeety pieces for those super fun hell levels.  Imagine folks running around killing Cazel or Naggie in hopes of getting a full PINK bubble.  How cute.  Let's further sissify the game by making all males characters where dresses ... yeah, you know who I am talking about.  I don't even want to know what sort of frilly underwear you barbarian 'men' where. (although, I wouldn't mind finding out about the women)  I guess that is the reason Shazdan wears only a helmet, he too is ashamed of his mini-skirt wearing brothers.  And to try to hide your issues by calling it a 'kilt' just makes it even worse.  If you aint gonna dress like a man, at least act like one and stand up for yourself.  Sheesh!!<br>
<br>
Then there is the idea of new comic strip that is supposed to come out in video form.  I plan all doing it in an Asian cartoon style at first but will translate it to English at a later date.  The rough translation for the comic will be &quot;All Your Bubbles&quot;.  Any input or thoughts on this are appreciated.  Note that the only reason I use bubbles is because translating the word segment might prove to difficult and end up in a very strange translation.  And we don't want to look stupid, now do we.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess that is enough for one day.  Sorry to go off like this, but at last report their have been no horrid smelling tidal waves hitting the Oasis, or anything else to write about lately.  I have heard rumors of some issues in the Dwarven Kingdom that might require a formal investigation at a later date, but I am anxiously awaiting further news on that.  It is quite the story so far, and I highly recommend everyone giving the previus writings on the situation a look see.  <br>
<br>
Take care all,<br>
