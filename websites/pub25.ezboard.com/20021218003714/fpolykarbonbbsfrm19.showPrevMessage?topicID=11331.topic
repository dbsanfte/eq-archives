Help/advice desparately needed!!</span><hr size=1> Hey everyone.  I kind of disapeared again.  Life hasn't been to bright lately <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, after wussing out of cross country, I realized how much I feel sick if I don't run a few miles everyday.<br>
Too bad lately though, I haven't been able to run at all.<br>
<br>
So can anyone offer advice??<br>
<br>
I know I'm sounding real desparate, but this has been frustrating me for almost 3 weeks now, and running was what pushed away my stress in the first place.<br>
<br>
I would go running after school for about 2 miles, then do another 2-3 miles at night.  I only did this for a few days.  That weekend, I ran two miles perfectly fine Saturday morning.  For the rest of the day, I was in these very dressy shoes for a wedding.<br>
The next day, I could barely run a mile.<br>
<br>
I rested about a week, tried running again, same problem.<br>
I got new shoes, I tried running again, same problem.<br>
<br>
The pain is in the part of my foot where it bends.  Pretty much between the top of the foot, and the front of the leg.  I'm sorry for the poor explanation.<br>
<br>
|  |    ____This part of the foot.<br>
|  | |/_<br>
|  |_____<br>
|_______\<br>
<br>
Basically, after about half a mile, it starts hurting, and then it slows me down and it hurts so much, I have to run flat footed.  And it hurts for a few more minutes after I stop running.<br>
<br>
I had this same problem when I quit cross country, but then I realized it didn't hurt after I tied my shoes properly.  That doesn't seem to make much of a difference these days though.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it was a long read.  But does anyone have any clue whats wrong with my feet?? <p><a href="http://geocities.com/riceonfridays/"><img src="http://server2043.virtualave.net/capnaardvark/anthem5.jpg"><br>Anthem Studios</a>

called the Zone Diet.. i can't go into too much detail without writing pages but basically not eating (or not that much) rice, bread, pasta, potatoes (bad carbs).<br>
replace with good carbs like vegetables, fruits, blah.<br>
eating more meat, mainly chicken.<br>
well, i've lost 4-5 percent body fat in the past 4 months, thanks to diet/exercise. i've noticed that being on this diet, i can run for a long period of time at a pretty good pace without even breathing out of my mouth.  say, 7.5 mph.<br>
hope this helps somewhat.<br>
<br>
edit: oh and btw, i'm chinese, so obviously totally avoiding rice doesn't last that long.  i just eat VERY little.  also, what i would do based on your explanation, is just give it a while to heal.. but that's only what i do.  it wouldn't hurt to go see your doctor, if u think it's a big enough deal. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/udoodleboi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>doodle boi</A> at: 10/20/02 7:56:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uriceonfridays.showPublicProfile?language=EN>riceonfridays</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(10/20/02 8:00:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11325.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server2043.virtualave.net/capnaardvark/rodneyblush.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i can probably help</span><hr size=1> thanks.  But a question though.  It probobly sounds dumb, but does what I eat really affect my feet that way?  It makes sense that a bad diet would cause you to get out of shape, and therefore have a hard time running..  But basically, the only thing stopping me is the pain I feel in my feet.  I'm sure my legs, and lungs could keep going way longer.<br>
<br>
And if a diet really is the problem, would the amount of sleep i get also matter?<br>
<br>
Not being able to run has kind of put me in a depressed mood, and I haven't really been eating healthily or getting much sleep...  So i dunno.. <p><a href="http://geocities.com/riceonfridays/"><img src="http://server2043.virtualave.net/capnaardvark/anthem5.jpg"><br>Anthem Studios</a>

I had the same problem for a little while, and I found out I had broken my ankle in such a way that I could still move it fine, but it hurt like hell when I did.<br>
<br>
Did the same thing to the center knuckle on my foot too, except that was from freestyle walking. <br>
<br>
Yes, you heard me. California accepts freestyle walking, why can't East Coast? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Gaealord Gabriel Angelo Maokai III</b>

One more thing: stay off the foot as much as possible. DON'T try to walk it off. You may be doing yourself more harm than good. <br>

<br>
I guess I have no choice but to see a doctor.  All my friends and even the school trainer said i should.  I'll try to talk my dad about it soon.  I haven't earlier since I always thought that he'd just blow it off and say its nothing.<br>
<br>
Mido, if I'm not fit enough to run two miles, it doesn't really make sense that I was able to run two to six miles everyday.  I know I didn't say that in my post, but it's very easy to assume, since I did say I was in cross country, and for a while, I ran on my own everyday.<br>
I normally wouldn't need to defend myself like this, but you can't even use correct punctuation.<br>
Sorry, its just one of my pet peeves on message boards.<br>
<br>
Sinfire - thanks.  I guess its nice to be back?  Honestly, I came back due to horrible desparation for help.  Polykarbon is such a great place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
