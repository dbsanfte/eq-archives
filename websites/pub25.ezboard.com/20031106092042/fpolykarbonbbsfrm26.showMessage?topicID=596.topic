<br>
 Though the line of division between fact and fantasy is often held in high esteem,and many choose to ignore the ongoing debate over ignorance of the lack of truth,the line of division,(almost symbolically)is simply a fantasy used by the weak of mind to simplify and hide the truth:<br>
          FACT IS A FANTASY.<br>
 Now you may think me mad, but consider this:<br>
<br>
         an eight year old boy discovers that he can annoy his mother by asking &quot;why&quot; after she says somthing.<br>
<br>
This boy,this pinnacle of ignorance and aspiration to discover and learn,has found the ultimate truth:<br>
          TRUTH IS A LIE<br>
You,the reader,may now be beginnig to discover the delima that is best presented by a line from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;<br>
spoken by Obi-wan to Luke.<br>
<br>
 &quot;you will discover,Luke,that a great many of the truths we cling to rely greatly upon your point of view.&quot;<br>
<br>
 With this bit of wisdom,one may realize that one can make the truth.one may bend the truth,and still be telling the truth,as they see it,and therefore,not lying.<br>
 With this in mind you realize also that this means that one determines ones own state of reality,relying greatly upon society to think for ones'self,leaving one with out any want for knowledge that isn't tangible and leaving ones imagination to rot like the fleshy bits of meat left by vultures.<br>
As artists,as writers,as creators and masters of our fates,we must not allow our imaginations to die.Save your humanity,embrace the lack of truth,love the limitless possibilities provided by the fruits of the mind.most of all<br>
 THINK..........................<br>

The rigor which he or she is able to deal with a concept or ideal ultimately leads to some often profound discourse. As an author the object of the game is to present the information in a way that achieves a balance between communication of the idea and the readership. When one is sacrificed for the other the entire work declines in value. I'll draw an alalogy a bed made out of springs no one will want to buy, however a bed made out of springs, contained in a mattress, covered by sheets and with a pillow, most everyone will enjoy. Don't thorn your paper and offend your readers. <br>
<br>
It's easy to write like this...<br>
<br>
My advice to you is as follows, if you write anything in your life, expect some degree of criticism, expect feedback wheter constructive or destructive. Arguemt among individuals is one of the priciple ways to arrive at some truth or maxim. Saying something like 'if your going to argue dont read it' brings in to peoples mind the idea of the 'forbidden fruit' because people know they can exact animosity from a source, because the source has made himself or herself vunerable, they will exact animosity. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, it is difficult for anyone to accept a statement such as Fact is a Fantasy or such gibberish, when little to no evidence, proof, examples, call it what you will is provided. You might focus on argument control. I read you're entire thing, and I thought about it and I considered things, and I came to the conclusion. That this is some sort of joke, or you really don't expect people to take this seriously and you're just wasting your time. <br>
<br>
Fantasy, can be defined as: a product of the mind or imagination, illusion. And yes, I agree with you that fantasy can be crafted out of truts or half truths, to yeild a world that is fiction. Such is the nature of the imagination. However, your paragraph does nothing to support the notion that Fact is Fantasy is true, you provide generalizations not facts. Secondly if Fact were Fantasy, you're entire argumet would not hold because you would be proving that what you are essentially saying is in itself a fantasy and your whole argument is a mere fabrication. <br>
<br>
Secondly your example with the boy asking his mother why, does nothing to support that statment that Truth is a Lie. If we propose that language is a series of symbols that have some value that is equal to experience or concepts linked to the natural world, and that each word descibes a distinct and different preception from another word, it would be impossible for one to claim that Truth is a Lie, if we take words as symbols only and they are capable of having any value as long as the majority of people are willing to accept it at that value we could make the statement that, Truth is first equal to fact and then what is truth is also a lie, then a lie would also be true and fact. <br>
<br>
When you can actually come up with a descent argument, post something, until then i suggest your read more, something by plato or socrates, if that's what interests you.<br>

 First and formost, I belive that it is important to adapt your point of view to fit the situation, like when you read my former post ,I assume you tried to see my point, yet you grasp it only partially(i assume the extent of your perception from what you said in your reply)and that you miss a major portion: that the quest for fact is limited by our perception of the world,and all things pretaining to our/your/my perception on reality and how we daily define ourselves through our actions only partially and our thoughts completely.<br>
 To simplify,we rely upon faith(in something,or anything)to cover the wall were our understandig ends.Take Religion,(though i may be opening the famous &quot;can of worms&quot;in saying this)many people put faith in something they cannot tangibly sense,but rely upon it all the same.Not to say that there is nothing to be said for the applications of the reality we create to the spiritual relm or lack thereof,but to say that faith creates a truth and that the truth is adaptabe to each person who speaks what they think,or thier own personal definition of the truth.To say that the adaptability of the truth has no limits and that one could do whatever one wants as long as thier personal morals don't conflict would be insane,from the general point of view of society.Law is there to maintain order,and the law defines the truth so that a person will have to obey the wishes of the general populus.<br>
The purpose of law in general relation to the desires or wishes of the general populus is best defined by the &quot;3,000 tyrants one mile away&quot; statement in &quot;The Patriot&quot;.One mans rights can be toppled just as easily by a free nation with some limits as in a limited nation with some freedom.Just as a man designs his own truths,belifs,and reality, society designs the limitations to constrict them with what truths,beliefs and reality is acceptable.No,i am not saying that society is wrong ,i am saying that because we define our reality,we must rely upon the borders of society to prevent the chaos that would result if no man had borders and each individual differed in opinion dramatically from the next.Society's borders keep or realities in some semblance of order,and thus must be upheld.<br>
 Now,back to my first statement,that Fact is a Fantasy.Facts rely upon a general agreement that something is the truth,and we cannot obtain this in our current society.<br>
I await the reply of a differing or similar viewpoint and will return Monday to see this view.<br>
