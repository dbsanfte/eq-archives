Just sit right back and hear a tale<br>
A tale of a fateful trip<br>
That started from the Butcherblock<br>
To catch a larger ship<br>
<br>
To Kunark, I was bound you see<br>
My Guild was fighting there<br>
A challenge they did send to me<br>
&quot;Come over if you dare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come over if you dare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;thunder and lightning&gt;<br>
<br>
The weather started getting rough<br>
transfering to the boat.<br>
My footing's not secure enough.<br>
Splash!  I'm now afloat.<br>
<br>
I started swimming aimlessly<br>
As the boat faded from view.<br>
To my Guild I called &quot;Please help me!&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know what to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fromunder said &quot;Go to this Loc.<br>
The boat comes to the pier.&quot;<br>
It comes back 'round to Kunark<br>
and you can join us here.&quot;<br>
<br>
I swam to the Loc he gave.<br>
It was a charted isle.<br>
An outpost there.<br>
I was safe, Whew!<br>
the boat comes now<br>
into view..<br>
Without a sound<br>
I'm Ku-nark bound.<br>
Leaving Gilraen's Isle!!!!  &lt;voice cracks&gt; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugillraen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gillraen</A> at: 10/12/01 1:46:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ugillraen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gillraen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(10/17/01 1:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fthecounciloftwilightfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Twilight Recruiters</span><hr size=1> The Twilight Recruiters<br>

She'll de-buff the mob and then hasten you.<br>

With Lora there, it's an easier fight.<br>
When we're overwhelmed, and about to be crushed,<br>
We never worry, cuz she takes care of us.<br>

Well I'm not a chanter so I can't understand.<br>
How she does what she does when she gives us a hand.<br>

She charms mobs away.  <br>
It's never a chore.<br>
She's ready to slay.  <br>

There were plants and wolves and wisps and things,<br>
There were skellies by the druid rings.<br>
The first thing I met was a wasp with a buzz<br>
And bats in the skies above.<br>

After two days in West Karana sun, my skin was slashed and it bled.<br>
After three days in East Karana fun, I was hunting by the river bed.<br>
And the story it told, of a cyclops so bold,<br>
Made me sad to think I was dead.<br>

There were crocs and orcs and asps and things,<br>
There were sand giants chasing me.<br>
Oasis by the desert with it's life all around,<br>
And attacks from the mobs abound.<br>
Far from the cities, lies my bod on the ground;<br>
For desert madmen prowl there, I have found.<br>

How do you think she does it?  I don't know<br>
what makes her so good.<br>

Got plenty of distractions, she giggles all the time.<br>
Takes no sass from meat shields, her comebacks are sublime.<br>
Doesn't get the agro, yet her performance shines.<br>
That high elf Cashew Nutty; makes grouping such a good time!<br>

I thought I was the damage output queen,<br>
but I just handed my Nightshade Wreath to her.<br>

Even in my favorite dungeon, she can beat my best.<br>
