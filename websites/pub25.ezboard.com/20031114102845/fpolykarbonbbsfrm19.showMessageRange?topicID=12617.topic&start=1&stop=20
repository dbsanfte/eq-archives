<br>
so here goes: <br>
<br>
I believe that all art is valid. but what is art? well, everything is art, if it has been drawn/painted/sculped/created/designed with feeling, and with the deliberate intention of causing an emotional response. wether the response is 'good' or 'bad' matters little, as long as the response is there. any topic is as valid as any other, and likewise, any medium is just as valid as any other. all works of art are equally important, nomatter who creates them, and nomatter what motivation the artist actually has to create them. all art is valid.<br>
<br>
 <p>remember: it's nice to be important - but it's more important to be nice<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>all works of art are equally important, nomatter who creates them, and nomatter what motivation the artist actually has to create them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
No, they are not. Some art is better than other art, and some art is more important than other art. Different mediums may all be valid, but there are varying degrees of quality between each piece of art. A young child's stick figures on lined paper is not on par with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel paintings, for example. It may be valid, hell, it may even have some meaning, but it is NOT as good, and it is certainly not as important as something that has actually survived hundreds of years and which has influenced other artists for just as long.<br>
<br>
I agree that in some cases, art is put down unfairly, and is judged solely on the medium, instead of the work itself, but to claim that ALL art is equally as good and equally as important is ridiculous. <p><html>

Saying all art is valid is hard to refute. At some point, to some person, so long as someone considers it art (even the creator), it is valid. However, that all works are equally important seems wonky.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
How are you measuring a work's importance? How it affects lives, inspires, or that it just exists? According to your and Mr. Hubbard's definition, an atomic explosion is a work of art. The technical expertise needed to create the explosion is immense. No one can deny that an emotional response accompanies viewing the frightful image of a mushroom cloud. Did Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer consider himself an artist? Probably not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=souridaijin@polykarbonbbs>Souridaijin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/7/03 6:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12617.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a debate on art and validity</span><hr size=1> Ah...the eternal debate on the definition of art. Here's my two cents. Think about this for a sec. To me it seems like humans are the only living creatures that create &quot;art&quot; conciously. Dogs, cats, birds, and ants, etc, etc, do not (at least not to my knowledge). It also seems obvious to me that although animals do have feelings, human emotions are much more sophisticated. These two observations do not connect directly into each other, but my point is this: I think animals can't make art because they don't have enough emotions in themselves to be inpired to make art. I think emotion and the artist's desire to express it in some way (ie: art) is a huge part of the definition of art. To me, the more emotion that goes into the art, the more meaning it has, and the more emotions it provokes the more important it is. What do you think about my theory?<br>

<br>
anyway, he has this to say about art. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In any case it is perfectly clear that the goal for all art - unless of course it is aimed at the &quot;consumer&quot;, like a saleable commodity - is to explain to the artist himself and those around him what man lives for, what is the meaning of his existence. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is perhaps not a vastly different definition of art than what a lot of people discuss. But Tarkovsky then takes a very different tack by tying art directly to spirituality. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Art is born and takes hold wherever there is a timeless and insatiable longing for the spiritual, for the ideal: that longing which draws people to art. Modern art has taken a wrong turn in abandoning the search for the meaning of existence in order to affirm the value of the individual for its own sake. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And then...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The artist is always a servant, and is perpetually trying to pay for the gift that has been given to him as if by a miracle. Modern man, however, does not want to make any sacrifice, even though true affirmation of self can only be expressed in sacrifice.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
i'm sure there are plenty of people on this board and in the world who disagree with this perspective on art. but i found that it is very well-developed (in other words, the concept goes further and holds together much better than most i've read) and rather unique. so, when this topic popped up i figured &quot;why not share?&quot;<br>
<br>
i agree with pretty much everything Tarkovsky says, not because i threw my mind out the window and said &quot;oh, this looks like a good thing&quot; but because i believe he had great insight into the creative process and how and why it works (or doesn't.) it's all well and good to say that all art is valid but i really don't think that's true. if a piece of work doesn't produce some emotion in every person that sees it, then it's failed in its purpose to communicate. (i know this is a point many will disagree with but it's my personal opinion.) not everyone has to feel exactly the same thing when they look at a painting but if people (even if they are only a few) feel nothing, then something about the work is lacking. <br>
<br>
anyway, just my two cents. <br>
<br>
again, i highly recommend Tarkovsky's book, just as a different perspective on art and creativity. and the above statements are my opinion. i will defend them to the last but you don't have to swallow anything i say if you don't feel like it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Very true, but what does that have to do with what I said? I said Michelangelo's work is more meaningful than a child's doodle, it has nothing to do with majority opinion or the medium in which they worked. His work is more meaningful, MUCH more meaningful. The child just plops down a stick figure with no thought to composition, form, or anatomy, and they certainly didn't have any deep intellectual meaning to their work, whereas Michelangelo's work is completely opposite. That I have to point this out at all is baffling to me.<br>
<br>
I don't live in a pretend world where everything is equal, because it's not. All art may be VALID, but it is most certainly not all equal.<br>

How could you possibly feel nothing? A blank wall elicits some kind of response out of people, a painting or other work of art is going to cause some kind of reaction, however small it may be. And if someone were able to actually produce a piece of art that could truly make you feel nothing, then they certainly would have achieved something. <p><html>

a child, realistically, for the most part, does not have the same level of emotional maturity as an adult. a child, realistically, for the most part, does not have the same understanding of anatomy or composition that a trained artist has. if you look at it from the point of view that a picture has to be realistic to be good, then a child's work is poor. however, they are no less valid an an artist.<br>
<br>
all films are art. the seven samurai is art. american pie is art. they are two completely different films, yet they are both art, and therefore both valid forms of expression. <br>
<br>
all paintings are art. van gogh's self portaits are art. picasso's portraits are art. neither are 100% realistic, yet both are art. <br>
<br>
while i do not think of the works of tracey emin or damien hurst to be of very high quality, they are all art, and therefore valid.<br>

<br>
actually, American Pie is entertainment, not art. or it's art in the same way that some comic strips are art. it's main purpose and function is not to be &quot;art&quot; but to entertain the masses. this is one reason why discussing films as art is difficult. they are generally geared more towards entertainment than anything else, at least in the U.S. <br>
<br>
Kurosawa didn't make films just to entertain people. he had a distinct creative vision behind every film and a very specific purpose in how he used the camera and film to achieve that vision. Dodes Kadan was his first color film. it flopped horribly and is still probably one of the the most depressing films you could ever watch. but the way he used color in the film borders on genuis. it's visually overwhelming and in complete contrast to the subject of the film. <br>
<br>
Alucard: as far as looking at something and feeling nothing, maybe i'm just weird but that's happened to me before. when i look at a blank wall i don't feel any emotional stirring other than boredom. and i've looked at paintings before and felt much the same. they didn't make me angry, confused, happy or sad, they simply left me feeling exactly the way i had when i walked into the gallery. <br>
<br>
now maybe i'm a freak and staring at a blue wall should make me feel different than staring at a white wall. but it doesn't. and it doesn't matter because no one said 'this blue wall is my artistic expression of the apathy of society in general.' it's just a blue wall. and if it were a giant canvas and someone had declared that it was a representation of the world's apathy? probably still wouldn't feel anything. i think a part of good art (whether it be abstract or more classical) is a certain level of complexity. the longer you look at something the more you should be able to see. <br>
<br>
so, that's my opinion unfolded a little. i used the wall (or giant canvas) as an arbitrary example. i've never seen a piece of artwork like that (although i'm sure there probably is one somewhere) and i'm not saying that it couldn't be done in such a way as to produce a response. just that this is the kind of thing that rarely stirs up any kind of emotion in me when i look at it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
of course, the american pie films aren't as good as kurosawa's work. not by a long way. a long, long way. the films kurosawa produced in the soviet union are better than the american pie films. but neither are more legitimate or less ligitimate artforms in their own right. <br>
<br>
something that does differentiate all works of art from each other is historical significance. to return to the american pie/kurosawa example, kurosawa's films are important as cultural and technical landmarks. the cinematography, use of texture and light, and later on, colour - as you rightly say e.p. - all play their part in creating masterpeices of cinema. american pie, on the other hand, is not a masterpeice by any lenght of the imagination. the seven samurai was remade as the magnificent seven, which spawned several sequels, and it's own remake, battle beyond the stars. the original is the best, but the first remake is probably just as important. without starting a new debate, and hopefully without half the planet flaming me, star wars is rubbish. there, i said it. the first one wasn't much cop, the next two were better, the fourth was cronic and i cannot judge the fifth, never having seen it. the plot is stolen from kurosawa, most of the stuff is just oriental rip offs (look at darth vader's helmet, then look at a samuri helmet) and the acting was sporadic. however, it is important historically, amongst other things for being a massive success.<br>
<br>
thank you. and may i remind you this thread is a debate on art, not the merits of star wars...<br>

Careful. But I agree with your distinction on entertainment vs. art, emmapeele. We often doodle because we're bored. Is it art? Are we artists? Or do we seek just to entertain ourselves. I'd say the latter.<br>
<br>
Let's give art its due. True art is an attempt by the artist to communicate emotion or perhaps concept. Or perhaps that's just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> art. It puts its own creation first.<br>

You're making some very odd assumptions about what I'm saying. I never said something has to be realistic to be good, I only brought up those issues in this case because I was comparing similar subjects. And how many times do I have to say that while all art may be VALID, it isn't EQUAL. It's not as good, it's not as significant.<br>

Actually, different colors do affect you in different ways. I'm not saying that seeing a red wall is going to make you furious and a blue wall is going to make you depressed, but they do affect you in subtle, unconscious ways.<br>
<br>
What's bothering me is that nearly everyone here defines art as something that causes some type of emotional response. Why is this required for an artwork? Certainly, many great works make use of emotion, and it's an important part of art, but just because something doesn't arouse any strong emotions doesn't mean it's bad. <p><html>

From this statement it seems that you are basing this on superficial qualities alone. The difference here is that GOOD modern art is done by people that know what they're doing, and is done for particular reasons. While it may look arbitrary, there is reason behind it. By the way, I do not like most Modern Art myself, but I do have more respect for it than you seem to hold.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the opinions that everyone has expressed here are their own, and everyone's opinions are valid.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is quite untrue. I was going to mention it earlier, but I didn't want to assume that anyone actually held this belief. Now that it has been stated, I have no problem disagreeing. Everyone's PREFERENCE is valid. If you said you like chocolate better than vanilla, I can't argue with that, because it's personal preference. But when you start using the word to say that things ARE a certain way, and they are based on faulty evidence or backing, then that opinion is not as valid as one that is based on truth.<br>
<br>
You must have excellent hearing to know if I am yelling or not, as I have found it very difficult to convey volume through text. If you're talking about my words in all caps, I do that for emphasis. I don't mean them as shouts. And I am debating in a civilized manner. I am not, for example, making a post for the sole purpose of criticizing someone without even responding to the actual discussion at hand. If you disagree with what I say, then by all means, share. But I don't appreciate you telling me to calm down and to be civilized when I am not angry, and I have not insulted anyone. <p><html>

<br>
i have very strong opinions about a lot of things, art being one of them. so does alucard, but although both of us have voiced strong opinions in reference to each others posts as well as those of other members, i don't think we've used language that would imply that we are angry. <br>
<br>
alucard: you made an interesting comment about why every one seems to think that art has to have an emotional impact. well, it may just be a question of semantics but i think the argument follows something like this. <br>
a: art is an act of creativity. <br>
b: creativity is a form of expression<br>
c: expression is communication<br>
therefore: lack of communication (in this case usually emotional since we aren't necessarily using words) means lack of expression, means lack of creativity = not art. <br>
<br>
that's kind of condensed, but that's my take on it. of course, some art forms are more complex and do use words (like novels or films) and are capable of communicating more than raw emotion. but really if you look back at a really good film, say Memento, which posits a very interesting commentary on how what we perceive or what we want to perceive shapes our reality, what you remember is usually the gut reaction you had to the whole. yes, the idea may have been communicated well and clearly, but what brought it home was the emotional reaction you had to it. (or at least this is what i usually remember.) <br>
<br>
perhaps i should point out here that i don't believe that all art is equally valid. this is why i consider American Pie entertainment and not art. this is why i think that a crucifix suspended in a jar of urine is not art. <br>
<br>
if you ask me how i make the differentiation, well, i'm not entirely sure myself. it doesn't have anything to do with quality. i simply believe that some art is more valid. <br>

I didn't mean to disagree with you entirely, and I think this sentence sums up more of what I was thinking. I do think emotion is a part of art, I just don't think it's THE thing which makes or breaks the work. There is some work that can be admired for its technical proficiency, and emotion may be secondary. I think they should be judged differently, but I believe they are both art. Now, if a work is skillful and they FAILED at conveying the emotional response it was going for, it may not be great art, but it is still art.<br>
<br>
I like the idea here that creativity is what defines art more than I do emotion. Again, I believe that emotion is an important part of art, and makes a piece all the more meaningful, I just think that a work can still be admired for some aspects when it is lacking in others. <p><html>

Bear with me for a sec. <br>
-If a tree falls in a forest with nobody around, does it make a sound? (In all actuality, no)<br>
-Even if you have a lot of currency, if no one wants it, is it worth anything? (Nope)<br>
-If you make something you intended to be art, and if NO ONE besides yourself actually thinks its art, is it really art? (In my humble opinion, no)<br>
<br>
Therefore, I think the old philosiphy &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; can be, to an extent, can be used to lead to the conclusion that, frankly, this whole &quot;Validity of art&quot; argument can be answered by; the more people think and accept something as art, the validity of it increases. In retrospect, isn't this pretty obvious? How many people actually think that a child's stick figure is more artistic than Michelangelo's work? No one. The simple fact that the overwhelming majority of people see Mike's work as having more artistic worth in itself increases its validity.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=souridaijin@polykarbonbbs>Souridaijin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(8/8/03 9:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12617.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.saiyanultimate.com/android186.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a debate on art and validity...</span><hr size=1> P.S.
