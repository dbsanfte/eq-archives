<br>
I am currently working on a Little Red Riding Hood style illustration, and I need some feedback to recalibrate my vision. Seems like I am too involved with this to be as objective as I need to be, so if anyone is interested in giving this pic a serious critique, I'd be quite grateful and would return the favor...<br>
<br>
About the work: Still in progress. The wolf and mask are not complete yet, so don't discuss these yet except to call out observations on color. Red is partially shaded (note Patrick's displacement trick on the bodice- bonus points for solid technique!) I feel like ditching the whole red velvet deal I have now and re-working it. Deosn't seem to work anymore, does it?<br>
<br>
What I need to consider at this point is-<br>
<br>
*The background: Does it work? I'm flirting with the idea of including rays of sunlight (featured here) Does this work? What do you think of the background pallete? I orriginally went with a warmer pallete, but it didn't seem to be working out. What are your thoughts on this? I am not committed to this background, if you have a better suggestion I will hear your opinion...<br>
<br>
*Lighting: The major light source is obviously coming from outisde and above (around three o'clock on the Y axis and four at the Z) but I also want to include some rim lighting (what Patrick calls reflex lighting if you read his tutorials) from the left. My original notion was to have a warm white from the right and a soft red from the right. I am concerned that this might make the overall compisistion too warm. Keep in mind the background is cool and a warm rimlight can really pop out the foreground elements.<br>
<br>
*Shading: Keep in mind the above lighting convention- this will necisitate a core shadow for both figures, but just how dark do I allow this pic to get? I want a moody feeling, but I want to show off as much detail as I can... Think chirascouro.<br>
<br>
*Composition: Obvoiusly at this point I am reluctant to go back to the drawing board, but there are many value considerations that can cause this work to soar or flop. Share your thoughts with me on my declared solution... <br>
<br>
My current plan is to address this in my normal modus operandi, so take a peek at some of my compeleted works to get an notion of what I am aiming for...<br>
<br>
<a href=http://www.darkemagic.com/alx/gallery/ray/ray.html>samples</a><br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your time and consideration in this matter. Anyone who will give this work a serious critique will be repaid in kind either on or off forum.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

as for the rest of it, little red riding isn't quite so...little. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but that's a NOT problem, just an obersavation. as for PROBLEMS, my biggest peeve is her hood: it's look kind of wierd not attached to anything...i feel like their should be a cape or something for the hood to sprout off of. also, i know you don't really want things that would send you back to the drawing board, but the hood material on her shoulder seems to be resting on something much more solid and rugged than her shirt and/or shoulder. i would suggest just smoothing it over so there weren't so many peaks a valleys.<br>
<br>
i, personally, like the rays of sunlight. my only sugestion would be to ad on the you can see coming through the canopy, rather that jsut from the top of the image. i think it might give it a more 3-d feel.<br>
<br>
all in all, very impressive. keep it up!<br>

How it got this far without being caught I have no idea, but at least it was caught before completion!!! Aphothis LeDante has a nice ring to it...<br>
<br>
About the basket- I always intended to put line on top of it for the sake of integration. And why not, I have to replace the arm anyway! Will I ever get over the shock?<br>
<br>
The bottle will be more transparent and allow background elements to show through (just like glass does) but not just yet. I was going to do that this weekend, but it's back to the drawing board for me. Obviously, I need to start posting my line art up here before I color it...<br>

I'd really be interested in what type of program you used to color it also how you did all those 3d pictures on your samples page you provided.<br>
<br>
Well I'm assuming that you've decided to change a few things so I'd like to make my input on a few things to consider. The background seems flat, like a stage background. I think it's because of that black thing under the top leftmost ray of sunlight. It sorta gives it a fake feeling.<br>
<br>
Little Read Ridding hood's chest looks to large for her to be so young. Afterall, how many girls under 16 have a bust size like that?<br>
<br>
Also I think this picture screams for a more sadistic dark mood to it, I'd make the wolf's fur darker to increase his sinister mood you displayed so well. <br>
<br>
I agree with squattingturnip about the hood ordeal. She feels too uncovered.<br>
<br>
I'd love for you to post more of your art it really is on a near professional level. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uledante.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ledante</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pre-Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(12/11/01 5:57:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://darkemagic.com/alx/hb/alx.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...and another thing</span><hr size=1> Let me try to clear everything else up here...<br>
<br>
Her breasts are not too high for a girl wearing a bodice. Unfettered, they'd be healthy B cups.<br>
<br>
She isn't wearing a cloak, she is wearing a hood. Cloaks will not be invented for a few hundred years after this pic. At this time, it is hood and cape. I omitted the cape to show off the arch of her back. <br>
<br>
Having said that, the shoulder of her hood is harsh and I don't like the color either. The whole bit needs to be redone, and I want to add more shading to her chemise (blouse for those of you who didn't do ren faire)<br>
<br>
Lastly, I had the piss taken out of me by a comrade for giving you such a low res shot. Here is an actual size sample<br>
<br>

<br>
IMHO, there is nothing worse than having someone look at your pic and exclaim &quot;I just used that filter the other day...&quot; or somesuch.<br>
<br>
For the backgrounds, I use Bryce (My First Raytracer) with the exception of Mr. Punch, who was done with Raydream, and the mascot who was done exclusively with 3DSmax. For Togoku, the background was done in Bryce but all the armor was done with 3DSmax.<br>
<br>
If you want to know more, just ask.<br>

Keep your eye on this one, I fully intend to use this as a portfolio piece, so I need all the input I can get...<br>
