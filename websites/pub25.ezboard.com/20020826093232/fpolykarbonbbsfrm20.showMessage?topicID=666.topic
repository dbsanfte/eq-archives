I'll admit that I'm not sure if I can keep this up alone with the fevered pitch that should go into it but I had this idea and thought 'what the heck, at least I can say tried' so... here it is...<br><br>I'm a Role-Player. D&amp;D, Rifts, console games ( like FF, Phantasy Star, even the weird freaky ones like Fatal Frame and Resident Evil ), and online MUCKs and MUDs.<br><br>Fight Club is a place where people challenge, yeah, but it states that it's also a place where people can go to challenge themselves with things they wouldn't normally draw on their own and to allow people to practic their layout techniques.<br><br>Down to the nitty gritty...<br><br>I propose a PK-FC RPG. What it'll be is a story of a group of travellers. the travellers will be whomever joins in. Initially I think it would be easier for me and others involved if it were a small group but if people keep up or people fall out, more may be added or replacements may be brought in.<br><br>What'll happen is almost exactly like what would happen in a RP campaign. I plan out a campaign and instead of the group of us RPing through stats and dice the people involved draw what they do.<br><br>The group chosen will obviously need to keep in contact and plan <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WITH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> eachother on what they want to do before the designated artist draws it. It'll be good practice for most because they won't quite be drawing on a whim, there'll be something of a script to work from depending on what everyone agrees to.<br><br>It'll be a techno-fantasy setting since that seems to be quite popular. Think FF6 or FF3ish. If/when the group is chosen, I'll draw up a few of the first pages and everyone else can go from there and once they have those pages done ( either one person can draw up however many pages are decided on or they can all split pages ) I'll jump in with the results of their decisions. Sorta like a:<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  DM : Okay, you're walking along on a forest road and are met with a group of bandits, what do you do?<br><br>GROUP: KICK @$$!!<br><br>DM : Okay... Bandit @$$ is kicked and as it is, not only do you get their gold and weapons, but you get the trolls that were chasing them.. since the bandits stole from them earlier. Now what?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br><br>kinda thing. :P <br><br>So... any takers? It'll be interesting! Maybe even fun! I'm sure it'll be an interesting campaign if nothing else.  If people join then can't communicate with the group or get up pages because they're busy, the character will be removed temporarily and replaced with someone else that wants in. Down the road they can join in again when they've got more free time.<br><br>Aim: f0ine kawaiian<br><br>Use that if you want/need to get in contact with me for more info about this or post and I'll try to reply as best I can.<br><br>Hell... I might even throw in a character. I'll have her pic up in a bit. By tomorrow morning at the latest. <p><center>=-=That which does not kill you... obviously wasn't trying hard enough=-=</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/uahpathy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ahpathy</A> at: 7/12/02 7:59:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ukaenlogos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KaenLogos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/27/02 11:29:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://genflux3.freewebspace.com/avatar_mm05.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A twist on Role-Playing</span><hr size=1> very well thought out and planned i might be interested if we can get this thing rolling and i get enough free time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufithy1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fithy1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/28/02 1:53:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fithsilar.freeservers.com/captboava.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A twist on Role-Playing</span><hr size=1>   Hey Ahp, you have supported me on both of my trips down obscurity road, so its only natural that i support you on this AWSOME idea.

There are steam engines so a mecha IS possible but it'd need to be massive to house the water tanks and boiler that it'd need to run it. A steam engine and dirigibles could work as well. No gunpowder though. I'd rather keep this a swords and sorcery thing and, like bushido, guns and gunpowder would more then likely get rid of the mysterious and romantic aspect. A HEAVY fantasy with a hint of tech. <br><br>Mana powered things are possible but mana's a rare and limited resource so even if you create something that shoots mana like lasers ( and you can ) you'd be limited in shots ike an ammo clip and it would act more like a spell-shooter for warriors. :P<br><br>I'm not sure how to add a sn with JUST the name.

This is Rival Einhorn<br>  He came from my rifts, he was used by mixing some rules from phase world and the coalition war campaign, and a lil psi-scape.  Hes a class we rolled up called a rune mage.  He is infused with an inate &quot;spark&quot;, the spark has no powers by itself.  However with the use of magical writings the spark can be channeled into many things.  <br>  <br> Example : the runes he has tatooed on his body are runes of shielding, projection, force manipulation, and conjuration.<br><br>  He keeps these runes on him at all times (tatoo) so he can, project his energy as a weapon, conjur small things using his energy.  Generate a shield, and levitate.  <br><br>  HE carries a LARGE amount of scrolls with him and is constantly studying new runes.<br><br>   *notes*  He cant do alter anything without a rune being on it.  So while he can shoot you with a blast, he cant make you just go up in flames unless he has a rune of engulfing on you some place.<br>   He carries little sticky tabs with runes predrawn on them in case hes in a jam.<br>    The &quot;spark&quot; reflects the personality of the person who has it.  His energy comes out cold and cruel, cause hes that kind of person.  If he had an alignment it would be chaotic/neutral. <br><br>   The are other rune mages out there, and they LOVE to compete to the death....its tradition.  Rune mages also fight VERY well but arent adept with weapons....they dont need em.<br>  <br>  Age: Unknown ( the spark could be effecting his aging)<br>  Height : 6,0<br>  Weight: 180<br>  <br>  Any other info needed i can post.

The Burning Wave hatched a fantasy FC a while back, and i revived a character from my fantasy universe to enter that FC. i guess i'll bring him back to get into this story. i'll redesign his outfit and look, and add his little familiar/sidekick.<br><br>AIM: v1z10n<br><br>here's the original character profile for him: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.liquid2k.com/optica/images/neydor.jpg">www.liquid2k.com/optica/images/neydor.jpg</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br>his name's neydor, and he's something of a mage/fighter dual-class kind of character. he started as a squire, and moved into knight status after completing several quests with his original team. his only love, a thief he adventured with for years, died on their last escapade together, and after that point, he cast everthing away: loyalties, power, status, and future. after his downward spiral, he attempted to connect with his past by choosing a path completely opposite the path he once knew: he became a mage. rekindling his magical talent, he took to solo adventuring and more or less smashing anything evil on his quest for the ultimate spell: Wish.<br><br>in technical terms, he's a rogue mage/fighter. he didn't learn the magical arts in any conventional way, he would somehow acquire his spells and powers through un-wizardly ways. he's a shoot-and-ask-questions-later when it comes to battle, generally looking for tactical advantages he learned as a warrior. his magical prowess boosts his fighting capabilities and makes him a troublesome opponent in mage-duels. his primary weapon is his rune sword, a finely crafted dwarven blade imbued with many abilities. the sword super-charge his spells and can do a variety of things from flight, energy discharge, and absorption. without the sword, he can cast spells, but not with a large enough range and level as with the sword. <p><b>"Without a <a href="http://www.liquid2k.com/optica">Vision</a>, the people will perish..."</b><br>Go<a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/bsquid">Forum</a>, Go!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ufithy1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fithy1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/29/02 9:14:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fithsilar.freeservers.com/captboava.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A twist on Role-Playing</span><hr size=1>    WAHOOOO, V1s10n im even happier about this FC now. <p>On a long enough timeline,the survival rate for everyone drops to zero<p><p align=center><a href="http://fithsilar.freeservers.com"><img src="http://fithsilar.freeservers.com/pictures/cokngif.gif" border=0></a>  <b>CLICK IT OR MISS IT</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#aaaaaa><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/ucentasias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>centasias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(6/29/02 2:14:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/fringooboi/crane.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A twist on Role-Playing</span><hr size=1> im gonna exit this fight alright?
