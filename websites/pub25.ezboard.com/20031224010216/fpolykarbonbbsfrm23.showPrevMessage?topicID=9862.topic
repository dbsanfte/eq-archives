The one I do have in there though, is sposed to be perched up on a rock about to sink an arrow through the oncoming zombie's head (or neck, or whatever <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   hehe)..  <br>

Anyway, im just looking to see what you guys think on the proportions so far mostly (obviously it's still a little early :P ).. I only need advice on the female elf for now.. I know that zombie has a few issues (like his left hand lol) .. I just have him there now as a place holder so I can work on him more later. <br>

That elf is looking great! The main problem I can see is her right arm, the one drawing the bow. My suggestion would be to have her hair draping behind the arm, rather than over it. It also seems her elbow takes up too much length, which makes the forearm seem out of place. Her left arm is a bit too long (even though it's very well done), so you should either consider shortening it (a crying shame) or lengthen the left arm. It would also help if you had her left hand drawn back to the corner of her mouth (known in archery as the draw point). For the hand, I would recommend using google to search up archery pictures. Or, if you can, find some other refrence material. Have you ever shot off a bow? It's awkward to do, but if you look at your hands while drawing back, you'll see your index, middle, and ring fingers pull the string back either on the first joint or the finger tips, the index finger being above the arrow. (Sorry if that was confusing, like I said, it might be best to find some refrence material to see how it looks. I can't make it make sense in text) I also noticed that her head is turned very sharply... It's possible to be in that pose, but it would be more likely that her torso would be raised a bit more on her right side, but it's not a must that you change it. It'll work just fine (mostly because she is about to shoot off a bow. I've seen some people put themselves into very stiff and odd positions in order to shoot more comfortably). <br>
Other than that, I can't really see anything in need of too much work.<br>
And I know you said you only wanted help on the elf, but on the zombie, his left hand appears to be another right hand... Just something for you to check on before you start REALLY working on him.<br>
<br>
Post again when you get some more done on it, ne?<br>
^_^ And welcome to the board. <p>~~~~Nyu!~~~~<br>

I see what you mean about the elbow on her right arm.. I'll try and shorten it some.  <br>
<br>
About the left arm being too long.. I was actually starting to think the opposite and that the right arm might be too short lol. Not sure 0.o  .. I'm afraid if I shortened her left arm I might ruin it somehow cuz I'd have to do the bow and that area over.  <br>
You think it'd still look ok if I just lengthened the right arm a little instead??<br>

I have a bow and have fired it before (long long ago heh).. But I guess I never really paid attention to how I was shooting it.. It shouldn't be too hard to change though. (especially if im resizing that arm anyway. )<br>

I hope I can reach that level someday. I'm not good enough to tell you all that could be wrong on the drawing, but on my point of view, you're great.<br>
<br>
But, not only sucking up here, I want to bring a fact that I notice. Of what I notice for the picture I saw of an archer, mostly every archer place the arrow inside the bow instead of outside of it. I beleive there is two way to put the arrow on the bow, but because of the bow construction, they might a right way and a wront way to place an arrow... not that I really know the right or wrong way, but you might want to check references on wich kind of bow uses an inside arrow and what kind uses a outside arrow... or maybe you can always do both on any kind of bow... <br>
<br>
Mostly, what I saw, is a inside arrow, guided by the fingers, but there might be other possibilities out there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just a quick comment about it... check out archer picture to find the best way to place it. I don't think it does any problem with an outside arrow, but some wants maximum realism, so checking it out might answer some question, and giving you tips on drawing nice archers.<br>

<br>
trying to balance it on the thumb is madness plus you can't tilt the bow that far to the left since of the the elbow joint restriction<br>
<br>
awsome looking picture.. just a nitpick <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
her thumb on the left hand is in a unpleasant position. most of the pressure from the bow will be distributed on the tissue between thumb and index finger. Because of the thickness of the bow grip which is absolutely fine, the thumb cannot slope downwards like that (well it can but it's painfull and would make firing that bow pretty tedious <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). It would actually more or less like how you draw her index finger. same direction/hight but tilting slighty to the right. again because of the grip thickness.<br>
<br>
one more thing. this might just be your style since i saw the hands on that zombie but the other fingers gripping the bow are a bit too long so is her index finger. but then again that might just be your style<br>
<br>
