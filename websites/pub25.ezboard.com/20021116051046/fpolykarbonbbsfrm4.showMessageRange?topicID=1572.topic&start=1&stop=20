<br>
The only thing i hate about it is that alot of people here are so influanced by DBZ!!!!!!!  Every fight, in the fight club is bassicaly a DBZ battel with Energy blasts and its kinda innoying.  Seriously people have you not seen any other Manga/Anime movies/shows??  I recomend watching other thigs besides DBZ and widen your view on Manga.  DBZ is only a taste of manga, and honestly i think its for people New to the Manga/ anime World!!<br>

I don't know what a &quot;manga show&quot; is, but maybe you'd like to enlighten us.<br>
<br>
I know that seeing so many people influenced by a show you don't like might be &quot;innoying&quot;, but so is some whiny, arrogant anime snob complaining about people for liking something you don't. Why do you assume that people like DBZ only because they haven't seen anything else? I, for one, was a fan of anime for years before had I even heard of DBZ. Guess what? Different people have different tastes. That means some people might like a show, even though you might not! I know, I know, it's a CRAZY concept that other people might like something you hate so intensely, but it's a crazy world!<br>
<br>
In conclusion: stop complaining. People like what they like, and they're going to be influenced by things they like, whether you want to see it or not. And how come I don't see anyone going around complaining about people influenced by any other animation that they don't like. It's always DBZ. <p><table width=100% border=0>

<br>
I believe it was alucard who suggested that it was the style that I was disagreeing with, not the quality....I thought that was a possibility, although I haven't really decided (it's not that important to me).  <br>
Other's who have had more experience with the manga and anime, say that it's really awsome, but it's hard to translate a manga directly into an anime...hence why it seems to take so long.  Stuff like that, I took on faith, 'cause I hadn't read the manga, or seen the uncensored versions of the anime.  I couldn't think of a way that extra footage or what have you could have made it any better...but hey, they must have a reason for liking it, right?  <br>
<br>
Not everyone is going to have the same taste as everyone else.  If that were the case we'd only need one tv station for the planet.  (well, maybe one in each language<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  I absolutely can't stand some things that other's love, and I run into some people who don't like things I think are absolutely brilliant.

I used to when I was younger, before I was exposed to other anime besides DBZ and Akira and one or two episodes of Cashon, robot hunter. As I got more into Japanes anime and manga, DBZ just started to seem poorly drawn, sort of like the south park of japanese anime ^_^. Also, the stories seemed a bit simple, draw out and slightly ridiculous. I do get annoyed that its sometimes all people talk about but I don't think its right to complain about that because its all personal opinion. If you like DBZ, great, have fun watching it. if not, that's great too, theres a lot more to choose from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soulx5k>soulx5k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/22/02 10:03:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/soul5k/vics.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Manga And DB/z/gt</span><hr size=1> what i think Manga man James ment to say, is that dbz became so popular that now everyone uses the idea or the &quot;mean&quot; of the show. Everyone now uses power, and have transformations and, you mostly find that these transfrmations are actually from the anime it self. The characters are different and the persona too but they use dbz moves and style. I llike it my self and i know it got bad graphics and a weak story, even Akira Toriama seen it him self that after gt he actually paid his workers to redraw the entire series of dragonball. Manga man james  got a point though cuz im having difficulties my self, now that everyone uses power what happens to those that have a character that dont?Its not fair.But there is a solution to it, and it is  what im gonna do, im gonna post a messgae saying that im chalenging someone to a fight, but the person cant have any power or those incredable transformation making them super powerful  and superior. My manga is about some cops future organiszation , and the only weapons that it can use is  guns and basukas and stuff like that(emunition),and the only thing to protect from these athe body is a suit, an external metal suit, now i can't go chalenging people that have superpowerful bodies with super fast speeds and eye sight cuz its not fair for those that only have a metal on their bodies.But like im saying the only way to solve this prob is to find someone that fits into your catagory. And what its gonna suck is that im gonna have to be waiting mad long for a chalenger actually come.

Wha?<br>
<br>
He had very little to do with GT. I believe all Toriyama did on GT was some character designs, he had absolutely NOTHING to do with the writing and he most certainly didn't pay any of the animators to do anything.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't think it's that bad. There are many people here that don't even like DBZ, and even the ones that do aren't necessarily going to completely emulate it. Besides, they may have other characters that are not DBZ-ish. And you could always do what soul said and just ask for a certain type of fight. <p><table width=100% border=0>

The owner of the anime pays  workers to draw for him, the creator just makes the character designes , he hire workers to draw , he can't draw about 500 episodes by himself,and a 5 min animation takes about 2000 pictures counting the repeating pictures, cuz every movement takes 3 freames( the frames are repeated 3 times  &quot;average*&quot;). hes not gonna sit on a chair with a stack of 50000 sheets of blank paper and draw an  the entire episode.Here do this, here lets talk on aim if you have it my screen name is Soulx5k. So you actually believ what im saying  im gonna give you the website that talks about the anime field, takes a little time, but ull see that im not just making stuff up.<br>

I can't get on AIM right now, busy working on a speech for tomorrow and checking the board in between breaks. If you were talking to me about my character for fight club, I can't. I've already accepted one from someone else, and I don't want to spread myself out over two.

I think the Manga Man James guy meant that everyone seems to copy DBZ's fighting style in that everyone has powers and stuff. But I don't think that it has to do with DBZ really. I think it has more to do with the japanese culture and stuff. It's a little complicated to go into right now but I'm fine with DBZ. It's okay to hate it but just because someone likes it doesn't mean you should try to shove your opinion of how much it sucks into their face. If you want people to respect your opinion on how DBZ sucks, you should respect their opinions if they differ from yours. <br>
   Anyways, I don't know what the fighting is for. I just thought that people were being pretty rude when they didn't have to be. THere IS a way to present yoru ideas without offending, y'know.<br>
     Just my thoughts. <p><Center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22144><h4>Nildian Forestblade</a></h4></Center>

I used to watch it every opportunity I had. My first coloured picture on Photoshop was one a friend of mine did of a Super Saiya-Jin and the first picture I EVER drew in any way manga-style was a character I'd developed for a DBZ RPG with my friends after watching DBZ. OK, so I've kinda moved on. So what? There's hardly any manga/anime over here in England anyway. But people are always badmouthing DBZ. It's one of the first anime almost anyone you ask in Britain who started recently would have seen, because apart from Pokemon and the occasional Gundam Wing or Sailor Moon, it's the only anime that shows over here at a decent time. Sci-Fi on Sky only shows anime at midnight on a Saturday, and I'm never awake for that and I don't have Sky. DBZ is a great anime, and more power to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub25.ezboard.com/useikenmaru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seikenmaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karbonite</span><br> <font color=#336699>(4/24/02 6:24:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.xs4all.nl/~seifer/PkVegeta.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: DBZ</span><hr size=1> Why is everybody sticking up for james when he's flaming DBZ? he's saying it sucks and people who like it are newbies. that's basicly it. <p><b>I am, Sesshoumaru: <br>"Names are not important, because you're already dead."</b></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1572.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1572.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1572.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1572.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1572.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub25.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="polykarbonbbsfrm18">PK-BBS Rules and Regulations!<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm27">Board F.A.Q.s<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm3">News and Updates<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm2">Photoshop and Art questions<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm4">General Manga/Anime Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm5">Japanese Language Help<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm23">art in progress<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm13">Black and White Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm14">Color Art<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm19">Member's Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm17">Moderators Lounge<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm6">Member Photos<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm31">Help, Hints and Cheats<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm20">Challenges<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm21">Matches<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm26">Writer's Forum<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm32">VG Discussion<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm33">PolyKarbon CCG<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm35">Member Created Tutorials<option value="polykarbonbbsfrm36">Best Tutorials</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#336699>- </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs>Polykarbon BBS</a><font color=#336699> - </font><a href=http://pub25.ezboard.com/fpolykarbonbbsfrm4>General Manga/Anime Discussion</a> <font color=#336699> - </font><a href="http://www.polykarbon.com">Polykarbon: Manga & Photoshop</a><font color=#336699> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM ARTS AD SCRIPT -->
